 Two or three Posies With two or three simples--- to O what can ail thee Knight at arms Alone and palely loitering? But true it is that, in reading Keats's letters with a fresh eye, one never knows whether the next precious stone one comes to, embedded in one of his racy, lively, inimitably good-tempered and well-conditioned prose pages, will be of the one mood or the other.' Colvin in a more succinct passage in the preface to his collection, written in May 1891, would apparently claim even greater merit for the letters when he says that 'if a selection could be made from those parts only of Keats's correspondence which show him at his best, we should have an anthology full of intuitions of beauty, even of wisdom, and breathing the very spirit of generous youth; one unrivalled for zest, whim, fancy, and amiability, and written in an English which by its peculiar, alert and varied movement sometimes recalls, perhaps more closely than that of any other writer (for the young Cockney has Shakspeare in his blood), the prose passages of "Hamlet" and "Much Ado about Nothing".' And in the preparation of such an anthology I venture to think that Sir Sidney would have been strongly tempted to go back on his expressed opinion of the love-letters and delve among them too for its enrichment. Possibly there is more behind Colvin's attitude towards the letters to Fanny Brawne than simple criticism or innate delicacy, but in the case of certain other distinguished men of letters, no reason is apparent save personal conviction. And that is difficult to understand. Matthew Arnold, who admits the signs of disease and the seeds of consumption, can overlook those ever- present harassments when he writes of the love-letters, naively professing not to judge the letters written when he 'was near his end, under the throttling and unmanning grasp of mortal disease'. Surely, he had forgotten Keats's medical knowledge and insight, had forgotten that 'haunting sore throat', and had not realized the possibility of what some of us to-day believe, that practically the whole of Keats's poetic life was passed under the shadow of death. May he not be forgiven for this on account of the true things he said of Keats? The oft- quoted 'He is; he is with Shakespeare' will be remembered long after his harsh judgement of the Fanny Brawne letters is forgotten. If the opinion of Arnold is perplexing, what is to be said of the deductions of Coventry Patmore after reading the letters for the first time in 1888? He who believed himself to be, and doubtless was, 'the sweetest-tempered and least savage of men', could 'find nothing in these letters that 'deserves a much better name than "lust"', and grudgingly he allows that 'with a man of splendid imagination like Keats the feeling would not express itself in vulgar forms, but would assume the singing robes of love, as far as that is possible in the absence of the true passion.' 'But that possibility', he adds, 'even for such a man as Keats, is very limited, and I fancy I detect artifice and cold self-consciousness in his most rhapsodical out-pourings.' A friend who has afforded me generous help while this book was passing through the press, urged me to hit out: he holds with me that Patmore was entirely wrong, and, again with me, he holds in high esteem the poet of 'The Angel in the House'. But is it worth while? Is there anything in the general impression Patmore expressed in his short letter to my father that one can counter? And may it not be that on later consideration he modified his views? If he could not see that Keats was seeking, and seeking passionately, to establish for himself a pure and beautiful ideal in the person of his lady love, it is too late now to convince him. Let it suffice to regard his interpretation with 'wonder and bedazement', to use his own words, and look upon it, as he himself suggested, as 'a psychological curiosity'. With regard to the actual publication of Keats's letters to Fanny Brawne, my father, upon whom the burden of that responsibility rests, died in the belief that in giving them to the world he was performing an act of justice to the poet's memory; he looked upon them as essential to any picture of the true Keats, and he thought, as he said, Keats's letters without those to Fanny Brawne very much like 'Hamlet' without the Prince of Denmark. What seems to me to be an unanswerable justification for their publication, if one is needed at this late date, is given by Mr Middleton Murry in his 'Keats and Shakespeare' when he declares that 'those who cannot understand Keats's love, will never understand his poetry, for these two things spring from a single source'. Can any man understand his love until he has read those letters 'which pierce the sense and live within the soul'? Were yet another justification for my father's action required, it could be found in the fact that those thirty-nine living documents, once for a while together in his keeping, came by force of circumstances under the disintegrating sway of the auctioneer's hammer and are now scattered over the face of the earth. Those who care to examine the table of contents, in which the source of each letter and, where traced, the present owner of the original are given, may see that of the series to Fanny Brawne I have succeeded in tracing only nineteen; eighteen are in America, one in the Keats Museum at Hampstead. It is to be regretted that they did not share the fate of the letters to that other Fanny, his sister, which at her death passed from my father's care, all save six, into the hands of the nation. It is proper to state that the present collection of Keats's letters is based primarily on the fourth and fifth volumes of 'The Complete Library' edition prepared by H. Buxton Forman for Messrs. Gowans and Gray in 1901. The editor of that edition never regarded any of his work on Keats and Shelley as final, and no sooner had he put into print his latest acquisitions, than he resumed his watch for anything by or relating to them, so that when he passed on in 1917 he left an interesting assortment of new and revised material in his working copies. All appropriate matter from that source, together with a considerable quantity of material from other sources, was included in my previous edition. The 1901 collection referred to above contained two hundred and seventeen letters or parts of letters. This number had grown to two hundred and thirty-one in 1931, and in many of the old letters corrections and additions of moment had been made. Wherever possible, the original letters, or trustworthy reproductions of them, were examined and, in accordance with modern practice, Keats's orthography and punctuation, wayward and curious as they were at times, were restored. In the present edition the number of letters has advanced to two hundred and forty-one, and many more of the originals of the earlier printed letters have come to light and have been collated anew. In the manner of presenting the letters practically the same procedure has been followed as in the previous edition, save that Keats's punctuation has not been altered, or supplemented, and his spelling and his pen-slips have been given without remark, except in a few instances when it has been thought desirable to add a letter, or indicate a slip; where this has been done conical brackets have been used to mark editorial interference. Some few letters addressed to the poet have been added and all such letters, as well as those previously given in the notes, have been embodied in the text. Of the letters brought into the collection for the first time in 1931 the most important were those now numbered 71, 72, and 152, addressed respectively to Tom Keats, George Keats, and Richard Woodhouse. My attention was first drawn to the letter to Tom Keats by an article from the pen of Professor Ralph Leslie Rusk who later gave me photostats of the pages of 'The Western Messenger' in which it was printed (see note on p. 154): those to George Keats and Woodhouse were first printed by Amy Lowell in her 'John Keats', and were given by me from photostats of the originals in Harvard College Library. I also enjoyed the advantage of collating the letters in the Pierpont Morgan Library by means of photostats kindly sent to me by the Director, Miss Belle da Costa Greene. From both these Libraries I have been privileged to draw further material and information for use on the present occasion. It gave me no little satisfaction five years ago to bring together, after nearly a century of separation, the contents of the two leaves of the letter of the 3rd of November 1817 to Benjamin Bailey. Lord Houghton in 1848 had printed a part of it as the 'Outside sheet of a letter to Mr. Bailey'. In his four-volume edition of 1883 my father followed Lord Houghton's lead, merely adding at the close the words, 'I don't relish his abuse'. Before he published his supplementary volume in 1890, he was in a position, I know not how, to make a further addition by giving the first part of the outside sheet. In 1927 the inside leaf, bearing the first two pages, belonging to Mr. H. J. Swinburne Bailey, the grandson of Keats's friend, was sold at the Anderson Galleries, New York, and bought by Mrs. James B. Murphy of that city, who kindly sent me a photostat of her acquisition. Mrs. Murphy's share of the letter starts of course at the beginning, and ends with the word 'groan', and it bears, written crosswise, the first two stanzas of the song 'O Sorrow!' on page 1, and the third and fourth stanzas and two lines of the fifth on page 2. The message to Gleig and Whitehead is also written on the first page. The last seven lines of the Song and the close of the letter with the signature are written crosswise on the Harvard leaf. Of the ten letters now added to the collection two are addressed to men who make their first appearance among the poet's correspondents, Thomas Richards, brother of Charles the printer of the 1817 'Poems', and William Mayor. The little I have been able to learn of Thomas Richards may be read in the Biographical Memoranda, while William Mayor has evaded me most successfully until, just in time to mention it here, there has come into my possession the original document whereby, on the 15th day of February 1821, he bound himself to become a pupil of Benjamin Robert Haydon 'in consideration of the sum of two hundred guineas the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged', and engaged 'to conduct himself decorously and respectfully, and attend to the advice of the said' B. R. Haydon during the term of three years. Mayor is described as a 'Gentleman of Sebbons buildings Islington', Haydon as an 'Historical Painter of St. John's Place, Lisson Grove North'. All else this document shows us is that Mayor wrote a good bold hand and Haydon a bold bad one. For Letter 33, a new one to Haydon, I have to thank the Director of the Wisbech Museum: though short it is interesting as recording a meeting with Wordsworth on the last day of 1818. There are three new letters to Fanny Keats, numbered 99, 119, and 236. Two of these were intentionally withheld from publication during Mrs. Llanos's life-time, and when some years after her death my father applied to her daughter Rosa for permission to include them in his centenary edition, he learned that copies of them had already been given to another Keats collector under conditions which precluded his use of them. It is understood that the holographs of these will shortly find a permanent home at Hampstead, coming to the Keats Museum as gifts from the great-nephew of the poet. Of the fate of Letter 236 I have no definite information. The bantering little letter, number 20, to Jane Reynolds, was printed by Amy Lowell in her 'John Keats' (i. 493-4). At that time the original was in the States and inaccessible to me; it has since crossed the Atlantic twice and Messrs. Sotheby permitted me to examine it when it was in their rooms. It now reposes in the collection of Mr. W. T. H. Howe. It is right that I should warn students of Keats that the poet did not write 'Sir Thos. Newton' as printed by his American biographer, nor did he write 'much fishing'. His writing is somewhat cramped at these points, but 'Isac' is clear enough, and so is the word 'merely' for which Miss Lowell printed 'much'. For the new note, number 105, to Mrs. Wylie, I am indebted, through the instrumentality of Mr. Louis A. Holman, to Mr. Julius H. Tuttle, the Secretary of the Massachusetts Historical Society. To Mr. Holman is also due the credit of revealing Letter 167 to George Keats, which resulted from the discovery by Mr. John H. Birss of the holograph of Letter 1, to Cowden Clarke, hitherto known only in the garbled fragment given in the Clarke 'Recollections'. Both these letters Mr. Holman printed in the October 1932 issue of his periodical brochure 'Within the Compass': they belong to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania whose Librarian, Mr. Ernest Spofford, has kindly accorded me permission to reprint them. Mr. Birss again is responsible for the fragment of a letter to Haslam, number 164, which he communicated to 'Notes and Queries' for the 14th of April 1934. In 1931 I mentioned in my preface a few of the letters of Keats we might yet hope to gather in. Mr. Holman and Mr. Birss went further and sent to 'Notes and Queries' a tabulated list of Keats's unlocated letters. It may serve a useful purpose to follow their example here and record all letters referred to by Keats, or elsewhere, which have not yet come to light. The page number given in the following table is that of the page on which the reference occurs; the dates are approximate. 1 To George Keats  Spring  1817  Page 52 ------------ To George Keats  10 September  1817  Page 39 To Charles Cripps  November  1817  Page 67 To George Keats  27 April  1818  Pages 137, 145 To B.

Birss and Holman also note a letter to Severn, 'Nov. 2, 1819 (?) Libbie Catalogue: April 22, 1879', of which I know nothing, and refer to Sharp's 'Life of Severn', page 40, where there is a suggestion of letters from Keats in the Isle of Wight and at Winchester in 1819 and mention of an invitation to Severn to join his friend at Winchester for a few days. There is also a definite statement that Severn received a letter from Keats headed 'College Street, Westminster', which would of course belong to October 1819. I have been able to print only four letters to Severn and it is probable that the painter distributed a good many among autograph collectors. I have an undated catalogue of the contents of 'Frederick Locker's Great Album', offered for sale by Dodd, Mead and Company of New York, which contains the following entry under 'Keats': A. L. S. Addressed , 'Joseph Severn Esqre 128 Goswell Street; dated , 'Friday afternoon'; signed , 'John Keats.' 1 page quarto, ... With authentication by Severn, and certificate of the British Vice-Consul at Rome. 'I am rearly  sic  sorry that I have an engagement on Saturday to which I have looked forward all the Week more especially because I particularly want to look into some beautiful scenery for poetical purposes.' &c. Despite the assistance of friends in the United States I have not been able to trace the 'Great Album'. Of letters to Leigh Hunt I know of only two, the one in the Ashley Library, signed 'John Keats alias Junkets', Letter 14, and Letter 230, probably the last Keats wrote to Hunt, in the library of Mr. Owen D. Young. Yet in 'The Cornhill Magazine' for May 1892, in an article entitled 'Concerning Leigh Hunt', the writer introduces Mr. Young's letter with these words: 'Of Keats's letters to Hunt I have several, but as I believe them to have been already published in some form or other I will give only a short one which I have never seen in print.' When so much Hunt material has been 'scat abroad' one wonders that some of those several letters have not emerged. To Keats's earlier friend Cowden Clarke we have five letters. In reply to his inquiry in 1883 Mary Cowden Clarke told my father that 'all our letters from dear John Keats have already been given away as autographs'. With Bryan Waller Procter Keats's acquaintance was brief. Procter says that he saw him only two or three times before his departure for Italy, but I cannot believe that a written acknowledgement was not part of Keats's plan to make Procter 'sensible of the esteem' he had for his kindness in sending him his books. We have no letter to him, however, and Procter has little to say of Keats in the 'Autobiographical Fragment' edited by Coventry Patmore. Nevertheless the book is of interest to Keats lovers because it contains Landor's opinion of the younger poet: What a poet would poor Keats have been, if he had lived. He had something of Shakespeare in him, and (what nobody else ever had) much, very much of Chaucer.' As my friend Mr. Edmund Blunden emphasizes in his 'Marginalia', we have no correspondence with George Felton Mathew, with Cripps (whom I have since managed to trace up to 1831), with Charles Ollier, with Hazlitt, with John Hunt, with Charles Richards, with John Scott, with Edward Holmes, with Novello, with Hilton. Nor have we any with De Wint, with Davenport or Lewis (both neighbours of Keats), with Henry Stephens, to whom Keats might well have communicated his intention to pass through Redbourne on his way to Liverpool with George and Georgiana. Any of these may some day be gathered into the fold, and in the meantime they may provide interesting occupation for those who desire to achieve merit in the pleasant fields of Keatsian research. Indeed, in that direction there are other questions that may strike readers of the letters as calling for solution. For example: where exactly is 'Elm Cottage', mentioned twice by Keats, and who was its tenant? Mr. Edgcumbe, the enthusiastic Curator of the Keats Museum, has searched the Hampstead rate-books in vain. Who and what was Bob Harris, see Letters 34 and 41? Authorities on Covent Garden history deny that he had anything to do with that establishment. Who were Miss Barnes and Miss Winter (page 310)? Probably Miss Barnes was the lady who stayed with the Hunts for a few days in September 1815; I know nothing more of her and nothing at all of Miss Winter. And there is yet to be determined a point arising out of the new letter to Fanny Keats about her confirmation. What was the little book Keats sent to his sister? Mrs. Marie Adami, whose essay on the said Fanny will, I hope, shortly appear in print, has tentatively selected 'The Catechism set forth in the Book of Common Prayer', printed at the Clarendon Press in 1817 and sold for sixpence; but there may be another book of its kind with stronger claims, and such books are not easy to come by a hundred years and more after publication. These points may seem trivial. They are not, for there is no knowing what they may lead to. And if they demand patience, patience is sometimes rewarded; mine was, only a few days ago, when I laboured through a long letter in the diminutive script of Caroline Scott, dated from Fontainebleau on the 19th of July 1817 and addressed to Haydon, and came upon the following passage: 'Whilst poets are my theme I must not omit saying a word or two of your young friend Keats. I am sorry to see that Mr. Hunt's critique upon his Book is done with an air of patronage, not with heart. I should have thought he could not have avoided giving a spirited article, upon verses containing so much true poetry: I will venture to predict notwithstanding that Keats will be to his critic bye and bye "as Mount Ossa to a Wart"--- There are more of this opinion; yet still I have had battles to fight in defence of many little extravagancies contained in some of the pieces. I could not defend him in all, but I did my best, for I cannot bear those cold blooded people, who for a few faults will condemn a noble work, and thereby perhaps crush that enthusiasm which always attends true genius, and sometimes leads it, "to overstep the modesty of nature". A few years upon the poet's head, will cure this fault, and after such a sample as the work in question from the boy, what may we not expect from the man! My Lord, and I, traversed "these realms of gold" together with equal pleasure, and we shall both look anxiously for the future productions of the same pen.' Caroline was the wife of John Scott, whom Keats, according to Brown, did not like. One wonders whether Haydon showed the letter to his friend. There are many names to add to the list of those who gave me help during the preparation of my previous edition. First I must mention with deep regret Miss Ellen Mary Middleton Haydon, the daughter of Frank Scott Haydon, who died on the 25th of March 1935. Miss Haydon up to last Christmas seemed never to weary of answering my interminable questions about her grandfather and his associates, and she displayed an interest in anything by or concerning him I was able to send her. I fancy that, like her father, she had no delusions about him, while she was obviously anxious that he should not be misunderstood. I have evidence that almost up to the last she was searching among the voluminous correspondence left to her by her father for points of interest to me, and I feel that I have lost a kind and helpful friend. Mrs. Marie Adami I must thank for her unflagging zeal and assistance in the collation of the Marquess of Crewe's holographs and transcripts, to which access was once more generously granted by his Lordship. To Mr. Edmund Blunden, whose many books dealing with the Keats period are an essential source of knowledge, I am grateful for much help and information. Mr. Frederick Edgcumbe has never failed to sacrifice his time in order to satisfy my demands, and I may remark that he is always ready to increase his burdens by adding to the steadily growing collection in the Keats Museum. Mr. Frederick Page has again kept a vigilant and beneficial eye on my proofs. Mrs. Charles E. Bodurtha, of Ohio, and Miss Naomi J. Kirk, of Indiana, have been ever willing to share with me any knowledge they have acquired in their particular branches of Keats research, and Mr. Louis A. Holman and Mr. J. Howard Birss have been assiduous in their hunting after Keats material and in imparting their discoveries and knowledge to me. Dr. J. Livingston Lowes kindly sent me a substantial list of Shakespeare references he had detected in Keats's letters, and the Harvard College Library authorities have been as helpful to me as before. My old friend Mr. Thomas J. Wise has lent me anything I liked to take from the Ashley Library. For photostats, for the loan of documents and books, for information, and for assistance in various other ways I am indebted to Mrs. Esther Root Adams; Mr. Johannes C. Andersen; Mrs. W. Harris Arnold; the late Frank B. Bemis; Mr. R. P. Best, Director of the National Library of Ireland; Mr. Julian P. Boyd, Assistant Librarian of the Historical Society of Pennsylvania; Miss C. W. Braby; Mr. Nelson S. Bushnell; Miss Isabel C. Clarke; Mr. Stanley Cursiter, Keeper of the National Gallery of Scotland; the late F. Holland Day; Mr. Bonamy Dobree; Professor Edward G. Fletcher; Professor H. W. Garrod; Miss Beatrice M. D. Gattie; Sir William Hale-White; Miss Ethel P. Hall, Librarian of the Maine Historical Society; Mr. P. P. Howe; Mr. W. T. H. Howe; Mr. Roger Ingpen; Miss Alice L. Keats; Mr. R. W. Kelsey, Curator of the Roberts Collection, Haverford College; Mr. A. G. G. Lloyd; Dr. T. Ollive Mabbott; Sir Eric Maclagan, Director of the Victoria and Albert Museum; Messrs. Maggs Brothers; Dr. Humphrey Milford; Mrs. James B. Murphy; Mr. J. Middleton Murry; Mr. A. Edward Newton; Dr. H. Clement Notcutt; Mr. Morris L. Parrish; Dr. T. Wilson Parry; Mr. Carl H. Pforzheimer; Mr. Willard B. Pope; Miss Fannie E. Ratchford; the Rev. J. F. Richards and Miss M. T. G. Richards; the Rev. M. R. Ridley; Dr. A. S. W. Rosenbach; Mr. J. G. Ross; Mr. Howard J. Sachs; Mr. A. Hamilton Smith; Mr. Richard S. Smith; Mr. Arthur Swann; Miss Olive M. Taylor; Mr. Phillip Speed Tuley; Mr. John M. Turnbull; Dr. Gabriel Wells; Mr. Lucius Wilmerding; Mr. J. H. E. Winston. To these and to any friend whose name I have by mischance omitted I tender my thanks. Finally I must thank Mrs. Oswald Ellis for allowing me to reproduce on a smaller scale than before the beautiful miniature of her grandmother, Fanny Brawne, for inclusion in the frontispiece. The portraits of George and Thomas Keats are reproduced from the Severn miniatures in the Keats-Shelley Memorial House at Rome; that of John from the Severn miniature, and that of Fanny Keats from the portrait painted for my father by Don Juan Llanos y Keats, both of which were given by my mother to the Keats House, Hampstead. M. B. F. LONDON, 5 September 1935\. Postscript .---The call for a third impression of this book affords the opportunity to include in the addenda three letters which have come to light since 1935. For the earliest of these, number 70a, to Thomas Monkhouse, I am indebted to Miss Joanna Hutchinson, who owns the holograph. From Harvard College Library comes the letter to Richard Abbey, number 138a; unfortunately a piece of the original has been torn off, obliging me to supply the lacunae. The fact that this letter has been preserved justifies the hope that others from the poet to his guardian may yet turn up. The letter to Haslam, number 234a, was sold at Messrs. Sotheby's on 16 March 1937 and is now printed from a reproduction in the sale catalogue. With the permission of the Library Committee of the Hampstead Borough Council, I also give from the holograph in the Keats Museum George Keats's last letter to John before leaving England for America for the second and last time. It will no doubt be observed that I have changed the order of the first two letters in this collection, and I must record my thanks to the correspondents, both public and private, for the trouble they have taken to convince me that I was wrong in attributing the Cowden Clarke letter to 1815, and particularly to Dr. H. W. Garrod for the 'final assault' in the introduction to his edition of 'The Poetical Works of John Keats'. A few letters have been revised and amended on collation with holographs I had not previously seen. The most important of these is Keats's reply to Shelley's invitation to Pisa, Letter 227; this is now correctly dated and, with Shelley's letter, should be read after number 231, to John Taylor. A reduced facsimile of this letter is given in 'Mary Shelley, a Biography', by Miss R. Glynn Grylls, to whom I am indebted for a photograph of the original; it is one of the finest examples I have seen of Keats's best calligraphy. Some notes, mostly relating to quotations in the text, have been added; here are a few more which cannot conveniently be put in their proper places on this occasion. Letter 18. 'I will ... let my condescension stalk forth like a Ghost at the Circus.' Mr. M. Willson Disher in his 'Greatest Show on Earth', p. 36, says: 'Ghosts were rare in circuses, but one to fit this reference walked at the Royal Circus in Halloween; or, The Castle of Athlin and Dunbayne , a New Grand Scotch Spectacle by J. C. Cross, the description of which is in Circusiana , published in 1809.' In this same letter, Keats tells of a transaction between 'the aged Tamer Kewthon' and 'the overseer of the Babel Skyworks'. This, as Dr. Livingston Lowes notes in his paper on 'Moneta's Temple' in 'P.M.L.A.' for December 1936, p. 1109, is a jeu d'esprit on a plate entitled 'The Building of Babel' in Southwell's 'Universal Family Bible' (1773), a copy of which Keats owned. Letter 34, page 76. The Christian name of the egregious Kingston of Haydon's party was John; he was appointed a Commissioner of Stamps in England on 6 November 1818. Letter 61, page 133. 'a Spleen, able to engender the finest Sentiment--- and cover the whole face of the Isle with Green.' This refers to 'The Spleen. An Epistle inscribed to his particular Friend Mr. C. J.' by Matthew Green (1696-1737), published in 1737. Letter 64, page 140. Dr. G. D. Summers has questioned the date of Keats's black-letter Chaucer. If it was dated 1596, Keats had good reason for crying 'huzza', for such a thing is unknown. Keats, or one of his transcribers, has blundered. The printed letter derives from a Woodhouse transcript and 1596 is the year given by all his editors from 1848 onwards. The transcript is not accessible at the moment, but if Keats himself made the mistake, I fancy he misread 1598 on the title page as 1596. Letter 85 to Jane Reynolds. 'I am glad John is not hurt, but gone safe into Devonshire.' Mr. Edmund Blunden in 'Keats's Publisher: a Memoir of John Taylor' provides the explanation of this in an extract from a letter from Hessey to Taylor: 'He [J. H. R.] went to Brighton a few nights since on Business and had the happiness to be overturned just outside his friend Hunt's old Residence in Horsemonger Lane.' Letter 87. 'Gather the rose, &c.' To the possible sources of this quotation already given on p. 217 Mrs. Gladys Una Rimington has contributed another from Ronsard's 'Sonnet pour Helene' ending--- Vivez, si m'en croyez, n'attendez a demain; Cueillez des aujourd'huy les roses de la vie. Keats sent Dilke a translation of one line of Ronsard on 21 September and the next day to Reynolds twelve lines. If the above lines were not the basis of his quotation, it may well be that they brought to his memory Spenser's 'Gather therefore the rose' and 'Gather the rose of love' from 'The Faerie Queene', II. xii. lxxv. Letter 98, page 250. William Henry Neville, of Esher, married 'Mary, daughter of the late H. Frogley, esq. of Hounslow' on 6 March 1820, and died at Esher on 30 April 1857, aged 68. To those I have already mentioned above I must offer my thanks and also, for help in various ways, to Mr. R. C. Churchill, Mr. H. Field, Miss Dorothy Hewlett, Mrs. Peter Gray, Mr. Willard B. Pope, Mr. Kenneth Sisam, and Mr. J. H. Preston who has succeeded the late Fred Edgecumbe in the Curatorship of the Keats House and Museum and who is no less anxious than was his predecessor to assist all who visit the Keats shrine at Hampstead. Mr. William A. Jackson, Librarian, and Miss Mabel A. E. Steele, Curator of the Keats Collection, have been most kind in furnishing me with information and photostats of some of the letters in the splendid assemblage of Keats documents in the Harvard College Library. 30 October 1944\. 2 1795.

Buxton Forman, C.B., revised by the editor. George Keats, the second son of Thomas Keats and his wife Frances, born Jennings, was born on the 28th of February 1797, and brought up with his brother at Mr. John Clarke's school at Enfield. He was afterwards occupied for a time in the office of their guardian, Richard Abbey, tea merchant of Pancras Lane and of Walthamstow. There is little to record of his early life beyond what appears in the letters of the poet, as here set out and annotated. The summer visit to Paris with his invalid brother Tom and the winter flight to Teignmouth (1817-18) are the most important incidents apart from his courtship of Georgiana Wylie, whom he married in June 1818 and took to America. Thither he took what he could of the small fortune which came to him from his grandmother, and, settling at Louisville in Kentucky, fought out the battle of life till he realized a fortune and reared a family. Once only before his brother's death he came on a brief business visit to London (January 1820); and that was the last occasion on which he saw anything of his English kith and kin. Brown and Severn blamed him for not giving help to John out of the money he took away in 1820; but Dilke, the shrewdest and most judicial of the friends of Keats, regarded George's case for his own defence as clearly established. Moreover, George paid his brother's debts scrupulously and promptly. Some recollections of him by the Rev. James Freeman Clarke, first published in 'The Dial' for April 1843, and selections from his letters, are given in the Library edition of Keats's Works (London: Reeves and Turner, 1883). His personality stands out as that of a manly and high-minded fellow; and I for one have long ago dismissed the accusations of Brown and Severn as the outcome of prejudice. Miss Naomi J. Kirk, of New Albany, Indiana, who has for some time been engaged in gathering materials for a life of George Keats, describes him as 'a prominent figure in the making of Louisville history ... a force in politics. He served on the town council for several years ... was active in promoting the first bridge over the Ohio ... a stockholder in the Lexington and Ohio Railroad ... instrumental in the revision of the school system ... a prominent member of the Unitarian Church, and curator of the Lyceum ... he was known more for his cultural attainments than for his wealth'. His wealth was the reward of his own exertions and enterprise. He invested in a lumber mill, became a skilled timber buyer, built and managed a flour mill, and dealt in real estate. From the same source comes definite information of George's end. As his first disaster in America resulted from a transaction concerning a boat with John James Audubon (see Letter 156, p. 399), so his last was connected with a shipping business bought by the naturalist's brother-in-law, William Bakewell, with George Keats's backing. The business failed, both men were faced with bankruptcy, and George, already suffering from a cold, overworked to avert the crash, suddenly developed consumption, and died on the 24th of December 1841, three days after making his will. George and Georgiana were good colonists; they had eight children, two sons and six daughters. The eldest, Georgiana Emily, born in 1819, the Little child O' the western wild, apostrophized in the poem at p. 235 (Letter 94) of this volume, married Alfred Gwathmey and died in 1856; the second, Rosalind, born in 1820, predeceased her father; and the third, Emma Frances, 1823-83, married Philip Speed and was the mother of John Gilmer Speed, whose selections from Keats's writings were published in three volumes in New York in 1883. Then came Isabel, 1825-43, followed in 1827 by John Henry, who died in 1917 and whose son, or grandson, is said to be living now. Miss Alice L. Keats, the daughter of George Keats's sixth child, Clarence George (1830-61), tells me that her father died of rapid consumption, the third generation to fall a victim of that fell disease. Ella, the seventh child, was born in 1833, married George Peay, and died in 1888; and lastly in 1836 came Alice Ann who married Edward M. Drane and died in 1891. Of Thomas Keats, born on the 18th of November 1799, it is to be recorded that he also received his education at Mr. Clarke's school, was employed for a time in Mr. Abbey's office, was instrumental in bringing into the Keats story Charles Jeremiah Wells (1800-79), a school-fellow of his but not of his elder brothers', and was the unwitting cause also of the rupture between Keats and Wells which led to the most acrimonious utterances that we have from the poet. Wells fabricated a correspondence indicating that a fictitious lady ('Amena') was in love with Tom, whose chagrin on the discovery of the deception put upon him had a prejudicial effect on his already desperate state. William Michael Rossetti in his Pre-Raphaelite journal (1849-53) mentions a conversation with Wells's brother-in-law, William Smith Williams, who spoke of Wells as 'a most dangerous and insidious person', and of this affair he said in November 1850 that Wells induced Tom 'to go to France in the idea of meeting his correspondent'. Williams held the opinion that Wells's literary works were produced in the hope of pleasing Keats and winning him back; but I know of no record of Keats having seen either 'Stories after Nature' or 'Joseph and his Brethren' in manuscript, and they were not printed until after his death, the 'Stories' in 1822 and 'Joseph' in 1824. Tom Keats died of consumption at Hampstead on the 1st of December 1818 and was buried in the Church of St. Stephen, Coleman Street. His brother George stated that there was no man living who understood John as well as Tom did. Keats's only sister, always called Fanny, was born on the 3rd of June 1803, and after the death of her grandmother Jennings in December 1814 was looked after by Mr. and Mrs. Abbey when not at school. The addresses of Keats's letters to her show four names of schoolmistresses, Miss Tuckey, Miss Tucker, Miss Kaley, and Miss Caley. I suspect that there was really only one school--- the Misses Tuckey's; these ladies had a large establishment and possibly Fanny lived at Miss Caley's, a much smaller house near by, when the Misses Tuckey had an overflow of pupils. (When Mary Ann Caley died in 1852 she was buried in the Tuckey vault in Walthamstow churchyard.) In the Abbey household Fanny had ample opportunity to learn self-control in difficult conditions. On attaining the age of 21 she had to invoke the aid of the law in order to obtain from Abbey her share of her grandmother's money. In this she was assisted by the intrepid Dilke. On the 30th of March 1826, at the Church of St. Luke, Chelsea, she married an accomplished Spanish gentleman, Señor Valentin Maria Llanos, who spoke and wrote English well, distinguished himself in the diplomatic service of his country, and was the author of 'Don Esteban' (for which Colburn paid him £200 in 1825 with the promise of another £100 if it went into a second edition), 'Sandoval the Freemason', 1826, and in 1828 'The Spanish Exile' (unpublished), works of fiction 'with a purpose' on the liberal side in politics. Gerald Griffin (1803-40) stated that Llanos was intimate with Keats and spoke with him three days before he died. Of the marriage there were four children, two sons and two daughters. One of the sons entered the civil service of Spain: the other, Don Juan Llanos y Keats, became a painter of distinction. Of the daughters, the Señorita Rosa attained to be an excellent musician: she had when I saw her a certain facial resemblance to the poet. The other daughter, the Countess Brockmann, was widowed when I visited the family in Madrid in 1885. Her daughter Elena was practising as a portrait-painter; she had a striking personality and very promising talents. Señora Llanos was greatly respected, and was an excellent manager in trying circumstances. Late in life, being less affluent than formerly, she allowed me to put in motion the necessary machinery for bringing her case before the first Lord of the Treasury for the grant of a Civil List pension. A moderate pension was awarded on Lord Beaconsfield's recommendation, and was of material assistance in her latter years. Señor Llanos died on the 14th of August 1885, aged nearly ninety ---Señora Llanos on the 16th of December 1889, after a very short illness. Keats's words about his sister's striking likeness to their brother Tom perhaps made one prone to find the resemblance: I certainly thought that she had a look, even in old age, of Severn's water-colour sketch of Tom; and a portrait of her painted for me by her son Don Juan conveys perennially the same impression. The poet, as we know, was short, with a good chest and shoulders, whereas Brown (Houghton papers) records that Tom was 'very tall and very narrow chested'. I have seen no portrait representing their sister in youth. In middle life and old age she was a tall, erect, and well-developed woman. She deemed the portrait of her brother which Severn exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1819 an excellent likeness. She possessed one of the many replicas; and of this her grand-daughter Elena made for me an excellent copy in oils (not, of course, to be confused with the exquisite replica formerly owned by Thomas and Jane Hood 3 ).  Señora Llanos always held that her illustrious brother's vera effigies was only to be seen in perfection in the life-mask made by Haydon, of which she had a cast always by her. To illustrate this view she co-operated with her son Juan, or John as she sometimes called him, in posing the mask to the best advantage, and lovingly superintended the work while he made from it a delicate oil miniature in grisaille which she sent to me in a letter in the early days of our correspondence. Georgiana Augusta, George Keats's wife, was the daughter of James Wylie, Adjutant of the Fifeshire Regiment of Fencible Infantry. Unfortunately the details of her antecedents are but scanty. She counted for a great deal in the life of Keats at its healthiest period; and readers of the letters will see how much she went for later on, and as long as Keats could keep up any kind of interest in life. Her mother, also among the poet's correspondents, does not stand clearly before us; and I regret the shadowiness of her personality arising from lack of material to bring it before the reader. After George Keats's death his widow married John Jeffrey, who furnished Lord Houghton with much invaluable material, grossly mishandled, but rather through lack of aptness than want of goodwill. George Keats in one of his letters to Dilke refers to a family of the name of Griffin in Montreal as related to his wife: this family may have been connected with the Gerald Griffin mentioned elsewhere in these memoranda, as his eldest brother, an army officer, was stationed in Canada up to 1817 and his parents emigrated to America in 1820. 'Charles Cowden Clarke was born on the 15th of December 1787, at Enfield, where his father, John Clarke, kept a school. When Keats came to the school as a child of six or seven, young Clarke, fourteen or fifteen years old, gave him much of the elementary part of his education, helping later to form his tastes. Clarke was devoted to music, and an enthusiastic playgoer, his prime histrionic favourites being Edmund Kean, Mrs. Siddons, and Miss O'Neill. At the time of his literary d ebut , in Leigh Hunt's 'Literary Pocket Book', he was living at Ramsgate, whither his parents had moved on giving up the school. Returning to London after his father's death (1820), he started as a publisher and bookseller in partnership with Henry Hunt. The firm, known as Hunt and Clarke, failed in 1829, involving Hazlitt in a loss of £200 on his 'Napoleon', and Clarke joined Alfred Novello as a music publisher. He married his partner's sister, Mary Victoria Novello (well known as Mary Cowden Clarke of the Shakespeare Concordance). He wrote theatrical articles and art- criticisms for the 'Atlas' and 'Examiner' newspapers, published 'Readings in Natural Philosophy' (1828), 'Tales from Chaucer' (1833), 'Adam the Gardener', a book for boys (1834), in which he refers to 'my old friend Mr. Keats' and here and there quotes lines from his poems, and 'The Riches of Chaucer' (1835), giving in the memoir of Chaucer an account of how Keats wrote 'The Floure and the Lefe' sonnet. It was about this time that he became a public lecturer on Shakespeare and other poets. He was an excellent lecturer in all respects, and did much in this way up to 1856 in popularizing the national study of Shakespeare---also publishing many of his lectures. When Haydon's 'Autobiography' was published in 1853 Clarke at once protested in 'The Examiner' (9 July) against the painter's allegation of Keats's intemperate habits and declined to believe the cayenne pepper story. In 1859 a volume of his own verses was issued, under the title of 'Carmina Minima'. It was he who was responsible for the texts of the popular series of British Poets known as Gilfillan's Poets. In conjunction with his wife he wrote 'Recollections of Writers' (in which is included, with revisions, C.C.C.'s 'Recollections of John Keats', first printed in 'The Gentleman's Magazine' for February 1874) and 'The Shakespeare Key', published in 1878 and 1879 respectively. They went to live at Nice, together with Alfred and Sabilla Novello, in 1856; and from 1861 till his death they lived at Villa Novello, Genoa. There he died on the 13th of March 1877, beloved, respected, leaving a pleasant memory and a great mass of work over and above that already specified---useful work, if not greatly distinguished---and above all the record of a happy and beneficent life. A four-page list of 'Works by Charles and Mary Cowden-Clarke' is printed at the end of Mrs. Clarke's 'My Long Life', (second edition, 1896). Mrs. Cowden Clarke died in 1898. Of James Henry Leigh Hunt it is not necessary to say much here. He figures so prominently throughout this volume, and has left such full records of himself, so generally known, that it should suffice to mark his eleven years' seniority to Keats by noting that he was born on the 19th of October 1784, and to refer the reader to 'The Autobiography of Leigh Hunt; with Reminiscences of Friends and Contemporaries', 3 vols., 1850, to a new edition of this book 'Revised by the Author; with further Revision, and an Introduction, by his eldest Son' [Thornton Hunt], 1 vol., 1860, to 'The Correspondence of Leigh Hunt', edited by his eldest son, 2 vols., 1862, and to Mr. Edmund Blunden's comprehensive and sympathetic 'leigh Hunt, A Biography', 1 vol., 1930. It may be added that he lived long, produced enormously, was the first brief biographer of Keats (in 'Lord Byron and Some of his Contemporaries', 1828), and was ever faithful to his affection for his friend. He died on the 28th of August 1859. Of Shelley also it scarcely seems needful to set down here much more than the dates of his birth and death and to refer those who want brief biographical details to the ordinary sources of information, and those who want full particulars to Dowden's Life in two large volumes (1886). For present purposes it should suffice to point out that, born on the 4th of August 1792, he was more than three years Keats's senior, that when Keats and he became acquainted he had separated from Harriet and taken Mary as his life's partner, and that he survived Keats by less than a year and a half, having been drowned on the 8th of July 1822. Of his immortal 'Adonais, an Elegy on the Death of John Keats', coupled with the fact that his ashes were buried not far from the grave of Keats at Rome, the barest record is enough. John Hamilton Reynolds, on the whole the most congenial of Keats's correspondents outside his family, was born at Shrewsbury on the 9th of September 1794 and was baptized on the 29th of the same month. 4 He entered Shrewsbury School in 1803, and when his father left Shrewsbury in the beginning of 1806 to take up the post of head writing-master at Christ's Hospital, John was sent to St. Paul's School, being admitted on the 4th of March 1806. Reynolds was a year older than Keats and, at the time of their first acquaintance (at Hunt's cottage in the Vale of Health), he had been some time in business as a clerk in the employ of the Amicable Society for a Perpetual Assurance Office, and was, so to speak, a seasoned author. He had published in 'The Gentleman's Magazine' in February 1813 a poem to his sister Jane on her birthday; in 1814 'Safie, an Eastern Tale', dedicated to (and imitative of) Lord Byron, and 'The Eden of Imagination', which owed more to the diverse influences of Wordsworth and Leigh Hunt; and in 1815 he had put forth a strange pamphlet called 'An Ode'. The three books were issued by John Martin of Holles Street; but his next work was published by Taylor and Hessey. This was 'The Naiad: a Tale' (with other poems, 1816), dedicated to Haydon 'by one who admires his genius and values his friendship'. He probably wrote the review of Keats's first book in 'The Champion' for the 9th of March 1817, and in 'The Alfred, West of England Journal' for the 6th of October 1818 he defended his friend against the 'Quarterly Review' attack. It was Reynolds who made Keats known to Rice, Dilke, and Brown. In the course of Keats's Letters will be found the story of Reynolds's pamphlet, 'Peter Bell, a Lyrical Ballad', issued anonymously, of course, as the jocular intention was to personate Wordsworth; three editions were printed in 1819. His farce, 'One, Two, Three, Four, Five; By Advertisement', was also produced in 1819: printed copies of it, undated, are 'from the acting copy' and form No. 236 of 'Cumberland's British Theatre'. In 1820 Taylor and Hessey published a highly amusing and brilliant work from his pen entitled 'The Fancy: A Selection from the Poetical Remains of the late Peter Corcoran ... with a brief Memoir of his Life'. Reynolds was, however, 'called off' from his allegiance to the Muse by an opportunity of entering the office of Mr. Fladgate and becoming a Solicitor---an offer which promised advantage, but was incompatible with avowed literary pursuits. His sonnet bidding Farewell to the Muses (p. 177 post ) is delightful. After that farewell he published his most important volume 'The Garden of Florence; and other Poems' (1821), in which he gave his name as 'John Hamilton' only; and, apart from this, he never wholly desisted from literature for very long. His contributions to periodical literature extend to a late period in his life; his writings may be found in 'The London Magazine', 'The Athenaeum' (of which for a while he was, with Dilke, part proprietor), 'The New Monthly Mazagine', 'Bentley's Miscellany', and 'Ainsworth's Magazine'. His sister Charlotte told me that he provided Charles Mathews with words for his popular entertainments. She did not specify which; and there is no evidence that Reynolds had a hand in more than three, his collaborators being James Smith in one and a Mr. Peake in the others. Reynolds participated with Thomas Hood in writing the notable little anonymous book 'Odes and Addresses to Great People', which went through three editions, two in 1825 and one in 1826. More than once have the 'Odes and Addresses' been apportioned between Hood and Reynolds on more or less trustworthy authority. Having in my library a copy of the third edition with the authorship of each poem marked in the writing of Hood, I think it well to state here that those ascribed to Reynolds by his coadjutor and brother-in-law are the Ode to Mr. M'Adam, --- Address to Mr. Dymoke, Address to Sylvanus Urban, Esquire, Address to R. W. Elliston, Esquire, and Address to ... the Dean and Chapter of Westminster; while the Address to Maria Darlington is stated by Hood to be 'a Joint Production of Thomas Hood and John Hamilton Reynolds'. Mr. Marsh, in his book already mentioned, points out that in the copy of the 'Odes' given by Reynolds to Monckton Milnes, the donor, agreeing with Hood about those six poems, claims a share in five others, namely: Ode to Mr. Graham, --- Ode to Joseph Grimaldi, Address to the Steam Washing Company, Ode to Captain Parry, Ode to W. Kitchener, M.D. Miss Charlotte Reynolds confirmed Hood's ascriptions save in one particular: she thought her brother was alone responsible for the Address to Maria Darlington. She also told me---and that positively ---that the poem 'Sally Brown' was written by Hood and Reynolds, alternate stanzas being from the pen of each poet. Reynolds had married Miss Eliza Powell Drewe on the 31st of August 1822, and had stuck more or less to business for a while. The witty and lovable James Rice, of whom we know so little and desire to know so much, paid his expenses of admission as a solicitor, took him into partnership, and relinquished a good practice for him to follow alone; but Reynolds gave it up prematurely. Perhaps 'the Muses' tempted him; but, be that as it may, he did not rise to greatness in literature; and his second farce, 'Confounded Foreigners' (first acted in January 1838 and 'printed from the prompter's copy' as No. 32 of 'Webster's Acting National Drama'), is not as amusing as it should be. A full account of the assistance given by Reynolds to Monckton Milnes in the preparation of 'The Life and Letters of John Keats' is given by Mr. Marsh in 'Poetry and Prose', together with the relative correspondence. From about 1846-7 to the end of his life Reynolds resided in the Isle of Wight, where he obtained the post of Clerk to the County Court. He was one of the original members of the Garrick Club, which he seems to have made his home whenever he could get away from the 'primrose island'; he gave up his membership in January 1852. His death took place at Node Hill, Newport, on the 15th of November 1852. There is a photogravure of Severn's miniature of Reynolds in 'Poetry and Prose by John Keats' (Reeves and Turner, 1890), and a reproduction of the contemporary silhouette in the Keats Museum, Hampstead, accompanies Mr. Willard B. Pope's article on Reynolds in 'Wessex', vol. iii, no. 2 (Pilgrim Press, Southampton, 1935). Jane Reynolds was born on the 6th of November 1792, and on the 5th of May 1825 was married to Thomas Hood at the Church of St. Botolph, Aldersgate, the Rev. Edward Rice officiating. 'James Rice, Junr.' was one of the witnesses to the ceremony. It has been said that the marriage was opposed by her family as imprudent; but all who read the 'Memorials of Thomas Hood' published in 1860 will be convinced that the union was a happy one, however hapless the struggles and premature death of the poet, and the late Walter Jerrold in 'Thomas Hood: his Life and Times' (1907) printed letters which certainly belie the suggestion. Misfortune but drew the couple closer together. It was the first-fruit of this union that called forth Lamb's poem 'On an Infant dying as soon as born'. Later (in 1830), at Winchmore Hill, Middlesex, Mrs. Hood gave birth to a daughter, Frances Freeling---afterwards known in the world of letters by her married name of Frances Freeling Broderip. On the 19th of January 1835, at Lake House, Wanstead, Thomas Hood Junior was born. From 1835 to 1838, the Hoods were abroad. On the 3rd of May 1845 Hood died at Devonshire Lodge, Finchley Road; and on the 4th of December in the following year Jane Hood also died. Thomas Hood, junior, died in 1874 and Mrs. Broderip in 1878. The portraits of Thomas and Jane Hood, bought from their son's widow, are in the National Portrait Gallery. Mariane and Jane Reynolds were, as shown by his letters, on very friendly and pleasant terms with Keats. Mariane was born on the 23rd of February 1797 (?) and baptized on the 27th of April 1797. Jane was, it will be seen, aged nearly 25 and her sister 20½ when Keats wrote them the first of the extant letters. Eliza Reynolds and Charlotte, the only one of the family whom I knew, were in their teens. Mariane married a Mr. Green, and was the mother of the two distinguished artists Charles and Townley Green, both deceased. Mrs. Green herself had a troublous life, bravely lived. She died on the 7th of January 1874, leaving an unmarried daughter (Marian) as well as the brother painters. Of Charlotte Reynolds the elder---Mrs. Reynolds, the mother of Jane, John, Mariane, Eliza, and Charlotte the younger---I know little beyond the fact that she also was among Keats's correspondents, that her maiden name was Cox, that she was born on the 15th of November 1761, and that she died on the 13th of May 1848. She published at least one book, 'Mrs. Leslie and her Grandchildren', 1827, praised heartily by Lamb. To her youngest daughter Charlotte, who was born on the 12th of May 1802 and died on the 26th of October 1884 in the house of the Green brothers at Hampstead, I was indebted for much information. 5 She loved to relate how her brother-in-law Hood had made her the heroine of his comic poem 'Number One: Versified from the Prose of a Young Lady', and had drawn a caricature of her at the head of it. She still had her 'single lot on hand' to the last, and never seemed to regret the circumstance. Benjamin Robert Haydon, who like Keats's father came from the West Country, was, at the time of his acquaintance with the poet, a portent of energy, enthusiasm, ambition, and egotism. Although as a painter he showed sparks of the sacred fire and possessed in fact something akin to genius, his life-work suffered from defects of judgement, a faulty sense of proportion, and a total want of humour. Haydon was the son of a stationer at Plymouth, where he was born on the 26th of January 1786. At the time when Keats became excited at the bare thought of coming face to face with 'this glorious Haydon and all his creation', the painter was, it will be seen, nearly 31 years old---the poet just 21. Haydon's story is too well known to need telling in detail here. He had come to London and become a student at the Royal Academy as early as 1804; and in 1807 he showed his first picture. This was 'The Repose of the Holy Family in Egypt', hung at the Royal Academy. The next picture exhibited was 'Dentatus'. The hanging of these two works led to a quarrel between Haydon and the authorities; indeed this remarkable man's arrogance and impetuosity led him to quarrel alike with patrons, friends, and critics; and, even when forced to take to portrait painting, he scorned to temporize or humour his subjects. Among the most notable of his huge canvases were 'The Judgement of Solomon', 'The Entry of Christ into Jerusalem' (into which Haydon put portraits of Keats, Wordsworth, and other friends), 'The Raising of Lazarus' (which has a home in our National Gallery, Millbank), 'The Crucifixion', and 'Xenophon and the Ten Thousand seeing the Sea'. 'Napoleon at St. Helena' and 'The Reform Banquet' should also be mentioned, and that 'Mock Election; which he painted when in prison for debt the second time, and which was bought by George IV. Haydon failed to realize the lessons of life: when he broke out in 1827 with 'my "Judgment of Solomon" is now in a warehouse in the Borough; my "Entry into Jerusalem" is doubled up in a back room in Holborn; my "Lazarus" is in an upholsterer's shop in Mount Street, and my "Crucifixion" in a hay-loft in Lisson Grove'---he had missed the point of it all. He was not wanted for the purpose to which he insisted on devoting his egregious vitality; but he was a powerful and untiring propagandist, a good writer, a splendid lecturer; and he succeeded in making the Nation buy the Elgin Marbles. The long row of folio volumes forming his illustrated manuscript journal is a monumental reflection of his strange personality. The works based upon the journal by Tom Taylor and Frederic Wordsworth Haydon 6 teem with a fascinating psychological interest, though they are not good books. His scattered essays are generally excellent reading, and full of instruction; and in one book he comes down to posterity associated with no less a luminary than William Hazlitt. That book is the agreeable volume in which, in 1838, Messrs. Adam and Charles Black republished from the seventh edition of the 'Encyclopaedia Britannica' Hazlitt's Essay on the Fine Arts and Haydon's on Painting. On the 10th of October 1821, in the face of his customary financial difficulties, Haydon married a Cornish lady, Mary Hyman, already the mother of two children by her first husband, and by whom he left two sons and a daughter. In 1836 he was finishing a picture of quite moderate size for him, representing the Black Prince thanking Lord Audley at the close of the battle of Poictiers; and he wrote to J. R. Planche ('Recollections and Reflections', 1872, volume i, pages 229-30) for certain information on matters of costume--- so careful was he in such particulars. The picture had been commissioned by a descendant of Audley, contained numerous portraits of Audleys then living, and was certainly a most striking production---none the worse, I suspect, for the comparative modesty of its size. Nevertheless, it must have measured at least 18 feet by 12, and it was probably found inconvenient to the house of Audley. At all events the whirligig of time brought it to Haydon's own county about the year 1858. That is how I come to speak of it as a thing seen. My father's friend, Mr. John Whiteway of Fishwick, on the Teign, who had a collection of fine old pictures, bought this one of Haydon's in London, and brought it home (a year or two before I left the county) for a birthday present to his wife. She kept it till the end of her long life; but I shall never forget her graphic account of its arrival at Fishwick and of the removal of a large window in the drawing room in order to get the picture into the house. This scrap of gossip is, I venture to think, an apt illustration of Haydon's failure in life. There was no place in little England for such canvases as his; and this was but a small one. Although he had in his time succeeded in drawing crowds to see his work, his crowning misfortune was a failure in that kind: he attempted to show his 'Banishment of Aristides' and his 'Nero Playing while Rome was in Flames'. In the same building, 'General Tom Thumb' was exhibiting his ludicrous small person; and, although a week's visitors to Haydon's show numbered but 133, the dwarf received the attentions and the gatemoney of 120,000 persons in the same period. At length Haydon's colossal fighting prowess collapsed: on the 22nd of June 1846 he ended his eventful career by shooting himself. The main sources of information about William Haslam are Sharp's 'Life and Letters of Joseph Severn' (1892) and the letters of John Keats, and in these stands out clearly the picture of one who from his early manhood not only quietly and unobtrusively showed devotion to a friend of his own age, but one who was also ready at all times to serve him. Haslam, according to Sharp, was born in 1795 and apparently became acquainted with Keats before most of the friends who figure more prominently in the poet's correspondence. We find him anxious about Keats when he was nursing his dying brother and warning Severn of the danger of such constant proximity to the invalid; sending his friend game; keeping in touch with Tom while John was away; invariably acting as mail agent for the dispatch of American letters; 'always doing me some good turn', 'a most kind and obliging and constant friend', to use Keats's own words; and it was Haslam, too, who relieved Keats of the sad duty of informing George of Tom's death. It is true that there was trouble on two occasions about the treatment of certain letters sent to him for some specific purpose, but although Keats was irritated at the time, the incidents did not rankle and the friendship was not disturbed. In March 1819 Haslam lost his father, to whose position in the firm of Frampton and Sons he was promoted. About this time he was living not far from the Framptons at Bethnal Green. Becoming engaged shortly afterwards, he seems to have been less in touch with Keats for a while, but directly there was urgent need for action he was to the fore again, and it was he who suggested to Severn that he should accompany Keats to Italy. Nor did he forget his friend after they had said good-bye at Gravesend. On the 4th of December 1820 he wrote to Severn warning him not to speak to John of George, about whom he shared Charles Brown's opinion, and adding, 'Keats must get himself well again, Severn, if but for us. I, for one, cannot afford to lose him. If I know what it is to love, I truly love John Keats.' In 1838 Brown dined with Haslam and found him living 'like a most prosperous man', with a wife and daughter, 'the latter a nice girl of about 16'. In 1847 he assisted Monckton Milnes in his work on 'The Life and Letters'. The only fault to be found in him is that he did not preserve his friend's letters with the care that is bestowed on them to-day, yet in that respect he does not stand alone. In explanation of this and of the fact that this collection contains only two letters and a fragment of a letter from Keats to him, Lord Crewe has kindly allowed me to print the following letter to his father dated from Copthall Court, the 5th of February 1847: Dear Sir, I am favoured with your note of yesterday. I was gratified to hear lately from Mr. Severn that you were certainly proceeding with a memoir of John Keats, and I immediately looked up such letters as I cou'd find and about three weeks ago called upon Mr. Severn with them---went generally over them, and begged of him to arrange for my seeing you with him, as soon as might be after you shou'd come to London---He is a sad fellow---and having heard nothing from him, I wrote to him three days ago. I regret that engagements for tomorrow will preclude my waiting upon you as requested---but I write to Severn to beg that he will see you and arrange for my meeting you and himself on Wednesday or on Thursday either at your residence or at his own, and I will request of you if you please to inform me what arrangement is made---The hour wou'd suit me perfectly well, or I wou'd make it eleven or twelve if you wou'd rather. The letters I have are Severn's letters written from the Downs---on the voyage and after their arrival. Letters of Keats I have found none ---They probably were so well, or intended to be so well taken care of, that every endeavour to lay my hand upon them has proved unavailing. ---Severn's however are highly interesting. I remain, Dear Sir, Yours faithfully W. Haslam. Haslam died on the 28th of March 1851. His wife, Mary Haslam, less than a year later wrote that he broke down under the heavy pressure of business and financial embarrassments but that 'his end was peace'. Sharp says that his sister, whom Keats seems to have known, was living in Paris in 1876. His daughter, Annette Augusta Haslam, was living in London in 1883 and was in correspondence with Severn up to the time of his death. Joseph Severn was the son of a musician, James Severn, and was born on the 7th of December 1793 at Hoxton. He showed a taste for drawing at an early age; and his father, faute de mieux , apprenticed him to an engraver. To engraving he did not take kindly; and he somehow managed to get an easel, colours, and brushes and to attend occasionally at the schools of the Royal Academy. In 1816 his enthusiasm was battling with his want of means; but his acquaintance with Keats fired him with redoubled ambition; and when in 1817 the Academy announced a students' competition for a gold medal, to be awarded for the best historical painting on a subject from Spenser, Severn sold his watch and books to buy the necessary material, competed, and won. His picture was 'The Cave of Despair'. His next, 'Hermia and Helena', was accepted and exhibited by the Academy, but not much noticed. His growing friendship with Hunt, Reynolds, Keats, and Charles Brown helped to form his tastes; and when, in 1820, he complied with Haslam's suggestion that he should go with Keats to Rome, he was probably wiser than his father thought. That impulsive gentleman is said to have knocked him down, on account of the supposed injury to his prospects. After Keats's death Severn set to work to finish the picture of 'The Death of Alcibiades' which he had left undone for Keats's sake. He obtained through this picture a three years' travelling premium of  £130; and the Academy refunded the expenses of his visit to Rome. Severn did not progress steadily as an artist after these early successes; but his many portraits of Keats are highly treasured, especially the earlier ones; with rare exceptions, the posthumous ones are of little interest or merit; his work, however, found a certain acceptance for the sake of the poet at whose deathbed he had attended so devotedly. He lived a great part of his life at Rome. In 1828 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Archibald, Lord Montgomerie; and he had by her several children, three of whom grew up to distinguish themselves as artists, among them Arthur Severn, who married Ruskin's cousin, and was his housemate at Brantwood till Ruskin died. One of his commissions was a picture of the Coliseum with Shelley in a prominent position, painted for Sir Percy Florence Shelley; and he projected, but did not execute, an illustrated edition of 'Adonais'---a poem in which he was anxious to appropriate to himself the portrait of Leigh Hunt, though Shelley had apologized in the preface for Severn's absence from the poem. In 1841 he returned to England for the sake of his children's education, and remained some 19 years. In 1860 he obtained the British Consulship at Rome. This he held till 1872, when he was superannuated. He died at Rome on the 3rd of August 1879, and was buried beside Keats. Of Benjamin Bailey, who, judged by the standard of sympathy and receptiveness, must be regarded as one of Keats's most important correspondents, very little is publicly known save through the biographies of the poet. From Mr. Joseph Foster's 'Alumni Oxonienses' it appears that he was the son of Mr. John Bailey of Thorney in Cambridgeshire. He was born on the 5th of June 1791, and matriculated from Magdalen Hall on the 19th of October 1816. He was an Oxford undergraduate, reading for the Church, when Keats made his acquaintance; and at that time he was a distinctly 'bookish' young man. Milton and Wordsworth were his supreme favourites; and it seems to have escaped the narrators that he actually produced a small printed work illustrative of his love for Wordsworth. It will be remembered that Keats stayed with Bailey at Oxford for some weeks of the long vacation of 1817, and there wrote the Third Book of 'Endymion', finding plenty of time to enjoy with his friend constant excursions on foot and by boat up and down the Isis, revelling in the beauties of nature, and indulging in high talk on great subjects. Before Bailey was ordained and married, he visited Stratford-on-Avon with Keats. He obtained a curacy in the neighbourhood of Carlisle at the end of 1817. In 1818 he defended Keats in 'The Oxford Herald' (for the 30th of May and 6th of June). In 1819 he was married to a daughter of the Bishop of Stirling---a sister of Robert Gleig, the author (later on) of 'The Subaltern', &c., and Chaplain-General of the Forces---and in the same year he became Vicar of Dallington in Northamptonshire. In 1827 he must have been at Townfield in Scotland, as two extant sonnets by him bear the name of that place with the date July 1827. In 1831 he became senior Colonial Chaplain of Ceylon and was stationed at Colombo, of which place he was appointed Archdeacon on the 27th of February 1846; and in 1847 he took the degree of Doctor of Divinity. He must have lost his wife not later than 1837 as in that year he printed at Colombo a twenty- four page pamphlet entitled 'Stanzas to my Daughter on her Birthday: with my own portrait', in which he refers to the child as 'motherless'. Shortly before his death he returned to England; he died at Nottingham Place, Marylebone, on the 25th of June 1853. In the year 1876 I purchased, among some pamphlets which appeared to be 'Athenacum' clearings, and then mislaid, an anonymous tract---a single post 8vo sheet in a plain grey wrapper---with a manuscript inscription connecting it with Bailey. Its title is 'Lines  Addressed to  William Wordsworth Esq.' The title-page bears an epigraph from the seventh Satire of Juvenal and the imprint 'Ceylon,  Colombo---:Printed at the Wesleyan Mission Press.  1835'. On the fly-leaf is written, in that hand which 'looks illegible and may perchance be read', the following inscription to Keats's other friend and correspondent whose writing 'looks very legible and may perchance not be read'---'C. Dilke Esq. with the kind regards of B. Bailey. Colombo. Jany. 1836. The first of these poems is by the Honble. Mr. Serjt. Rough, Senior Puisne Justice of Ceylon---the rest by me.--- They may, if wished, be reprinted in the Athen aeum , if not done so already. B. B.' The columns of that paper for 1835 and 1836 show no trace of the reprint thus authorized. Mr. Serjeant Rough's effusion consists of seven long stanzas of a very poor kind. Bailey's remainder is less ambitious, and much better; and the place which the worthy ecclesiastic now takes in the records of Keats's life confers on this memorial of his enthusiasm a literary interest. His part of the pamphlet is but six pages, containing four sonnets and two smaller pieces of eight lines each. I rediscovered my discovery in 1886 and communicated it to the Editor of the 'Athenaeum', who, availing himself of the permission given half a century earlier, reprinted one of the sonnets. The tiny tract closes with the following lines written in 1827 'On a Portrait of Wordsworth': Though sadness seem to dwell upon his face, It is of Thought the 'melancholy grace': Deep Thought is seated on that ample brow, And sheds a grandeur on the face below; A countenance serene, where feelings mild With high imagination mingle: Child, And Youth, and Manhood---every age we trace Depicted in his Works , and in his Face. In 1831 Bailey had published 'Poetical Sketches in the South of France', and in addition to these efforts in verse he wrote books on religious subjects and some of his sermons were printed in Ceylon. Another event of the year 1831 which must have been a pleasure to Bailey was the visit of Maria Jane Jewsbury, who had just married the Rev. William Kew Fletcher. The Fletchers stayed with him for a fortnight, and Mrs. Fletcher wrote to Dora Wordsworth describing Bailey as 'such a Wordsworthian as I have rarely if ever met--- every edition of your father is here---filled with m.s. notes'. 7 One Wordsworth quarto, 'The Excursion', she took away inscribed to her by her host: it is now in the collection of Mr. John M. Turnbull in South Africa. Keats had an excessively high opinion of Bailey's character at first; and I think he must have retained it in the main, although his criticism of his friend's inconstancy in love affairs, written to his brother and sister-in-law in March 1819, is full and unsparing. He wrote to Bailey in August 1819 somewhat coldly, to judge from the portion of the letter which is extant (see Letter 142): still, he congratulated him on his marriage, and said things which he could not have said sincerely if he had not resolved to condone what he regarded as an offence to woman-kind in Bailey's behaviour. As Keats was incapable of hypocrisy, I think we must take his final judgement of Bailey to be that he was 'one of the noblest men alive' (see Letter 37), but fickle in his attentions to women in the days of his bachelorhood---a defect which Keats might well, writing certain phrases which he did to George and Georgiana, regard as cured by his marriage. It is not improbable that Keats was misinformed about Bailey's 'trying at Miss Martin' (see Letter 123, p. 304) for Miss Martin married another Bailey, an upholsterer of London, whose Christian name was Edward. The personality of James Rice is vividly alive in Keats's letters; and yet there is scarcely anything to say about his annals, beyond the bare record that he was not alive at the end of 1833. Witty and generous in the extreme, he appears to have been a general favourite, and one who impressed others as in some sense fortunate, despite his miserable health--- concerning which Keats, going to inquire on one occasion, reported to his brothers (Letter 40, p. 87) that 'lo! Master Jemmy had been to the play the night before and was out at the time--- he always comes on his Legs like a Cat'. Rice was educated for the law; and the reader will see from the note to Letter 76 (pp. 176-7) how liberal a soul that of James Rice was. But there must have been something very notable about the man of whom two such opposites as Keats and Dilke, both so unusually capable of judging character, agreed in employing terms of enthusiastic laudation. It was not for nothing that Keats imported into his criticism of Bailey's love affairs the fact that James Rice, the witty, the gay, the glib-tongued, had for his own satisfaction sat in judgement: 'Rice would not make an immature resolve: he was ardent in his friendship for Bailey, he examined the whole for and against minutely; and he has abandoned Bailey entirely.' It was not for nothing that Keats was at the time more swayed against Bailey by this than anything else; not for nothing that he told his brother in September 1819 (p. 400) that Rice was 'the most sensible, and even wise Man' he knew---with 'a few John Bull prejudices, but they improve him'; and assuredly it was not for nothing that Dilke, the shrewd, the keen, the far-seeing, spoke of him as 'dear generous noble James Rice---the best, and in his quaint way one of the wittiest and wisest men I ever knew'. Dilke printed a few of Rice's whimsicalities in 'The Athenaeum'. Reynolds, whose affection and esteem had borne the hard test of considerable obligation, wrote to Lord Houghton when the 'Life, Letters &c.' was in preparation that Rice had been 'a very kind friend to him', adding---'He was a quiet true wit---extremely well read---had great taste and a sound judgement. For every quality that marks the sensible companion--- the valuable Friend---the gentleman, and the Man---I have known no one to surpass him.' How gladly would we see a few of his letters, and realize his outer man by means of a fine portrait! There is a silhouette, and also a miniature in water- colours, of Rice in the Leigh Browne-Lockyer collection in the Keats Museum; which also contains letters, relics, and commonplace books relating to Rice, Bailey, and Reynolds. Charles Wentworth Dilke, born on the 8th of December 1789, made his start in life as a clerk in the Navy Pay Office, and employed his leisure in the study of English literature, especially of the elder dramatists. By the time Keats had come to years of discretion, Dilke had already brought out in the years 1814 to 1816 and admirably edited series of volumes supplementary to Dodsley's Collection of Old Plays, and had married and settled at Hampstead. When Keats made his acquaintance he was living at Wentworth Place with his wife and his son Charles, born in 1810, and afterwards created a Baronet. He was a contributor to 'The London Magazine', 'The London Review', 'The Champion', 'The Retrospective Review', and in 1821 advocated the repeal of the corn laws in a letter addressed to Lord John Russell, published as a pamphlet. 'The Athenaeum', established by Silk Buckingham in 1828, was in failing health at the end of 1829. Dilke came to its rescue, taking complete editorial control in 1830, and greatly influencing the management on behalf of the proprietors, who, besides himself and the printer, seem to have been John Hamilton Reynolds, Thomas Hood, and Allan Cunningham. These, alarmed by his bold measures, such as reduction of price, withdrew from the venture, save as contributors, and left Dilke and the printer alone to establish, successfully, an independent and incorruptible literary organ. In 1836, on the abolition of the Navy Pay Office, Dilke, as a civil service pensioner, was able to devote himself more completely to 'The Athenaeum'; and when, between 1840 and 1850, it had become an assured success, he relinquished the editorship. In 1846 he became manager of 'The Daily News'; but he withdrew from that post at the close of an agreed three years, the composite proprietorship proving intractable. The principles which he would have applied to it were adopted with good results later on. From 1847 or thereabout he did most of his best literary work---his exact, thorough, truth-finding, and truth-speaking papers on Junius, Burke, Wilkes, Dr. Wolcot ('Peter Pindar'), Pope, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and many like subjects. Dilke was one of those who in 1858 attempted to bring about a reform in the administration of the Royal Literary Fund, and, being outvoted, founded the Guild of Literature and Art. He left London in 1862 and went to live at Alice Holt in Hampshire. There, on the 10th of August 1864, his useful and distinguished life closed after an illness of only a few days. The facts of his life may be read more at length in the Biographical Sketch prefixed by his grandson, the Right Honourable Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, Baronet, M.P., to the two volumes of articles reprinted under the title of 'Papers of a Critic' (Murray, 1875), and his portrait, reproduced from a miniature, forms the frontispiece to the second volume of 'John Francis, Publisher of The Athenaeum' (Bentley, 1888). Charles Armitage Brown was born in Lambeth in 1786. His father was a Scotch stockbroker. When only eighteen years old the lad was sent to St. Petersburg to manage a business. By 1810 or thereabout Charles had come back to London, penniless, and had to make a living as he might; but, through the early death of a brother, he became possessed of just enough to live on, and added to his income by writing for periodicals, &c. In 1814 a serio-comic opera by him, entitled 'Narensky, or the Road to Yaroslaf', was both published and performed at Drury Lane. The music was by Braham and Reeve: it ran for several nights, but is an indifferent production enough, though, according to his son, its success was sufficient to give him £300 and free admission for life to Drury Lane Theatre. His relations with Keats from 1817 to the time of the poet's death come out clearly and pleasantly in the letters, but there is a point recorded in the Houghton papers indicative of remarkable tact. After telling how anxious he was for Keats's friendship the moment he met him, Brown says--- 'I succeeded in making him come often to my house by never asking him to come oftener; and I let him feel himself at perfect liberty there chiefly by avoiding to assure him of the fact. He quickly became intimate.' In 1822 Brown went to Pisa taking with him his son by Abigail Donohue whom at one time he had thought of leaving in the care of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Richards. In Italy he met Byron, whom he tried to convert from his erroneous views on Keats, became more or less friendly with Landor, and contributed to 'The Liberal' under the pseudonyms of 'Carlucci' and 'Carlone'. He was the author of papers in that short-lived periodical which have been attributed to two wrong Charleses---to Lamb ('Les Charmettes and Rousseau') and to Cowden Clarke ('On Shakespeare's Fools'). He contributed to many of Leigh Hunt's ventures and wrote a number of articles for 'The New Monthly Magazine'. Returning to England in the spring of 1834, he lived at Laira Green near Plymouth, lectured on Shakespeare and Keats, and was associated with 'The Plymouth and Devonport Weekly Journal', in which appeared in 1840 his 'Walks in the North during the Summer of 1818'. This record, though unfinished, furnishes interesting confirmation of the tour with Keats described in the poet's letters. In 1838 he published a work of some permanent value and considerable talent, which he dedicated to Landor: it is called 'Shakespeare's Autobiographical Poems. Being his Sonnets clearly developed: with his Character drawn chiefly from his works'. The publisher was James Bohn of London. It is a crown 8vo volume of over 300 pages. In the same year forty-eight stanzas of his translation of Francesco Berni's version of Boiardo's 'Orlando Innamorato' was printed in the November number of the 'West of England Magazine'. He meant to have edited Keats's Works with a memoir (which he wrote); but on deciding to emigrate to New Zealand he transferred his materials to Mr. Monckton Milnes, afterwards Lord Houghton. In 1841 Brown obtained a grant of land at New Plymouth, now called Taranaki, and having sent his son on before him and disposed of his cottage at Laira Green, he left Plymouth on the 22nd of June 1841 and reached New Zealand in October. Dissatisfied with the land and in failing health he decided to return, but in June 1842 he died suddenly of apoplexy, and was buried on Marsland Hill. In his last letter to Severn written in January 1842 he said 'I have written much of my "New Zealand Handbook"; not "New Zealand Guide"; because I cannot conscientiously guide anyone to it': this book has not been published, and his unfinished novel 'Walter Hazelbourne' remains in manuscript in the Keats Museum at Hampstead. Charles Brown was an excellent fellow and a good friend to Keats: he was a wit and a jolly companion, whom Keats loved. He was liable to prejudices of an unusually strong kind; and was wanting in breadth of character. The time will come when the battle between Charles Brown and George Keats will be fought over again around the growing cairn of Keats literature. For that reason I take this opportunity of putting on public record a note of the shrewd and critical-minded Dilke, who lived in the same block with him and knew him and the Keats circle intimately. It is written in Dilke's copy of the 'Life, Letters, &c.' (1848), as a caveat against any over-estimate of Brown's liberality and chivalry such as might possibly be formed after reading the work of Lord Houghton, who had described Brown as a 'retired Russia- merchant' and the 'generous protector and devoted friend of the Poet Keats'. This is Dilke's note: 'A retired Russia-merchant, the generous protector of the poet Keats! Fine words---what are they worth? I arrived from Broad-stairs just in time to see the first notice of this work before it was inserted in the "Athenaeum", and therein these fine words and others of a like tendency were echoed with a vengeance---and the retired Russia-merchant figured as the generous patron! There is a curious amount of truth and error in these fine phrases---Brown was a retired Russia-merchant. His brother John had been clerk in a merchant house, started on his own account, went to Petersburg, sent for his brother Charles (then about 18 I should say), left him to conduct the business there and returned to manage it in England. They speculated in bristles and having little or no capital soon failed! Charles returned to England at about three- and-twenty---and for many years had a very hard struggle , the particulars of which do not concern Keats's history. Then his brother James returned from India and died within six weeks or two months. It was his small share of James's property on which he afterwards lived---for his reversion to two houses or one left him by his father had been sold at his bankruptcy. What Mr. Milnes means by a "generous protector" I know not---assuredly it had nothing to do with money. When John Keats died Brown sent in an account to George for board, money lent, and interest amounting to about  £72-which by George's order I paid. Neither Mr. Milnes nor his distinguished ... friend of Fiesole 8 knew anything about Brown--- they were not sufficiently on an equality to penetrate the heart of his mystery. If it were to the purpose, I could here write down a character of Brown that would be greatly to his honour---though there would be nothing in it about the retired Russia-merchant or generous protector. I saw him under all varieties of fortune, they only under one, of moderate, very moderate, independence. He was the most scrupulously honest man I ever knew---but wanted nobleness to lift this honesty out of the commercial kennel. He would have forgiven John what he owed him with all his heart---but had John been able and offered to pay, he would have charged interest, as he did to George. He could do generous things too---but not after the fashion of the world and therefore they were not appreciated by the world. His sense of justice led him at times to do acts of generosity---at others of meanness--- the latter was always noticed, the former overlooked---therefore amongst his early companions he had a character for anything rather than liberality---but he was liberal.' Believing every word of this note, I still find it compatible with a very high estimate of Brown's affection for Keats. In a touching letter sent to Severn when nursing the dying poet, his obviously genuine expressions of gratitude leave the impression that he would himself have done anything for Keats that might have lain in his power. There is a bust of Brown in the Keats House, Hampstead. Of Keats's publishers, Taylor and Hessey, one takes in these letters, as indeed in history, a far more prominent position than the other. John Taylor was born at East Retford (Notts.) on the 31st of July 1781, and had been several years established in the publishing partnership at No. 93 Fleet Street when he became acquainted with Keats. He was a man of character and learning ---the originator of the theory that Sir Philip Francis wrote the Letters of Junius, a subject on which he published 'A Discovery of the Author of the Letters of Junius' (1813), 'The Identity of Junius with a distinguished Living Character Established' (1816), and 'A Supplement to Junius Identified' (1817). These works, it will be noted, or at least two of them, preceded the time of his connexion with Keats as publisher of 'Endymion'; and it seems likely that Keats had been reading them when he wrote the postscript to Letter No.42-'I hope your next work will be of a more general Interest---I suppose you cogitate a little about it now and then.' About that very time a second edition, corrected and enlarged, of 'The Identity' was being issued; and it may be to that that Keats alludes in Letter 50 when he says to his brothers that he thinks Taylor 'will be out before' 'Endymion'. It has been alleged that Edward Dubois was the author of these treatises; but Taylor himself emphatically declared that he had no assistance either from Dubois or from any one else. In 1821, on the acquisition of 'The London Magazine' by his firm, Taylor assumed the editorship, with Thomas Hood as sub- editor. Moving to Waterloo Place, the firm extended frequent and congenial hospitality to their distinguished contributors---such as Lamb, De Quincey, and Talfourd. Taylor, like his brother James, the Bakewell banker, was a close student of the currency question. Opposed to Sir Robert Peel's measures in this matter, he published a number of works on this somewhat dry department of human learning. His later writings include 'The Emphatic New Testament, with an Introductory Essay on Greek Emphasis' (1852), 'The Great Pyramid: Why was it Built?' (1859), 'The Battle of the Standards' (1864), and 'Light shed on Scripture Truth by a more Uniform Translation' (1864). Taylor died unmarried on the 5th of July 1864. He is buried at Gamston, near Retford. Augustus De Morgan, in 'A Budget of Paradoxes', 1872, writes of him as 'a man of a very thoughtful and quiet temperament', and of his books as 'valuable for their accurate learning'. In 'Sketches in the Life of John Clare' (1931) Mr. Edmund Blunden prints a study of Taylor in which, as he says, 'Clare plays the candid friend'; and some interesting particulars of her great-uncle and extracts from his letters to his family are given by Miss Olive M. Taylor in 'The London Mercury', June and July 1925. There is a medallion portrait of Taylor in the National Portrait Gallery. Of James Augustus Hessey, I am able to record but little beyond what appears above or in the letters of Keats or the notes upon them. Lord Houghton applied to Reynolds for information about him, and got next to nothing beyond the fact of the partnership, and that Hessey 'attended to the retail business in Fleet Street' and was 'a very respectable person---but of no moment in the memoir' of Keats. The partnership with Taylor was dissolved on the 30th of June 1825-'the dissolution of partnership', says Miss Taylor in 'The London Mercury', 'was felt by both to be a grief, but a necessary grief'---and after a period spent in the retail trade and in auctioneering, he took over an oldestablished school at Hampstead in 1834. I ascertained from his son, Archdeacon Hessey, headmaster of Merchant Taylors' School, that he was born on the 28th of July 1785 and died on the 7th of April 1870. Of his personality one gathers nothing but pleasant impressions from the letters of Keats, slight as the indications are. The firm was collectively and individually on terms of friendship and kindness with the poet. The letters are generally to the predominant partner Taylor; of Hessey's personality the most significant thing in the letters in Keats's mention of him on one occasion as 'Mistessey'---a jocular way of alluding to some one's corruption of 'Mr. Hessey' into 'Mista 'Essey'. Had he been other than a good fellow Keats would not have ventured on 'Mistessey'. To Richard Woodhouse the lovers of Keats owe no common debt. Born at Bath on the 11th of December 1788, and educated at Eton, he was, when Keats became acquainted with him, 'a young barrister who', to use Sir Sidney Colvin's words ('Keats' in the 'English Men of Letters' series, p.126), 'acted in some sort as adviser or literary assistant to Messrs. Taylor and Hessey'. It was actually in March 1811 that he had joined Taylor and Hessey's little circle of friends who met at 93 Fleet Street for practice in essay writing and debating, and mutual improvement generally. Taylor then described him as an 'excellent Classic', with a turn for poetry, abstemious to a remarkable degree (a few years later we catch him cracking a bottle of claret with Keats), of great industry, averse to the pleasures of the day, an early riser, and 'above all things ... extremely attentive to religious duties'. The little that is known of Woodhouse shows that Taylor judged his man well. Woodhouse's interleaved and annotated copy of 'Endymion', and his common-place books full of copies made from Keats's poems before publication and copies of letters from Keats made with a view to biographical use, have proved invaluable, both for the quality and the quantity of what he preserved and for his own gifts as an accurate and judicious recorder. From a letter written by Keats to Dilke it appears that Charles Brown took 'one of his funny odd dislikes' to the literary young lawyer, but after Woodhouse had stayed with him near Florence for seven weeks in the autumn of 1832 Brown wrote to Severn that he liked him much and hoped he would return. Cowden Clarke, who did not meet him until after Keats's death, found him 'for a lawyer, rather a good fellow'. From the preface to 'A Grammar of the Spanish, Portuguese and Italian Languages', published by Woodhouse in 1815, we learn that he lived for more than two years in Spain and Portugal, and the dedication of the same book shows that he was a nephew of John Alderson, M.D., of Hull, from which Mr. Blunden traces his cousin-ship to Amelia Opie, nee Alderson, the novelist and poet, and wife of John Opie the painter. His notes of conversations in which De Quincey took part were printed in Richard Garnett's edition of the 'Confessions of an English Opium-Eater' in the Parchment Library (1885). Mr. Blunden also records that he was solicitor to the Law Life Assurance Society and that in March 1824 he assisted the poet Clare in making his will. Woodhouse was not only a philologist and versifier and an excellent scholar in the literary sense, but he was also a practical stenographer. There are many notes in the interleaved 'Endymion' written in shorthand---Mavor's System (1795). The portrait of Keats by William Hilton now in the National Portrait Gallery, and the Girometti medallion, which may be seen in the Keats Museum at Hampstead, were both executed for Woodhouse. For some years before his death his health was precarious; in 1829 and 1830 he was in Madeira, and in 1832 in Italy as already mentioned. He died of consumption on the 3rd of September 1834, leaving his collection of Keats material to John Taylor. There is but little to record of Thomas Richards, the brother of the Charles Richards who printed Keats's first book of 'Poems' in 1817. He was the son of John Richards who, like Keats's father, carried on a livery-stable business, and with such success that when he made his will in 1814 he had, in addition to the business, substantial investments in the public funds and leasehold properties in Bayswater, Oxford Street, and Duke Street to leave to his wife and family of nine children. I have at present no knowledge of when Thomas Richards was born, and all that the Public Record Office can tell of him is that he was appointed a Junior Clerk of the First Class in the Store-keeper's Office of the Tower on the Ist of July 1804, was promoted in 1827, and died in 1831. From Charles Brown we learn that towards the end of 1820 Richards broke his leg romping with his children, and that he offered to take charge of Carlino Brown when the father went to Italy. Cowden Clarke in 'Recollections of Writers' describes him as 'a right good comrade, a capital reader, a capital listener, a capital appreciator of talent and of genius'; and in letters to Richards he refers to his godson, Thomas Richards the younger, as 'old gravity'. It must have been at Thomas Richards's house, No.9 Providence Place, near Vauxhall Gardens, that Keats stayed in December 1816 on that night so 'whoreson' that he could not return home. In his letter to Georgiana (No. 172, p. 454) Keats contrasts him humorously with Rice and Reynolds; and the tone of the only letter we have from the poet to him convinces me that Thomas, not Charles, Richards was his intimate friend. Perhaps the strongest evidence of Keats's feelings towards Richards is the fact that he sent him the Wells- Amena letters to read, for in view of what he wrote to his brother George in the journal letter of February-May 1819 it is unlikely that he would have disclosed the details of that sorry affair to one who was not a tried and trusted friend. There are portraits of Thomas Richards's son, 'old gravity', his grandson Franklin Richards, and his great-grandson Grant, in Mr. Grant Richards's 'Author-Hunting' (Hamish Hamilton, 1934), but I regret that so far as I can learn there exists no portrait of the man Keats knew. James Elmes, senior even to his friend Haydon, was considerably older than Keats. Born in London on the 15th of October 1782, he had entered the Merchant Taylors' School in April 1796, but a few months after Keats's birth. Destined for the career of an architect, Elmes had studied under George Gibson and at the Royal Academy, had gained the silver medal for an architectural design as early as 1805, had been a constant exhibitor of designs for some years, had become Vice-President of the Royal Architectural Society in 1809; and when Haydon was firing Keats's young enthusiasm with fervour for the fine arts, Elmes, his close associate, was editing that notable periodical the 'Annals of the Fine Arts', 1816-20, in which the 'Nightingale' and 'Grecian Urn' odes first appeared and the Elgin Marbles sonnets were reprinted from 'The Examiner'. Elmes was a distinctly successful man: not only did he, as recorded in Redgrave's 'Dictionary of Artists of the English School' (1874), design and erect several buildings in the Metropolis, but he was Surveyor of the Port of London up till 1848, was a voluminous and instructive writer on art subjects, and shares with Haydon the credit of the Elgin Marbles propaganda. In 1844 he lost his sight, but regained it sufficiently after about five years to enable him to resume literary work. He died on the 2nd of April 1862, at Greenwich, and is buried at Charlton. The instant and permanent success of one book and the well-merited friendship of several men great in the world of letters have combined to keep Horace Smith's memory green---greener indeed than the mass of his very voluminous writings apart from the 'Rejected Addresses' would have kept it. And so long as edition follows edition of that brilliant and delightful book, the world will not be at a loss for details of the life of the brother authors James Smith and Horatio, or, as he is always called, Horace Smith. They were the sons of Robert Smith, a Somersetshire man who came to London and became Solicitor to the Board of Ordnance. James was born on the 10th of February 1775, Horace not till the last day of 1779; and both were educated at Mr. Burford's School at Chigwell in Essex. Horace was trained in business in a merchant's office, went on the Stock Exchange, and had realized a competency by 1820 when he retired from business. He published a novel called 'The Runaway' in 1800, and from that time almost up to the time of his death he was engaged in literary pursuits. It was in 1812 that his brother and he found themselves famous by the publication of 'Rejected Addresses, or the New Theatrum Poetarum'; and that book was followed, in 1813, by their 'Horace in London'. Traces of Horace Smith's relations with Shelley occur in an anonymous work which he published in 1821-'Amarynthus, the Nympholept; a Pastoral Drama in three acts---with other Poems'; and Shelley recorded his opinion of Smith in the 'Letter to Maria Gisborne': Wit and sense, Virtue and human knowledge, all that might Make this dull world a business of delight, Are all combined in Horace Smith. Perhaps the most valued of Smith's single compositions outside the 'Rejected Addresses' is the admirable 'Address to a Mummy', in which true wit and true feeling are combined in a manner which Hood has lifted to the level of a high literary art. Smith seems to have met both Keats and Shelley for the first time on the same day in December 1816 at Hunt's cottage at Hampstead. Keats dined with Smith while his brothers were at Teignmouth, and from his one letter to him we learn that he found his 'Nehemiah Muggs' amusing. The tone of his letter (No. 32) to his brothers suggests that the company Smith kept did not attract him, and he did not pursue the intercourse. Smith died at Tunbridge Wells on the 12th of July 1849. It has been suggested that Mrs. Jeffrey and her daughters were family friends of the Keatses, and instrumental in bringing, first George and Thomas, and then John, to Teignmouth. This seems to me improbable from the terms in which Keats writes to his sister of having written to Miss Jeffrey. Letters 127 and 128 to Miss Jeffrey deal with the question of getting cheap lodgings near Teignmouth: in Letter 129 he tells his sister that he has 'written lately to some acquaintances in Devonshire'---not 'to our friends the Jeffreys'--- concerning a cheap lodging. Hence I judge that, when George and Tom went to Teignmouth, Mrs. Jeffrey and her daughters let their warm Devonshire hearts go out to the invalid boy and his youthful nurse scarce more than a lad, and when the poet came were equally kind to the elder brother, beloved by every one who met him. From the four letters numbered 65, 67, 127, and 128, I should judge that Mrs. Jeffrey had four daughters, Marian, Sarah, Fanny, and a young one who wore her hair down when the Keatses were at Teignmouth; but I have no distinct information about their names, apart from these letters, except about Sarah and Marian. I do not even know how many of them married, though it is on record that Sarah did not. She and Marian, who did marry, were still remembered at Teignmouth at the beginning of the present century by an old inhabitant or two; but I am not able to give dates of birth or death. Marian, concerning whom there is a local tradition that Keats 'was in love with her', was of a more or less romantic turn, ultimately married a Mr. Prowse, and lived at Torquay. Under her married name she published a book in 1830-'Poems by Mrs. I. S. Prowse'. It contains 183 pages, excluding the title, contents, &c., and including a seven-page list of subscribers in which appear the names of 'The Lady Noel Byron (4 copies)', Sir Egerton Bridges, Bart., and Keats's Teignmouth acquaintances, Captain Tonkin, Bickford Bartlett, Esq., and Miss Periman. Tradition will have it that the following lyric ('Si deseris pereo', pp. 156 and 157 of the book) was addressed to Keats on his departure with his dying brother in 1818: If thou canst bear to say adieu, To her who loves so warm, so true; If thou canst think thou mayst depart, Yet leave unbroken the young heart, Which gave to thee its earliest vow And lives but in thy presence now; Then quit thy love, thy bride---but know Si deseris, ah! pereo. Yet dearest go; the pang will be Soon o'er; I shall not live to see Thy look of love, which is my heaven My happiness---to others given; 'Tis best we part; I could not bear Thy coldness---nor the sick despair Of love decaying; go then, go, Si deseris, ah! pereo. I had a foolish hope---'tis gone: I thought thou might'st have lov'd alone The simple heart which clung to thee With more than Woman's constancy:--- 'Tis over---but I murmur not Nor dare I wish a happier lot--- To thee, to life farewell---for oh Si deseris, ah! pereo!--- Whether that song was for him or not, there is a clear reference to his untimely fate in a thoughtful poem standing first in the collection, and called 'Autumnal Musings'. After the sententious utterance--- Surely as the least wretched we must class, Those from th' unequal strife who earliest pass--- we have the following stanzas: No more of such a theme---it is not well For one who scarce hath struck the mighty lyre, Unthinkingly the dreary cry to swell Of victims to Opinion's breath of fire; What, tho' it did destroy their high desire? Yet unappall'd be the Muse still my choice, E'en tho' the grave sends forth a warning voice. Yea---from the grave a warning: one is there Who sought it as a refuge, when too late For health or peace, he found how falsely fair The hope that led him on to consecrate His heart unto the muse---and yet not hate, But scorn and laughter quenched his worthy pride, The minstrel's heart was stricken,---and he died. Yet died he not in vain; if, ere they rush To wreak their thoughtless malice on their kind, His fate may bid men ponder ere they crush The first aspirings of the Poet's mind; Spare the weak blossom future fruit to find, And leave to Time the perfecter to bring A plenteous Autumn from a tardy Spring. It is natural to think that Keats and his brothers had much intellectual converse with a girl who could think and write like this a little later on, and it seems likely enough that one of the brothers showed her the 'Floure and Lefe' sonnet in 'The Examiner', from which she would go to the old poem itself. This would account for her use of the Chaucerian stanza, so little in vogue at that time. There are more stanzas in which Keats is glanced at, according to the Teignmouth legend: More still the evening grew---the wither'd leaf Without once circling, fell unto the ground; 9 All living creatures sought in sleep relief From the unusual calmness brooding round; No longer did the wild bird's song resound; Darken'd the heavy night clouds o'er my head, 'Twas a fit hour to commune with the dead. The unforgotten!---I can people here This solitude with beings of the past; They whose departing made the world look drear, And the bright sunshine of our youth o'ercast With sorrow, which thro' lengthen'd years shall last: Lo! potent as of old the magian's wand, Fancy, has call'd up the pale shadowy band. After this, in one and the same page, we get a reminiscence of Keats's 'Lamia' (Book II, lines 229-38): Ye who tell With your philosophy, the rule and cause That shapes the rainbow--- and the passionate lines Oh could I hear e'en tho' my heart were riven Those well remembered accents once again--- It may not be---the wish the thought are vain, A mourner I, amid life's desert thrown To feel and suffer---live and die---alone! In 'Autumnal Musings', which was composed on Little Haldon, over-looking Teignmouth from a point close to what antiquarians tell us are the traces of an ancient Danish encampment, there are more striking passages than any of these I have quoted; but they are less germane to the present subject, and do not add to our biographical knowledge of the writer. From Tom Hood we learn that Mrs. Prowse contributed to the annuals, that her son, William Jeffrey Prowse, was born at Torquay on the 6th of May 1836, and that her husband died about 1844. Young Prowse became a writer of excellent vers de soci ete , was trained as a journalist by Thornton Leigh Hunt, joined the staff of 'The Daily Telegraph' in 1861, and died of consumption at Nice on Easter Sunday 1870. Although Mrs. Brawne is numbered among Keats's correspondents, there is but one letter to her; and there is little to record save that she was the widow of a Mr. Samuel Brawne, and came to Hampstead at the time when Dilke and Brown lived at Wentworth Place, bringing her three children, Fanny, Samuel, and Margaret; that, having taken Keats in when she was renting and residing in one of the Wentworth Place houses, and when he left Hunt's home suddenly on account of the opening of a letter by one of Hunt's servants, the good lady did her part in nursing him. Her end was tragic: she was burnt to death, by her dress having caught fire as she stood at the door of her house in Wentworth Place. She was buried at St. Martin-in-the-Fields on the Ist of December 1829. Fanny or Frances Brawne was born on the 9th of August 1800, and was therefore at the time of Thomas Keats's death, when she came prominently into Keats's life, over 18 years of age. The story of her relations with Keats appears very clearly and fully in the letters which will be found in the second half of this book. I am not among those who think otherwise than kindly and respectfully of her. I fully believe that she was warmly attached to Keats and mourned his loss long and bitterly. Time, the healer of most wounds, healed that of Fanny Brawne sufficiently to admit of her marriage when Keats had been twelve years dead. On the 15th of June 1833 at the Parish Church of St. Marylebone she became the wife of Mr. Louis Lindo, afterwards changed to Lindon, who was known to the public as one of the Secretaries of the 1851 Exhibition. 10 She herself was a woman of considerable character and attainment, though not known to the public. She was a contributor to Blackwood's Magazine; 11 and I have in my possession a manuscript tale called 'Nickel List', translated by her from the German, showing some literary skill. Her son, my friend Herbert Brawne-Lindon, and her daughter, Miss Margaret Lindon, held her memory in the highest respect and affection. She died on the 4th of December 1865. Her husband died on the 21st of October 1872, aged sixty; they lie in the same grave in Brompton Cemetery. In September 1821 Valentin Llanos appears to have called on Miss Brawne on his way to stay with a Mr. Wigram at Walthamstow, an incident possibly leading to the social events mentioned below. This Mr. Wigram was, no doubt, one of the twenty-three children of Sir Robert Wigram, Bart. (1744-1830), who owned Walthamstow House, one of the most considerable of the Walthamstow mansions of the eighteenth century. An entirely disinterested opinion of Fanny Brawne was brought to light in 1931 by Mr. Blunden, 12 and in view of the little that is known of her from contemporary sources it is desirable to give it here. The passages concerning her occur in the 'Life of Gerald Griffin Esq.' by his brother Dr. Daniel Griffin (London: 1843). Griffin (1803-40), poet, novelist, and playright, had come to London in 1823 and made the acquaintance of Valentin Llanos. On the 21st of June 1825 he wrote to his sister Lucy:---'I think it probable that I may some of these days become acquainted with the young sister of poor Keats the poet, as she is coming to spend some time with a friend of mine. If I do I will send you an account of her. My Spanish friend, Valentin Llanos, was intimate with him and spoke with him three days before he died. I am greatly interested about that family. Keats you must know was in love, and the lady whom he was to have married had he survived Gifford's (the butcher) review, attended him to the last. She is a beautiful young creature, but now wasted away to a skeleton, and will follow him shortly I believe. She and his sister say they have oft found him on suddenly entering the room, with that review in his hand, reading as if he would devour it---completely absorbed---absent and drinking it in like mortal poison. The instant he observed anybody near him however, he would throw it by, and begin to talk of some indifferent matter. The book displays great genius but unfortunately it afforded one or two passages capable of being twisted to the purpose of a malignant wretch of a reviewer such as Gifford is, with much effect.' A year later he wrote to his sister Ellen:---'I spent a very pleasant evening the other day, with the sister of John Keats--- his intended bride, (as beautiful, elegant and accomplished a girl as any---or more so than any I have seen here) and the husband of the former, who is an old friend of mine.' On July the 31st 1826, he expresses regret, 'as deeply as it is possible for me to say' that Llanos is going to France; but the friendship was maintained, and on January the 27th 1829, he wrote to Lucy Griffin:---'Dining the other day at my friend Llanos's, I met that Miss B---of whom I spoke to you some time since---sadly changed and worn, I thought, but still most animated---lively and even witty in conversation. She quite dazzled me in spite of her pale looks. Her sister was there, younger and prettier, but not so clever. If I were certain that the whole article were equal to the specimen given, how I should wish that my dear Lucy had such a friend and companion in her solitude! and how I should pity poor Keats!' Eleven months later Miss Brawne received a letter of a singularly harassing nature. It was addressed in Charles Brown's clerkly handwriting to 'Miss Brawne  Wentworth Place  Hampstead  near London', with 'Inghilterra' at the top and 'Angleterre' across the lower left-hand corner. It bore a 'Firenze' postmark without a date, and a London postmark, 'F.P.O. DE 29 1829'. This is what it contained:--- Florence. 17 December 1829. My dear Miss Brawne, Without any apology for our long silence, let me hope you are in the best health, that your mother is better, and that Margaret is never ailing; to which I add a merry Xmas and a happy new year to all. Now, with these good wishes, I may begin. A few days ago, I received a letter from the Galignani in Paris telling me they are on the eve of publishing the works of Keats, and asking for his autograph. I sent it to them, with a letter stating it was always my intention to write his life, and annex it to a Tragedy of his, together with some unpublished poems in my possession, whenever his countrymen should have learnt to value his poetry. I also told them I believed that time was arrived, as needs it must, sooner or later; but that I was fearful it was too late for me to enter into any arrangement with them. Whatever their answer may be, I am resolved to write his life, persuaded that no one, except yourself, knew him better. Leigh Hunt's account of him is worse than disappointing; I cannot bear it; it seems as if Hunt was so impressed by his illness, that he had utterly forgotten him in health. This is a dreadful mistake, because it is our duty to his memory to show the ruin his enemies had effected; and I will not spare them. It is not my present purpose to enter into any criticism on his works, but to let it be simply a biography; and, to make that as vivid as possible, I shall incorporate into it passages from letters to me, and to his brothers,--- which last are in my possession; together with passages from particular poems, or entire ones, relating to himself, always avoiding those which regard you, unless you let me know that I may, without mentioning your name, introduce them. There are, however, two of his letters which I wish to give entire; one written when he dispaired of Tom's recovery, the other when he dispaired of his own. This latter one is of the most painful description; therefore I wish it to be known, that Gifford and Lockhart may be thoroughly hated and despised. The question is whether you will object to it; I think you will not. Though much of it regards you, your name is never once mentioned. Then again, those poems addressed to you, which you permitted me to copy,---may I publish them? It is impossible for me to judge of your feelings on the subject; but whatever they are, you are certain that I shall obey them. To my mind, you ought to consent, as no greater honour can be paid to a woman than to be beloved by such a man as Keats. I am aware that, at a more recent period, you would have been startled at its being alluded to; but consider that eight years have now passed away; and now, no one, if you do not, can object to it. Besides, Hunt has alluded to you, and what more will it be to give his poems addressed to that lady? Your name will still remain as secret to the world as before. I shall of course scrupulously avoid intimating who you are, or in what part of England you reside. As his love for you formed so great a part of him, we may be doing him an injustice in being silent on it: Indeed something must be said especially as Hunt has said something. We live among strange customs; for had you been husband and wife, though but for an hour, every one would have thought himself at liberty publicly to speak of, and all about you; but as you were only so in your hearts, it seems, as it were, improper. Think of it in your best train for thinking, my dear Miss Brawne, and let me know your decision. I have turned it in my mind a great deal, and find nothing,---to confess the truth freely,--- against it. Three months ago I heard you were at Bruges, on a visit to your aunt; but I suppose you are, by this time, returned. Give my kindest remembrances to Mrs. Brawne and Margaret. Carlino and I lead very comfortable, happy, healthy lives, with short lessons, long walks, and, now and then, a game at romps, or a "ballo grande" at the Opera. Believe me always Your's most sincerely, Chas. Brown. Brown did not know that he was intruding with a subject disturbing enough at any time but more so to a woman whose nerves had been so recently shattered by her mother's dreadful death. Yet Miss Brawne's courage did not desert her. The same day she sat down to answer him. Her draft reply, for such I take to be the unfinished document now exhibited with Brown's letter in the Keats Museum, suggests to me an anguished heart and a mind distraught by the idea of her love for Keats being noised abroad. I give the draft, as I have given the poet's letters, as closely in accord with the holograph as print can make it. Hampstead Dec  r 29th 1829- 13 My dear Mr Brown As the aggressor I am too happy to escape the apologies I owe you on my long silence not gladly to take your hint and say nothing about it, the best reparation I can make is to answer your letter of today as soon as possible although I received it only this morning in the hours that have intervened before I sit down to answer it my feelings have entirely changed on the subject of the request it contains. Perhaps you will think I was opposed to it and am now come over to your side the question, but it just just the contrary had I answered your letter immediately [ ] I should have told you that I considered myself so entirely unconnected with Mr Keats except by my own feelings that nothing published respecting him could affect me, but I now see it differently. We have all our little world in which we figure and I cannot help expressing [ ] some disinclination at the idea [ ] that the few acquaintance I have should be able to obtain such [ ] a key to my sensations. [ ] Having said so much you will probably conclude that I mean to refuse your request. Perhaps when I assure you that though my opinion has changed my intention of complying [ ] in every respect with your wishes remains, you will think I am mentioning my objections to make a favor of my consent but indeed my dear Mr Brown if you do, you mistake me entirely. It is only to justifys[ ] myself I own that I state all I think. [ ] to you I [ ] am very grateful nor ought I to have gone so far without thanking you for your kindness and consideration in writing to me on the subject---[ ] I assure you I should not have hinted that your wishes were painful to me did I not feel [ ] the suffering myself to be even alluded to was [ ] a want of pride. So far am I from possessing overstrained delicacy that the circumstance of its being a ^[mere] love story is the least of my concern, on the contrary had I been his wife I should have felt my present reluctance would have been so much stronger that I think I must have made it my request that [ ] you would [ ] relinquish your intention. The only thing that saves me now is that so very few can know I am in any way implicated and that of those few [ ] I may hope the greater number may never see the book in Question. Do then entirely as you please and be assured that I comply with your wishes rather because they are yours than with the expectation of any good that can be done. I fear the kindest act would be to let him rest for ever in the obscurity to which unhappy [ ] circumstances ^ [have] condemned him. Will the writings that remain of his rescue him from it? You can tell better than I [ ] and are more [ ] impartial on the subject for my wish has long been that his name, his very name could be forgotten by every one but like [ ] To your publishing his poems addressed to me I do not see there can be any objection [2] after the subject has been once alluded to;[I] if you think them worthy of him. I entirely agree with you that if his life is to be published no part ought to be kept back [ ] for all you can show is his character, his life was too short and too unfortunate for any thing else. I have no doubt that his talents would have been great, not the less for their being devel &lstrike;oped [ ] rather late which I believe they was the case,[ ] all I fear is whether he has left enough to [ ] make people believe that. If I could think so I should consider[ ] it right to make that [ ] sacrifice to his reputation that I now do to your kind motives. Not that ^[even] the establishment of his fame would give me the pleasure it ought [ ]. Without claiming too much constancy for myself [ ] I may truly say that he is well- remembered by me and that satisfied with that I could wish no one but myself knew he had ever existed but I confess [ ] as he was so much calumniated and suffered so much from it, it is perhaps the duty of those who loved and valued him [ ] to vindicate him also, and if it [ ] can be done, all the friends that time has left him and I above all must [ ] be deeply indebted to I am glad you feel that Mr Hunt in gives him a weakness of character that ^[ ] only belonged to his ill health. Mr Hazlitt, if I remember rightly some remarks used five or six years ago is still more positive in fixing it on him. [ ] I should be glad if you could disprove I was a very poor judge of character ten years ago and [ ] probably overrated every good quality he had but surely they go too far on the other side. after all he was but four and twenty when his illness begun [ ] and he had gone through a great deal of vexation before ... There the draft, filling two quarto pages, ends. I do not know whether the fair copy is extant. At all events Miss Brawne tried her hand at the address on a section of the doublings of Brown's letter, beginning 'Al Signor' and leaving that to write 'Il Signor Charles Brown  Gentiluomo Inglesi  Firenze Italia'. Although Fanny Brawne had invited Fanny Keats to stay with her when George was in England, the two did not meet until after John's death, when they became close friends. Miss Brawne complied promptly with the request mentioned in John's farewell letter to his sister (No. 236), and the correspondence then begun lasted for many years, while in her letters to my father written between the years 1877 and 1889 Mrs. Llanos was still displaying interest in the Brawne family and sending messages to them. Samuel Brawne was born at Ealing on the 26th of July 1804 and died at Wentworth Place in April 1828. Margaret Brawne, who was born on the 19th of April 1809, married Chevalier Joao Antonio Pereira da Cunha at the English Episcopal Church at Dieppe on the 30th of November 1833; I have been unable to trace the date and place of her death. Since the above brief account of Fanny Brawne was first printed her letters to Fanny Keats have returned to Hampstead and are now in the Keats Museum. Should any sceptics still exist, they have only to read those letters, edited by the late Fred Edgcumbe and published by the Oxford University Press in London in 1936 and in New York in 1937, to be convinced of the absolute sincerity of Fanny Brawne's love for Keats. Thomas Monkhouse, who now appears for the first time among Keats's correspondents, came from a Penrith family and was born in 1783. In June 1820 he married Jane Horrocks, a daughter of the sometime Member of Parliament for Preston, and died of consumption at Clifton on 26 February 1825. He was a well-to-do London merchant carrying on business in Budge Row, and a kinsman by marriage of Wordsworth, who, with his wife and daughter, accompanied Mr. and Mrs. Monkhouse on their Continental wedding tour. Many references to Monkhouse may be found in the diary of Crabb Robinson, whom he numbered among his literary and artistic friends. Monkhouse was present at Haydon's 'immortal dinner', see Letter 34, and unpublished correspondence discloses that he was one of the unwary who lent the painter money. On hearing of his death Charles Lamb wrote to Sarah Hutchinson: 'No one will more feel it than Robinson, to whom I have written. No one more than he and we acknowledge the nobleness and worth of what we have lost. Words are perfectly idle'; and a little later to the same correspondent: 'It is a damp, I do assure you, amid all my prospects that I can receive none from a quarter upon which I had calculated, almost more than from any, upon receiving congratulations. I had grown to like poor M. more and more. I do not esteem a soul living or not living more warmly than I had grown to esteem and value him. But words are vain.' Who would not be proud to know that Lamb had written of him in such terms? I have gathered but few details of the life of William Mayor, to whom Letter 112 is addressed; I can find no record of him at Somerset House, and the Islington Parish Church registers and Lewis's 'History of Islington' while affording information about others of the same surname, and probably of the same stock, make no mention of this one. When Keats wrote to him in February 1819 he was apparently living with his family at Sebbons Buildings and the Islington rate-books for 1830 show a William Mayor living at No. 7 Sebbons Buildings and paying a rent of £54 a year, quite a considerable rental in those days. On 15 February 1821 Mayor became a pupil of B. R. Haydon (see Preface, p. xi), and Joseph Hogarth, the well-known print and picture dealer of Mount Street, writing of him after his death, says that in Haydon's studio he formed a friendship with his fellow-pupils, the Landseers, W. Bewick, and George Lance, and that 'his instruction under Haydon led him to see and appreciate the importance which drawings by the old masters were to one seeking information; and desiring to mature his judgment, he journeyed to the Continent'. From a letter addressed to him by Haydon 14 it appears that he was at Amsterdam with Edward Chatfield in August 1822 studying Rubens's pictures. After his return he was introduced to Sir Thomas Lawrence who, according to Hogarth, commended his discrimination and desired to possess some of the sketches he had bought, thereby influencing his whole future, 'for from that period, for half a century all but two years, he devoted his entire attention to this one pursuit'. In 1831 he began the publication of a 'Series of Fac-similes of original designs by the most eminent painters of the Italian, German, Spanish, Flemish, Dutch, French and English Schools' which he dedicated to the memory of Sir Thomas Lawrence. In 1871, when he was living at No. 6 Bayswater Hill, he published a catalogue of his collection which was reprinted after his death by his son, Edgar J. Mayor, in 1874 and again in 1875 when his pictures were sold, many of them passing into Sir Edward Poynter's collection. An amusing description of Mayor's personal appearance is given by Edmond de Goncourt in his 'Maison d'un Artiste' (Paris, 1881).

My Brain bewildered, and my Mind o'Er cast With Heaviness; in seasons, when I've thought No spherey strains,  16 by me, could e'er be caught From the blue Dome, though I to dimness Gaze On the far depth, where sheeted Lightning plays; Or, on the wavy Grass, outstretch'd supinely, Pry 'mong the Stars, to strive to think divinely: That I should never hear Apollo's song, Though feathery clouds were floating all along The purple West, and two bright Streaks between, The golden Lyre itself were faintly seen: That the still Murmur of the honey Bee, Would never teach a rural song to me: That the bright glance, from Beauty's Eyelids slanting, Would never make a lay of mine enchanting, Or warm my Breast with ardor, to unfold Some Tale of Love, and Arms, in times of old. But, there are times, when those who love the Bay, Glide from all sorrowing, far, far away: A sudden glow comes on them; nought they see In Water, Earth, or Air, but Poesy. It has been said, dear George, and true I hold it, (For Knightly Spenser to Libertas  17 told it,) That, when a Poet is in such a trance, In Air, he sees white Coursers, paw, and prance; Bestridden of gay Knights, in gay Apparel, Who, at each other tilt, in playful Quarrel; And, what we, ignorantly, sheet lightning, call, Is the swift opening of their wide Portal; When the bright Warder blows his Trumpet clear, Whose Tones reach nought on earth, but Poet's Ear. When these enchanted Portals open wide, And through the light, the horsemen swiftly glide; The Poet's eye can reach those golden Halls, And view the glory of their festivals: Their Ladies bright, that in the distance seem Fit for the silv'ring of a Seraphs dream: Their rich brimmed Goblets, that incessant run Like the bright spots that move about the Sun: And, when upheld, the Wine, from each bright Jar Pours with the lustre of a falling star. Yet further off, are dimly seen, their bowers, Of which, no mortal Eye can reach the Flowers; And 'Tis right just---for well Apollo knows 'Twould make the Poet quarrel with the Rose. All that's reveal'd from that far seat of Blisses, Is, the clear fountains, interchanging kisses As gracefully descending, light, and thin, Like silver streaks across a Dolphin's fin, When he upspringeth from the coral Caves, And sports, with half his Tail above the Waves. These Wonders strange, he sees, and many more, Whose head is pregnant with poetic lore. Should he upon an Evening ramble fare, With Forehead, to the soothing breezes, bare; Would he nought see, but the dark silent blue, With all its Diamonds trembling through, and through? Or the coy Moon, when in the waviness Of whitest Clouds, she doth her beauty dress, And staidly paces, higher up, and higher, Like a sweet Nun in Holyday Attire? Ah Yes! much more would start into his sight; The Revelries, and Mysteries of Night: And should I ever view them, I will tell ye Such Tales, as needs must with Amazement spell ye. These are the living pleasures of the Bard; But richer, far, Posterity's award. What does he murmer with his latest breath, While his proud Eye looks through the film of death? "What, though I leave this dull, and earthly mould, Yet, shall my spirit, lofty converse hold With after times---the Patriot shall feel My stern alarum, and unsheath his steel: Or in the senate, thunder out my Numbers, To startle Princes from their easy slumbers. The Sage will mingle with each moral Theme My happy thoughts, sententious: he will teem With lofty Periods, when my Verses fire him, And then I'll stoop from Heaven, to inspire him. Lays have I left, of such a dear delight, That Maids will sing them on their bridal Night. Gay Villagers, upon a Morn of May, When they have tired their gentle Limbs with play, And formed a snowy circle on the Grass; Placing in midst thereof, that happy Lass Who chosen is their Queen; with her fine head Crowned with flowers, purple, white, and red: For there the lily, and the Musk rose, sighing, Are emblems true of hapless Lovers dying. Between her Breasts, that never yet felt trouble, A bunch of Violets, full blown, and double, Serenely sleep. She from a Casket takes A Little Book, and then a Joy awakes About each youthful heart; with stifled Cries, And rubbing of white hands, and sparkling Eyes. For she's to read a Tale of Hopes, and fears; One that I fostered in my youthful Years. The Pearls, that on each glist'ning circlet sleep, Gush ever and anon with silent creep, Lured by the innocent Dimples. To sweet rest, Shall the dear Babe, upon its Mother's breast Be lull'd with songs of Mine. Fair world Adieu! Thy Dales, and Hills are fading from my view: Swiftly, I mount, upon widespreading Pinions, Far from the narrow bounds of thy Dominions. Full joy I feel, while thus I cleave the Air, That my soft Verse will charm thy Daughters fair, And warm thy Sons." Ah, my dear friend, and Brother! Could I, at once, my mad Ambition smother For tasting Joys like these; sure I should be Happier, and dearer to Society. At times 'tis true I've felt relief from pain, When some bright thought has darted through my brain: Through all that Day I've felt a greater Pleasure, Than if I'd brought to light a hidden Treasure. As to my Sonnets; though none else should heed them, I feel delighted, still, that you will read them. Of late, too, I have had much calm enjoyment; Stretched on the Grass, at my best lov'd employment Of scribbling Lines for you. These things I thought, While, in my face, the freshest Breeze I caught. E'en now, I'm pillow'd on a bed of Flowers, That crown a lofty Cliff, which proudly towers Above the Ocean Waves. The Stalks, and Blades Checquer my Tablet with their quivering shades.  18 On one side, is a field of drooping Oats; Through which the Poppies show their scarlet Coats; So pert, and useless, that they bring to Mind The scarlet Coats, that pester human kind. And on the other side, outspread, is seen Ocean's blue mantle, streak'd with purple &green. Now 'tis I see a Canvassed Ship, and now Mark the bright silver curling round her prow. I see the Lark down dropping to her Nest, And the broad winged Sea Gull, never at rest; For when no more he spreads his feathers free, His breast is dancing on the reastless Sea. Now I direct my Eyes towards the west, Which at this Moment, is in Sunbeams drest; Why westward turn? 'Twas but to say adieu! 'Twas but to kiss my hand dear George to you! As this may be kept for a fair Coppy I will write the three words I have time to do on the sheet  19 which will inclose this.

My dear Keats, Consider this letter a sacred secret---Often have I sat by my fire after a day's effort, as the dusk approached, and a gauzey veil seemed dimming all things---and mused on what I had done, and with a burning glow on what I would do till filled with fury I have seen the faces of the mighty dead crowd into my room, and I have sunk down &prayed the great Spirit that I might be worthy to accompany these immortal beings in their immortal glories, and then I have seen each smile as it passed over me, and each shake his hand in awful encouragement. My dear Keats, the Friends who surrounded me were sensible to what talent I had,---but no one reflected my enthusiasm with that burning ripeness of soul, my heart yearned for sympathy,--- believe me from my Soul in you I have (one) found one,---you add fire, when I am exhausted, &excite fury afresh---I offer my heart &intellect &experience---at first I feared your ardor might lead you to disregard the accumulated wisdom of ages in moral points---but the feelings put forth lately have delighted my soul---always consider principle of more value than genius---and you are safe---because on the score of genius, you can never be vehement enough. I have read your Sleep and Poetry---it is a flash of lightening that will round men from their occupations, and keep them trembling for the crash of thunder that will follow--- God bless you let our hearts be buried in each other B R Haydon 36  I'll be at Reynolds to night but latish March 1817- I confide these feelings to your honor.

So I shall soon be out of Town. You must soon bring all your present troubles to a close, and so must I, but we must, like the Fox, prepare for a fresh swarm of flies.

Address : To Mr J.H. Reynolds  19 Lambs Conduit Str  London. Postmarks : not recorded. Carisbrooke April 17th. My dear Reynolds, Ever since I wrote to my Brothers from Southampton I have been in a taking, and at this moment I am about to become settled, for I have unpacked my books, put them into a snug corner---pinned up Haydon---Mary Queen of Scotts, and Milton with his daughters in a row. In the passage I found a head of Shakspeare which I had not before seen. It is most likely the same that George spoke so well of; for I like it extremely. Well---this head I have hung over my Books, just above the three in a row, having first discarded a french Ambassador---now this alone is a good morning's work. Yesterday I went to Shanklin, which occasioned a great debate in my Mind whether I should live there or at Carisbrooke. Shanklin is a most beautiful place---sloping wood and meadow ground reaches round the Chine, which is a cleft between the Cliffs of the depth of nearly 300 feet at least. This cleft is filled with trees &bushes in the narrow parts; and as it widens becomes bare, if it were not for primroses on one side, which spread to the very verge of the Sea, and some fishermen's huts on the other, perched midway in the Ballustrades of beautiful green Hedges along their steps down to the sands.--- But the sea, Jack, the sea---the little waterfall---then the white cliff--- then St. Catherine's Hill---"the sheep in the meadows, the cows in the corn." ---Then, why are you at Carisbrooke? say you--- Because, in the first place, I shod be at twice the Expense, and three times the inconvenience---next that from here I can see your continent---from a little hill close by, the whole north Angle of the Isle of Wight, with the water between us. In the 3d place, I see Carisbrooke Castle from my window,  52 and have found several delightful wood-alleys, and copses, and quick freshes  53 . As for Primroses--- the Island ought to be called Primrose Island: that is, if the nation of Cowslips agree thereto, of which there are diverse Clans just beginning to lift up their heads and if an how the Rain holds whereby that is Birds eyes abate---Another reason of my fixing is that I am more in reach of the places around me---I intend to walk over the Island east---West--- North South---I have not seen many specimens of Ruins--- I dont think however I shall ever see one to surpass Carisbrooke Castle. The trench is o'ergrown with the smoothest turf, and the Walls with ivy---The Keep within side is one Bower of ivy---a Colony of Jackdaws have been there many years. I dare say I have seen many a descendant of some old cawer who peeped through the Bars at Charles the first, when he was there in Confinement. On the road from Cowes to Newport I saw some extensive Barracks which disgusted me extremely with Government for placing such a Nest of Debauchery in so beautiful a place---I asked a man on the coach about this---and he said that the people had been spoiled---In the room where I slept at Newport I found this on the Window "O Isle spoilt by the Mil a tary!" I must in honesty however confess that I did not feel very sorry at the idea of the Women being a little profligate---The wind is in a sulky  54 fit, and I feel that it would be no bad thing to be the favorite of some Fairy, who would give one the power of seeing how our Friends got on, at a Distance---I should like, of all Loves,  55 a sketch of you and Tom and George in ink which Haydon will do if you tell him how I want them---From want of regular rest, I have been rather narvus \---and the passage in Lear ---"Do you not hear the sea?"  56 \---has haunted me intensely. 57 It keeps eternal Whisperings around Desolate shores, and with its mighty swell Gluts twice ten thousand Caverns; till the spell Of Hecate  58 leaves them their old shadowy sound. Often 'tis in such gentle temper found That scarcely will the very smallest shell Be moved for days from whence it sometime fell When last the winds of Heaven were unbound. O ye who have your eyeballs vext and tir'd Feast them upon the wideness of the Sea O ye whose Ears are dinned with uproar rude Or fed too much with cloying melody--- Sit ye near some old Cavern's Mouth and brood Until ye start as if the Sea Nymphs quired--- April 18th Will you have the goodness to do this? Borrow a Botanical Dictionary---turn to the words Laurel and Prunus show the explanations to your sisters and Mrs Dilk e and without more ado let them send me the Cups Basket and Books they trifled and put off and off while I was in Town---ask them what they can say for themselves ---ask Mrs Dilke wherefore she does so distress me---Let me know how Jane has her health---the Weather is unfavorable for her.---Tell George and Tom to write.---I'll tell you what---on the 23rd was Shakespeare born---now if I should receive a Letter from you and another from my Brothers on that day 'twould be a parlous good thing--- Whenever you write say a Word or two on some Passage in Shakespeare that may have come rather new to you; which must be continually happening, notwithstandg that we read the same Play forty times---for instance, the following, from the Tempest, never struck me so forcibly as at present, "Urchins Shall, for that vast of Night that they may work, All exercise on thee---" How can I help bringing to your mind the Line--- In the dark backward and abysm of time. 59 I find that I cannot exist without poetry---without eternal poetry---half the day will not do---the whole of it---I began with a little, but habit has made me a Leviathan---I had become all in a Tremble from not having written any thing of late---the Sonnet over leaf did me some good. I slept the better last night for it---this Morning, however, I am nearly as bad again---Just now I opened Spencer, and the first Lines I saw were these.--- "The noble Heart that harbors virtuous thought, And is with Child of glorious great intent, Can never rest, until it forth have brought Th' eternal Brood of Glory excellent---"  60 Let me know particularly about Haydon; ask him to write to me about Hunt, if it be only ten lines---I hope all is well ---I shall forthwith begin my Endymion,  61 which I hope I shall have got some way into by the time you come, when we will read our verses in a delightful place I have set my heart upon near the Castle ---Give my Love to your Sisters severally---To George and Tom---Remember me to Rice Mr and Mrs Dilke and all we know--- Your sincere Friend John Keats.

Margate May 10th--- My dear Hunt, The little Gentleman that sometimes lurks in a gossips bowl ought to have come in very likeness of a coasted 62 crab and choaked me outright for not having answered your Letter ere this--- however you must not suppose that I was in Town to receive it; no, it followed me to the isle of Wight and I got it just as I was going to pack up for Margate, for reasons which you anon shall hear. On arriving at this treeless affair I wrote to my Brother George to request C. C. C.  63 to do the thing you wot of respecting Rimini; and George tells me he has undertaken it with great Pleasure; so I hope there has been an understanding between you for many Proofs--- ---C. C. C. is well acquainted with Bensley.  64 Now why did you not send the Key of your Cupboard which I know was full of Papers? We would have lock'd them all in a trunk together with those you told me to destroy; which indeed I did not do for fear of demolishing Receipts. There not being a more unpleasant thing in the world (saving a thousand and one others) than to pay a Bill twice. Mind you---old Wood's a very Varmant--- sharded in Covetousness---And now I am upon a horrid subject---what a horrid one you were upon last sunday and well you handled it.  65 The last Examiner was  a Battering Ram against Christianity---Blasphemy--- Tertullian---Erasmus---Sr. Philip Sidney. And then the dreadful Petzelians and their expiation by Blood---and do Christians shudder at the same thing in a Newspaper which they attribute to their God in its most aggravated form? What is to be the end of this? I must mention Hazlitt's Southey  66 O that he had left out the grey hairs! Or that they had been in any other Paper not concluding with such a Thunderclap---that sentence about making a Page of the feelings of a whole life appears to me like a Whale's back in the Sea of Prose. I ought to have said a word on Shakspeare's Christianity ---there are two, which I have not looked over with you, touching the thing: the one for, the other against. That in favor is in Measure for Measure Act 2. S. 2 Isab. Alas! alas! Why all the Souls that were, were forfeit once And he that might the vantage best have took, Found out the Remedy--- That against is in Twelfth Night. Act 3. S. 2. Maria---for there is no Christian, that means to be saved by believing rightly, can ever believe such impossible Passages of grossness! Before I come to the Nymphs I must get through all disagreeables---I went to the Isle of Wight---thought so much about Poetry so long together that I could not get to sleep at night---and moreover, I know not how it was, I could not get wholesome food---By this means in a Week or so I became not over capable in my upper Stories, and set off pell mell for Margate, at least 150 Miles---because forsooth I fancied that I should like my old Lodging here, and could contrive to do without Trees. Another thing I was too much in Solitude, and consequently was obliged to be in continual burning of thought as an only resource.  67 However Tom is with me at present and we are very comfortable. We intend though to get among some Trees.  68 How have you got on among them? How are the Nymphs?  69 I suppose they have led you a fine dance--- Where are you now. In Judea, Cappadocia, or the Parts of Lybia about Cyrene, Strangers from "Heaven, Hues and Prototypes. I wager you have given given several new turns to the old saying "Now the Maid was fair and pleasant to look on" as well as made a little variation in "once upon a time" perhaps too you have rather varied "thus endeth the first Lesson" I hope you have made a Horseshoe business of---"unsuperfluous lift" "faint Bowers" and fibrous roots. I vow that I have been down in the Mouth lately at this Work. These last two days however I have felt more confident---I have asked myself so often why I should be a Poet more than other Men,---seeing how great a thing it is,---how great things are to be gained by it ---What a thing to be in the Mouth of Fame---that at last the Idea has grown so monstrously beyond my seeming Power of attainment that the other day I nearly consented with myself to drop into a Phaeton---yet 'tis a disgrace to fail even in a huge attempt, and at this moment I drive the thought from me. I began my Poem about a Fortnight since and have done some every day except travelling ones ---Perhaps I may have done a good deal for the time but it appears such a Pin's Point to me that I will not coppy any out. When I consider that so many of these Pin points go to form a Bodkin point (God send I end not my Life with a bare Bodkin,  70 in its modern sense) and that it requires a thousand bodkins to make a Spear bright enough to throw any light to posterity---I see that nothing but continual uphill Journeying! Now is there any thing more unpleasant (it may come among the thousand and one)  71 than to be so journeying and miss the Goal at last. But I intend to whistle all these cogitations into the Sea where I hope they will breed Storms violent enough to block up all exit from Russia. Does Shelley go on telling strange Stories of the Death of Kings?  72 Tell him there are strange Stories of the death of Poets---some have died before they were conceived "how do you make that out Master Vellum".  73 Does Mrs. S. cut Bread and Butter as neatly as ever? Tell her to procure some fatal Scissors and cut the thread of Life of all to be disappointed Poets. Does Mrs Hunt tear linen in half as straight as ever? Tell her to tear from the book of Life all blank Leaves. Remember me to them all---to Miss Kent  74 and the little ones all. Your sincere friend John Keats alias Junkets--- You shall know where we move--- . Address : John Keats  Post Office---  Margate 11 May 1817 My dear Keats, I have been swearing to write you every hour this week---but have been so interrupted that the Post man has rang his bell every night in vain, with a sound that made my heart quake---I think you did quite right to leave the Isle of White if you felt no relief &being quite alone after study---you may now devote your eight hours a day with just as much seclusion as ever---Do not give way to any forebodings they are nothing more than the over eager anxieties of a great Spirit stretched beyond its strength, and then relapsing for a time to languid inefficiency---Every man of great views, is at times thus tormented--- but begin again where you left off---without hesitation or fear--- Trust in God with all your might my dear Keats---This dependance with your own energy will give you strength,  &hope &comfort---In all my troubles, &wants, &distresses, here I found a refuge---from my soul I declare to you, I never applied for help or consolation, or strength--- but I found it. I always arose with a refreshed fury---an iron clenched firmness, and chrystal piety of feeling, that sent me streaming on with a repulsive power against the troubles of life that attempted to stop me, as if I was a cannon shot, darting through feathers---never despair while there is this path open to you---by habitual exercise, you will have habitual intercourse, and constant companionship; and in every want, turn to the great Star of your hopes with a delightful confidence which will never be disappointed---I love you like my own Brother, beware for God's sake of the delusions and sophistications that is ripping up the talent and respectability of our Friend Leigh Hunt\---he will go out of the World the victim of his own weakness &the dupe of his own self delusions ---with the contempt of his enemies and sorrow of his Friends---the cause he undertook to support injured by his own neglect of character---his family disordered, his children neglected, himself, petted &his prospects ruined!--- of this I am sure and keep this letter and you will find this is so---I speak this in confidence & pain---I write this at breakfast---for I am able to work like a hero---and wish to God you would come up to Town for a day or two when you are inclined---that I may put your head in with glory &honor--- I have rubbed in Wordsworth's &advanced the whole---God bless you My dear Keats go on, dont despair, collect incident, study characters, read Shakespeare and trust in Providence---and you will do---you must, you shall  \---  75 Address : Benjamin Robert Haydon  41 Great Marlborough Street  London--- Postmarks : MARGATE and 13 MY 1817. Margate Saturday Eve My dear Haydon, Let Fame, which all hunt after in their Lives, Live register'd upon our brazen tombs, And so grace us in the disgrace of death: When spite of cormorant devouring time The endeavour of this present breath may buy That Honor which shall bate his Scythe's keen edge And make us heirs of all eternity.  76 To think that I have no right to couple myself with you in this speech would be death to me me so I have e'en written it---and I pray God that our brazen Tombs be nigh neighbors. It cannot be long first the endeavor of this present breath will soon be over---and yet it is as well to breathe freely during our sojourn---it is as well if you have not been teased with that Money affair--- that bill-pestilence. However I must think that difficulties nerve the Spirit of a Man---they make our Prime Objects a Refuge as well as a Passion. The Trumpet of Fame is as a tower of Strength the ambitious bloweth it and is safe. I suppose by your telling me not to give way to forebodings George has mentioned to you what I have lately said in my Letters to him---truth is I have been in such a state of Mind as to read over my Lines and hate them. I am "one that gathers Samphire dreadful trade"  77 the Cliff of Poesy Towers above me---yet when, Tom who meets with some of Pope's Homer in Plutarch's Lives reads some of those to me they seem like Mice 78 to mine. I read and write about eight hours a day. There is an old saying well begun is half done" ---'tis a bad one. I would use instead---Not begun at all till half done" so according to that I have not begun my Poem and consequently (a priori) can say nothing about it. Thank God! I do begin arduously where I leave off, notwithstanding occasional depressions: and I hope for the support of a High Power while I clime this little eminence  79 and especially in my Years of more momentous Labor. I remember your saying that you had notions of a good Genius presiding over you. I have of late had the same thought---for things which I do half at Random are afterwards confirmed by my judgment in a dozen features of Propriety. Is it too daring to Fancy Shakspeare this Presidor? When in the Isle of Whight I met with a Shakspeare in the Passage of the House at which I lodged---it comes nearer to my idea of him than any I have seen---I was but there a Week yet the old Woman 80 made me take it with me though I went off in a hurry  81 \---Do you not think this is ominous of good? I am glad you say every Man of great Views is at times tormented as I am--- Sunday Aft . This Morning I received a letter from George by which it appears that Money Troubles are to follow us up for some time to come perhaps for always---these vexations are a great hindrance to one---they are not like Envy and detraction stimulants to further exertion as being immediately relative and reflected on at the same time with the prime object---but rather like a nettle leaf or two in your bed. So now I revoke my Promise of finishing my Poem by the Autumn which I should have done had I gone on as I have done--- but I cannot write while my spirit is fevered in a contrary direction and I am now sure of having plenty of it this Summer. At this moment I am in no enviable Situation---I feel that I am not in a Mood to write any to day; and it appears that the loss of it is the beginning of all sorts of irregularities. I am extremely glad that a time must come when every thing will leave not a wrack behind.  82 You tell me never to despair---I wish it was as easy for me to observe the saying---truth is I have a horrid Morbidity of Temperament which has shown itself at intervals---it is I have no doubt the greatest Enemy and stumbling block I have to fear---I may even say that it is likely to be the cause of my disappointment. However every ill has its share of good---this very bane would at any time enable me to look with an obstinate eye on the Devil Himself---ay to be as proud of being the lowest of the human race as Alfred could be in being of the highest. I feel confident I should have been a rebel Angel had the opportunity been mine. I am very sure that you do love me as your own Brother---I have seen it in your continual anxiety for me---and I assure you that your wellfare and fame is and will be a chief pleasure to me all my Life. I know no one but you who can be fully sensible of the turmoil and anxiety, the sacrifice of all what is called comfort the readiness to Measure time by what is done and to die in 6 hours could plans be brought to conclusions---the looking upon the Sun the Moon the Stars, the Earth and its contents as materials to form greater things---that is to say ethereal things ---but here I am talking like a Madman greater things that our Creator himself made!! I wrote to Hunt yesterday---scarcly know what I said in it. I could not talk about Poetry in the way I should have liked for I was not in humor with either his or mine. His self delusions are very lamentable they have inticed him into a Situation which I should be less eager after than that of a galley Slave---what you observe thereon is very true must be in time. Perhaps it is a self delusion to say so---but I think I could not be be deceived in the Manner that Hunt is---may I die tomorrow if I am to be. There is no greater Sin after the 7 deadly than to flatter oneself into an idea of being a great Poet---or one of those beings who are privileged to wear out their Lives in the pursuit of Honor---how comfortable a feel it is that such a Crime must bring its heavy Penalty? That if one be a Selfdeluder accounts will be balanced? I am glad you are hard at Work---'t will now soon be done---I long to see Wordsworth's as well as to have mine in:  83 but I would rather not show my face in Town till the end of the Year---if that will be time enough---if not I shall be disappointed if you do not write for me even when you think best. I never quite despair and I read Shakspeare--- indeed I shall I think never read any other Book much---Now this might lead me into a long Confab but I desist. I am very near Agreeing with Hazlit that Shakspeare is enough for us---By the by what a tremendous Southean Article his last was---I wish he had left out "grey hairs" It was very gratifying to meet your remarks of the Manuscript  84 \---I was reading Anthony and Cleopatra when I got the Paper and there are several Passages applicable to the events you commentate. You say that he arrived by degrees and not by any single struggle to the height of his ambition---and that his Life had been as common in particulars as other Mens. Shakspeare makes Enobarb say--- Where's Antony Eros ---He's walking in the garden---thus: and spurns the rush that lies before him; cries fool, Lepidus! In the same scene we find: "let determined things to destiny hold unbewailed their way." Dolabella says of Antony's Messenger "An argument that he is pluck'd when hither He sends so poor a pinion of his wing"---Then again, Eno---"I see Men's Judgments are A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward Do draw the inward quality after them, To suffer all alike"---The following applies well to Bertram  85 "Yet he that can endure To follow with alegience a fallen Lord, Does conquer him that did his Master conquer, And earns a place i' the story" But how differently does Buonap bear his fate from Antony! 'Tis good too that the Duke of Wellington has a good Word or so in the Examiner. A Man ought to have the Fame he deserves---and I begin to think that detracting from him as well as from Wordsworth is the same thing. I wish he had a little more taste---and did not in that respect "deal in Lieutenantry". 86 You should have heard from me before this---but in the first place I did not like to do so before I had got a little way in the 1st Book and in the next as G.  87 told me you were going to write I delayed till I had heard from you. Give my Respects the next time you write to the North and also to John Hunt---  88 Remember me to Reynolds and tell him to write---Ay, and when you sent Westward tell your Sister that I mentioned her in this---So now in the Name of Shakespeare Raphael and all our Saints I commend you to the care of heaven!

A Couple of Duns that I thought would be silent till the beginning, at least, of next Month (when I am certain to be on my legs for certain sure) have opened upon me with a cry most "untunable;" never did you hear such un "gallant chiding"  96 Now you must know I am not desolate but have thank God 25 good Notes in my fob ---but then you know I laid them by to write with and would stand at Bay a fortnight ere they should grab me. In a Month's time I must pay--- but it would relieve my Mind if I owed you instead of these Pelican duns.  97 I am affraid you will say I have "wound about with circumstance"  98 when I should have asked plainly. However as I said I am a little maidenish or so---and I feel my virginity come strong upon me---the while I request the loan of a £20 and a £10-which if you would enclose to me I would acknowledge and save myself a hot forehead. I am sure you are confident in my responsibility---and in the sense of squareness that is always in me.

Address : Miss Keats  Miss Kaley's School  Walthamstow  Essex--- Postmark : OXFORD 12 SE 1817. 104 Oxford Septr 10th My dear Fanny, Let us now begin a regular question and answer--- a little pro and con; letting it interfere as a pleasant method of my coming at your favorite little wants and enjoyments, that I may meet them in a way befitting a brother. We have been so little together since you have been able to reflect on things that I know not whether you prefer the History of King Pepin to Bunyan's Pilgrims Progress--- or Cinderella and her glass slipper to Moor's Almanack. 105 However in a few Letters I hope I shall be able to come at that and adapt my scribblings to your Pleasure. You must tell me about all you read if it be only six Pages in a Week ---and this transmitted to me every now and then will procure you full sheets of Writing from me pretty frequently ---This this I feel as a necessity: for we ought to become intimately acquainted, in order that I may not only, as you grow up love your as my only Sister, but confide in you as my dearest friend. When I saw you last I told you of my intention of going to Oxford and 'tis now a Week since I disembark'd from his Whipship's Coach the Defiance in this place. I am living in Magdalen Hall on a visit to a young Man with whom I have not been long acquainted, but whom I like very much---we lead very industrious lives he in general$ Studies and I in proceeding at a pretty good rate with a Poem which I hope you will see early in the next year.  106 Perhaps you might like to know what I am writing about. I will tell you. Many Years ago there was a young handsome Shepherd who fed his flocks on a Mountain's Side called Latmus--- he was a very contemplative sort of a Person and lived solitary among the trees and Plains little thinking---that such a beautiful Creature as the Moon was growing mad in Love with him---However so it was; and when he was asleep on the Grass, she used to come down from heaven and admire him excessively from a long time; and at last could not refrain from carrying him away in her arms to the top of that high Mountain Latmus while he was a dreaming---but I dare [ ] say you 107 have read this and all the other beautiful Tales which have come down from the ancient times of that beautiful Greece. If you have not let me know and I will tell you more at large of others quite as delightful. This Oxford I have no doubt is the finest City in the world---it is full of old Gothic buildings---Spires---towers--- Quadrangles---Cloisters Groves &c. and is surrounded with more clear streams than ever I saw together. I take a Walk by the Side of one of them every Evening and thank God, we have not had a drop of rain these many days. I had a long and interesting Letter from George, cross lines by a short one from Tom yesterday dated Paris. They both send their loves to you. Like most Englishmen they feel a mighty preference for every thing English---the french Meadows the trees the People the Towns the Churches, the Books the every thing---although they may be in themselves good: yet when put in comparison with our green Island they all vanish like Swallows in October. They have seen Cathedrals Manuscripts, Fountains, Pictures, Tragedy Comedy,--- with other things you may by chance meet with in this Country such as Washerwomen, Lamp-lighters, Turnpikemen Fish Kettles, Dancing Masters, Kettle drums, Sentry Boxes, Rocking Horses &c. and, now they have taken them over a set of boxing gloves. I have written to George and requested him, as you wish I should, to write to you. I have been writing very hard lately even till an utter incapacity came on, and I feel it now about my head: so you must not mind a little out of the way sayings---though bye the bye where my brain as clear as a bell I think I should have a little propensity thereto. I shall stop here till I have finished the 3rd Book of my Story; which I hope will be accomplish'd in at most three Weeks from to day---about which time you shall see me. How do you like Miss Taylor's essays in Rhyme  108 \---I just look'd into the Book and it appeared to me suitable to you--- especially since I remember your liking for those pleasant little things the Original Poems---the essays are the more mature production of the same hand. While I was speaking about france it occurred to me to speak a few Words on their Language---it is perhaps the poorest one ever spoken since the jabbering in the Tower of Babel, and when you come to know that the real use and greatness of a Tongue is to be referred to its Literature---you will be astonished to find how very inferior it is to our native Speech---I wish the Italian would supersede french in every School throughout the Country for that is full of real Poetry and Romance of a kind more fitted for the Pleasure of Ladies than perhaps our own---It seems that the only end to be gained in acquiring french is the immense accomplishment of speaking it---it is none at all--- a most lamentable mistake indeed. Italian indeed would sound most musically from Lips which had began to pronounce it as early as french is cramne'd down our Mouths, as if we were young Jackdaws at the mercy of an overfeeding Schoolboy. Now Fanny you must write soon---and write all you think about, never mind what ---only let me have a good deal of your writing---You need not do it all at once---be two or three or four days about it, and let it be a diary of your little Life. You will preserve all my Letters and I will secure yours---and thus in the course of time we shall each of us have a good Bundle---which, hereafter, when things may have strangely altered and god knows what happened, we may read over together and look with pleasure on times past---that now are to come. Give my Respects to the Ladies---and so my dear Fanny I am ever Your most affectionate Brother John If you direct---Post Office Oxford---your Letter will be brought to me--- No address or postmark. 109 My dear Jane, You must not expect that your Porcupine quill is to be shot at me with impunity---without you mean to question the existance of the Pyramids or rout Sir Isaac Newton out of his Coffin. If I did not think you had a kind of preference yourself for Juliet I would not say a word more about it---but as I know people love to be reminded of those they most love---'t is with me a certain thing that you are merely fishing for a little proing and conning thereon---As for your accusations I perhaps may answer them like Haydon in a Postcript---. If you go on at this rate I shall always have you in my imagination side by side with Bailey's Picture of Jeremy Taylor  110 who always looks as if he were going to hit me a rap with a Book he holds in a very threatning position My head is always in imminent danger---However with the armour of words and the Sword of Syllables  111 I hope to attack you in a very short time more at length--- My love to Marianne Your's sincerely John Keats. Address : Miss Reynolds---  Mrs Earle  Little Hampton. Postmark : OXFORD 15 SE 1817. Oxford Sunday Evening My dear Jane, You are such a literal translator that I shall some day amuse myself with looking over some foreign sentences and imagining how you would render them into english. This is an age for typical curiosities and I would advise you, as a good speculation, to study Hebrew and astonish the world with a figurative version in our native tongue. 'The Mountains skipping like Rams and the little Hills like Lambs'  112 you will leave as far behind as the Hare did the Tortoise. It must be so or you would never have thought that I really meant you would like to pro and con about those Honeycombs  113 \---no, I had no such idea, or if I had 'twould be only to tease you a little for Love. So now let me put down in black and white briefly my sentiment thereon. Imprimis---I sincerely believe that Imogen is the finest Creature; and that I should have been disappointed at hearing you prefer Juliet. Item Yet I feel such a yearning towards Juliet and that I would rather follow her into Pandemonium than Imogen into Paradize---heartily wishing myself a Romeo to be worthy of her and to hear the Devils quote the old Proverb---'Birds of a feather flock together"---Amen. Now let us turn to the Sea Shore. Believe me, my dear Jane it is a great Happiness to me that you are in this finest part of the year, winning a little enjoyment from the hard World---in truth the great Elements we know of are no mean Comforters---the open Sky sits upon our senses like a Sapphire Crown---the Air is our Robe of State---the Earth is our throne and the Sea a mighty Minstrell playing before it---able like David's Harp to charm the evil Spirit from such Creatures as I am---able like Ariel's to make such a one as you forget almost the tempest-cares of Life. I have found in the Ocean's Musick--- varying (though selfsame) more than the passion of Timotheus,  114 an enjoyment not to be put into words and "though inland far I be"  115 I now hear the voice most audibly while pleasing myself in the Idea of your Sensations. Marianne is getting well apace and if you have a few trees and a little Harvesting about you, I'll snap my fingers in Lucifer's eye. I hope you bathe too---if you do not I earnestly recommend it---bathe thrice a Week and let us have no more sitting up next Winter. Which is the best of Shakspeare's Plays? I mean in what mood and with what accompenament do you like the Sea best? It is very fine in the morning when the Sun "opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams Turns into yellow gold his salt Sea Streams"  116 and superb when "The sun from meridian height Illumines the depth of the sea, and the fishes beginning to sweat Cry damn it how hot we shall be" and gorgeous when the fair planet hastens---"to his home within the western foam" but don't you think there is something extremely fine after sunset, when there are a few white Clouds about and a few stars blinking---when the the waters are ebbing and the Horison a Mystery? This state of things has been so fulfilling to me that I am anxious to hear whether it is a favorite with you ---so when you and Marriann club your Letter to me put in a word or two about it. I am glad that you will spend a little time with the Dilkes---tell Dilke that it would be perhaps as well if he left a Pheasant or Partridge alive here and there to keep up a supply of Game for next season---tell him to rein in if possible all the Nimrod of his disposition, he being a mighty hunter before the Lord---of the Manor. Tell him to shoot far and not have at the poor devils in a furrow ---when they are flying he may fire and nobody will be the wiser. Give my sincerest Respects to Mrs Dilke saying that I have not forgiven myself for not having got her the little Box of Medicine I promised for her after dinner flushings. and that had I remained at Hampstead I would have made precious havoc with her house and furniture--- drawn a great harrow over her garden---poisoned Boxer--- eaten her Cloathes pegs,---fried her Cabbages fricaceed (how is it spelt?) her radishes--- ragouted her Onions--- belaboured her beat root---outstripped her Scarlet Runners ---parlezvou'd with her french Beans---devoured her Mignon or Mignonette---metamorphosed her Bell handles ---splinterd her looking glasses ---bullock'd at her cups and Saucers---agonized her decanters---put old Philips  117 to pickle in the Brine-tub---disorganized her Piano---dislocated her Candlesticks---emptied her wine bins in a fit of despair---turned out her Maid to Grass and Astonished Brown---whose Letter to her on these events I would rather see than the original copy of the Book of Genesis. Should you see Mr W. Dilke. remember me to him--- and to little Robinson Crusoe  118 \---and to Mr Snook--- Poor Bailey scarcely ever well has gone to bed very so so, and pleased that I am writing to you. To your Brother John (whom henceforth I shall consider as mine) and to you my dear friends Marriann and Jane I shall ever feel grateful for having made known to me so real a fellow as Bailey. He delights me in the Selfish and (please God) the disinterrested part of my disposition. If the old Poets have any pleasure in looking down at the Enjoyers of their Works, their eyes must bend with double satisfaction upon him---I sit as at a feast when he is over them and pray that if after my death any of my Labours should be worth saving, they may have as "honest a Chronicler"  119 as Bailey. Out of this his Enthusiasm in his own pursuit and for all good things is of an exalted kind---worthy a more healthful frame and an untorn Spirit. He must have happy years to come---he shall not die by God  120 \---A Letter from John the other day was a chief Happiness to me. I made a little mistake when just now I talked of being far inland: how can that be when Endymion and I are at the bottom of the Sea?  121 Whence I hope to bring him in safety before you leave the Sea Side and if I can so contrive it you shall be greeted by him on the Sands and he shall tell you all his adventures: which having finished he shall thus proceed. "My dear Ladies, favorites of my gentle Mistress, how ever my friend Keats may have teazed and vexed you believe me he loves you not the less ---for instance I am deep in his favor and yet he has been hawling me through the Earth and Sea with unrelenting Perseverence. I know for all this that he is mightily fond of me, by his contriving me all sorts of pleasures---nor is this the least fair Ladies---this one of meeting you on desert Shore and greeting you in his Name. He sends you moreover this little scroll"--- My dear Girls,     (Remberances to little Britain) I send you per favor of Endymion the assurance of my esteem of you and my utmost wishes for your Health and Pleasure---being ever--- Your affectionate Brother--- John Keats--- George and Tom are well--- Address : Mr J. H. Reynolds.  Little Britain  Christs Hospital  London. Postmark : not recorded. Oxford Sunday Morn My dear Reynolds, So you are determined to be my mortal foe---draw a Sword at me, and I will forgive---Put a Bullet in my Brain, and I will shake it out as a dew-drop from the Lion's Mane  122 ; ---put me on a Gridiron and I will fry with great complancency ---but, oh horror! to come upon me in the shape of a Dun! Send me bills! As I say to my Taylor send me Bills and I'll never employ you more---However, needs must when the devil drives: and for fear of "before and behind Mr Honeycomb"  123 I'll proceed. I have not time to elucidate the forms and shapes of the grass and trees; for, rot it! I forgot to bring my mathematical case with me; which unfortunately contained my triangular Prism so that the hues of the grass cannot be dissected for you--- For these last five or six days, we have had regularly a Boat on the Isis, and explored all the streams about, which are more in number than your eye lashes. We sometimes skim into a Bed of rushes, and there become naturalized riverfolks,---there is one particularly nice nest which we have christened "Reynolds's Cove," in which we have read Wordsworth and talked as may be. I think I see you and Hunt meeting in the Pit.---What a very pleasant fellow he is, if he would give up the sovereignty of a Room pro bono---What Evenings we might pass with him, could we have him from Mrs H---Failings I am always rather rejoiced to find in a Man than sorry for; they bring us to a Level---He has them,---but then his makes-up are very good. He agrees with the Northern Poet in this, "He is not one of those who much delight to season their fireside with personal talk"---I must confess however having a little itch that way, and at this present I have a few neighbourly remarks to make---The world, and especially our England, has, within the last thirty years been vexed and teazed by a set of Devils, whom I detest so much that I almost hunger after an acherontic promotion to a Torturer, purposely for their accommodation. These Devils are a set of Women, who having taken a snack or Luncheon of Literary scraps, set themselves up for towers of Babel in Languages Sapphos in Poetry---Euclids in Geometry---and everything in nothing. Among such the name of Montague  124 has been preeminent. The thing has made a very uncomfortable impression on me. ---I had longed for some real feminine Modesty in these things, and was therefore gladdened in the extreme on opening the other day one of Bayley's Books---a Book of Poetry written by one beautiful Mrs Philips, a friend of Jeremy Taylor's, and called "the matchless Orinda"  125 \---You must have heard of her, and most likely read her Poetry---I wish you have not, that I may have the pleasure of treating you with a few stanzas--- I do it at a venture.---You will not regret reading them once more. The following to her friend Mrs M. A.  126 at parting you will judge of. I have examined and do find, Of all that favour me There's none I grieve to leave behind But only, only thee To part with thee I needs must die Could parting sep'rate thee and I. But neither chance nor Compliment Did element our Love; 'Twas sacred sympathy was lent Us from the Quire above. That friendship fortune did create, Still fears a wound from time or fate. Our chang'd and mingled souls are grown To such acquaintance now, That if each would resume her own, Alas! we know not how. We have each other so engrost, That each is in the union lost And thus we can no absence know Nor shall we be confin'd; Our active souls will daily go To learn each others mind. Nay, should we never meet to sense, Our souls would hold intelligence. Inspired with a flame divine I scorn to court a stay; For from that noble soul of thine I ne'er can be away. But I shall weep when thou dost grieve Nor can I die whilst thou dost live By my own temper I shall guess At thy felicity, And only like my happiness Because it pleaseth thee. Our hearts at any time will tell If thou, or I be sick or well. All honour sure I must pretend, All that is good or great; She that would be Rosania's friend,  127 Must be at least compleat, If I have any Bravery, 'Tis cause I have so much of thee.' Thy Leiger Soul in me shall lie, And all thy thoughts reveal; Then back again with mine shall flie And thence to me shall steal. Thus still to one another tend; Such is the sacred name of friend. Thus our twin Souls in one shall grow, And teach the world new Love, Redeem the age and sex, and show A Flame Fate dares not move: And courting death to be our friend, Our Lives together too shall end A Dew shall dwell upon our Tomb Of such a Quality That fighting Armies thither come Shall reconciled be. We'll ask no Epitaph, but say Orinda and Rosannia In other of her Poems there is a most delicate fancy of the Fletcher Kind--- which we will con over together: So Haydon is in Town---I had a letter from him yesterday--- We will contrive as the Winter comes on---but that is neither here nor there. Have you heard from Rice? Has Martin  128 met with the Cumberland Beggar  129 or been wondering at the old Leech gatherer?  130 Has he a turn for fossils? that is, is he capable of sinking up to his Middle in a Morass? I have longed to peep in and see him at supper after some tolerable fatigue. How is Hazlitt? We were reading his Table  131 last night. I know he thinks himself not estimated by ten People in the World ---I wish he knew he is---I am getting on famous with my third Book---have written 800 lines thereof, and hope to finish it next Week--- Bailey likes what I have done very much  132 \---Believe me, my dear Reynolds, one of my chief layings-up is the pleasure I shall have in showing it to you, I may now say, in a few days---I have heard twice from my Brothers; they are going on very well, and send their Remembrances to you. We expected to have had notices from little Hampton this morning---we must wait till Tuesday. I am glad of their Days with the Dilkes. You are I know very much teased in that precious London, and want all the rest possible; so shall be content with as brief a scrall---a Word or two, till there comes a pat hour--- Send us a few of your Stanzas to read in "Reynolds's cove." Give my Love and respects to your Mother and remember me kindly to all at home. Yours faithfully John Keats I have left the doublings for Bailey  133 who is going to say that he will write to you to morrow ... Wordsworth sometimes, though in a fine way, gives us sentences in the style of school exercises---For instance, The lake doth glitter Small birds twitter &c.  134 Now, I think this is an excellent method of giving a very clear description of an interesting place such as Oxford is--- The Gothic looks solemn--- The plain Doric column Supports an old Bishop & Crosier; The mouldering arch, Shaded o'er by a larch, Lives next door to Wilson the Hosier Vice\---that is, by turns--- O'er pale visages mourns The black tassell trencher or common hat: The Chauntry boy sings, The Steeple-bell rings, And as for the Chancellor--- dominat. There are plenty of trees, And plenty of ease, And plenty of fat deer for Parsons; And when it is venison Short is the benison,--- Then each on a leg or thigh fastens. My dear Keats, I am delighted to hear you are getting on with your Poem, success to it and to you with all my heart & soul and liver---will you oblige me by going to Magdalen College, and ask for the Porter---and will you enquire of him about a Young Man who was copying when I was at Oxford the Altar piece there by Moralez.---I am anxious to know about that Young Man, the copy promised something---will you if you can see the Young Man, and ascertain what his wishes in Art are \---if he has ambition , if he seems to possess power---if he wishes to be great \---all of which you can soon see---In these cases should any friend be disposed to assist him up to London  & to support him for a Year I'll train him in the Art, with no other remuneration but the pleasure of seeing him advance---I'll put him in the right way, and do every thing to advance him--- read this part of the letter to the Porter \--- and do oblige me by exerting your Yourself---perhaps Mr. Bailey will also feel an interest---give my kind remembrance to him. Sp. 17. 1817- Yours ever, Dear Keats--- B. R. Haydon Address : B. R. Haydon  41 Great Marlborough Street  London Postmark : OXFORD 28 SE 1817. Oxford Septr 28th My dear Haydon, I read your last to the young Man whose Name is Crips.  135 He seemed more than ever anxious to avail himself of your offer. I think I told you we asked him to ascertain his Means. He does not possess the Philosophers stone---nor Fortunatus' purse, nor Gyges' ring---but at Bailey's suggestion, whom I assure you is a very capital fellow, we have stummed  136 up a kind of contrivance whereby he will be enabled to do himself the benifits you will lay in his Path. I have a great Idea that he will be a tolerable neat brush. 'Tis perhaps the finest thing that will befal him this many a year: for he is just of an age to get grounded in bad habits from which you will pluck him. He brought a Copy of Mary Queen of Scotts---it appears to me that he has coppied the bad style of the painting as well as couloured the eyeballs yellow like the original. He has also the fault that you pointed out to me in Hazlitt ---on the constringing and diffusing of substance.  137 However I really believe that he will take fire at the sight of your Picture---and set about things. If he can get ready in time to return to Town with me which will be in a few days---I will bring him to you. You will be glad to hear that within these last three weeks I have written 1000 lines ---which are the third Book of my Poem. My Ideas with respect to it I assure you are very low---and I would write the subject thoroughly again---but I am tired of it and think the time would be better spent in writing a new Romance which I have in my eye for next Summer---Rome was not built in a Day---and all the good I expect from my employment this summer is the fruit of Experience which I hope to gather in my next Poem.  138 Bailey's kindest wishes and my vow of being Yours eternally. John Keats--- Address : Mr. B. Bailey  Magdalen Hall.  Oxford. Postmark : 8 OCT 1817. Hamps tead Octr Wednesday. My dear Bailey, After a tolerable journey, I went from Coach to Coach to as far as Hampstead where I found my Brothers---the next Morning finding myself tolerably well I went to Lambs Conduit Street and delivered your Parcel---Jane and Marianne were greatly improved Marianne especially she has no unhealthy plumpness in the face---but she comes me healthy and angular to the Chin---I did not see John--- I was extremely sorry to hear that poor Rice, after having had capital Health during his tour, was very ill. I dare say you have heard from him. From No 19 I went to Hunt's and Haydon's who live now neighbours. Shelley was there. I know nothing about anything in this part of the world---every Body seems at Loggerheads. There's Hunt infatuated---there's Haydon's Picture in statu quo. There's Hunt walks up and down his painting room criticising every head most unmercifully. There's Horace Smith tired of Hunt.  139 The web of our Life is of mingled Yarn."  140 Haydon having removed entirely from Marlborough Street Crips must direct his Letter to Lisson Grove North---Paddington. Yesterday Morning while I was at Brown's in came Reynolds---he was pretty bobbish we had a pleasant day---but he would walk home at night that cursed cold distance. Mrs Bentley's children 141 are making a horrid row---whereby I regret I cannot be transported to your Room to write to you. I am quite disgusted with literary Men---and will never know another except Wordsworth ---no not even Byron. Here is an instance of the friendships of such. Haydon and Hunt have known each other many years--- now they live pour ainsi dire jealous Neighbours. Haydon says to me Keats dont show your Lines to Hunt on any account or he will have done half for you---so it appears Hunt wishes it to be thought. When he met Reynolds in the Theatre John told him that I was getting on to the completion of 4000 Lines. Ah! says Hunt, had it not been for me they would have been 7000! If he will say this to Reynolds what would he to other People? Haydon received a Letter a little while back on this subject from some Lady---which contains a caution to me through him on this subject---Now is not all this a most paultry thing to think about? You may see the whole of the case by the following extract from a Letter I wrote to George in the Spring "As to what you say about my being a Poet, I can return no answer but by saying that the high Idea I have of poetical fame makes me think I see it towering to high above me. At any rate I have no right to talk until Endymion is finished---it will be a test, a trial of my Powers of Imagination and chiefly of my invention which is a rare thing indeed---by which I must make 4000 Lines of one bare circumstance and fill them with Poetry; and when I consider that this is a great task, and that when done it will take me but a dozen paces towards the Temple of Fame---it makes me say---God forbid that I should be without such a task! I have heard Hunt say and I may be asked---why endeavour after a long Poem? To which I should answer---Do not the Lovers of Poetry like to have a little Region to wander in where they may pick and choose, and in which the images are so numerous that many are forgotten and found new in a second Reading: which may be food for a Week's stroll in the Summer? Do not they like this better than what they can read through before. Mrs Williams comes down stairs? a Morning work at most. Besides a long Poem is a test of Invention which I take to be the Polar Star of Poetry, as Fancy is the Sails, and Imagination the Rudder. Did our great Poets ever write short Pieces? I mean in the shape of Tales---This same invention seems indeed of late Years to have been forgotten as a Poetical excellence. But enough of this, I put on no Laurels till I shall have finished Endymion, and I hope Apollo is not angered  142 at my having made a Mockery at him at Hunt's"  143 You see Bailey how independant my writing has been--- Hunts dissuasion was of no avail---I refused to visit Shelley, that I might have my own unfetterd Scope---and after all I shall have the Reputation of Hunt's eleve. His corrections and amputations will by the knowing ones be traced in the Poem. This is to be sure the vexation of a day---nor would I say so many Words about it to any but those whom I know to have my wellfare and Reputation at Heart--- Haydon promised to give directions for those Casts and you may expect to see them soon---with as many Letters. You will soon hear the dinning of Bells--- never mind you and Gleg  144 will defy the foul fiend.  145 But do not sacrifice your health to Books do take it kindly and not so voraciously. I am certain if you are your own Physician your Stomach will resume its proper Strength and then what great Benefits will follow. My Sister wrote a Letter to me which I think must be at yr post office---Ax Will to see. My Brothers kindest remembrances to you---we are going to dine at Brown's where I have some hopes of meeting Reynolds. The little Mercury I have taken has corrected the Poison and improved my Health---though I feel from my employment that I shall never be again secure in Robustness--- would that you were as well as your sincere friend & brother John Keats--- The Dilkes are expected to day. Address : Mr B. Bailey  Magdalen Hall  Oxford. Postmark : illegible. 146 My dear Bailey, So you have got a Curacy! good but I suppose you will be obliged to stop among your Oxford favorites during term time---never mind. When do you preach your first Sermon tell me for I shall propose to the two Rs  147 to hear it, so dont look into any of the old corner oaken pews, for fear of being put out by us---Poor Johnny Martin  148 can't be there He is ill I suspect---but that's neither here nor there ---all I can say I wish him as well through it as I am like to be. For this fortnight I have been confined at Hampstead ---Saturday evening was my first day in town ---when I went to Rices as we intend to do every Saturday till we know not when---Rice had some business at Highgate yesterday---so he came over to me, and detained me for the first time of I hope 24860 times. We hit upon an old Gent we had known some few years ago and had a veray pleausante daye,. In this World there is no quiet nothing but teasing and snubbing and vexation---my brother Tom look'd very unwell yesterday and I am for shipping him off to Lisbon---perhaps I ship there with him. I have not seen Mrs Reynolds since I left you wherefore my conscience smites me---I think of seeing her tomorrow have you any Message? I hope Gleg came soon after I left. I dont suppose I've written as many Lines as you have read Volumes or at least Chapters since I saw you. However, I am in a fair way now to come to a conclusion in at least three Weeks when I assure you I shall be glad to dismount for a Month or two although I'll keep as tight a reign as possible till then nor suffer myself to sleep. I will copy for you the opening of the 4 Book---in which you will see from the Manner I had not an opportunity of mentioning any Poets, for fear of spoiling the effect of the passage by particularising them! Muse of my Native Land! Loftiest Muse! O First born of the Mountains, by the hues Of Heaven on the spiritual air begot--- Long didst thou sit alone in northern grot While yet our England was a wolfish den; Before our forests heard the talk of Men; Before the first of Druids was a child.--- Long didst thou sit amid our regions wild Wrapt in a deep, prophetic Solitude. There came a hebrew voice of solemn Mood Yet wast thou patient: then sang forth the Nine, Apollo's Garland; yet didst thou divine Such homebred Glory, that they cry'd in vain "Come hither Sister of the Island." Plain Spake fair Ausonia, and once more she spake A higher Summons---still didst thou betake Thee to thy[ ] darling hopes. O thou hast A full [won] accomplishment---the thing is done, Which undone these our latter days had risen On barren Souls. O Muse thou knowst what prison Of flesh and bone curbs and confines and frets Our Spirits Wings: despondency besets Our Pillows and the fresh tomorrow morn Seems to give forth its light in very scorn Of our dull uninspired snail paced lives. Long have I said "how happy he who shrives To thee"---but then I thought on Poets gone And could not pray---nor can I now---so on I move to the end in Humbleness of Heart. .--- Thus far had I written when I received your last which made me at the sight of the direction caper for despair--- but for one thing I am glad that I have been neglectful--- and that is, therefrom I have received a proof of your utmost kindness which at this present I feel very much---and I wish I had a heart always open to such sensations---but there is no altering a Man's nature and mine must be radically wrong for it will lie dormant a whole Month.  149 This leads me to suppose that there are no Men thouroughly wicked ---so as never to be self spiritualized into a kind of sublime Misery---but alas! 'tis but for an Hour---he is the only Man "who has kept watch on Man's Mortality"  150 who has philantrophy enough to overcome the disposition to an indolent enjoyment of intellect---who is brave enough to volunteer for uncomfortable hours. You remember in Hazlit's essay on commonplace people---He says "they read the Edinburgh and Quarterly and think as they do".  151 Now with respect to Wordsworth's Gipseys, I think he is right and yet I think Hazlitt  152 is right and yet I think Wordsworth is rightest. Wordsworth had not been idle he had not been without his task---nor had they Gipseys--- they in the visible world had been as picturesque an object as he in the invisible. The Smoke of their fire---their attidudes---their Voices were all in harmony with the Evenings---It is a bold thing to say and I would not say it in print---but it seems to me that if Wordsworth had thought a little deeper at that Moment he would not have written the Poem at all---I should judge it to have been written in one of the most comfortable Moods of his Life ---it is a kind of sketchy intellectual Landscape---not a search after Truth---nor is it fair to attack him on such a subject---for it is with the Critic as with the poet had Hazlitt thought a little deeper and been in a good temper he would never have spied an imaginary fault there. The Sunday before last I asked Haydon to dine with me---when I thought of settling all Matters with him in regard to Crips and let you know about it---now although I engaged him a Fortnight before---he sent illness as an excuse---he never will come---I have not been well enough to stand the chance of a Wet night, and so have not seen him nor been able to expurgatorize those Masks for you---but I will not speak---your Speakers are never dooers---then Reynolds ---every time I see him and mention you he puts his hand to his head and looks like a Son of Niobe's---but he'll write soon. Rome you know was not built in a day---I shall be able, by a little perseverence to read your Letters off hand.  153 I am affraid your health will suffer from over study before your examination. I think you might regulate the thing according to your own Pleasure---and I would too. They were talking of your being up at Christmas---will it be before you have passed? There is nothing my dear Bailey I should rejoice at more that  for than  to see you comfortable with a little Poeona Wife  154 \---an affectionate Wife I have a sort of confidence would do you a great happiness May that be one of the many blessings I wish you. Let me be but the 1/10 of one to you, and I shall think it great. My Brother Georges Kindest wishes to you. My dear Bailey I am your affectionate friend. John Keats I should not like to be Pages in your way when in a tolerable hungry mood you have no Mercy. Your teeth are the Rock Tarpeian  155 down which you capsise Epic Poems like Mad---I would not for 40 Shillings be Coleridge's Lays  156 in your way. I hope you will soon get through this abominable writing in in the Schools---and be able to keep the terms with more comfort in the hope of retiring to a comfortable and quiet home out of the way of all Hopkinses and black beetles. When you are settled I will come and take a peep at your Church ---your house ---try whether I shall have grown two lusty for my chair--- by the fire side---and take a peep at my cardials Bower--- A Question is the best beacon towards a little Speculation. You ask me after my health and spirits--- This Question ratifies in my Mind what I have said above---Health and Spirits can only belong unalloyed to the selfish Man---the Man who thinks much of his fellows can never be in Spirits ---when I am not suffering for vicious beastliness I am the greater part of the week in spirits. You must forgive although I have only written 300 Lines---they would have been five but I have been obliged to go to town. yesterday I called at Lambs---St  157 \---Jane look'd very flush when I first went in but was much better before I left. Address : Miss Jane Reynolds  19 Lamb's Conduit Street Postmark : 31 OC 1817. 158 My dear Jane, When I got home the other night there was a letter from Bailey---and so very kind a one after all my indolence that I felt a very repentance---and finished my Letter to him immediately. I hope you are getting well quite fast. I send you a few lines from my fourth Book with the desire of helping away for you five Minutes of the day--- O Sorrow Why dost borrow The natural hue of health from vermeil Lips?

Give our Love to Marianne--- Your's sincerely. John Keats Address : Mr B. Bailey  Magdalen Hall  Oxford. Postmarks: LOMBARD ST. and 5 NO 1817. Monday---Hampstead My dear Bailey, Before I received your Letter I had heard of your disappointment ---an unlook'd for piece of villainy.  159 I am glad to hear there was an hindrance to your speaking your Mind to the Bishop: for all may go straight yet---as to being ordained---but the disgust consequent cannot pass away in a hurry---it must be shocking to find in a sacred Profession such barefaced oppression and impertinence---The Stations and Grandeurs of the World have taken it into their heads that they cannot commit themselves towards and inferior in rank---but is not the impertinence from one above to one below more wretchedly mean than from the low to the high? There is something so nauseous in selfwilled yawning impudence in the shape of conscience---it sinks the Bishop of Lincoln  160 into a smashed frog putrifying: that a rebel against common decency should escape the Pillory! That a mitre should cover a Man guilty of the most coxcombical, tyranical and indolent impertinence! I repeat this word for the offence appears to me most especially impertinent \---and a very serious return would be the Rod---Yet doth he sit in his Palace. Such is this World ---and we live---you have surely in a continual struggle against the suffocation of accidents---we must bear (and my Spleen is mad at the thought thereof) the Proud Mans Contumely.  161 O for a recourse somewhat human independant of the great Consolations of Religion and undepraved Sensations---of the Beautiful---the poetical in all things--- O for a Remedy against such wrongs within the pale of the World! Should not those things be pure enjoyment should they stand the chance of being contaminated by being called in as antagonists to Bishops? Would not earthly thing do? By Heavens my dear Bailey I know you have a spice of what I mean---you can set me and have set it in all the rubs that may befal me. you have I know a sort of Pride which would kick the Devil on the Jaw Bone and make him drunk with the kick---There is nothing so balmy to a Soul imbittered as yours must be, as Pride---When we look at the Heavens we cannot be proud--- but shall stocks and stones be impertinent and say it does not become us to kick them? At this Moment I take your hand---let us walk up yon Mountain of common sense now if our Pride be vainglorious such a support would fail---yet you feel firm footing---now look beneath at that parcel of knaves and fools. Many a Mitre is moving among them. I cannot express how I despise the Man who would wrong or be impertinent to you---The thought that we are mortal makes us groan--- I will speak of something else or my Spleen will get higher and higher---and I am not a bearer of the two egded sword. I hope you will recieve an answer from Haydon soon---if not, Pride! Pride! Pride! I have received no more subscription---but shall soon have a full health Liberty and leisure to give a good part of my time to him ---I will certainly be in time for him. We have promised him one year let that have elapsed and then do as we think proper. If I did not know how impossible it is, I should say---'do not at this time of disappointments disturb yourself about others'.--- There has been a flaming attack upon Hunt in the Endinburgh Magazine.  162 I never read any thing so virulent ---accusing him of the greatest Crimes depreciating his Wife his Poetry---his Habits---his company, his Conversation ---These Philippics are to come out in Numbers--- calld 'the Cockney School of Poetry' There has been but one Number published---that on Hunt to which they have prefixed a Motto from one Cornelius Webb Poetaster 163 \---who unfortunately was of our Party occasionally at Hampstead and took it into his head to write the following ---something about---"we'll talk on Wordsworth Byron--- a theme we never tire on and so forth till he comes to Hunt and Keats. In the Motto they have put Hunt and Keats in large Letters---I have no doubt that the second Number was intended for me: but have hopes of its non appearance from the following advertisement in last Sunday's Examiner. "To Z. The writer of the Article signed Z in Blackwood's Edinburgh magazine for October 1817 is invited to send his address to the printer of the Examiner, in order that Justice may be executed of  for on  the proper person" I dont mind the thing much---but if he should go to such lengths with me as he has done with Hunt I must infallibly call him to an account---if he be a human being and appears in Squares and Theatres where we might possibly meet. I dont relish his abuse Yesterday Rice and I were at Reynolds'---John was to be articled tomorrow I suppose by this time it is done. Jane was much better---At one time or other I will do you a Pleasure and the Poets a little Justice---but it ought to be in a Poem of greater moment than Endymion---I will do it some day---I have seen two Letters of a little Story Reynolds is writing---I wish he would keep at it. Here is the song I enclosed to Jane if you can make it out in this cross wise writing. O Sorrow! Why dost borrow The natural hue of health from vermeil Lips? To give maiden blushes To the white Rose bushes Or ist thy dewy hand the daisy tips? O Sorrow Why dost borrow The Lustrous Passion from an orbed eye? To give the glow worm Light? Or on a moonless night To tinge on Syren Shores the salt sea spry? O Sorrow Why dost borrow The tender ditties from a mourning tongue? To give at Evening pale Unto the Nightingale That thou mayest listen the cold dews among? O Sorrow Why dost borrow Hearts lightness from the Merriment of May? A Lover would not tread A Cowslip on the head Though he should dance from eve till peep of day; Nor any drooping flower Held sacred to thy bower Wherever he may sport himself and play. To Sorrow I bade good morrow, And thought to leave her far away behind But cheerly, cheerly, She loves me dearly--- She is to me so constant, and so kind--- I would deceive her And so leave her But ah! she is too constant and too kind. O that I had Orpheus lute---and was able to charm away all your Griefs and Cares---but all my power is a Mite---amid all your troubles I shall ever be your sincere and affectionate friend John Keats My brothers remembrances to you--- Give my respects to Gleig and Whitehead.  164 No address. My dear Dilke Mrs Dilke or Mr Wm Dilke whoever of you shall receive this present have the kindness to send pr Bearer " Sybilline Leaves "  165 and you r petitioner shall ever pray as in duty bound. Given under my hand this Wendnesday Morning of Novr 1817. John Keats Vivant Rex et Regina---amen. Address : Mr John H. Reynolds Lambs Conduit Stt. London. Postmarks : LEATHERHEAD and 22 NO 1817. Saturday My Dear Reynolds There are two things which tease me here---one of them Crips, and the other that I cannot go with Tom into Devonshire---however I hope to do my duty to myself in a week or so; and then I'll try what I can do for my neighbour---now is not this virtuous? on returning to Town---I'll damn all Idleness---indeed, in superabundance of employment, I must not be content to run here and there on little two-penny errands---but turn Rakehell, i e go a masking or Bailey will think me just as great a Promise Keeper as he thinks you---for myself I do not,--- and do not remember above one Complaint against you for matter o' that---Bailey writes so abominable a hand, to give his Letter a fair reading requires a little time: so I had not seen, when I saw you last, his invitation to Oxford at Christmas---I'll go with you. You know how poorly Rice was---I do not think it was all corporeal---bodily pain was not used to keep him silent. I'll tell you what; he was hurt at what your Sisters said about his joking with your Mother, he was, soothly to sain---It will all blow over. God knows, my Dear Reynolds, I should not talk any sorrow to you--- you must have enough vexations---so I won't any more---If I ever start a rueful subject in a Letter to you---blow me! Why don't you---Now I was agoing to ask a very silly Question neither you nor any body else could answer, under a folio, or at least a Pamphlet---you shall judge---Why don't you, as I do, look unconcerned at what may be called more particularly Heart-vexations? They never surprize me--- lord! a man should have the fine point of his soul taken off to become fit for this world---I like this place very much. There is Hill  & Dale and a little River---I went up Box hill this Evening after the Moon---you a'seen the Moon---came down---and wrote some lines. Whenever I am separated from you, and not engaged in a continued Poem---every Letter shall bring you a lyric---but I am too anxious for you to enjoy the whole, to send you a particle. One of the three Books I have with me is Shakespear's Poems: I neer found so many beauties in the Sonnets---they seem to be full of fine things said unintentionally---in the intensity of working out conceits. Is this to be borne? Hark ye! When lofty trees I see barren of leaves Which erst from heat did canopy the herd, And Summer's green all girded up in sheaves, Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard. He has left nothing to say about nothing or anything: for look at Snails, you know what he says about Snails, you know where he talks about "cockled Snails" 166 \---well, in one of these sonnets, he says---the chap slips into---no! I lie! this is in the Venus and Adonis:  167 the Simile brought it to my Mind. Audi---As the snail, whose tender horns being hit, Shrinks back into his shelly cave with pain And there all smothered up in shade doth sit, Long after fearing to put forth again: So at his bloody view her eyes are fled, Into the deep dark Cabins of her head. He overwhelms a genuine Lover of Poesy with all manner of abuse, talking about--- "a poet's rage And stretched metre of an antique song." Which by the by will be a capital Motto for my Poem,  168 won't it?---He speaks too of "Time's antique pen"---and "april's first born flowers"---and "deaths eternal cold".--- By the Whim King! I'll give you a Stanza, because it is not material in connection and when I wrote it I wanted you to---give your vote, pro or con.--- Crystalline Brother of the belt of Heaven, Aquarius! to whom King Jove hath given Two liquid pulse-streams! 'stead of feather'd wings--- Two fan-like fountains---thine illuminings For Dian play: Dissolve the frozen purity of air; Let thy white shoulders silvery and bare, Show cold through watery pinions: make more bright The Star-Queen's Crescent on her marriage night: Haste Haste away!  169 \--- Now I hope I shall not fall off in the winding up, as the woman said to the 170 \---I mean up and down. I see there is an advertizement in the Chronicle to Poets---he is so overloaded with poems on the late Princess.  171 \---I suppose you do not lack---send me a few---lend me thy hand to laugh a little  172 \---send me a little pullet sperm,  173 a few finch eggs  174 \---and remember me to each of our Card playing Club---When you die you will all be turned into Dice, and be put in pawn with the Devil---for Cards they crumple up  175 like any King---I mean John in the stage play what pertains Prince Arthur. I rest Your affectionate friend John Keats Give my love to both houses  176 \---hinc atque illinc. Address : Mr B. Bailey  Magdalen Hall  Oxford--- Postmarks : LEATHERHEAD and 22 NO 1817. My dear Bailey, I will get over the first part of this ( un said)  177 Letter as soon as possible for it relates to the affair of poor Crips--- To a Man of your nature such a Letter as Haydon's must have been extremely cutting---What occasions the greater part of the World's Quarrels? simply this, two Minds meet and do not understand each other time enough to prevent any shock or surprise at the conduct of either party---As soon as I had known Haydon three days I had got enough of his character not to have been surprised at such a Letter as he has hurt you with. Nor when I knew it was it a principle with me to drop his acquaintance although with you it would have been an imperious feeling. I wish you knew all that I think about Genius and the Heart---and yet I think you are thoroughly acquainted with my innermost breast in that respect, or you could not have known me even thus long and still hold me worthy to be your dear friend. In passing however I must say of one thing that has pressed upon me lately and encreased my Humility and capability of submission and that is this truth---Men of Genius are great as certain ethereal Chemicals operating on the Mass of neutral intellect---by   for but  they have not any individuality, any determined Character---I would call the top and head of those who have a proper self Men of Power--- But I am running my head into a Subject which I am certain I could not do justice to under five years Study and 3 vols octavo---and moreover long to be talking about the Imagination---so my dear Bailey do not think of this unpleasant affair if possible---do not---I defy any harm to come of it---I defy. I'll shall write to Crips this Week and request him to tell me all his goings on from time to time by Letter whererever I may be---it will all go on well so don't because you have suddenly discover'd a Coldness in Haydon suffer yourself to be teased. Do not my dear fellow. O I wish I was as certain of the end of all your troubles as that of your momentary start about the authenticity of the Imagination. I am certain of nothing but of the holiness of the Heart's affections and the truth of Imagination---What the imagination seizes as Beauty must be truth  178 \---whether it existed before or not---for I have the same Idea of all our Passions as of Love they are all in their sublime, creative of essential Beauty. In a Word, you may know my favorite Speculation by my first Book and the little song I sent in my last  179 \---which is a representation from the fancy of the probable mode of operating in these Matters. The Imagination may be compared to Adam's dream  180 \---he awoke and found it truth. I am the more zealous in this affair, because I have never yet been able to perceive how any thing can be known for truth by consequitive reasoning---and yet it must be. Can it be that even the greatest Philosopher ever arrived at his goal without putting aside numerous objections. However it may be, O for a Life of Sensations rather than of Thoughts! It is 'a Vision in the form of Youth' a Shadow of reality to come--- and this consideration has further convinced me for it has come as auxiliary to another favorite Speculation of mine, that we shall enjoy ourselves here after by having what we called happiness on Earth repeated in a finer tone and so repeated. And yet such a fate can only befall those who delight in Sensation rather than hunger as you do after Truth. Adam's dream will do here and seems to be a conviction that Imagination and its empyreal reflection is the same as human Life and its Spiritual repetition. But as I was saying---the simple imaginative Mind may have its rewards in the repetition of its own silent Working coming continually on the Spirit with a fine Suddenness ---to compare great things with small---have you never by being Surprised with an old Melody---in a delicious place---by a delicious voice, felt over again your very Speculations and Surmises at the time it first operated on your Soul ---do you not remember forming to yourself the singer's face more beautiful that  for than  it was possible and yet with the elevation of the Moment you did not think so---even then you were mounted on the Wings of Imagination so high---that the Protrotype must be here after---that delicious face you will see. What a time! I am continually running away from the subject---sure this cannot be exactly the case with a complex Mind---one that is imaginative and at the same time careful of its fruits---who would exist partly on Sensation partly on thought---to whom it is necessary that years should bring the philosophic Mind  181 \--- such an one I consider your's and therefore it is necessary to your eternal Happiness that you not only drink this old Wine of Heaven, which I shall call the redigestion of our most ethereal Musings on Earth; but also increase in knowledge and know all things. I am glad to hear you are in a fair way for Easter---you will soon get through your unpleasant reading and then!---but the world is full of troubles and I have not much reason to think myself pesterd with many---I think Jane or Marianne has a better opinion of me than I deserve ---for really and truly I do not think my Brothers illness connected with mine ---you know more of the real Cause than they do nor have I any chance of being rack'd as you have been---You perhaps at one time thought there was such a thing as Worldly Happiness to be arrived at,  182 at certain periods of time marked out---you have of necessity from your disposition been thus led away---I scarcely remember counting upon any Happiness---I look not for it if it be not in the present hour---nothing startles me beyond the Moment. The setting Sun will always set me to rights--- or if a Sparrow come before my Window I take part in its existince and pick about the Gravel. The first thing that strikes me on hearing a Misfortune having befalled another is this. 'Well it cannot be helped---he will have the pleasure of trying the resources of his spirit'---and I beg now my dear Bailey that hereafter should you observe any thing cold in me not to but  for put  it to the account of heartlessness but abstraction---for I assure you I sometimes feel not the influence of a Passion or affection during a whole week 183 \--- and so long this sometimes continues I begin to suspect myself and the genuineness of my feelings at other times ---thinking them a few barren Tragedy-tears---My Brother Tom is much improved---he is going to Devonshire--- whither I shall follow him---at present I am just arrived at Dorking to change the Scene---change the Air and give me a spur to wind up my Poem, of which there are wanting 500 Lines. I should have been here a day sooner but the Reynoldses persuaded me to spop in Town to meet your friend Christie.  184 There were Rice and Martin---we talked about Ghosts. I will have some talk with Taylor and let you know---when please God I come down at Christmas. I will find that Examiner if possible. My best regards to Gleig. My Brothers to you and Mrs Bentley's Your affectionate friend John Keats--- I want to say much more to you---a few hints will set me going. Direct Burford Bridge near dorking Address and postmark not recorded. Hampstead Sunday My dear Brothers, I must crave your pardon for not having written ere this. ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) I saw Kean return to the public in 'Richard III.' 185 , and finely he did it, and, at the request of Reynolds, I went to criticize his Luke in Riches. The critique is in to-day's 'Champion', which I send you, with the Examiner, in which you will find very proper lamentation on the obsoletion of Christmas Gambols and pastimes:  186 but it was mixed up with so much egotism of that drivelling nature that pleasure is entirely lost. Hone, the publisher's trial, you must find very amusing; and, as Englishmen, very encouraging---his Not Guilty is a thing, which not to have been, would have dulled still more Liberty's Emblazoning ---Lord Ellenborough has been paid in his own coin---Wooler and Hone  187 have done us an essential service ---I have had two very pleasant evenings with Dilke, yesterday and to-day, and am at this moment just come from him, and feel in the humour to go on with this, began in the morning, and from which he came to fetch me. I spent Friday evening with Wells,  188 and went next morning to see Death on the Pale Horse.  189 It is a wonderful picture, when West's age is considered; But there is nothing to be intense upon; no women one feels mad to kiss, no face swelling into reality---The excellence of every art is its intensity, capable of making all disagreeables evaporate, from their being in close relationship with Beauty and Truth. Examine 'King Lear', and you will find this exemplified throughout; but in this picture we have unpleasantness without any momentous depth of speculation excited, in which to bury its repulsiveness---The picture is larger than 'Christ rejected'.  190 I dined with Haydon the Sunday after you left, and had a very pleasant day, I dined too (for I have been out too much lately) with Horace Smith, and met his two Brothers, with Hill  191 and Kingston, and one Du Bois.  192 They only served to convince me, how superior humour is to wit in respect to enjoyment---These men say things which make one start, without making one feel; they are all alike; their manners are alike; they all know fashionables; they have a mannerism in their very eating and drinking, in their mere handling a Decanter---They talked of Kean and his low company---Would I were with that Company instead of yours, said I to myself! I know such like acquaintance will never do for me, and yet I am going to Reynolds on Wednesday. Brown and Dilke walked with me and back from the Christmas pantomime. I had not a dispute but a disquisition, with Dilke on various subjects; several things dove-tailed in my mind, and at once it struck me what quality went to form a Man of Achievement, especially in Literature, and which Shakespeare possessed so enormously ---I mean Negative Capability , that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason--- Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine isolated verisimilitude  193 caught from the Penetralium of mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes  194 would perhaps take us no further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all consideration. Shelley's poem  195 is out, and there are words about its being objected to as much as "Queen Mab" was. Poor Shelley, I think he has his Quota of good qualities, in sooth la!!

Hampstead Decr 31st My dear Haydon, I forgot on Sunday to ask you for Cripps's direction as you might chance to know---on monday you were out in the Sun. I shall be with you shortly to have a talk about him. I thoughtlessly gave you a promise for Sunday--- now I have just received a 'yes' from a friend of mine to pass that said day here---so be lenient and your petitioner shall ever pray &c I met Wordsworth on Hampstead Heath this Morning.  196 Your affectionate friend John Keats Address : Messrs Keats  Post Office  Teignmouth  Devonshire. Postmark : 5 JA 1818. Featherstone Buildgs Monday My dear Brothers, I ought to have written before, and you should have had a long Letter last week, but I undertook the Champion for Reynolds who is at Exeter. I wrote two articles, one on the Drury Lane Pantomime, the other on the Covent Garden New Tragedy,  197 which they have not put in. The one they have inserted is so badly punctuated that, you perceive, I am determined never to write more without some care in that particular. Wells tells me, that you are licking your Chops, Tom, in expectation of my Book coming out. I am sorry to say I have not begun my corrections yet: tomorrow I set out. I called on Sawrey  198 this morning. He did not seem to be at all out at any thing I said and the enquiries I made with regard to your spitting of Blood: and moreover desired me to ask you to send him a correct account of all your sensations and symptoms concerning the Palpitation and the spitting and the Cough---if you have any. Your last Letter gave me at great Pleasure for I think the Invalid is in a better spirit there along the Edge  199 \---and as for George I must immediately, now I think of it, correct a little misconception of a part of my last Letter. The Miss Reynolds have never said one word against me about you,  200 or by any means endeavoured to lessen you in my estimation. That is not what I referred to: but the manner and thoughts which I knew they internally had towards you---time will show. Wells and Severn dined with me yesterday: we had a very pleasant day. I pitched upon another bottle of claret--- Port---we enjoyed ourselves very much were all very witty and full of Rhyme---we played a Concert  201 from 4 o'clock till 10-drank your Healths the Hunts and N. B. Severn Peter Pindars. I said on that day the only good thing I was ever guilty of---we were talking about Stephens and the Is Gallery. I said I wondered that careful Folks would go there for although it was but a Shilling still you had to pay through the Nose. I saw the Peachey family in a Box at Drury one Night. I have got such a curious  202 \---or rather I had such, now I am in my own hand. I have had a great deal of pleasant time with Rice lately, and am getting initiated into a little band--- they call drinking deep dying scarlet, and when you breathe in your wartering they bid you cry hem and play it off  203 \---they call good Wine a pretty tipple, and call getting a Child knocking out an apple, stopping at a Tavern they call hanging out. Where do you sup? is where do you hang out? This day I promised to dine with Wordsworth, and the Weather is so bad that I am undecided for he lives at Mortimer street. I had an invitation to meet him at Kingston's---but not liking that place I sent my excuse---What I think of doing to day is to dine in Mortimer Street (Wordsth) and sup here in Feathrsne Buildgs as Mr Wells has invited me. On Saturday I called on Wordsworth  204 before he went to Kingston's and was surprised to find him with a stiff Collar. I saw his Spouse and I think his Daughter. I forget whether I had written my last before my Sunday Evening  205 at Haydon's---no I did not or I should have told you Tom of a young man you met at Paris at Scott's of the  torn  Richer  206 I think---he is going to Fezan in Africa there to proceed if possible like Mungo Park---he was very polite to me and enquired very particularly after you--- then there was Wordsworth, Lamb, Monkhouse,  207 Landseer, Kingston and your humble Sarvant. Lamb got tipsey and blew up Kingston--- proceeding so far as to take the Candle across the Room hold it to his face and show us wh-a-at-sort-fello-he-waas I astonished Kingston at supper with a pertinacity in favour of drinking---keeping my two glasses at work in a knowing way--- I have seen Fanny twice lately---she enquired particularly after you and wants a Co-partnership Letter from you---she has been unwell but is improving---I think she will be quick---Mrs Abbey was saying that the Keatses were ever indolent---that they would ever be so and that it was born in them---Well whispered fanny to me If it is born with us how can we help it---She seems very anxious for a Letter---She as I asked her what I should get for her she said a Medal of the Princess.  208 I called on Haslam--- we dined very snugly together---he sent me a Hare last Week which I sent to Mrs Dilke. Brown is not come back. I and Dilke are getting capital Friends---he is going to take the Champion---he has sent his farce to Convent Garden---I met Bob Harris in the Slips at Covent Garden---we had a good deal of curious chat---he came out with his old humble opinion--- The Covent Garden Pantomime is a very nice one---but they have a middling Harlequin, a bad Pantoloon, a worse Clown and a shocking Columbine who is one of the Miss Dennets. I suppose you will see my Critique on the new Tragedy in the next Week's Champion  209 \---It is a shocking bad one. I have not seen Hunt, he was out when I called ---Mrs Hunt looks as well as ever I saw her after her Confinement ---There is an article in the sennight Examiner on Godwin's Mandeville signed E. K., fl. 1573 I think it Miss Kents  210 \---I will send it. There are fine Subscriptions going on for Hone.  211 You ask me what degrees there are between Scotts Novels and those of Smollet. They appear to me to be quite distinct in every particular---more especially in their aim---Scott endeavours to throw so interesting and romantic a colouring into common and low Characters as to give them a touch of the Sublime---Smollet on the contrary pulls down and levels what with other Men would continue Romance. The Grand parts of Scott are within the reach of more Minds that  for than  the finest humours in Humphrey Clincker---I forget whether that fine thing of the Sargeant is Fielding's or Smollet's but it gives me more pleasure that  for than  the whole Novel of the Antiquary ---you must remember what I mean.  212 Some one says to the Sargeant---"Thats a non sequiter," "if you come to that" replies the Sargeant "you're another." I see by Wells' Letter, Mr Abbey does not overstock you with Money---you must write---I have not seen Loveless yet---but expect it on Wednesday---I am affraid it is gone. Severn tells me he has an order for some drawings for the Emperor of Russia. I was at a dance at Redhall's and passed a pleasant time enough---drank deep and won 10.6 at cutting for Half Guineas. There was a younger Brother of the Squibs made himself very conspicuous after the Ladies had retired from the supper table by giving Mater Omnium---Mr Redhall said he did not understand any thing but plain english---whereat Rice egged the young fool on to say the Word plainly out. After which there was an enquiry about the derivation of the Word C---t when while two parsons and Grammarians were sitting together and settling the matter Wm Squibs interrupting them said a very good thing---Gentlemen says he I have always understood it to be a Root and not a Derivitive! On proceeding to the Pot in the Cupboard it soon became full on which the Court door was opened Frank Floodgate bawls out---Hoollo! here's an opposition pot---Ay, says Rice in one you have a Yard for your pot, and in the other a pot for your Yard---Bailey was there and seemed to enjoy the Evening---Rice said he cared less about the hour than any one and the proof is his dancing---he cares not for time, dancing as if he was deaf. Old Redhall not being used to give parties had no idea of the Quantity of wine that would be drank and he actually put in readiness on the kitchen stairs 8 dozen---Every one enquires after you---and every one desires their remembrances to you. You must get well Tom and then I shall feel 'Whole and general as the casing Air'.  213 Give me as many Letters as you like and write to Sawrey soon---I received a short Letter from Bailey about Crips and one from Haydon ditto---Haydon thinks he improves very much Here'sa happy twelveth day to you and may we pass the next together---Mrs Wells desires  214 particularly to Tom and her respects to George---and I desire no better than to be ever Your most affectionate Brother John--- I had not opened the Champion before---I find both my articles in it--- Address : Mr J. Taylor  Bond Street. Postmark : 10 JA 1818. Saturday morning My dear Taylor, Several things have kept me from you lately:---first you had got into a little hell,  215 which I was not anxious to reconnoitre. Secondly, I have made a vow not to call again without my first book:  216 so you may expect to see me in four days.  217 Thirdly, I have been racketing too much, & do not feel over well. I have been Wordsworth frequently ---Dined with him last Monday---Reynolds, I suppose you have seen. Just scribble me thus many lines, to let me know you are in the land of the living, & well. Remember me to the Fleet Street Household---And should you see any from Percy Street, give my kindest regards to them. Your sincere friend John Keats Address : Benjamin Robert Haydon  Lisson Grove North  Paddington Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and JA 10 1818 Saturday Morn. My dear Haydon, I should have seen you ere this, but on account of my sister being in Town: so that when I have sometimes made ten paces towards you, Fanny has called me into the City; and the Xmas Holydays are your only time to see Sisters, that is if they are so situated as mine. I will be with you early next week---to night it should be, but we have a sort of a Club every Saturday evening---to morrow---but I have on that day an insuperable engagement---Crips has been down to me, and appears sensible that a binding to you would be of the greatest advantage to him---if such a thing be done it cannot be before £150 or £200 are secured in subscriptions to him. I will write to Bailey about it, give a Copy of the Subscribers names to every one I know who is likely to get a £5 for him. I will leave a Copy at Taylor and Hesseys, Rodwell and Martin--- and will ask Kingston and Co. to cash up. Your friendship for me is now getting into its teens---and I feel the past. Also every day older I get---the greater is my idea of your atchievements in Art: and I am convinced that there are three things to rejoice at in this Age ---The Excursion Your Pictures, and Hazlitt's depth of Taste. Your's affectionately John Keats--- No address or postmark. My dear Keats, I feel greatly delighted by your high opinion, allow me to add sincerely a fourth to be proud of--- John Keats' genius !---this I speak from my heart---You  & Bewick are the only men I ever liked with all my heart, for Wordsworth being older, there is no equality tho' I reverence him and love him devotedly---and now you know my peculiar feelings in wishing to have a notice when you cannot keep an engagement with me; there can never be as long as we live any ground of dispute between us---My Friendship for you is beyond its teens, & beginning to ripen to maturity---I always saw through your nature at once & you shall always find me a devoted & affectionate Brother.---With respect to Cripps, I sincerely think it would be for our mutual advantage to have him bound, I would instruct him for the first two years, and then in the last he would be a great assistance to me. I will subscribe £5-it is all I can afford, and all which ought to be expected of me, as I will do all in my power to inform him---I like him much he is docile & industrious & improves rapidly---I hope we shall succeed in getting the money ---do your utmost & so will I---In the mean time I will go on with his Studies ---with respect to our meeting the sooner my dear Keats the better---but accept this engagement as long as we live---every Sunday at three I shall be happy to see you as long as I live and you live, and as long as I have a bit of beef to give you when you have other engagements more important, come the Sunday following  &c Address and postmark not recorded. Hampstead, Tuesday. My dear Brothers, I am certain I think, of having a letter to-morrow morning; for I expected one so much this morning, having been in town two days, at the end of which my expectations began to get up a little. I found two on the table, one from Bailey and one from Haydon. I am quite perplexed in a world of doubts and fancies---there is nothing stable in the world; uproar's your only music---I don't mean to include Bailey in this and so I dismiss him from this with all the opprobrium he deserves---that is in so many words, he is one of the noblest men alive at the present day. In a note to Haydon about a week ago 218 (which I wrote with a full sense of what he had done, and how he had never manifested any little mean drawback in his value of me) I said if there were three things superior in the modern world, they were 'The Excursion', Haydon's Pictures, and Hazlitt's depth of Taste. So I do believe---not thus speaking with any poor vanity---that works of genius are the first things in this world. No! for that sort of probity and disinterestedness which such men as Bailey possess, does hold and grasp the tip-top of any spiritual honors that can be paid to anything in this world. And moreover having this feeling at this present come over me in its full force, I sat down to write to you with a grateful heart, in that I had not a Brother who did not  219 feel and credit me for a deeper feeling and devotion for his uprightness, than for any marks of genius however splendid. I was speaking about doubts and fancies---I mean there has been a quarrel of a severe nature between Haydon and Reynolds and another ('the Devil rides upon a fiddle stick')  220 between Hunt and Haydon. The first grew from the Sunday on which Haydon invited some friends to meet Wordsworth. Reynolds never went, and never sent any Notice about it, this offended Haydon more than it ought to have done---he wrote a very sharp and high note to Reynolds and then another in palliation--- but which Reynolds feels as an aggravation of the first.---Considering all things, Haydon's frequent neglect of his appointments &c., his notes were bad enough to put Reynolds on the right side of the question---but then Reynolds has no powers of sufferance; no idea of having the thing against him; so he answered Haydon in one of the most cutting letters I ever read; exposing to himself all his own weaknesses and going on to an excess, which whether it is just or no, is what I would fain have unsaid, the fact is they are both in the right and both in the wrong. The quarrel with Hunt I understand thus far. Mrs H. was in the habit of borrowing silver of Haydon---the last time she did so, Haydon asked her to return it at a certain time---she did not---Haydon sent for it---Hunt went to expostulate on the indelicacy &c.---they got to words and parted for ever. All I hope is at some time to bring them all together again.---Lawk! Molly there's been such doings ---Yesterday evening I made an appointment with Wells to go to a private theatre, and it being in the neighbourhood of Drury Lane, and thinking we might be fatigued with sitting the whole evening in one dirty hole, I got the Drury Lane ticket,  221 and therewith we divided the evening with a spice of Richard III.---  About 19 January 1818. Good Lord! I began this letter nearly a week ago, what have I been doing since ---I have been---I mean not been sending last Sunday's paper to you I believe because it was not near me---for I cannot find it and my conscience presses heavy on me for not sending it. You would have had one last Thursday, but I was called away, and have been about somewhere ever since. Where? What? Well I rejoice almost that I have not heard from you because no news is good news. I cannot for the world recollect why I was called away, all I know is that there has been a dance at Dilke's, and another at the London Coffee House;  222 to both of which I went. But I must tell you in another letter the circumstances thereof---for though a week should have passed since I wrote on the other side it quite appals me---I can only write in scraps and patches. Brown is returned from Hampstead---Haydon has returned an answer in the same style---they are all dreadfully irritated against each other. On Sunday I saw Hunt and dined with Haydon, met Hazlitt and Bewick  223 there, and took Haslam with me---forgot to speak about Crips though I broke my engagement to Haslam's on purpose. Mem.--- Haslam came to meet me, found me at Breakfast, had the goodness to go with me my way. I have just finished the revision of my First Book, and shall take it to Taylor's to-morrow. Do not let me see many days pass without hearing from you. Your most affectionate Brother, John. No address or postmark. Friday 23rd--- My dear Haydon, I have a complete fellow-feeling with you in this business ---so much so that it would be as well to wait for a choice out of Hyperion \---when that Poem is done there will be a wide range for you---in Endymion I think you may have many bits of the deep and sentimental cast---the nature of Hyperion will lead me to treat it in a more naked and grecian Manner---and the march of passion and endeavour will be undeviating---and one great contrast between them will be---that the Hero of the written tale being mortal is led on, like Buonaparte, by circumstance; whereas the Apollo in Hyperion being a fore- seeing God will shape his actions like one. But I am counting  &c. Your proposal pleases me---and, believe me, I would not have my Head in the shop windows from any hand but yours---no by Apelles! I will write Taylor  224 and you shall hear from me Yours ever John Keats--- No address or postmark. Friday 23rd My dear Taylor, I have spoken to Haydon about the Drawing---he would do it with all his Art and Heart too if so I will it---however he has written thus to me---but I must tell you first, he intends painting a finished picture from the Poem---thus he writes "When I do any thing for your poem, it must be effectual ---an honor to both of us---to hurry up a sketch for the season won't do. I think an engraving from your head, from a Chalk drawing of mine---done with all my might--- to which I would put my name, would answer Taylor's Idea more than the other indeed I am sure of it---this I will do&this will be effectual and as I have not done it for any other human being---it will have an effect" What think you of this? Let me hear. I shall have my second book in readiness forthwith--- Your's most sincerely John Keats--- If Reynolds calls tell him three lines would be acceptable for I am squat at Hampstead Address : Mr B. Bailey  Magdalen Hall  Oxford--- Postmark : 23 JA 1818 Friday Jany 23rd My dear Bailey, Twelve days have pass'd since your last reached me--- what has gone through the myriads of human Minds since the 12th we talk of the immense number of Books, the Volumes ranged thousands by thousands---but perhaps more goes through the human intelligence in 12 days than ever was written. How has that unfortunate family lived through the twelve?  225 One saying of your's I shall never forget---you may not recollect it---it being perhaps said when you were looking on the surface and seeming of Humanity alone, without a thought of the past or the future---or the deeps of good and evil---you were at the moment estranged from speculation and I think you have arguments ready for the Man who would utter it to you--- this is a formidable preface for a simple thing---merely you said; "Why should Woman suffer?" Aye. Why should she? 'By heavens I'd coin my very Soul and drop my Blood for Drachmas"!  226 These things are, and he who feels how incompetent the most skyey Knight errantry its  for is  to heal this bruised fairness is like a sensitive leaf on the hot hand of thought. Your tearing, my dear friend, a spiritless and gloomy Letter up [ ] to rewrite to me is what I shall never forget---it was to me a real thing. Things have happen'd lately of great Perplexity. You must have heard of them. Reynolds and Haydon retorting and recrimminating--- and parting for ever---the same thing has happened between Haydon and Hunt--- It is unfortunate ---Men should bear with each other---there lives not the Man who may not be cut up, aye hashed to pieces on his weakest side. The best of Men have but a portion of good in them---a kind of spiritual yeast in their frames which creates the ferment of existence---by which a Man is propell'd to act and strive and buffet with Circumstance. The sure way Bailey, is first to know a Man's faults, and then be passive---if after that he insensibly draws you towards him then you have no Power to break the link. Before I felt interested in either Reynolds or Haydon--- I was well read in their faults yet knowing them I have been cementing gradually with both. I have an affection for them both for reasons almost opposite---and to both must I of necessity cling---supported always by the hope that when a little time---a few years shall have tried me more fully in their esteem I may be able to bring them together---the time must come because they have both hearts---and they will recollect the best parts of each other when this gust is overblown. I had a Message from you through a Letter to Jane  227 I think about Cripps---there can be no idea of binding till a sufficient sum is sure for him--- and even then the thing should be maturely consider'd by all his helpers. I shall try my luck upon as many fatpurses as I can meet with. Cripps is improving very fast. I have the greater hopes of him because he is so slow in devellopment---a Man of great executing Powers at 20- with a look and a speech almost stupid is sure to do something. I have just look'd through the second side of your Letter---I feel a great content at it. I was at Hunt's the other day, and he surprised me with a real authenticated Lock of Milton's Hair . I know you would like what I wrote thereon---so here it is ---as they say of a Sheep in a Nursery Book On seeing a Lock of Milton's Hair--- Chief of organic Numbers! Old Scholar of the Spheres! Thy spirit never slumbers, But rolls about our ears For ever and for ever. O, what a mad endeavour Worketh he Who, to thy sacred and ennobled hearse, Would offer a burnt sacrifice of verse And Melody! How heavenward thou soundedst Live Temple of sweet noise; And discord unconfoundedst: Giving delight new joys, And Pleasure nobler pinions--- O where are thy Dominions! Lend thine ear To a young delian oath---aye, by thy soul, By all that from thy mortal Lips did roll; And by the Kernel of thine earthly Love, Beauty, in things on earth and things above, When every childish fashion Has vanish'd from my rhyme Will I grey-gone in passion, Give to an after-time Hymning and harmony Of thee, and of thy Works and of thy Life: But vain is now the burning and the strife--- Pangs are in vain---until I grow high-rife With Old Philosophy And mad with glimpses at futurity! For many years my offerings must be hush'd: When I do speak I'll think upon this hour, Because I feel my forehead hot and flush'd, Even at the simplest vassal of thy Power,--- A Lock of thy bright hair! Sudden it came, And I was startled when I heard thy name Coupled so unaware--- Yet, at the moment, temperate was my blood: Methought I had beheld it from the flood. Jany 21st This I did at Hunt's  228 at his request---perhaps I should have done something better alone and at home ---I have sent my first book  229 to the Press---and this afternoon shall begin preparing the second---my visit to you will be a great spur to quicken the Proceeding---I have not had your Sermon returned---I long to make it the subject of a Letter to you---What do they say at Oxford? I trust you and Gleig pass much fine time together. Remember me to him and Whitehead. My brother Tom is getting stronger but his Spitting of blood continues. I sat down to read King Lear yesterday, and felt the greatness of the thing up to the writing of a Sonnet preparatory thereto---in my next you shall have it  230 There were some miserable reports of Rice's health---I went and lo! Master Jemmy had been to the play the night before and was out at the time---he always comes on his Legs like a Cat--- I have seen a good deal of Wordsworth. Hazlitt is lecturing on Poetry at the Surrey institution---I shall be there next Tuesday. Your most affectionate Friend John Keats--- Address : Messrs. Keats  Teignmouth  Devonshire. Postmark : not recorded. Friday, 23 January 1818. My dear Brothers, I was thinking what hindered me from writing so long, for I have so many things to say to you and know not where to begin. It shall be upon a thing most interesting to you my Poem. Well! I have given the 1st Book to Taylor; he seemed more than satisfied with it, and to my surprise proposed publishing it in Quarto if Haydon could make a drawing of some event therein, for a Frontispiece.  231 I called on Haydon, he said he would do anything I liked, but said he would rather paint a finished picture, from it, which he seems eager to do; this in a year or two will be a glorious thing for us; and it will be, for Haydon is struck with the 1st Book. I left Haydon and the next day received a letter from him, proposing to make, as he says with all his might, a finished Chalk sketch of my head, to be engraved in the first style and put at the head of my Poem, saying at the same time he had never done the thing for any human being, and that it must have considerable effect as he will put the name to it. I begin to day to copy my 2nd Book---"thus far into the bowels of the Land"  232 \---You shall hear whether it will be Quarto or non Quarto, picture or non Picture. Leigh Hunt I showed my 1st Book to, he allows it not much merit as a whole; says it is unnatural and made ten objections to it in the mere skimming Over. He says the conversation is unnatural and too high-flown for Brother and Sister---says it should be simple, forgetting do ye mind that they are both overshadowed by a Supernatural Power, and of force could not speak like Franchesca in the Rimini. He must first prove that Caliban's poetry is unnatural,---This with me completely overturns his objections. The fact is he and Shelley are hurt, and perhaps justly, at my not having showed them the affair officiously ---and from several hints I have had they appear much disposed to dissect and anatomize, any trip or slip I may have made.---But who's afraid? Ay! Tom! Demme if I am. I went last Tuesday, an hour too late, to Hazlitt's Lecture on Poetry, got there just as they were coming out, when all these pounced upon me ---Hazlitt, John Hunt and Son, Wells, Bewick, all the Landseers,  233 Bob Harris, RoxI of the Burrough aye and more; the Landseers enquired after you particularly---I know not whether Wordsworth has left town---But Sunday I dined with Hazlitt and Haydon, also that I took Haslam with me---I dined with Brown lately. Dilke having taken the Champion Theatricals  234 was obliged to be in town. Fanny has returned to Walthamstow ---Mr Abbey appeared very glum the last time I went to see her, and said in an indirect way that I had no business there---Rice has been ill, but has been mending much lately--- I think a little change has taken place in my intellect lately---I cannot bear to be uninterested or unemployed, I, who for so long a time have been addicted to passiveness. Nothing is finer for the purposes of great productions than a very gradual ripening of the intellectual powers. As an instance of this--- observe---I sat down yesterday to read "King Lear" once again the thing appeared to demand the prologue of a Sonnet, I wrote it and began to read  235 \---(I know you would like to see it.) "On sitting down to read King Lear once again" O golden tongued Romance with serene Lute! Fair-plumed Syren! Queen of far-away! Leave melodizing on this wintry day, Shut up thine olden volume and be mute. Adieu! for once again the fierce dispute, Betwixt Hell torment and impassion'd Clay Must I burn through; once more assay The bitter Sweet of this Shakespeareian fruit. Chief Poet! and ye clouds of Albion, Begetters of our deep eternal theme, When I am through the old oak forest gone Let me not wander in a barren dream But when I am consumed with the Fire Give me new Phoenix-wings to fly at my desire So you see I am getting at it, with a sort of determination and strength, though verily I do not feel it at this moment---this is my fourth letter this morning, and I feel rather tired, and my head rather swimming---so I will leave it open till to-morrow's post--- I am in the habit of taking my papers to Dilke's and copying there; so I chat and proceed at the same time. I have been there at my work this evening, and the walk over the Heath  236 takes off all sleep, so I will even proceed with you---I left off short in my last, just as I began an account of a private theatrical---Well it was of the lowest order, all greasy and oily, insomuch that if they had lived in olden times, when signs were hung over the doors; the only appropriate one for that oily place would have been--- a guttered Candle---They played John Bull, The Review ---and it was to conclude with Bombastes Furioso---I saw from a Box the 1st Act of John Bull,  237 then I went to Drury and did not return till it was over---when by Wells's interest we got behind the scenes---there was not a yard wide all the way round for actors, scene-shifters and interlopers to move in; for 'Nota Bene' the Green Room was under the stage and there was I threatened over and over again to be turned out by the oily scene-shifters---There did I hear a little painted Trollop own, very candidly, that she had failed in Mary, with a "damned if she'd play a serious part again, as long as she lived", and at the same time she was habited as the Quaker in the Review---There was a quarrel, and a fat good-natured looking girl in soldiers' Clothes wished she had only been a man for Tom's sake---One fellow began a song, but an unlucky finger-point from the Gallery sent him off like a shot. One chap was dressed to kill for the King in Bombastes, and he stood at the edge of the scene in the very sweat of anxiety to show himself, but alas the thing was not played. The sweetest morsel of the night moreover was, that the Musicians began pegging and fagging away at an overture---never did you see faces more in earnest, three times did they play it over, dropping all kinds of correctness and still did not the curtain draw up---Well then they went into a country-dance, then into a region they well knew, into their old boonsome Pothouse, and then to see how pompous o' the sudden they turned; how they looked about and chatted; how they did not care a damn; was a great treat--- I hope I have not tired you by this filling up of the dash in my last,--- Constable, the bookseller, has offered Reynolds ten guineas a sheet to write for his Magazine---it is an Edinburgh one which Blackwood's started up in opposition to. Hunt said he was nearly sure that the 'Cockney School' was written by Scott  238 so you are right Tom!--- There are no more little bits of news I can remember at present I remain, My dear Brothers, Your very affectionate Brother John Address : John Taylor Esqre  91 New Bond Street. Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 30 JA 1818. Friday My dear Taylor, These Lines, as they now stand, about Happiness have rung in my ears like a 'chime a mending'.  239 See here, Behold Wherein Lies happiness Poeona? fold--- This appears to me the very contrary of blessed. I hope this will appear to you more elegible. Wherein lies Happiness? In that which becks Our ready Minds to fellowship divine; A fellowship with essence, till we shine Full alchymized and free of space. Behold The clear Religion of heaven---fold. &c---  240 You must indulge me by putting this in for setting aside the badness of the other, such a preface is necessary to the subject. The whole thing must I think have appeared to you, who are a consequitive Man, as a thing almost of mere words---but I assure you that when I wrote it it was a regular stepping of the Imagination towards a Truth. My having written that Argument will perhaps be of the greatest Service to me of any thing I ever did. It set before me at once the gradations of Happiness even like a kind of Pleasure Thermometer---and is my first Step towards the chief attempt in the Drama--- the playing of different Natures with Joy and Sorrow. Do me this favor and believe me, Your sincere friend John Keats I hope your next Work will be of a more general Interest ---I suppose you cogitate a little about it now and then. Address : Mr J.H. Reynolds  Little Brittain  Christs Hospital. Postmark : 31 JA 1818. 241 Hampstead Saturday My Dear Reynolds I have parcell'd out this day for Letter Writing---more resolved thereon because your Letter will come as a refreshment and will have (sic parvis &c.) the same effect as a Kiss in certain situations where people become overgenerous. I have read this first sentence over, and think it savours rather; however an inward innocence is like a nested dove; or as the old song says. O blush not so, O blush not so or I shall think ye knowing; And if ye smile, the blushing while, Then Maidenheads are going. There's a blush for wont, and a blush for shan't And a blush for having done it, There's a blush for thought, and a blush for naught And a blush for just begun it. O sigh not so, O sigh not so For it sounds of Eve's sweet pippin. By those loosen'd Lips, you have tasted the pips And fought in an amorous nipping. Will ye play once more, at nice cut core For it only will last our youth out, And we have the prime of the Kissing time We have not one sweet tooth out. There's a sigh for yes, and a sigh for no, And a sigh for "I can't bear it"--- O what can be done, shall we stay or run O cut the sweet apple and share it. Now I purposed to write to you a serious poetical Letter, but I find that a maxim I met with the other day is a just one "On cause mieux quand on ne dit pas causons " I was hindered however from my first intention by a mere muslin Handkerchief very neatly pinned---but "Hence vain deluding  &c."  242 Yet I cannot write in prose, It is a sun-shiny day and I cannot so here goes, Hence Burgundy, Claret&Port, Away with old Hock and Madeira Too couthly  243 ye are for my sport There's a beverage brighter and clearer. Instead of a pitiful rummer My Wine overbrims a whole Summer My bowl is the sky And I drink at my eye Till I feel in the brain A delphian pain--- Then follow my Caius then follow On the Green of the Hill We will drink our fill Of golden sunshine Till our brains intertwine With the glory and grace of Apollo! \--- God of the Meridian And of the East and West to thee my soul is flown And my body is earthward press'd--- It is an awful mission A terrible division And leaves a gulph austere To be filled with worldly fear. Aye, when the Soul is fled To high above our head, Affrighted do we gaze After its airy maze--- As doth a Mother wild, When her young infant child Is in an eagle's claws--- And is not this the cause Of Madness? God of Song Thou bearest me along Through sights I scarce can bear O let me, let me share With the hot Lyre and thee, The staid Philosophy. Temper my lonely hours, And let me see thy bow'rs More unalarm'd!--- My Dear Reynolds, you must forgive all this ranting--- but the fact is, I cannot write sense this Morning---however you shall have some. I will copy my last Sonnet. When I have fears that I may cease to be Before my pen has glean'd my teeming brain, Before high piled Books in charactery Hold like rich garners the full ripen'd grain--- When I behold upon the night's starr'd face Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance, And feel that I may never live to trace Their shadows with the magic hand of chance: And when I feel, fair creature of an hour, That I shall never look upon thee more Never have relish in the fairy power Of unreflecting Love: then on the Shore Of the wide world I stand alone and think Till Love and Fame to Nothingness do sink.--- I must take a turn, and then write to Teignmouth. Remember me to all, not excepting yourself. Your sincere friend, John Keats. Address and postmark not recorded. Hampstead, Tuesday. My dear Reynolds, I thank you for your dish of Filberts---Would I could get a basket of them by way of dessert every day for the sum of two-pence  244 \---Would we were a sort of ethereal Pigs, and turn'd loose to feed upon spiritual Mast and Acorns--- which would be merely being a squirrel and feeding upon filberts, for what is a squirrel but an airy pig, or a filbert but a sort of archangelical acron. About the nuts being worth cracking, all I can say is that where there are a throng of delightful Images ready drawn simplicity is the only thing. The first is the best on account of the first line, and the "arrow---foil'd of its antler'd food", and moreover (and this is the only word or two I find fault with, the more because  245 I have had so much reason to shun it as a quicksand) the last has "tender and true".  246 \--- The trees in Sherwood forest are old and good,--- The grass beneath them now is dimly green; Are they deserted all? Is no young mien With loose-slung bugle met within the wood: No arrow found,---foil'd of its antler'd food,--- Struck in the oak's rude side? Is there nought seen, To mark the revelries which there have been,--- In the sweet days of merry Robin Hood? Go there, with Summer, and with evening,---go In the soft shadows like some wandering man,--- And thou shalt far amid the forest know The archer men in green, with belt and bow, Feasting on pheasant, river-fowl, and swan, With Robin at their head, and Marian. With coat of Lincoln green and mantle too, And horn of ivory mouth, and buckle bright, And arrows wing'd with peacock-feathers light, And trusty bow well gather'd of the yew,--- Stands Robin Hood:---and near, with eyes of blue Shining through dusk hair, like the stars of night, And habited in pretty forest plight,--- His green-wood beauty sits, tender and true. Oh gentle-tressed girl! Maid Marian! Are thine eyes bent upon the gallant game That stray in the merry Sherwood: thy sweet fame Can never, never die. And thou, high man, Would we might pledge thee with thy silver Can Of Rhenish, in the woods of Nottingham! We must cut this, and not be rattlesnaked into any more of the like---It may be said that we ought to read our Contemporaries ---that Wordsworth &c. should have their due from us. But, for the sake of a few fine imaginative or domestic passages, are we to be bullied into a certain Philosophy engendered in the whims of an Egotist---Every man has his speculations, but every man does not brood and peacock over them till he makes a false coinage and deceives himself. Many a man can travel to the very bourne of Heaven, and yet want confidence to put down his half-seeing. Sancho will invent a Journey heavenward as well as any body. We hate poetry that has a palpable design upon us---and if we do not agree, seems to put its hand in its breeches pocket. Poetry should be great and unobtrusive, a thing which enters into one's soul, and does not startle it or amaze it with itself, but with its subject.--- How beautiful are the retired flowers! how would they lose their beauty were they to throng into the highway crying out, "admire me I am a violet!---dote upon me I am a primrose! Modern poets differ from the Elizabethans in this. Each of the moderns like an Elector of Hanover governs his petty state, and knows how many straws are swept daily from the Causeways in all his dominions and has a continual itching that all the Housewives should have their coppers well scoured: the antients were Emperors of vast Provinces, they had only heard of the remote ones and scarcely cared to visit them.---I will cut all this--- I will have no more of Wordsworth or Hunt in particular ---Why should we be of the tribe of Manasseh, when we can wander with Esau? why should we kick against the Pricks, when we can walk on Roses? Why should we be owls, when we can be Eagles? Why be teased with "nice Eyed wagtails",  247 when we have in sight "the Cherub Contemplation"?  248 \---Why with Wordsworth's "Matthew with a bough of wilding in his hand"  249 when we can have Jacques "under an oak &c."?  250 \---The secret of the Bough of Wilding will run through your head faster than I can write it---Old Matthew spoke to him some years ago on some nothing, and because he happens in an Evening Walk to imagine the figure of the Old Man---he must stamp it down in black and white, and it is henceforth sacred---I don't mean to deny Wordsworth's grandeur and Hunt's merit, but I mean to say we need not be teazed with grandeur and merit when we can have them uncontaminated and unobtrusive.  251 Let us have the old Poets, and robin Hood. Your letter and its sonnets gave me more pleasure than will the 4th Book of Childe Harold  252 and the whole of anybody's life and opinions. In return for your Dish of filberts, I have gathered a few Catkins, I hope they'll look pretty. To J. H. R. In answer to his Robin Hood Sonnets. No! those days are gone away, And their hours are old and grey, And their Minutes buried all Under the down-trodden pall Of the leaves of many years. Many times have Winter's sheers, Frozen North and chilling East, Sounded Tempests to the feast Of the Forest's whispering fleeces, Since men paid no rent and Leases. No, the Bugle sounds no more, And the twanging bow no more; Silent is the ivory shrill Past the heath and up the Hill: There is no mid forest laugh, Where lone Echo gives the half To some wight amaz'd to hear Jesting, deep in forest drear. On the fairest time of June You may go with Sun or Moon, Or the seven stars to light you, Or the polar ray to right you; But you never may behold Little John or Robin bold; Never one of all the Clan Thrumming on an empty can Some old hunting ditty, while He doth his green way beguile To fair Hostess' Merriment Down beside the pasture Trent, For he left the merry tale, Messenger to spicy ale. Gone, the merry morris din, Gone the song of Gamelyn, Gone the tough-belted outlaw Idling in the 'grene shawe'  253 : All are gone away and past! And if Robin should be cast Sudden from his turfed grave; And if Marian should have Once again her forest days; She would weep, and he would craze: He would swear, for all his oaks, Fallen beneath the Dock-yard-strokes, Have rotted on the briny seas: She would weep that her wild bees Sang not to her---'Strange that honey Can't be got without hard money'. So it is: yet let us sing, Honor to the old bow-string, Honor to the Bugle horn, Honor to the woods unshorn, Honor to the Lincoln green, Honor to the archer keen, Honor to tight little John, And the horse he rode upon; Honor to bold Robin Hood Sleeping in the underwood, Honor to maid Marian, And to all the Sherwood-clan--- Though their days have hurried by Let us two a burden try. I hope you will like them---they are at least written in the Spirit of Outlawry---Here are the Mermaid lines. Souls of poets dead and gone, What Elysium have ye known, Happy field, or mossy cavern, Fairer than the Mermaid Tavern? Have ye tippled drink more fine Than mine Host's Canary wine? Or are fruits of Paradise Sweeter than those dainty pies Of Venison. O generous food Dress'd as though bold Robin Hood Would with his Maid Marian Sup, and bouze from horn and can. I have heard that on a day Mine host's sign-board flew away, Nobody knew whither, till An Astrologer's old quill To a sheepskin gave the story; Says he saw you in your glory Underneath a new old sign Sipping beverage divine, And pledging with contented smack The Mermaid in the Zodiac. Souls of Poets dead and gone, Are the winds a sweeter home, Richer is uncellar'd cavern Than the merry Mermaid Tavern? I will call on you at 4 to-morrow and we will trudge together for it is not the thing to be a stranger in the Land of Harpsicols.  254 I hope also to being you my 2d book.  255 In the hope that these Scribblings will be some amusement for you this evening ---I remain copying on the Hill Yr sincere friend and Co-scribbler, John Keats. No address or postmark. Thursday Morning My dear Haydon, I was at Reynolds's when he received your Letter and am therefore up to Probabilities---The fact is Reynolds is very unwell---he has all kinds of distressing Symptoms, and I am on this account rather glad that he has not spare time for one of our right Sort meetings---he would go too far for his health. I was right glad of your Letter from Devonshire---whereby that is I hope one day to see it---right sorry that you are going back to day. I hope 'tis not for long---I met a friend the other day who had seen Wordsworth's House the other Week---You will be glad to hear that I have finished my second Book  256 that is if this catches you at your Street-door---I have been gadding and did not see your Note  257 time to answer it sooner. Let me hear from Devon again--- Your's like a Pyramid John Keats--- My Brother George desires to be remembered to you--- Address : John Taylor Esqre  91 New Bond Street. Postmark : 5 FE 1818. Fleet Street Thurs. Morn My dear Taylor, I have finish'd coppying my Second Book  258 but I want it for one day to overlook it---and moreover this day I have very particular employ in the affair of Cripps---so I trespass on your indulgence and take advantage of your good nature. You shall hear from me or see me soon. I will tell Reynolds of your engagement ---tomorrow. Your's unfeignedly John Keats--- Address : Messrs. Keats Teignmouth Devon. Postmark not recorded. Hampstead Saturday Night. My dear Brothers When once a man delays a letter beyond the proper time, he delays it longer for one or two reasons; first, because he must begin in a very common-place style, that is to say, with an excuse; and secondly things and circumstances become so jumbled in his mind, that he knows not what, or what not, he has said in his last---I shall visit you as soon as I have copied my Poem all out, I am now much beforehand with the printer: they have done none yet, and I am half afraid they will let half the season by before the printing, I am determined they shall not trouble me when I have copied it all---Horace Smith has lent me his manuscript called "Nehemiah Muggs, an exposure of the Methodists" perhaps I may send you a few extracts.  259 Hazlitt's last lecture was on Thomson Cowper, and Crabbe. He praised Cowper and Thomson, but he gave Crabbe an unmerciful licking. I think Hunt's article of Fazio---no it was not, but I saw Fazio the first night, it hung rather heavily on me  260 \---I am in the high way of being introduced to a squad of people, Peter Pindar, Mrs Opie---Mrs Scott ---Mr Robinson, a great friend of Coleridge's, called on me---Richards tells me that my Poems are known in the West Country, and that he saw a very clever copy of verses, headed with a Motto from my Sonnet to George---Honors rush so thickly upon me that I shall not be able to bear up against them. What think you, am I to be crowned in the Capitol, am I to be made a Mandarin---No! I am to be invited, Mrs Hunt tells me, to a party at Ollier's to keep Shakespeare's birthday---Shakespeare would stare to see me there  261 \---The Wednesday before last Shelley, Hunt and I wrote each a Sonnet on the River Nile, some day you shall read them all. I saw a sheet of Endymion, and have all reason to suppose they will soon get it done, there shall be nothing wanting on my part. I have been writing at intervals many songs and Sonnets, and I long to be at Teignmouth, to read them over to you: however I think I had better wait till this Book is off my mind; it will not be long first. Reynolds has been writing two very capital articles, in the Yellow Dwarf, on Popular Preachers  262 \---All the talk here is about Dr. Croft, the Duke of Devon etc  263 Your most affectionate brother John Address : not recorded. Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 19 FE 1818. My dear Reynolds, I had an idea that a Man might pass a very pleasant life in this manner---let him on a certain day read a certain Page of full Poesy or distilled Prose, and let him wander with it, and muse upon it, and reflect upon it, and bring home to it, and prophesy upon it, and dream upon it, until it becomes stale---but when will it do so? Never. When Man has arrived at a certain ripeness in intellect any one grand and spiritual passage serves him as a starting-post towards all "the two-and-thirty Palaces".  264 How happy is such a voyage of conception, what delicious diligent Indolence! A doze upon a sofa does not hinder it, and a nap upon Clover engenders ethereal finger-pointings---the prattle of a child gives it wings, and the converse of middle-age a strength to beat them---a strain of music conducts to "an odd angle of the Isle",  265 and when the leaves whisper it puts a girdle round the earth.  266 Nor will this sparing touch of noble Books be any irreverence to their Writers--- for perhaps the honors paid by Man to Man are trifles in comparison to the Benefit done by great Works to the Spirit and pulse of good  267 by their mere passive existence. Memory should not be called knowledge. Many have original minds who do not think it---they are led away by Custom. Now it appears to me that almost any Man may like the spider spin from his own inwards his own airy Citadel---the points of leaves and twigs on which the spider begins her work are few, and she fills the air with a beautiful circuiting. Man should be content with as few points to tip with the fine Web of his Soul, and weave a tapestry empyrean full of symbols for his spiritual eye, of softness for his spiritual touch, of space for his wandering, of distinctness for his luxury. But the Minds of Mortals are so different and bent on such diverse journeys that it may at first appear impossible for any common taste and fellowship to exist between two or three under these suppositions. It is however quite the contrary. Minds would leave each other in contrary directions, traverse each other in numberless points, and at last greet each other at the journey's end. An old Man and a child would talk together and the old Man be led on his path and the child left thinking. Man should not dispute or assert but whisper results to his neighbour and thus by every germ of spirit sucking the sap from mould ethereal every human  268 might become great, and Humanity instead of being a wide heath of Furze  269 and Briars with here and there a remote Oak or Pine, would become a grand democracy of Forest Trees! It has been an old comparison for our urging on--- the Beehive; however, it seems to me that we should rather be the flower than the Bee---for it is a false notion that more is gained by receiving than giving---no, the receiver and the giver are equal in their benefits. The flower, I doubt not, receives a fair guerdon from the Bee---its leaves blush deeper in the next spring---and who shall say between Man and Woman which is the most delighted? Now it is more noble to sit like Jove than to fly like Mercury---let us not therefore go hurrying about and collecting honey, bee- like buzzing here and there impatiently from a knowledge of what is to be aimed at; but let us open our leaves like a flower and be passive and receptive---budding patiently under the eye of Apollo and taking hints from every noble insect that favours us with a visit---sap will be given us for meat and dew for drink. I was led into these thoughts, my dear Reynolds, by the beauty of the morning operating on a sense of Idleness---I have not read any Books---the Morning said I was right---I had no idea but of the morning, and the thrush said I was right--- seeming to say, O thou whose face hath felt the Winter's wind,  270 Whose eye has seen the snow-clouds hung in mist, And the black elm-tops 'mong the freezing stars, To thee the Spring will be a harvest-time. O thou, whose only book has been the light Of supreme darkness which thou feddest on Night after night when Phoebus was away, To thee the Spring shall be a triple morn. O fret not after knowledge---I have none, And yet my song comes native with the warmth. O fret not after knowledge---I have none, And yet the Evening listens. He who saddens At thought of idleness cannot be idle, And he's awake who thinks himself asleep. Now I am sensible all this is a mere sophistication (however it may neighbour to any truths), to excuse my own indolence---so I will not deceive myself that Man should be equal with Jove---but think himself very well off as a sort of scullion-Mercury, or even a humble Bee. It is no matter whether I am right or wrong, either one way or another, if there is sufficient to lift a little time from your shoulders. Your affectionate friend John Keats--- Address : Horace Smith Esqre  Knightsbridge Postmark : HAMPSTEAD; no date. Hampstead Thursd: Morn. My dear Sir, My Brothers are expecting me every day in devonshire, and I have some days work before I can go thither: so I am hardy enough to nullify the day I had expected to pass with you, and trespassing enough to ask your indulgence therefore--- I am being greatly amused with your Poem  271 \---it has a full leven of Wit and imaginative fun. I thank you for it now and will return it to Reynolds. Remember me to Shelley and Kingston. Your's very sincerely John Keats Address : Messrs. Keats Teignmouth Dover Postmark : not recorded. 272 Hampstead, Saturday. My dear Brothers I am extremely sorry to have given you so much uneasiness by not writing, however you know good news is no news or vice versa. I do not like to write a short letter to you, or you would have had one long before. The weather although boisterous to-day has been very much milder; and I think Devonshire is not the last place to receive a temperate Change. I have been abominably idle since you left, but have just turned over a new leaf, and used as a marker a letter of excuse to an invitation from Horace Smith. The occasion of my writing to-day is the enclosed letter---by Postmark from Miss Wylie. Does she expect you in town George? I received a letter the other day from Haydon, in which he says, his Essays on the Elgin Marbles are being translated into Italian, the which he superintends. I did not mention that I had seen the British Gallery, there are some nice things by Stark,  273 and Bathsheba by Wilkie, which is condemned.  274 I could not bear Alston's "Uriel". Reynolds has been very ill for some time, confined to the house, and had leeches applied to the chest; when I saw him on Wednesday he was much the same, and he is in the worst place in the world for amendment, among the strife of women's tongues, in a hot and parch'd room: I wish he would move to Butler's  275 for a short time. The Thrushes and Blackbirds have been singing me into an idea that it was Spring, and almost that leaves were on the trees. So that black clouds and boisterous winds seem to have mustered and collected to full Divan, for the purpose of convincing me to the contrary. Taylor says my poem shall be out in a month, I think he will be out before it.  276 ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) The thrushes are singing now as if they would speak to the winds, because their big brother Jack, the Spring, was not far off. I am reading Voltaire and Gibbon, although I wrote to Reynolds the other day to prove reading of no use; I have not seen Hunt since. I am a good deal with Dilke and Brown, we are very thick; they are very kind to me, they are well. I don't think I could stop in Hampstead but for their neighbourhood. I hear Hazlitt's lectures regularly, his last was on Gray, Collins, Young, &c., and he gave a very fine piece of discriminating Criticism on Swift, Voltaire, and Rabelais. I was very disappointed at his treatment of Chatterton. I generally meet with many I know there. Lord Byron's 4th Canto  277 is expected out, and I heard somewhere, that Walter Scott has a new Poem in readiness. I am sorry that Wordsworth has left a bad impression where-ever he visited in town by his egotism, Vanity, and bigotry. Yet he is a great poet if not a philosopher. I have not yet read Shelley's Poem,  278 I don't suppose you have it yet, at the Teignmouth libraries. These double letters must come rather heavy, I hope you have a moderate portion of cash, but don't fret at all, if you have not---Lord! I intend to play at Cut and run as well as Falstaff, that is to say, before he got so lusty. I remain praying for your health my dear Brothers Your affectionate Brother John--- Address : John Faylor Esqre  New bond Street No postmark. 279 Hampstead 27 Feby--- [ ] My dear Taylor, Your alteration strikes me as being a great improvement ---the page looks much better. And now I will attend to the Punctuations you speak of---the comma should be at soberly, 280 and in the other passage the comma should follow quiet, 281 I am extremely indebted to you for this attention and also for your after admonitions---It is a sorry thing for me that any one should have to overcome Prejudices in reading my Verses---that affects me more than any hypercriticism on any particular Passage. In Endymion I have most likely but moved into the Go-cart from the leading strings. In Poetry I have a few Axioms, and you will see how far I am from their Centre. 1st. I think Poetry should surprise by a fine excess and not by Singularity---it should strike the Reader as a wording of his own highest thoughts, and appear almost a Remembrance---2nd. Its touches of Beauty should never be half way ther eby making the reader breathless instead of content: the rise, the progress, the setting of imagery should like the Sun come natural natural too him---shine over him and set soberly although in magnificence leaving him in the Luxury of twilight--- but it is easier to think what Poetry should be than to write it---and this leads me on to another axiom. That if Poetry comes not as naturally as the Leaves to a tree it had better not come at all. However it may be with me I cannot help looking into new countries with 'O for a Muse of fire to ascend!'  282 If Endymion serves me as a Pioneer perhaps I ought to be content. I have great reason to be content, for thank God I can read and perhaps understand Shakspeare to his depths, and I have I am sure many friends, who, if I fail, will attribute any change in my Life and Temper to Humbleness rather than to Pride---to a cowering under the Wings of great Poets rather than to a Bitterness that I am not appreciated.  283 I am anxious to get Endymion printed that I may forget it and proceed. I have coppied the 3rd Book and have begun the 4th. On running my Eye over the Proofs---I saw one Mistake I will notice it presently and also any others if there be any. There should be no comma in 'the raft branch down sweeping from a tall ash top'. 284 I have besides made one or two alterations and also altered the 13 Line Page 32 to make sense of it as you will see. I will take care the Printer shall not trip up my Heels. There should be no dash after Dryope in this Line 'Dryope's lone lulling of her Child.  285 Remember me to Percy Street. Your sincere and obligd friend John Keats--- P.S. You shall have a short Preface in good time--- Address : Messrs Taylor  & Hessey. No postmark. My dear Sirs, I am this morning making a general clearance of all lent Books---all---I am affraid I do not return all---I must jog your memories about them---however with many thanks here are the remainder---which I am affraid are not worth so much now as they were six months ago---I mean the fashions may have changed--- Yours truly John Keats. Address : Mr B. Bailey  Magdalen Hall  Oxford--- Postmark : TEIGNMOUTH, undated. Teignmouth Friday My dear Bailey, When a poor devil is drowning, it is said he comes thrice to the surface, ere he makes his final sink---if however, even at the third rise, he can manage to catch hold of a piece of weed or rock, he stands a fair chance, as I hope I do now, of being saved. I have sunk twice in our Correspondence, have risen twice and been too idle, or something worse, to extricate myself. I have sunk the third time and just now risen again at this two of the Clock P.M. and saved myself from utter perdition---by beginning this, all drench'd as I am and fresh from the Water---and I would rather endure the present inconvenience of a Wet Jacket than you should keep a laced one in store for me. Why did I not stop at Oxford in my Way?---How can you ask such a Question? Why did I not promise to do so? Did I not in a Letter to you make a promise to do so? Then how can you be so unreasonable as to ask me why I did not? This is the thing--- (for I have been rubbing up my invention; trying several sleights---I first polish'd a cold, felt it in my fingers tried it on the table, but could not pocket it: I tried Chilblains, Rheumatism, Gout, tight Boots, nothing of that sort would do, so this is, as I was going to say, the thing.---I had a Letter from Tom saying how much better he had got, and thinking he had better stop---I went down to prevent his coming up. Will not this do? Turn it which way you like--- it is selvaged all round. I have used it these three last days to keep out the abominable Devonshire Weather---by the by you may say what you will of devonshire: the thuth is, it is a splashy, rainy, misty, snowy, foggy, haily, floody, muddy, slipshod County---the hills are very beautiful, when you get a sight of 'em---the Primroses are out, but then you are in---the Cliffs are of a fine deep Colour, but then the Clouds are continually vieing with them. The Women like your London People in a sort of negative way ---because the native men are the poorest creatures in England ---because Government never have thought it worth while to send a recruiting party among them. When I think of Wordsworth's Sonnet 'Vanguard of Liberty! ye Men of Kent!' the degenerated race about me are Pulvis Ipecac. Simplex---a strong dose.  286 Were I a Corsair I'd make a descent on the South Coast of Devon, if I did not run the chance of having Cowardice imputed to me: as for the Men they'd run away into the methodist meeting houses, and the Women would be glad of it. Had England been a large devonshire we should not have won the Battle of Waterloo. There are knotted oaks---there are lusty rivulets there are Meadows such as are not---there are vallies of femminine Climate but there are no thews and Sinews---Moor's Almanack  287 is here a curiosity---Arms Neck and Shoulders may at least be seen there, and the Ladies read it as some out of the way romance. Such a quelling Power have these thoughts over me that I fancy the very Air of a deteriorating quality---I fancy the flowers, all precocious, have an Acrasian  288 spell about them---I feel able to beat off the devonshire waves like soap froth. I think it well for the honor of Britain that Julius Caesar did not first land in this County. A Devonshirer standing on his native hills is not a distinct object---he does not show against the light---a wolf or two would dispossess him. I like I love England. I like its strong Men. Give me a long brown plain  289 for my Morning so I may meet with some of Edmond Ironside's descendants. Give me a barren mould so I may meet with some Shadowing of Alfred in the Shape of a Gipsey, a Huntsman or a Shepherd. Scenery is fine---but human nature is finer. The Sward is richer for the tread of a real, nervous, english foot---the eagles nest is finer for the Mountaineer has look'd into it---Are these facts or prejudices? Whatever they are, for them I shall never be able to relish entirely any devonshire scenery---Homer is very fine, Achilles is fine, Diomed is fine, Shakspeare is fine, Hamlet is fine, Lear is fine, but dwindled englishmen are not fine---Where too the Women are so passable, and have such english names, such as Ophelia, Cordelia &c---that they should have such Paramours or rather Imparamours. As for them I cannot, in thought help wishing as did the cruel Emperour, that they had but one head and I might cut it off to deliver them from any horrible Courtesy they may do their undeserving Countrymen.---I wonder I meet with no born Monsters---O Devonshire, last night I thought the Moon had dwindled in heaven. I have never had your Sermon from Wordsworth but Mrs Dilke lent it me. You know my ideas about Religion. I do not think myself more in the right than other people, and that nothing in this world is proveable. I wish I could enter into all your feelings on the subject merely for one short 10 Minutes and give you a Page or two to your liking. I am sometimes so very sceptical as to think Poetry itself a mere Jack a lanthen to amuse whoever may chance to be struck with its brilliance. As Tradesmen say every thing is worth what it will fetch, so probably every mental pursuit takes its reality and worth from the ardour of the pursuer---being in itself a nothing---Ethereal things may at least be thus real, divided under three heads---Things real---things semireal ---and no things. Things real---such as existences of Sun Moon & Stars and passages of Shakspeare. Things semireal such as Love, the Clouds &c which require a greeting of the Spirit to make them wholly exist---and Nothings which are made Great and dignified by an ardent pursuit ---which by the by stamps the burgundy mark on the bottles of our Minds, insomuch as they are able to " consec rate whate'er they look upon ".  290 I have written a Sonnet  291 here of a somewhat collateral nature---so don't imagine it an a propos des bottes. Four Seasons fill the Measure of the year; Four Seasons are there in the mind of Man. He hath his lusty spring when fancy clear Takes in all beauty with an easy span: He hath his Summer, when luxuriously He chews the honied cud of fair spring thoughts, Till, in his Soul dissolv'd they come to be Part of himself. He hath his Autumn ports And Havens of repose, when his tired wings Are folded up, and he content to look On Mists in idleness: to let fair things Pass by unheeded as a threshhold brook. He hath his Winter too of pale Misfeature, Or else he would forget his mortal nature. Aye this may be carried---but what am I talking of--- it is an old maxim of mine and of course must be well known that every point of thought is the centre of an intellectual world---the two uppermost thoughts in a Man's mind are the two poles of his World he revolves on them and every thing is southward or northward to him through their means. We take but three steps from feathers to iron. Now my dear fellow I must once for all tell you I have not one Idea of the truth of any of my speculations---I shall never be a Reasoner because I care not to be in the right, when retired from bickering and in a proper philosophical temper. So you must not stare if in any future letter I endeavour to prove that Apollo as he had cat gut strings to his Lyre used a cats' paw as a Pecten---and further from said Pecten's reiterated and continual teasing came the term Hen peck'd. My Brother Tom desires to be remember'd to you---he has just this moment had a spitting of blood poor fellow. Remember me to Greig  292 and Whitehead--- Your affectionate friend John Keats--- Address : Mr John H. Reynolds Little Brittain Christs Hospital London. Postmark : not recorded. Teignmouth Saturday Dear Reynolds, I escaped being blown over and blown under & trees & house being toppled on me.---I have since hearing of Brown's accident had an aversion to a dose of parapet, and being also a lover of antiquities I would sooner have a harmless piece of herculaneum sent me quietly as a present than ever so modern a chimney pot tumbled onto my head  293 \---Being agog to see some Devonshire, I would have taken a walk the first day, but the rain wod not let me; and the second, but the rain wod not let me; and the third, but the rain forbade it---Ditto 4-ditto 5-ditto---So I made up my Mind to stop in doors, and catch a sight flying between the showers; and behold I saw a pretty valley---pretty cliffs, pretty Brooks, pretty Meadows, pretty trees, both standing as they were created, and blown down as they are uncreated---The green is beautiful, as they say, and pity it is that it is amphibious---mais! but alas! the flowers here wait as naturally for the Rain twice a day as the Muscles do for the Tide,---so we look upon a brook in these parts as you look upon a dash in your Country--- there must be something to support this, aye fog, hail, snow rain---Mist---blanketing up three parts of the year--- This devonshire is like Lydia Languish, very entertaining when at smiles, but cursedly subject to sympathetic moisture. You have the sensation of walking under one great Lamplighter: and you can't go on the other side of the ladder to keep your frock clean, and cosset your superstition. Buy a girdle---put a pebble in your Mouth---loosen your Braces---for I am going among Scenery whence I intend to tip you the Damosel Radcliffe  294 \---I'll cavern you, and grotto you, and waterfall you, and wood you, and water you, and immense-rock you, and tremendous-sound you, and solitude you. I'll make a lodgment on your glacis by a row of Pines, and storm your covered way with bramble Bushes. I'll have at you with hip and haw smallshot, and cannonade you with Shingles---I'll be witty upon salt fish,  295 and impede your cavalry with clotted cream. But ah Coward! to talk at this rate to a sick man, or I hope to one that was sick---for I hope by this you stand on your right foot---If you are not---that's all,---I intend to cut all sick people if they do not make up their minds to cut sickness ---a fellow to whom I have a complete aversion, and who strange to say is harboured and countenanced in several houses where I visit---he is sitting now quite impudent between me and Tom---he insults me at poor Jem Rice's---and you have seated him before now between us at the Theatre---when I thought he look'd with a longing eye at poor Kean. I shall say, once for all, to my friends generally and severally, cut that fellow, or I cut you---I went to the Theatre here the other night which I forgot to tell George, and got insulted, which I ought to remember to forget to tell any Body; for I did not fight, and as yet have had no redress---"Lie thou there, sweetheart!"  296 I wrote to Bailey yesterday, obliged to speak in a high way, and a damme who's affraid,---for I had owed him so long; however, he shall see I will be better in future. Is he in Town yet? I have directed to Oxford as the better chance. I have copied my fourth Book, and shall write the preface soon. I wish it was all done; for I want to forget it and make my mind free for something new---Atkins the Coachman, Bartlet the Surgeon, Simmons  297 the Barber, and the Girls over at the Bonnet shop, say we shall now have a Month of seasonable Weather---warm, witty, and full of invention.  298 Write to me and tell me you are well or thereabouts, or by the holy Beaucoeur ---which I suppose is the virgin Mary, or the repented Magdalen, (beautiful name, that Magdalen) I'll take to my Wings and fly away to anywhere but old or Nova Scotia---  299 I wish I had a little innocent bit of Metaphysic in my head, to criss-cross this letter: but you know a favorite tune is hardest to be remembered when one wants it most and you, I know have long ere this taken it for granted that I never have any speculations without associating you in them, where they are of a pleasant nature, and you know enough to for of me to tell the places where I haunt most, so that if you think for five minutes after having read this you will find it a long letter, and see written in the Air above you, Your most affectionate friend John Keats. Remember me to all. Tom's remembrances to you. My dear Keats/ I shall certainly go mad!---In a field at Stratford upon-Avon, in a field that belonged to Shakespeare; they have found a gold ring and seal 300 with the initial thus---WS within a circle  a true Lover's knot between ; if this is not Shakespeare who is it?---a true lover's knott.!!--- I saw an impression to day, and am to have one as soon as possible--- As sure as you breathe,  & that he was the first of beings the Seal belonged to him--- \---Oh Lord !--- B R Haydon Address : B R Haydon Esq---  Lisson Grove North  Paddington  Middx Postmarks : TEIGNMOUTH and 23 MR 1818. 301 Teignmouth Saturd.

Such a piece of intelligence came doubly welcome to me while in your own County and in your own hand---not but I have blown up said County for its urinal qualifications ---the 6 first days I was here it did nothing but rain and at that time having to write to a friend I gave Devonshire a good blowing up---it has been fine for about three days and I was coming round a bit; but to day it rains again ---with me the County is yet upon its good behaviour. I have enjoyed the most delightful Walks these three fine days beautiful enough to make me content here all the summer could I stay. 303 For there's Bishop's teign And King's teign And Coomb at the clear teign head.

Ye tight little fairy---just fresh from the dairy Will ye give me some cream if I ask it--- I love your Meads and I love your flowers And I love your junkets mainly  304 But 'hind the door, I love kissing more O look not so disdainly! I love your Hills and I love your dales And I love your flocks a bleating--- But O on the hether to lie together With both our hearts a beating. I'll put your Basket all safe in a nook And your shawl I hang up on this willow And we will sigh in the daisy's eye And Kiss on a grass green pillow. I know not if this rhyming fit has done anything---it will be safe with you if worthy to put among my Lyrics How does the Work go on? I should like to bring out my Dentatus  305 at the time your Epic makes its appearance. I expect to have my Mind soon clear for something new. Tom has been much worse: but is now getting better--- his remembrances to you---I think of seeing the dart and Plymouth---but I dont know. It has as yet been a Mystery to me how and when Wordsworth went. I cant help thinking he has returned to his Shell---with his beautiful Wife and his enchanting Sister. It is a great Pity that People should by associating themselves with the finest things, spoil them. Hunt has damned Hampstead and Masks and Sonnets and italian tales---Wordsworth has damned the lakes--- Millman has damned the old drama  306 \--- West has damned---wholesale---Peacock has damned sattire,  307 Ollier has damn'd Music  308 \---Hazlitt has damned the bigotted and the bluestockined how durst the Man?! he is your only good damner and if ever I am damn'd---damn me if  309 I shoul'nt like him to damn me. It will not be long ere I see you, but I thought I would just give you a line out of Devon--- Your's affectionately John Keats Rember me to all we know Address : John Keats Esq.  Teignmouth  Devonshire Postmark : 2 AP 1818. March 25th 1818 My dear Keats, Your bi-ell as you call it, is beautiful & I take it as a great friendly kindness to remember me in that way---as often as you feel inclined to give vent remember I am always ready with pleasure to receive the result---Surely you will not leave Devonshire without going to Plymouth the country round which is most exquisite---I will give you letters and promise you a kind & a welcome reception---Do go my dear Keats, and if you consent let me know & I will write my Friends immediately, and go round by the Totness road which is very fine, & come home by Ashburton, and then by Bridgewater where I have a sister who will be most happy to see you---I am getting on well, & have got my Christ better than I have ever had it yet---and in a good state to compleat it ---I am most happy to hear your Poem is advancing to publication, God grant it the most compleat success, and may its reputation equal your genius--- Devonshire has somehow or other the character of being rainy, but I must own to you I do not think it is more so than any other County, and pray remember the time of year; it has rained in Town almost incessantly ever since you went away, the fact is you dog you carried the rain with you as Ulysses did the Winds and then opening your rain bags you look round with a knowing wink, and say 'curse this Devonshire how it rains!' Stay till the Summer, and then bask in its deep blue summer Sky, and lush grass, & tawny banks, and silver bubbling rivers---you must not leave Devonshire without seeing some of its Scenery, rocky, mossy, craggy with roaring rivers & as clear as crystal---it will do your mind good--- Shakespeare in speaking of somebody who is gradually dying makes some one say---"how is he?"---still ill nature & sickness debate it at their leisure "  310 \---is this not exquisite? When I die I'll have my Shakespeare placed on my heart, with Homer in my right hand  & Ariosto in the other, Dante under my head, Tasso at my feet, & Corneille under my ---. I hate that Corneille, a heartless tirade maker---I leave my other side that is my right one, for you, if you realize all of which your Genius is capable, as I am sure you will--- Write me if you go to Devonshire. 311 Mrs Scott "con occhi neri" is as interesting as ever & desires to be remembered---I have heard nothing of Wordsworth ever since he went, which I take to be unkind---Hazlitt is going to lecture at Crown & Anchor I am sorry for it, tho' he will get money, it is letting his talents down a little---What affectation in Hunt's title---" Foliage "!---I met that horrid creature Miss Kent, looking like a fury  & an old maid, mixed--- Yours ever dr Keats, B R Haydon Address : Jno.

I have indeed been sanguine; whenever he has occurred to my thoughts he has appeared nearly in good health, every answer I have given to enquiring Friends has been "much better" and "improving every day". I can hardly beleive this melancholy news, having so long accustomed myself to think altogether otherwise---I hope and trust that your kind superintendance will prevent any violent bleeding in future, and consequently that this alarm may prove in the end advantageous; Tom must never again presume on his strength, at all events untill he has completely recover'd. John Reynolds is little better, in many respects worse, he has a very bad rheumatic Fever, and suffers constant pain: it is not said that he is dangerously ill, but I cannot help thinking that so many evils acting upon his most irritable disposition; deadening his hopes of his advance in business, consequently all his hopes, must make this illness somewhat dangerous.---I called yesterday but he was not sufficiently well to be seen. His Sisters are well---Your letter  312 was most welcome to him. Bailey's in Town for a few days, on business for Glegg---I have not seen him.---Mrs Scott desires her compliments to you and Tom. I have repeatedly called on Taylor & Hessey and have never found them at home, or you should long since have known the progress of your book. Brown has I understand written to you and given you the pleasant information that the printer's are in immediate want of the Fourth book and preface. By the time you have received this I have no doubt but T & H will have received them.---The inclosed 20 pounds No. 834 dated 3rd Feby--- 1818, will reach you before you are quite aground. I am about paying your's as well as Tom's bills, of which I shall keep regular accounts and for the sake of justice and a future proper understanding I intend calculating the probable amount Tom and I are indebted to you, something of this kind must be done, or at the end of two or three years we shall be all at sixes and sevens, let me know when you want Money. I have paid Hodgkinson who desires his best rems.--- I'll write Tom soon give my love to him---rems to Miss M & C---and love to the Miss J's 313 \---Miss Wylie as usual desires her respects to you, and best wishes to Tom---R Draper has been teazing throughout the writing of this to my great annoyance--- Good bye for the present Your most affectionate Brother ---George.

Teignmouth Saturday Morn--- My dear Sirs, I had no idea of your getting on so fast---I thought of bringing my 4th Book to Town all in good-time for you, especially after the late unfortunate chance. I did not however for my own sake delay finishing the copy which was done a few days after my arrival here. I send it off to day, and will tell you in a Postscript at what time to send for it from the Bull and Mouth or other Inn. You will find the Preface and dedication, and the title Page as I should wish it to stand---for a ramance is a fine thing notwithstanding the circulating Libraries. My respects to Mrs Hessey and to Percy Street. Your's very sincerely John Keats P.S. I have been advised to send it to you---you may expect it on Monday for I send it by the Post-man to Exeter at the same time with this Letter. Adieu Address : Mr James Rice Junr  Poland Street  Oxford Street  London--- Postmarks : TEIGNMOUTH and 26 MR 1818. Teignmouth Tuesday, My dear Rice, Being in the midst of your favorite Devon, I should not by rights, pen one word but it should contain a vast portion of Wit, Wisdom, and learning---for I have heard that Milton ere he wrote his Answer to Salmasius came into these parts, and for one whole Month, rolled himself, for three whole hours in a certain meadow hard by us ---where the mark of his nose at equidistances is still shown. The exhibitor of said Meadow further saith that after these rollings, not a nettle sprang up in all the seven acres for seven years and that from said time a new sort of plant was made from the white thorn, of a thornless nature very much used by the Bucks of the present day to rap their Boots withall. This account made me very naturally suppose that the nettles and thorns etherealized by the Scholars rotatory motion and garner'd in his head thence flew after a new fermentation against the luckless Salmasius and occasioned his well known and unhappy end. What a happy thing it would be if we could settle our thoughts, make our minds up on any matter in five Minutes and remain content---that is to build a sort of mental Cottage of feelings quiet and pleasant---to have a sort of Philosophical Back Garden, and cheerful holiday-keeping front one---but Alas! this never can be: for as the material Cottager knows there are such places as france and Italy and the Andes and the Burning Mountains---so the spiritual Cottager has knowledge of the terra semi incognita of things unearthly; and cannot for his Life, keep in the check rein ---Or I should stop here quiet and comfortable in my theory of Nettles. You will see however I am obliged to run wild, being attracted by the Loadstone Concatenation. No sooner had I settled the knotty point of Salmasius that  for than  the Devil put this whim into my head in the likeness of one of Pythagora's questionings 'Did Milton do more good or harm to the world? He wrote let me inform you (for I have it from a friend, who had it of---) he wrote Lycidas, Comus, Paradise Lost and other Poems, with much delectable prose---he was moreover an active friend to Man all his Life and has been since his death. Very good---but my dear fellow I must let you know that as there is ever the same quantity of matter constituting this habitable globe---as the ocean notwithstanding the enormous changes and revolutions taking place in some or other of its demesnes--- notwithstanding Waterspouts whirlpools and mighty Rivers emptying themselves into it, it still is made up of the same bulk---nor ever varies the number of its Atoms---and as a certain bulk of Water was instituted at the Creation---so very likely a certain portion of intellect was spun forth into the thin Air for the Brains of Man to prey upon it. You will see my drift without any unnecessary parenthesis. That which is contained in the Pacific and  314 lie in the hollow of the Caspian ---that which was in Miltons head could not find Room in Charles the seconds---he like a Moon attracted Intellect to its flow---it has not ebbed yet---but has left the shore pebble all bare---I mean all Bucks  315 Authors of Hengist and Castlereaghs of the present day---who without Miltons gormandizing might have been all wise Men. Now for as much as---I was very predisposed to a Country I had heard you speak so highly of, I took particular notice of every thing during my journey and have bought some folio asses Skin for Memorandums. I have seen every thing but the wind---and that they say becomes visible by taking a dose of Acorns or sleeping one night in a hog trough with your tail to the Sow Sow West. Some of the little Barmaids look'd at me as if I knew Jem Rice---but when I took torn Brandy they were quite convinced. One asked whether you preserved  316 a secret she gave you on the nail---another how many buttons of your Coat were buttoned in general.---I told her it used to be four---but since you had become acquainted with one Martin you had reduced it to three and had been turning this third one in your Mind--- and would do so with finger and thumb only you had taken to snuff. I have met with a Brace or twain of little Long heads---not a bit o' the german---all in the neatest little dresses, and avoiding all the puddles---but very fond of peppermint drops, laming ducks, and seeing little Girls affairs. Well I can't tell! I hope you are showing poor Reynolds the way to get well---send me a good account of him and if I can I'll send you one of Tom. Oh! for a day and all well! I went yesterday to dawlish fair--- Over the hill and over the dale, And over the bourn to Dawlish--- Where Gingerbread Wives have a scanty sale And gingerbread nuts are smallish. Rantipole Betty she ran down a hill And kick'd up her petticoats fairly Says I I'll be Jack if you will be Gill. So she sat on the Grass debonnairly. Here's somebody coming, here's somebody coming! Says I 'tis the Wind at a parley So without any fuss any hawing and humming She lay on the grass debonnairly. Here's somebody here and here's somebody there! Say's I hold your tongue you young Gipsey. So she held her tongue and lay plump and fair And dead as a venus tipsy. O who would'nt hie to Dawlish fair O who would'nt stop in a Meadow O who would not rumple the daisies there And make the wild fern for a bed do. Tom's Remembrances and mine to all--- Your sincere friend John Keats Address : Mr J. H. Reynolds  Little Britain  Christ's Hospital  London. Postmark : not recorded. Teignmouth, 25 March 1818. Dear Reynolds, as last night I lay in bed, There came before my eyes that wonted thread Of Shapes, and Shadows and Remembrances, That every other minute vex and please: Things all disjointed come from North and south, Two witch's eyes above a Cherub's mouth, Voltaire with casque and shield and Habergeon,  317 And Alexander with his night-cap on--- Old Socrates a tying his cravat; And Hazlitt playing with Miss Edgeworth's cat; And Junius Brutus pretty well so, so,  318 Making the best of's way towards Soho. Few are there who escape these visitings--- P'erhaps one or two, whose lives have patent wings; And through whose curtains peeps no hellish nose, No wild boar tushes,  319 and no Mermaid's toes: But flowers bursting out with lusty pride; And young Æolian harps personified, Some, Titian colours touch'd into real life.--- The sacrifice goes on; the pontif knife Gleams in the sun, the milk-white heifer lows, The pipes go shrilly, the libation flows: A white sail shews above the green-head cliff Moves round the point, and throws her anchor stiff. The Mariners join hymn with those on land.--- You know the Enchanted Castle it doth stand Upon a Rock on the Border of a Lake Nested in Trees, which all do seem to shake From some old Magic like Urganda's  320 sword. O Phoebus that I had thy sacred word To shew this Castle in fair dreaming wise Unto my friend, while sick and ill he lies. You know it well enough, where it doth seem A mossy place, a Merlin's Hall, a dream. You know the clear Lake, and the little Isles, The Mountains blue, and cold near neighbour rills--- All which elsewhere are but half animate Here do they look alive to love and hate; To smiles and frowns; they seem a lifted mound Above some giant, pulsing underground. Part of the building was a chosen See Built by a banish'd Santon of Chaldee:  321 The other part two thousand years from him Was built by Cuthbert de Saint Aldebrim; Then there's a little wing, far from the Sun, Built by a Lapland Witch turn'd Maudlin nun--- And many other juts of aged stone Founded with many a mason-devil's groan. The doors all look as if they oped themselves, The windows as if latch'd by fays & elves--- And from them comes a silver flash of light As from the Westward of a Summer's night; Or like a beauteous woman's large blue eyes Gone mad through olden songs and Poesies--- See what is coming from the distance dim! A golden galley all in silken trim! Three rows of oars are lightening moment-whiles Into the verdurous bosoms of those Isles. Towards the Shade under the Castle Wall It comes in silence---now tis hidden all. The clarion sounds; and from a postern grate An echo of sweet music doth create A fear in the poor herdsman who doth bring His beasts to trouble the enchanted spring: He tells of the sweet music and the spot To all his friends, and they believe him not. O that our dreamings all of sleep or wake Would all their colours from the Sunset take: From something of material sublime, Rather than shadow our own Soul's daytime In the dark void of Night. For in the world We jostle---but my flag is not unfurl'd On the Admiral staff---and to philosophize I dare not yet!---Oh never will the prize, High reason, and the love of good and ill Be my award. Things cannot to the will Be settled, but they tease us out of thought. Or is it that Imagination brought Beyond its proper bound, yet still confined,--- Lost in a sort of Purgatory blind, Cannot refer to any standard law Of either earth or heaven?---It is a flaw In happiness to see beyond our bourn--- It forces us in Summer skies to mourn: It spoils the singing of the Nightingale. Dear Reynolds. I have a mysterious tale And cannot speak it. The first page I read Upon a Lampit Rock of green sea weed Among the breakers---'Twas a quiet Eve; The rocks were silent---the wide sea did weave An untumultuous fringe of silver foam Along the flat brown sand. I was at home, And should have been most happy---but I saw Too far into the sea; where every maw The greater on the less feeds evermore:--- But I saw too distinct into the core Of an eternal fierce destruction, And so from Happiness I far was gone. Still am I sick of it: and though to-day I've gathered young spring-leaves, and flowers gay Of Periwinkle and wild strawberry, Still do I that most fierce destruction see, The Shark at savage prey---the hawk at pounce, The gentle Robin, like a pard or ounce, Ravening a worm---Away ye horrid moods, Moods of one's mind!  322 You know I hate them well, You know I'd sooner be a clapping bell To some Kamschatkan missionary church, Than with these horrid moods be left in lurch--- Do you get health---and Tom the same---I'll dance, And from detested moods in new Romance Take refuge---Of bad lines a Centaine dose Is sure enough---and so "here follows prose"  323 .--- My dear Reynolds, In hopes of cheering you through a Minute or two, I was determined nill he will he to send  324 you some lines so you'll excuse the unconnected subject, & careless verse. You know, I am sure, Claude's Enchanted Castle, and I wish you may be pleased with my remembrance of it. The Rain is come on again I think with me Devonshire stands a very poor chance. I shall damn it up hill and down dale, if it keeps up to the average of 6 fine days in three weeks. Let me have better news of you. Yr affectte Friend John Keats Toms Remembs to you. ReMr us to all--- Address : B R Haydon Esqr  Lisson Grove North  Paddington Middx Postmarks : TEIGNMOUTH and 10 AP 1818. 325 Wednesday--- My dear Haydon, I am glad you were pleased with my nonsense and if it so happen that the humour takes me when I have set down to prose to you I will not gainsay it. I should be (god forgive me) ready to swear because I cannot make use of your assistance in going through Devon if I was not in my own Mind determined to visit it thoroughly at some more favorable time of the year. But now Tom (who is getting greatly better) is anxious to be in Town therefore I put off my threading the County. I purpose within a Month to put my knapsack at my back and make a pedestrian tour through the North of England, and part of Scotland ---to make a sort of Prologue to the Life I intend to pursue---that is to write, to study and to see all Europe at the lowest expence. I will clamber through the Clouds and exist. I will get such an accumulation of stupendous recollolections that as I walk through the suburbs of London I may not see them---I will stand upon Mount Blanc and remember this coming Summer when I intend to straddle ben Lomond---with my Soul!---galligaskins are out of the Question---I am nearer myself to hear your Christ is being tinted into immortality---Believe me Haydon your picture is a part of myself---I have ever been too sensible of the labyrinthian path to eminence in Art (judging from Poetry) ever to think I understood the emphasis of Painting. The innumerable compositions and decompositions which take place between the intellect and its thousand materials before it arrives at that trembling delicate and snail-horn  326 perception of Beauty. I know not your many havens of intenseness---nor ever can know them---but for this I hope nought you adchieve is lost upon me: for when a Schoolboy the abstract Idea I had of an heroic painting---was what I cannot describe I saw it somewhat sideways large prominent round and colour'd with magnificence---somewhat like the feel I have of Anthony and Cleopatra. Or of Alcibiades, leaning on his Crimson Couch in his Galley, his broad shoulders imperceptibly heaving with the Sea---That  for What  passage in Shakspeare is finer than this 'See how the surly Warwick mans the Wall'  327 I like your consignment of Corneille---that's the humor of it  328 \---They shall be called your Posthumous Works. I don't understand your bit of Italian.  329 I hope she will awake from her dream and flourish fair---my respects to her. The Hedges by this time are beginng to leaf---Cats are becoming more vociferous---young Ladies that wear Watches are always looking at them---Women about forty five think the Season very backward---Ladie's Mares have but half an allowance of food---It rains here again, has been doing so for three days ---however as I told you I'll take a trial in June July or August next year. I am affraid Wordsworth went rather huff'd out of Town ---I am sorry for it. he cannot expect his fireside Divan to be infallible he cannot expect but that every Man of worth is as proud as himself. O that he had not fit with a Warrener  330 that is din'd at Kingston's. I shall be in town in about a fortnight and then we will have a day or so now and then before I set out on my northern expedition---we will have no more abominable Rows---for they leave one is  for in  a fearful silence having settled the Methodists let us be rational ---not upon compulsion---no if it will out let it---but I will not play the Basson any more deliberately  331 \---Remember me to Hazlitt, and Bewick  332 \--- Your affectionate friend John Keats--- Address : J H Reynolds Esq  Little Brittain  Christs Hospital London. Postmark : not recorded. Thy Morng My Dear Reynolds, Since you all agree that the thing  333 is bad, it must be so---though I am not aware there is anything like Hunt in it, (and if there is, it is my natural way, and I have something in common with Hunt) look it over again and examine into the motives, the seeds from which any one sentence sprung---I have not the slightest feel of humility towards the Public---or to anything in existence,---but the eternal Being, the Principle of Beauty, and the Memory of great Men---When I am writing for myself for the mere sake of the Moment's enjoyment, perhaps nature has its course with me---but a Preface is written to the Public; a thing I cannot help looking upon as an Enemy, and which I cannot address without feelings of Hostility---If I write a Preface in a supple or subdued style, it will not be in character with me as a public speaker---I wod be subdued before my friends, and thank them for subduing me---but among Multitudes of Men---I have no feel of stooping, I hate the idea of humility to them--- I never wrote one single Line of Poetry with the least Shadow of public thought. Forgive me for vexing you and making a Trojan horse of such a Trifle, both with respect to the matter in Question, and myself---but it eases me to tell you---I could not live without the love of my friends---I would jump down Ætna for any great Public Good---but I hate a Mawkish Popularity. ---I cannot be subdued before them---My glory would be to daunt and dazzle the thousand jabberers about Pictures and Books---I see swarms of Porcupines with their Quills erect "like lime-twigs set to catch my Winged Book"  334 and I would fright 'em away with a torch---You will say my preface is not much of a Torch. It would have been too insulting "to begin from Jove" and I could not set a golden head upon a thing of clay---if there is any fault in the preface it is not affectation: but an undersong of disrespect to the Public--- if I write another preface, it must be done without a thought of those people ---I will think about it.  335 If it should not reach you in four---or five days---tell Taylor to publish it without a preface, and let the dedication simply stand "inscribed to the Memory of Thomas Chatterton". I had resolved last night to write to you this morning ---I wish it had been about something else---something to greet you towards the close of your long illness---I have had one or two intimations of your going to Hampstead for a space; and I regret to see your confounded Rheumatism keeps you in Little Britain where I am sure the air is too confined---Devonshire continues rainy. As the drops beat against the window, they give me the same sensation as a quart of cold water offered to revive a half-drowned devil---No feel of the clouds dropping fatness; but as if the roots of the Earth were rotten cold and drench'd---I have not been able to go to Kents' Cave at Babbicum---however on one very beautiful day I had a fine Clamber over the Rocks all along as far as that place: I shall be in Town in about Ten days.---We go by way of Bath on purpose to call on Bailey. I hope soon to be writing to you about the things of the north, purposing to wayfare all over those parts. I have settled my accoutrements in my own mind, and will go to gorge wonders: However we'll have some days together before I set out--- I have many reasons for going wonder-ways: to make my winter chair free from spleen  336 \---to enlarge my vision--- to escape disquisitions on Poetry and Kingston Criticism  337 \---to promote digestion and economise shoe-leather---I'll have leather buttons and belt; and if Brown holds his mind, over the Hills we go.---If my Books will help me to it,---thus will I take all Europe in turn,  338 and see the Kingdoms of the Earth and the glory of them---Tom is getting better he hopes you may meet him at the top o' the hill--- My Love to your nurses. I am ever Your affectionate Friend, John Keats. Address : John H. Reynolds Esq  Little Brittain  Christs Hospital London. Postmark : not recorded. Friday My dear Reynolds, I am anxious you shod find this Preface  339 tolerable. If there is an affectation in it, 'tis natural to me---Do let the Printer's Devil cook it, and let me be as 'the casing air'.  340 You are too good in this Matter---were I in your state, I am certain I should have no thought but of discontent and illness---I mighttho' be taught patience: I had an idea of giving no Preface; however, don't you think this had better go?.---O, let it---one should not be too timid---of committing faults. The Climate here weighs us down completely---Tom is quite low-spirited---It is impossible to live in a country which is continually under hatches---Who would live in the region of Mists, Game Laws, indemnity Bills &c. when there is such a place as Italy? It is said this England from its Clime produces a Spleen, able to engender the finest Sentiment---and cover the whole face of the Isle with Green---so it ought, I'm sure.---I should still like the Dedication simply as I said in my last.  341 \--- H.B.F. I wanted to send you a few songs written in your favorite Devon---it cannot be ---Rain! Rain! Rain! I am going this morning to take a fac-simile of a Letter of Nelson's, very much to his honor---you will be greatly pleased when you see it---in about a week---What a spite it is, one cannot get out the little way I went yesterday I found a lane bank'd on each side with store of Primroses, while the earlier bushes are beginning to leaf. I shall hear a good Account of you soon Your affectionate Friend John Keats. My Love to all and remember me to Taylor. Address : John Taylor Esqre  Taylor  & Hessey's  Booksellers &c  Fleet Street. Postmarks : TEIGNMOUTH and 27 AP 1818. Teignmouth Friday 342  My dear Taylor, I think I did very wrong to leave you to all the trouble of Endymion---but I could not help it then---another time I shall be more bent to all sort of troubles and disagreeables ---young Men for some time have an idea that such a thing as happiness is to be had  343 and therefore are extremely impatient under any unpleasant restraining---in time however, of such stuff is the world about them, they know better and instead of striving from Uneasiness greet it as an habitual sensation, a pannier which is to weigh upon them through life. And in proportion to my disgust at the task is my sense of your kindness & anxiety---the book pleased me much--- it is very free from faults; and although there are one or two words I should wish replaced, I see in many places an improvement greatly to the purpose--- I think those speeches which are related---those parts where the speaker repeats a speech---such as Glaucus' repetition of Circe's words, should have inverted commas to every line---In this there is a little confusion. If we divide the speeches into identical and related : and to the former put merely one inverted comma at the beginning and another at the end; and to the latter inverted commas before every line, the book will be better understood at the first glance. Look at pages 126 and 127 you will find in the 3 line the beginning of a related speech marked thus "Ah! art awake---while at the same time in the next page the continuation of the identical speech is mark'd in the same manner "Young Man of Latmos---You will find on the other side all the parts which should have inverted commas to every line. I was purposing to travel over the north this Summer--- there is but one thing to prevent me---I know nothing I have read nothing and I mean to follow Solomon's directions of 'get Wisdom---get understanding'  344 \---I find cavalier days are gone by. I find that I can have no enjoyment in the World but continual drinking of Knowledge---I find there is no worthy pursuit but the idea of doing some good for the world---some do it with their society---some with their wit---some with their benevolence---some with a sort of power of conferring pleasure and good humour on all they meet and in a thousand ways all equally dutiful to the command of Great Nature---there is but one way for me--- the road lies th rough application study and thought. I will pursue it and to that end purpose retiring for some years. I have been hovering for some time between an exquisite sense of the luxurious and a love for Philosophy ---were I calculated for the former I should be glad--- but as I am not I shall turn all my soul to the latter.

Teignmouth Monday My dear Reynolds It is an awful while since you have heard from me--- I hope I may not be punished, when I see you well, and so anxious as you always are for me, with the remembrance of my so seldom writing when you were so horribly confined--- the most unhappy hours in our lives are those in which we recollect times past to our own blushing---If we are immortal that must be the Hell---If I must be immortal, I hope it will be after having taken a little of "that watery labyrinth" in order to forget some of my school-boy days & others since those. I have heard from George at different times how slowly you were recovering. It is a tedious thing---but all Medical Men will tell you how far a very gradual amendment is preferable; you will be strong after this, never fear.---We are here still enveloppd in clouds---I lay awake last night listening to the Rain with a sense of being drown'd and rotted like a grain of wheat. There is a continual courtesy between the Heavens and the Earth.---The heavens rain down their unwelcomeness and the Earth sends it up again to be returned to morrow. Tom has taken a fancy to a physician here, Dr Turton,  347 and I think is getting better--- therefore I shall perhaps remain here some Months. I have written to George for some Books---shall learn Greek,  348 and very likely Italian---and in other ways prepare myself to ask Hazlitt in about a years time the best metaphysical road I can take.  349 For although I take Poetry to be Chief, yet there is something else wanting to one who passes his life among Books and thoughts on Books---I long to feast upon old Homer as we have upon Shakespeare, and as I have lately upon Milton. If you understood Greek, and would read me passages, now and then, explaining their meaning, 'twould be, from its mistiness, perhaps a greater luxury than reading the thing one's self.---I shall be happy when I can do the same for you.---I have written for my folio Shakespeare,  350 in which there is the first few stanzas of my "Pot of Basil": I have the rest here finish'd, and will copy the whole out fair shortly, and George will bring it you---The Compliment is paid by us  351 to Boccace, whether we publish or no: so there is content in this world ---mine is short ---you must be deliberate about yours: you must not think of it till many months after you are quite well:---then put your passion to it,---and I shall be bound up with you in the shadows of Mind, as we are in our matters of human life.---Perhaps a Stanza or two will not be too foreign to your Sickness. Were they unhappy then?---It cannot be--- Too many tears for lovers have been shed, Too many sighs give we to them in fee, Too much of pity after they are dead, Too many doleful stories do we see, Whose matter in bright gold were best be read; Except in such a page where Theseus' spouse Over the pathless waves towards him bows. But, for the general award of love, The little sweet doth kill much bitterness; Though Dido silent is in under-grove, And Isabella's was a great distress, Though young Lorenzo in warm Indian clove Was not embalm'd, this truth is not the less--- Even bees, the little almsmen of spring-bowers, Know there is richest juice in poison-flowers.  She wept alone for pleasures not to be; Sorely she wept until the night came on, And then, instead of love, O misery! She brooded o'er the luxury alone: What might have been too plainly did she see, And to the silence made a gentle moan, Spreading her perfect arms upon the air, And on her couch low murmuring 'Where? O where?' I heard from Rice this morning---very witty---and have just written to Bailey ---Don't you think I am brushing up in the letter way? and being in for it,--- you shall hear again from me very shortly:---if you will promise not to put hand to paper for me until you can do it with a tolerable ease of health--- except it be a line or two---Give my Love to your Mother and Sisters. Remember me to the Butlers---not forgetting Sarah.  352 Your affectionate friend, John Keats Address : Mr John H. Reynolds  Little Britain  Christs Hospital London. Postmark : not recorded. Teignmouth, May 3d. My dear Reynolds. What I complain of is that I have been in so an uneasy a state of Mind as not to be fit to write to an invalid. I cannot write to any length under a disguised feeling. I should have loaded you with an addition of gloom, which I am sure you do not want. I am now thank God in a humour to give you a good groats worth---for Tom, after a Night without a Wink of sleep, and overburdened with fever, has got up after a refreshing day sleep and is better than he has been for a long time; and you I trust have been again round the Common without any effect but refreshment.--- As to the Matter I hope I can say with Sir Andrew  353 "I have matter enough in my head" in your favor And now, in the second place, for I reckon that I have finished my Imprimis, I am glad you blow up the weather all through your letter there is a leaning towards a climate-curse, and you know what a delicate satisfaction there is in having a vexation anathematized: one would think there has been growing up for these last four thousand years, a grandchild Scion of the old forbidden tree, and that some modern Eve had just violated it; and that there was come with double charge "Notus and After, black with thunderous clouds From Sierraleona.'  354 I shall breathe worsted stockings  355 sooner than I thought for---Tom wants to be in town---we will have some such days upon the heath like that of last summer---and why not with the same book: or what say you to a black-Letter Chaucer  356 printed in 1596: aye I've got one huzza! I shall have it bounden gothique---a nice sombre binding---it will go a little way to unmodernize. And also I see no reason, because I have been away this last month, why I should not have a peep at your Spencerian  357 \---notwithstanding you speak of your office, in my thought a little too early, for I do not see why a Mind like yours is not capable of harbouring and digesting the whole Mystery of Law as easily as Parson Hugh does Pepins  358 \---which did not hinder him from his poetic Canary---Were I to study physic or rather Medicine again, I feel it would not make the least difference in my Poetry; when the Mind is in its infancy a Bias is in reality a Bias, but when we have acquired more strength, a Bias becomes no Bias. Every department of Knowledge we see excellent and calculated towards a great whole. I am so convinced of this, that I am glad at not having given away my medical Books, which I shall again look over to keep alive the little I know thitherwards; and moreover intend through you and Rice to become a sort of pip-civilian. An extensive knowledge is needful to thinking people---it takes away the heat and fever; and helps, by widening speculation, to ease the Burden of the Mystery: 359 a thing I begin to understand a little, and which weighed upon you in the most gloomy and true sentence in your Letter. The difference of high Sensations with and without knowledge appears to me this---in the latter case we are falling continually ten thousand fathoms deep and being blown up again without wings and with all the horror of a bare shoulderd creature---in the former case, our shoulders are fledge, and we go thro' the same air and space without fear. This is running one's rigs on the score of abstracted benefit---when we come to human Life and the affections it is impossible to know how a parallel of breast and head can be drawn---(you will forgive me for thus privately treading out of my depth, and take it for treading as schoolboys tread the water)---It is impossible to know how far Knowledge will console us for the death of a friend and the ill "that flesh is heir to"  360 \---With respect to the affections and Poetry you must know by a sympathy my thoughts that way; and I dare say these few lines will be but a ratification: I wrote them on May-day---and intend to finish the ode all in good time.--- Mother of Hermes! and still youthful Maia! May I sing to thee As thou wast hymned on the shores of Baiae? Or may I woo thee In earlier Sicilian? or thy smiles Seek as they once were sought, in Grecian isles, By Bards who died content on pleasant sward, Leaving great verse unto a little clan? O give me their old vigour, and unheard, Save of the quiet Primrose, and the span Of Heaven and few ears Rounded by thee My song should die away Content as theirs Rich in the simple worship of a day.--- You may be anxious to know for fact to what sentence in your Letter I allude. You say "I fear there is little chance of any thing else in this life". you seem by that to have been going through with a more painful and acute zest the same labyrinth that I have---I have come to the same conclusion thus far. My Branchings out therefrom have been numerous: one of them is the consideration of Wordsworth's genius and as a help, in the manner of gold being the meridian Line of worldly wealth,---how he differs from Milton.---And here I have nothing but surmises, from an uncertainty whether Miltons apparently less anxiety for Humanity proceeds from his seeing further or no than Wordsworth: And whether Wordsworth has in truth epic passion, and martyrs himself to the human heart, the main region of his song  361 \---In regard to his genius alone---we find what he says true as far as we have experienced and we can judge no further but by larger experience---for axioms in philosophy are not axioms until they are proved upon our pulses: We read fine things but never feel them to the full until we have gone  362 the same steps as the Author.---I know this is not plain; you will know exactly my meaning when I say, that now I shall relish Hamlet more than I ever have done---Or, better---You are sensible no Man can set down Venery as a bestial or joyless thing until he is sick of it and therefore all philosophizing on it would be mere wording. Until we are sick, we understand not;---in fine, as Byron says, "Knowledge is Sorrow";  363 and I go on to say that "Sorrow is Wisdom"---and further for aught we can know for certainty "Wisdom is folly"!---So you see how I have run away from Wordsworth, and Milton, and shall still run away from what was in my head, to observe, that some kind of letters are good squares others handsome ovals, and other some orbicular, others spheroid---and why should there not be another species with two rough edges like a Rat-trap? I hope you will find all my long letters of that species, and all will be well; for by merely touching the spring delicately and etherially, the rough edged will fly immediately into a proper compactness; and thus you may make a good wholesome loaf, with your own leaven in it, of my fragments---If you cannot find this said Rat-trap sufficiently tractable---alas for me, it being an impossibility in grain for my ink to stain otherwise: If I scribble long letters I must play my vagaries. I must be too heavy, or too light, for whole pages---I must be quaint and free of Tropes and figures---I must play my draughts as I please, and for my advantage and your erudition, crown a white with a black, or a black with a white, and move into black or white, far and near as I please---I must go from Hazlitt to Patmore,  364 and make Wordsworth and Coleman  365 play at leap-frog---or keep one of them down a whole half-holiday at fly the garter---"from Gray to Gay, from Little to Shakespeare"  366 \---Also, as a long cause requires two or more sittings of the Court, so a long letter will require two or more sittings of the Breech wherefore I shall resume after dinner.--- Have you not seen a Gull, an orc, a Sea Mew, or any thing to bring this Line to a proper length, and also fill up this clear part; that like the Gull I may dip 367 \---I hope, not out of sight---and also, like a Gull, I hope to be lucky in a good sized fish---This crossing a letter is not without its association---for chequer work leads us naturally to a Milkmaid, a Milkmaid to Hogarth Hogarth to Shakespeare Shakespear to Hazlitt---Hazlitt to Shakespeare and thus by merely pulling an apron string we set a pretty peal of Chimes at work---Let them chime on while, with your patience, I will return to Wordsworth---whether or no he has an extended vision or a circumscribed grandeur--- whether he is an eagle in his nest, or on the wing---And to be more explicit and to show you how tall I stand by the giant, I will put down a simile of human life as far as I now perceive it; that is, to the point to which I say we both have arrived at---Well---I compare human life to a large Mansion of Many Apartments, two of which I can only describe, the doors of the rest being as yet shut upon me. The first we step into we call the infant or thoughtless Chamber, in which we remain as long as we do not think--- We remain there a long while, and notwithstanding the doors of the second Chamber remain wide open, showing a bright appearance, we care not to hasten to it; but are at length imperceptibly impelled by the awakening of this thinking principle within us---we no sooner get into the second Chamber, which I shall call the Chamber of Maiden-Thought, than we become intoxicated with the light and the atmosphere, we see nothing but pleasant wonders, and think of delaying there for ever in delight: However among the effects this breathing is father of is that tremendous one of sharpening one's vision into the heart and nature of Man---of convincing one's nerves that the world is full of Misery and Heartbreak, Pain, Sickness and oppression--- whereby this Chamber of Maiden Thought becomes gradually darken'd and at the same time on all sides of it many doors are set open---but all dark---all leading to dark passages---We see not the ballance of good and evil. We are in a Mist. We are now in that state---We feel the "burden of the Mystery", To this Point was Wordsworth come, as far as I can conceive when he wrote 'Tintern Abbey' and it seems to me that his Genius is explorative of those dark Passages. Now if we live, and go on thinking, we too shall explore them---he is a Genius and superior  to us, in so far as he can, more than we, make discoveries, and shed a light in them---Here I must think Wordsworth is deeper than Milton---though I think it has depended more upon the general and gregarious advance of intellect, than individual greatness of Mind---From the Paradise Lost and the other Works of Milton, I hope it is not too presuming, even between ourselves to say, that his Philosophy, human and divine, may be tolerably understood by one not much advanced in years, In his time englishmen were just emancipated from a great superstition---and Men had got hold of certain points and resting places in reasoning which were too newly born to be doubted, and too much opposed by the Mass of Europe not to be thought etherial and authentically divine---who could gainsay his ideas on virtue, vice, and Chastity in Comus, just at the time of the dismissal of Cod-pieces and a hundred other disgraces? who would not rest satisfied with his hintings at good and evil in the Paradise Lost, when just free from the inquisition and burning in Smithfield? The Reformation produced such immediate and great benefits, that Protestantism was considered under the immediate eye of heaven, and its own remaining Dogmas and superstitions, then, as it were, regenerated, constituted those resting places and seeming sure points of Reasoning---from that I have mentioned, Milton, whatever he may have thought in the sequel, appears to have been content with these by his writings ---He did not think into the human heart, as Wordsworth has done---Yet Milton as a Philosopher, had sure as great powers as Wordsworth--- What is then to be inferr'd? O many things---It proves there is really a grand march of intellect---, It proves that a mighty providence subdues the mightiest Minds to the service of the time being, whether it be in human Knowledge or Religion---I have often pitied a Tutor who has to hear "Nom: Musa"---so often dinn'd into his ears---I hope you may not have the same pain in this scribbling---I may have read these things before, but I never had even a thus dim perception of them; and moreover I like to say my lesson to one who will endure my tediousness for my own sake---After all there is certainly something real in the World---Moore's present to Hazlitt  368 is real---I like that Moore, and am glad I saw him at the Theatre just before I left Town. Tom has spit a leetle blood this afternoon, and that is rather a damper---but I know---the truth is there is something real in the World. Your third Chamber of Life shall be a lucky and a gentle one---stored with the wine of love---and the Bread of Friendship. When you see George if he should not have received a letter from me tell him he will find one at home most likely ---tell Bailey I hope soon to see him---Remember me to all. The leaves have been out here, for mony a day---I have written to George for the first stanzas of my Isabel--- I shall have them soon and will copy the whole out for you. Your affectionate friend John Keats. No address or postmark. 8th of May 1818. My dear Keats, I have read your delicious Poem,  369 with exquisite enjoyment, it is the most delightful thing of the time---you have taken up the great trumpet of nature and made it sound with a voice of your own---I write in a great hurry---You will realize all I wish or expect--- Success attend you my glorious fellow---& Believe me ever & ever yours B R Haydon Address : Mrs Jeffrey,  Teignmouth. No postmark. 370 Honiton. My dear Mrs Jeffrey, My Brother has borne his Journey thus far remarkably well. I am too sensible of your anxiety for us not to send this by the Chaise back for you. Give our goodbyes again to Marrian and Fanny. Beleive me we shall bear you in Mind and that I shall write soon. Yours very truly, John Keats. Address : Mr B. Bailey  Magdalen Hall  Oxford. Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 25 MY 1818. Hampstead Thursday--- My dear Bailey, I should have answered your letter on the moment--- if I could have said yes to your invitation. What hinders me is insuperable; I will tell it at a little length. You know my Brother George has been out of employ for some time--- it has weighed very much upon him, and driven him to scheme and turn over things in his Mind---the result has been his resolution to emigrate to the back Settlements of America, become farmer and work with his own hands after purchacing 1400 hundred Acres of the American Government. This for many reasons has met with my entire consent---and the chief one is this---he is of too independant and liberal a Mind to get on in trade in this Country---in which a generous Man with a scanty recourse must be ruined. I would sooner he should till the ground than bow to a Customer---there is no choice with him; he could not bring himself to the latter. I would not consent to his going alone---no; but that objection is done away with ---he will marry before he sets sail a young Lady  371 he has known some years---of a nature liberal and highspirited enough to follow him to the Banks of the Mississippi. He will set off in a month or six weeks, and you will see how I should wish to pass that time with him---and then I must set out on a journey of my own. Brown and I are going a pedestrian tour through the north of England and Scotland as far as John o' Grots. I have this morning such a Lethargy that I cannot write---the reason of my delaying is oftentimes from this feeling---I wait for a proper temper. Now you ask for an immediate answer I do not like to wait even till tomorrow. However I am now so depressed that I have not an Idea to put to paper---my hand feels like lead---and yet it is and unpleasant numbness it does not take away the pain of existence. I don't know what to write---Monday 25 May.---You see how I have delayed ---and even now I have but a confused idea of what I should be about my intellect must be in a degenerating state---it must be for when I should be writing about god knows what I am troubling you with Moods of my own Mind  372 or rather body---for Mind there is none. I am in that temper that if I were under Water I would scarcely kick to come to the top. I know very well 'tis all nonsense. In a short time I hope I shall be in a temper to fell for feel  sensibly your mention of my Book---in vain have I waited till Monday to have any interest in that or in any thing else. I feel no spur at my Brothers going to America, and am almost stony-hearted about his wedding. All this will blow over---all I am sorry for is having to write to you in such a time---but I cannot force my letters in a hot bed. I could not feel comfortable in making sentences for you. I am your debtor---I must ever remain so---nor do I wish to be clear of my rational debt---There is a comfort in throwing oneself on the charity of ones friends---'tis like the Albatross sleeping on its wings. I will be to you wine in the cellar and the more modestly or rather indolently I retire into the backward Bin, the more falerne will I be at the drinking. There is one thing I must mention. My Brother talks of sailing in a fortnight if so I will most probably be with you a week before I set out for Scotland. The middle of your first page should be sufficient to rouse me--- what I said is true and I have dreamt of your mention of it and my not answering it has weighed on me since. If I come, I will bring your Letter and hear more fully your Sentiments on one or two points. I will call about the Lectures at Taylor's and at Little Britain tomorrow--- Yesterday I dined with Hazlitt, Barnes,  373 and Wilkie at Haydon's. The topic was the Duke of Wellington very amusingly pro and con'd. Reynolds has been getting much better; and Rice may begin to crow for he got a little so so at a Party of his and was none the worse for it the next morning. I hope I shall soon see you for we must have many new thoughts and feelings to analize, and to discover whether a little more knowledge has not made us more ignorant. Your's affectionately John Keats--- Address : For Misses M. and S. Jeffrey Postmark : not recorded. Hampstead June 4th My dear Girls, I will not pretend to string a list of excuses together for not having written before---but must at once confess the indolence of my disposition which makes a letter more formidable to me than a Pilgrimage. I am a fool in delay for the idea of neglect is an everlasting Knapsack which even now I have scarce power to hoist off---by the bye talking of everlasting Knapsacks I intend to make my fortune by them in case of a War (which you must consequently pray for) for contracting with Government for said materials to the economy of one branch of the Revenue. At all events a Tax which is taken from the people and shoulder'd upon the Military ought not to be snubb'd at. I promised to send you all the News. Harkee! The whole city corporation with a deputation from the Fire Offices are now engaged at the London Coffee house in secret conclave concerning Saint Paul's Cathedral its being washed clean. Many interesting speeches have been demosthenized in said Coffee house as to the Cause of the black appearance of the said Cathedral. One of the veal-thigh Aldermen actually brought up three Witnesses to depose how they beheld the ci-devant fair Marble turn black on the tolling of the great Bell for the amiable and tea-table-lamented Princess  374 \---adding moreover that this sort of sympathy in inanimate objects was by no means uncommon for said the Gentleman 'As we were once debating in the common Hall Mr Waithman  375 in illustration of some case in point quoted Peter Pindar,  376 at which the head of George the third although in hard marble squinted over the Mayor's seat at the honorable speaker so oddly that he was obliged to sit down'. However I will not tire you about these Affairs for they must be in your Newspapers by this time. You see how badly I have written these last three lines so I will remain here and take a pinch of snuff every five Minutes until my head becomes fit and proper and legitimately inclined to scribble--- Oh! there's nothing like a pinch of snuff except perhaps a few trifles almost beneath a philosopher's dignity, such as a ripe Peach or a Kiss that one takes on a lease of 91 moments---on a b&ustrike;il ing lease. Talking of that is the Captn married yet, or rather married Miss Mitchel  377 \---is she stony hearted enough to hold out this season? Has the Doctor given Miss Perryman  378 a little love powder?---tell him to do so. It really would not be unamusing to see her languish a little--- Oh she must be quite melting this hot Weather. Are the little Robins weaned yet? Do they walk alone? You have had a christening a top o' the tiles and a Hawk has stood God father and taken the little Brood under the Shadows of its Wings much in the way of Mother Church ---a Cat too has very tender bowels in such pathetic Cases. They say we are all (that is our set) mad at Hampstead. There's George took unto himself a Wife a Week ago and will in a little time sail for America---and I with a friend am preparing for a four Months Walk all over the North---and belike Tom will not stop here---he has been getting much better--- Lord what a Journey I had and what a relief at the end of it---I'm sure I could not have stood it many more days  379 . Hampstead is now in fine order. I suppose Teignmouth and the contagious country is now quite remarkable---you might praise it I dare say in the manner of a grammatical exercise--- The trees are full--- the den  380 is crowded--- the boats are sailing--- the musick is playing. I wish you were here a little while---but lauk we haven't got any female friend in the house. Tom is taken for a Madman and I being somewhat stunted am taken for nothing---We lounge on the Walk opposite as you might on the Den---I hope the fine season will keep up your Mother's Spirits---she was used to be too much down hearted. No Women ought to be born into the world for they may not touch the bottle for shame---now a Man may creep into a bung hole  381 \---However this is a tale of a tub---however I like to play upon a pipe sitting upon a puncheon and intend to be so drawn in the frontispiece to my next book of Pastorals---My Brothers' respects and mine to your Mother and all our Loves to you. Yours very sincerely John Keats P.S. has many significations---here it signifies Post Script ---on the corner of a Handkerchief Polly Saunders---Upon a Garter Pretty Secret---Upon a Band Box Pink Sattin--- At the Theatre Princes Side---on a Pulpit Parson's Snuffle ---and at a Country Ale House Pail Sider. Address : Mr. Jos. Severn  Islington Road  near the Angel Inn. Postmark : 6 JU 1818. My dear Severn, The Doctor says I must n't go out. I wish such a delicious fate would but  for put  me in cue to entertain you with a Sonnet or a Pun. I am, yours ever John Keats Address : Mr B--- Bailey  Magdalen Hall  Oxford--- Postmark : 10 JU 1818. London--- My dear Bailey, I have been very much gratified and very much hurt by your Letters in the Oxford Paper:  382 because independant of that unlawful and mortal feeling of pleasure at praise, there is a glory in enthusiasm; and because the world is malignant enough to chuckle at the most honorable Simplicity. Yes on my Soul my dear Bailey you are too simple for the World---and that Idea makes me sick of it---How is it that by extreme opposites we have as it were got discontented nerves---you have all your Life (I think so) believed every Body---I have suspected every Body---and although you have been so deceived you make a simple appeal---the world has something else to do, and I am glad of it---were it in my choice I would reject a petrarchal coronation---on account of my dying day, and because women have Cancers. I should not by rights speak in this tone to you ---for it is an incendiary spirit that would do so. Yet I am not old enough or magnanimous enough to annihilate self---and it would perhaps be paying you an ill compliment. I was in hopes some little time back to be able to releive your dullness by my spirits---to point out things in the world worth your enjoyment---and now I am never alone without rejoicing that there is such a thing as death---without placing my ultimate in the glory of dying for a great human purpose. Perhaps if my affairs were in a different state I should not have written the above---you shall judge---I have two Brothers one is driven by the 'burden of Society' to America the other, with an exquisite love of Life, is in a lingering State. My Love for my Brothers from the early loss of our parents and even for earlier Misfortunes has grown into an affection 'passing the Love of Women'  383 \---I have been ill temper'd with them, I have vex'd them---but the thought of them has always stifled the impression that any woman might otherwise have made upon me. I have a Sister too and may not follow them, either to America or to the Grave---Life must be undergone, and I certainly derive a consolation from the thought of writing one or two more Poems before it ceases. I have heard some hints of your retireing to scotland ---I should like to know your feeling on it---it seems rather remote---perhaps GleIg will have a duty near you. I am not certain whether I shall be able to go my Journey on account of my Brother Tom and a little indisposition of my own---If I do not you shall see me soon---if not on my return---or I'll quarter myself upon you in Scotland next Winter. I had known my sister in Law some time before she was my Sister and was very fond of her. I like her better and better---she is the most disinterrested woman I ever knew---that is to say she goes beyond degree in it. To see an entirely disinterrested Girl quite happy is the most pleasant and extraordinary thing in the world---it depends upon a thousand Circumstances---on my word 'tis extraordinary. Women must want Imagination and they may thank God for it---and so may we that a delicate being can feel happy without any sense of crime. It puzzles me and I have no sort of Logic to comfort me---I shall think it over. I am not at home and your letter being there I cannot look it over to answer any particular---only I must say I felt that passage of Dante---if I take any book with me it shall be those minute volumes of Carey  384 for they will go into the aptest corner. Reynolds is getting I may say robust ---his illness has been of service to him--- like every one just recoverd he is high-spirited. I hear also good accounts of Rice. With respect to domestic Literature---the Endinburgh Magasine in another blow up against Hunt calls me 'the amiable Mister Keats'  385 and I have more than a Laurel from the Quarterly Reviewers for they have smothered me in 'Foliage'  386 I want to read you my 'Pot of Basil' if you go to scotland I should much like to read it there to you among the Snows of next Winter. My Brothers' remembrances to you. Your affectionate friend John Keats--- Address : John Taylor Esqre  Taylor and Hessey's  Booksellers  &c  Fleet Street--- Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 22 JU 1818.

Address and postmark : not recorded. 391 Here beginneth my journal, this Thursday, the 25th day of June, Anno Domini 1818. This morning we arose at 4, and set off in a Scotch mist; put up once under a tree, and in fine, have walked wet and dry to this place, called in the vulgar tongue Endmoor, 17 miles; we have not been incommoded by our knapsacks; they serve capitally, and we shall go on very well. June 26-I merely put pro forma , for there is no such thing as time and space, which by the way came forcibly upon me on seeing for the first hour the Lake and Mountains of Winander---I cannot describe them---they surpass my expectation---beautiful water---shores and islands green to the marge--- mountains all round up to the clouds. We set out from Endmoor this morning, breakfasted at Kendal with a soldier who had been in all the wars for the last seventeen years--- then we have walked to Bowne's   for Bowness  to dinner---said Bowne's situated on the Lake where we have just dined, and I am writing at this present. I took an oar to one of the islands to take up some trout for our dinner, which they keep in porous boxes. I enquired of the waiter for Wordsworth---he said he knew him, and that he had been here a few days ago, canvassing for the Lowthers. What think you of that---Wordsworth versus Brougham!! Sad---sad---sad---and yet the family has been his friend always. What can we say? We are now about seven miles from Rydale, and expect to see him to-morrow. You shall hear all about our visit. There are many disfigurements to this Lake---not in the way of land or water. No; the two views we have had of it are of the most noble tenderness---they can never fade away---they make one forget the divisions of life; age, youth, poverty and riches; and refine one's sensual vision into a sort of north star which can never cease to be open lidded and stedfast over the wonders of the great Power.  392 The disfigurement I mean is the miasma of London. I do suppose it contaminated with bucks and soldiers, and women of fashion---and hatband ignorance. The border inhabitants are quite out of keeping with the romance about them, from a continual intercourse with London rank and fashion. But why should I grumble? They let me have a prime glass of soda water---O they are as good as their neighbors. But Lord Wordsworth, instead of being in retirement, has himself and his house full in the thick of fashionable visitors quite convenient to be pointed at all the summer long. When we had gone about half this morning, we began to get among the hills and to see the mountains grow up before us---the other half brought us to Wynandermere, 14 miles to dinner. The weather is capital for the views, but is now rather misty, and we are in doubt whether to walk to Ambleside to tea---it is five miles along the borders of the Lake. Loughrigg will swell up before us all the way---I have an amazing partiality for mountains in the clouds. There is nothing in Devon like this, and Brown says there is nothing in Wales to be compared to it. I must tell you, that in going through Cheshire and Lancashire, I saw the Welsh mountains at a distance. We have passed the two castles, Lancaster and Kendal. 27th---We walked here to Ambleside yesterday along the border of Winandermere all beautiful with wooded shores and Islands---our road was a winding lane, wooded on each side, and green overhead, full of Foxgloves---every now and then a glimpse of the Lake, and all the while Kirkstone and other large hills nestled together in a sort of grey black mist. Ambleside is at the northern extremity of the Lake. We arose this morning at six, because we call it a day of rest, having to call on Wordsworth who lives only two miles hence---before breakfast we went to see the Ambleside water fall. The morning beautiful---the walk early among the hills. We, I may say, fortunately, missed the direct path, and after wandering a little, found it out by the noise---for, mark you, it is buried in trees, in the bottom of the valley---the stream itself is interesting throughout with "mazy error over pendant shades".  393 Milton meant a smooth river---this is buffetting all the way on a rocky bed ever various---but the waterfall itself, which I came suddenly upon, gave me a pleasant twinge. First we stood a little below the head about half way down the first fall, buried deep in trees, and saw it streaming down two more descents to the depth of near fifty feet---then we went on a jut of rock nearly level with the second fall-head, where the first fall was above us, and the third below our feet still ---at the same time we saw that the water was divided by a sort of cataract island on whose other side burst out a glorious stream---then the thunder and the freshness. At the same time the different falls have as different characters; the first darting down the slate-rock like an arrow; the second spreading out like a fan---the third dashed into a mist ---and the one on the other side of the rock a sort of mixture of all these. We afterwards moved away a space, and saw nearly the whole more mild, streaming silverly through the trees. What astonishes me more than any thing is the tone, the coloring, the slate, the stone, the moss, the rock-weed; or, if I may so say, the intellect, the countenance of such places. The space, the magnitude of mountains and waterfalls are well imagined before one sees them; but this countenance or intellectual tone must surpass every imagination and defy any remembrance. I shall learn poetry here and shall henceforth write more than ever, for the abstract endeavor of being able to add a mite to that mass of beauty which is harvested from these grand materials, by the finest spirits, and put into etherial existence for the relish of one's fellows. I cannot think with Hazlitt that these scenes make man appear little. I never forgot my stature so completely---I live in the eye; and my imagination, surpassed, is at rest---We shall see another waterfall near Rydal to which we shall proceed after having put these letters in the post office. I long to be at Carlisle, as I expect there a letter from George and one from you. Let any of my friends see my letters---they may not be interested in descriptions---descriptions are bad at all times ---I did not intend to give you any; but how can I help it? I am anxious you should taste a little of our pleasure; it may not be an unpleasant thing, as you have not the fatigue. I am well in health. Direct henceforth to Port Patrick till the 12th July. Content that probably three or four pair of eyes whose owners I am rather partial to will run over these lines I remain; and moreover that I am your affectionate brother John.

June 27 My dear George, We have passed from Lancaster from to Burton from Burton to Endmoor, from Endmoor to Kendal from Kendal to Bowness on turning down to which place there burst upon us the most beautiful and rich view of Winander mere and the surrounding Mountains---we dined at Bowness on Trout which I took an oar to fetch from some Box preserves close on one of the little green Islands. After dinner we walked to Ambleside down a beautiful shady Lane along the Borders of the Lake with ample opportunity for Glimpses all the way. We slept at Ambleside not above two Miles from Rydal the Residence of Wordsworth---We arose not very early on account of having marked this day for a day of rest. Before breakfast we visited the first waterfall I ever saw and certainly small as it is it surpassed my expectation, in what I have mentioned in my letter to Tom, in its tone and intellect its light shade slaty Rock, Moss and Rock weed---but you will see finer ones I will not describe by comparison a teapot spout. We ate a Monstrous Breakfast on our return (which by the way I do every morning) and after it proceeded to Wordsworths He was not at home nor was any Member of his family. I was much disappointed. I wrote a note for him and stuck it up over what I knew must be Miss Wordsworth's Portrait and set forth again---we visited two Waterfalls in the neighbourhood, and then went along by Rydal Water and Grasmere through its beautiful Vale---then through a defile in the Mountains into Cumberland and So to the foot of Helvellyn whose summit is out of sight four Miles off rise above rise. I have seen Kirkstone, Loughrigg and Silver How---and discovered without a hint "that ancient woman seated on Helm Craig."  395 This is the summary of what I have written to Tom and dispatched from Ambleside---I have had a great confidence in your being well able to support the fatigue of your Journey since I have felt how much new Objects contribute to keep off a sense of Ennui and fatigue 14 Miles here is not so much as the 4 from Hampstead to London. You will have an inexhaustible astonishment; with that and such a Companion you will be cheered on from day to day---I hope you will not have sail'd before this Letter reaches you--- yet I do not know for I will have my Series to Tom coppied and sent to you by the first Packet you have from England. God send you both as good Health as I have now. Ha! my dear Sister George I wish I knew what humour you were in that I might accommodate myself to any one of your Amiabilities. Shall it be a Sonnet or a Pun or an Acrostic, a Riddle or a Ballad---'perhaps it may turn out a Sang, and perhaps turn out a Sermon'  396 I'll write you on my word the first and most likely the last I ever shall do, because it has struck me---what shall it be about? Give me your patience Sister while I frame Enitials - - -  397 -wise of your golden name: Or sue the fair Apollo and he will Rouse from his slumber heavy and instill Great Love in me for thee and Poesy. Imagine not that greatest Mastery And Kingdom over all the realms of verse Nears more to heaven in aught than when we nurse And surety give to Love and Brotherhood. Anthropopagi in Othello's Mood, Ulysses stormed, and his enchanted Belt Glow with the Muse but they are never felt Unbosom'd so, and so eternal made, Such selfsame insence in their Laurel shade To all the regent sisters of the Nine As this poor offering to thee Sister mine. Kind Sister! Aye this third name says you are Entranced has it been the Lord knows where. Ah! may it taste to you like good old wine--- Take you to real happiness and give Sons daughters and a Home like honied hive. June 28th I have slept and walked eight miles to Breakfast at Keswick on derwent water---We could not mount Helvellyn for the mist so gave it up with hopes of Skiddaw which we shall try tomorrow if it be fine---today we shall walk round Derwent water, and in our Way see the Falls of Low-dore---The Approach to derwent water is rich and magnificent beyond any means of conception---the Mountains all round sublime and graceful and rich in colour--- Woods and wooded Islands here and there---at the same time in the distance among Mountains of another aspect we see Bassenthwaite---I shall drop like a Hawk on the Post Office at Carlisle  page torn some Letters from you and Tom. Sweet sweet is the greeting of eyes, And sweet is the voice in its greeting, When Adieux have grown old and goodbyes Fade away where old time is retreating--- Warm the nerve of a welcoming hand And earnest a Kiss on the Brow, When we meet over sea and o'er Land Where furrows are new to the Plough. This is all  torn  in the m  torn  please a  torn  Letters as possible. We will before many Years are over have written many folio volumes which as a Matter of selfdefence to one whom you understand intends to be immortal in the best points and let all his Sins and peccadillos die away---I mean to say that the Booksellers will rather decline printing ten folio volumes of Correspondence printed as close as the Apostles creed in a Watch paper---I have been looking out my dear Georgy for a joke or a Pun for you--- there is none but the Names of romantic Misses on the Inn window Panes. You will of course have given me directions brother George where to direct on the other side of the Water. I have not had time to write to Henry---for I have a journal to keep for Tom nearly enough to employ all my leisure---I am a day behind hand with him---I scarcely know how I shall manage Fanny and two or three others I have promised---We expect to be in Scotland in at most three days so you must if this should catch you before you set sail give me a line to Port-Patrick. God bless you my dear Brother and Sister. John--- Address : Mr Thomas Keats Hampstead. Postmark : not recorded. 398 Keswick, June 29 My dear Tom, I cannot make my journal as distinct and actual as I could wish, from having been engaged in writing to George. and therefore I must tell you without circumstance that we proceeded from Ambleside to Rydal, saw the waterfall there, and called on Wordsworth, who was not at home, nor was any one of his family. I wrote a note and left it on the mantel-piece. Thence on we came to the foot of Helvellyn, where we slept, but could not ascend it for the mist. I must mention that from Rydal we passed Thirlswater, and a fine pass in the Mountains from Helvellyn we came to Keswick on Derwent Water. The approach to Derwent Water surpassed Winandermere---it is richly wooded, and shut in with rich-toned Mountains. From Helvellyn to Keswick was eight miles to Breakfast, after which we took a complete circuit of the Lake, going about ten miles, and seeing on our way the fall of Lowdore. I had an easy climb among the streams, about the fragments of Rocks, and should have got I think to the summit, but unfortunately I was damped by slipping one leg into a squashy hole. There is no great body of water, but the accompaniment is delightful; for it oozes out from a cleft in perpendicular Rocks, all fledged with Ash and other beautiful trees.  399 It is a strange thing how they got there. At the south end of the Lake, the Mountains of Borrowdale are perhaps as fine as anything we have seen. On our return from this circuit, we ordered dinner, and set forth about a mile and a half on the Penrith road, to see the Druid temple.  400 We had a fag up hill, rather too near dinner-time, which was rendered void by the gratification of seeing those aged stones, on a gentle rise in the midst of Mountains, which at that time darkened all around, except at the fresh opening of the Vale of St. John. We went to bed rather fatigued, but not so much so as to hinder us getting up this morning, to mount Skiddaw It promised all along to be fair, and we had fagged and tugged nearly to the top, when, at half-past six there came a Mist upon us and shut out the view; We did not, however, lose anything by it: we were high enough without mist, to see the coast of Scotland; the Irish Sea; the hills beyond lancaster; and nearly all the large ones of Cumberland and Westmoreland, particularly Helvellyn and Scawfell. It grew colder and colder as we ascended, and we were glad, at about three parts of the way, to taste a little rum which the Guide brought with him, mixed, mind ye with Mountain water, I took two glasses going and one returning. It is about six miles from where I am writing to the top. So we have walked ten miles before Breakfast to-day. We went up with two others, very good sort of fellows, All felt, on arising into the cold air, that same elevation which a cold bath gives one. I felt as if I were going to a Tournament. Wordsworth's house is situated just on the rise of the foot of Mount Rydall, his parlour-window looks directly down Winandermere; I do not think I told you how fine the Vale of Grassmere is, and how I discovered "the ancient woman seated on Helm Crag"  401 \---We shall proceed immediately to Carlisle, intending to enter Scotland on the 1st of July via\--- July 1st .---We are this morning at Carlisle. After Skiddaw, we walked to Ireby, the oldest market town in Cumberland ---where we were greatly amused by a country dancing-school holden at the Inn, it was indeed "no new cotillon fresh from France".  402 No, they kickit and jumpit with mettle extraordinary, and whiskit, and friskit, and toed it, and go'd it, and twirl'd it, and wheel'd it, and stamped it, and sweated it, tattooing the floor like mad; The difference between our country dances and these Scottish figures is about the same as leisurely stirring a cup o'Tea and beating up a batter-pudding. I was extremely gratified to think, that if I had pleasures they knew nothing of, they had also some into which I could not possibly enter. I hope I shall not return without having got the Highland fling, There was as fine a row of boys and girls as you ever saw; some beautiful faces, and one exquisite mouth. I never felt so near the glory of Patriotism, the glory of making by any means a country happier.  403 This is what I like better than scenery. I fear our continued moving from place to place, will prevent our becoming learned in village affairs; we are mere creatures of Rivers, Lakes, and Mountains. Our yesterday's journey was from Ireby to Wigton, and from Wigton to Carlisle. The Cathedral does not appear very fine; the Castle is very Ancient, and of brick The City is very various, old, white-washed narrow streets broad red-brick ones more modern---I will tell you anon, whether the inside of the cathedral is worth looking at. It is built of sandy red stone or Brick. We have now walked 114 miles, and are merely a little tired in the thighs and a little blistered; We shall ride 38 miles to Dumfries, when we shall linger awhile about Nithsdale and Galloway, I have written two letters to Liverpool. I found a letter from sister George--- very delightful indeed: I shall preserve it in the bottom of my knapsack for you. The Town, the churchyard, and the setting sun, The Clouds, the trees, the rounded hills all seem Though beautiful, cold---strange---as in a dream, I dreamed long ago, now new begun The short-liv'd, paly Summer is but won From Winter's ague, for one hour's gleam; Though sapphire-warm, their stars do never beam, All is cold Beauty; pain is never done For who has mind to relish Minos-wise, The Real of Beauty, free from that dead hue Sickly imagination and sick pride Cast  404 wan upon it! Burns! with honor due I have oft honour'd thee. Great shadow; hide Thy face, I sin against thy native skies. You will see by this sonnet that I am at Dumfries, We have dined in Scotland. Burns's tomb is in the Churchyard corner, not very much to my taste, though on a scale large enough to show they wanted to honour him. Mrs Burns lives in this place, most likely we shall see her tomorrow. This Sonnet I have written in a strange mood, half-asleep. I know not how it is, the Clouds, the Sky, the Houses, all seem anti-Grecian and anti-Charlemagnish--- I will endeavour to get rid of my prejudices and tell you fairly about the Scotch  405 \--- In Devonshire they say, "Well, where be ye going?"  406 Here it is, "How is it all wi'yoursel?" A man on the Coach said the horses took a Hellish heap o'drivin'---the same fellow pointed out Burns's Tomb with a deal of life, "There! de ye see it, amang the trees---white, wi'a roond tap." The first well-dressed Scotchman we had any conversation with, to our surprise confessed himself a Deist. The careful manner of his delivering his opinions, not before he had received several encouraging hints from us, was very amusing. Yesterday was an immense Horse-fair at Dumfries, so that we met numbers of men and women on the road, the women nearly all barefoot, with their shoes and clean stockings in hand, ready to put on and look smart in the Towns. There are plenty of wretched cottages whose smoke has no outlet but by the door---We have now begun upon Whiskey, called here whuskey ,---very smart stuff it is---Mixed like our liquors, with sugar and water, 'tis called toddy; very pretty drink, and much praised by Burns.

Dumfries July 2nd My dear Fanny, I intended to have written to you from Kirkcudbright the town I shall be in tomorrow---but I will write now because my Knapsack has worn my coat in the Seams, my coat has gone to the Taylors and I have but one Coat to my back in these parts. I must tell you how I went to Liverpool with George and our new Sister and the Gentleman my fellow traveller through the Summer and Autumn--- We had a tolerable journey to Liverpool ---which I left the next morning before George was up for Lancaster---Then we set off from Lancaster on foot with our Knapsacks on, and have walked a Little zig zag through the mountains and Lakes of Cumberland and Westmoreland---We came from Carlisle yesterday to this place---We are employed in going up Mountains, looking at Strange towns prying into old ruins and eating very hearty breakfasts. Here we are full in the Midst of broad Scotch 'How is it a'wi yoursel'---the Girls are walking about bare footed and in the worst cottages the Smoke finds its way out of the door. I shall come home full of news for you and for fear I should choak you by too great a dose at once I must make you used to it by a letter or two. We have been taken for travelling Jewellers, Razor sellers and Spectacle venders because friend Brown wears a pair--- The first place we stopped at with our Knapsacks contained one Richard Bradshaw a notorious tippler---He stood in the shape of a and ballanced himself as well as he could saying with his nose right in Mr Browns face 'Do ---yo---u sell Spect---ta---cles?'Mr Abbey says we are Don Quixotes---tell him we are more generally taken for Pedlars. All I hope is that we may not be taken for excisemen in this whiskey country---We are generally up about 5 walking before breakfast and we complete our 20 Miles before dinner---Yesterday we visited Burns's Tomb and this morning the fine Ruins of Lincluden---I had done thus far when my coat came back fortified at all points---so as we lose no time we set forth again through Galloway---all very pleasant and pretty with no fatigue when one is used to it---We are in the midst of Meg Merrilies'country of whom I suppose you have heard--- Old Meg she was a Gipsey And liv'd upon the Moors Her bed it was the brown heath turf And her house was out of doors Her apples were swart blackberries Her currants pods o'broom Her wine was dew o'the wild white rose Her book a churchyard tomb Her Brothers were the craggy hills Her Sisters larchen trees--- Alone with her great family She liv'd as she did please. No breakfast has she many a day morn No dinner many a noon, And 'stead of supper she would stare Full hard against the Moon. But every morn of woodbine fresh She made her garlanding And every night the dark glen Yew She wove and she would sing. And with her fingers old and brown She plaited Mats o'Rushes And gave them to the Cottagers She met among the Bushes. Old Meg was brave as Margaret Queen And tall as Amazon: An old red blanket cloak she wore; A chip hat had she on. God rest her aged bones somewhere--- She died full long agone! If you like these sort of Ballads I will now and then scribble one for you--- if I send any to Tom I'll tell him to send them to you. I have so many interruptions that I cannot manage to fill a Letter in one day---since I scribbled the Song we have walked through a beautiful Country to Kirkcudbright---at which place I will write you a song about myself--- There was a naughty Boy A naughty boy was he He would not stop at home He could not quiet be--- He took In his Knapsack A Book Full of vowels And a shirt With some towels--- A slight cap For night cap--- A hair brush Comb ditto New Stockings For old ones Would split O! This Knapsack Tight at's back He rivetted close And followed his Nose To the North To the North And follow'd his nose To the North. There was a naughty boy And a naughty boy was he For nothing would he do But scribble poetry--- He took An inkstand In his hand And a Pen Big as ten In the other And away In a Pother He ran To the mountains And fountains And ghostes And Postes And witches And ditches And wrote In his coat When the weather Was cool Fear of gout--- And without When the weather Was warm--- Och the charm When we choose To follow ones nose To the north To the north To follow one's nose to the north! There was a naughty boy And a naughty boy we  for was  he He kept little fishes In washing tubs three In spite Of the might Of the Maid Nor affraid Of his Granny-good--- He often would Hurly burly Get up early And go By hook or crook To the brook And bring home Miller's thumb Tittle bat Not over fat Minnows small As the stall Of a glove Not above The size Of a nice Little Baby's Little finger--- O he made 'Twas his trade Of Fish a pretty Kettle A Kettle---A Kettle Of Fish a pretty Kettle A Kettle! There was a naughty Boy And a naughty Boy was he He ran away to Scotland The people for to see--- There he found That the ground Was as hard That a yard Was as long, That a song Was as merry, That a cherry Was as red--- That lead Was as weighty That fourscore Was as eighty That a door Was as wooden As in england--- So he stood in His shoes And he wonderd He wonderd He stood in his Shoes and he wonder'd. My dear Fanny I am ashamed of writing you such stuff, nor would I if it were not for being tired after my day's walking, and ready to tumble into bed so fatigued that when I am asleep you might sew my nose to my great toe and trundle me round the town like a Hoop without waking me---Then I get so hungry---a Ham goes but a very little way and fowls are like Larks to me---A Batch of Bread I make no more ado with than a sheet of parliament; and I can eat a Bull's head as easily as I used to do Bull's eyes---I take a whole string of Pork Sausages down as easily as a Pen'orth of Lady's fingers---Oh dear I must soon be contented with an acre or two of oaten cake a hogshead of Milk and a Cloaths basket of Eggs morning noon and night when I get among the Highlanders ---Before we see them we shall pass into Ireland and have a chat with the Paddies, and look at the Giant's Cause-way which you must have heard of---I have not time to tell you particularly for I have to send a Journal to Tom of whom you shall hear all particulars or from me when I return. Since I began this we have walked sixty miles to newton stewart at which place I put in this Letter---to night we sleep at Glenluce---tomorrow at Portpatrick and the next day we shall cross in the passage boat to Ireland--- I hope Miss Abbey has quite recovered---Present my Respects to her and to Mr And Mrs Abbey---God bless you--- Your affectionate Brother John--- Do write me a Letter directed to Inverness . Scotland--- Address : Mr Thos. Keats  Well Walk  Hampstead  Middx--- Imperfect postmarks : 1818 and JY 13. 407 Auchencairn July 3rd My dear Tom, I have not been able to keep up my journal completely on account of other letters to George and one which I am writing to Fanny from which I have turned to loose no time whilst Brown is coppying a song about Meg Merrilies which I have just written for her---We are now in Meg Merrilies county and have this morning passed through some parts exactly suited to her---Kirkcudbright County is very beautiful, very wild with craggy hills somewhat in the westmoreland fashion---We have come down from Dumfries to the Sea Coast part of it---The song I mention you would have from Dilke: but perhaps you would like it here--- Old Meg she was a Gipsey And liv'd upon the Moors; Her bed it was the brown heath turf, And her house was out of doors. Her apples were swart blackberries, Her currants pods o'Broom, Her wine was dew o'the wild white rose, Her book a churchyard tomb. Her brothers were the craggy hills, Her Sisters larchen trees--- Alone with her great family She liv'd as she did please. No Breakfast had she many a morn, No dinner many a noon; And 'stead of supper she would stare Full hard against the Moon. But every Morn, of wood bine fresh She made her garlanding; And every night the dark glen Yew She wove and she would sing. And with her fingers old and brown She plaited Mats o'Rushes, And gave them to the Cottagers She met among the Bushes. Old Meg was brave as Margaret Queen And tall as Amazon: An old red blanket cloak she wore A chip hat had she on--- God rest her aged bones somewhere She died full long agone!--- Now I will return to Fanny---it rains. I may have time to go on here presently. July 5-You see I have missed a day from fanny's Letter. Yesterday was passed in Kirkcudbright ---the Country is very rich---very fine---and with a little of Devon---I am now writing at Newton Stuart six Miles into Wigton---Our Landlady of yesterday said very few Southrens passed these ways. The children jabber away as in a foreign Language---The barefooted Girls look very much in keeping ---I mean with the Scenery about them. Brown praises their cleanliness and appearance of comfort---the neatness of their cottages &c It may be--- they are very squat among trees and fern and heaths and broom, on levels, slopes and heights---They are very pleasant because they are very primitive---but I wish they were as snug as those up the Devonshire vallies. We are lodged and entertained in great varieties---we dined yesterday on dirty bacon dirtier eggs and dirtiest Potatoes with a slice of Salmon---we breakfast this morning in a nice carpeted Room with Sofa hair bottomed chairs and green-baized mehogany---A spring by the road side is always welcome---we drink water for dinner diluted with a Gill of wiskey. July 7th Yesterday Morning we set out from Glenluce going some distance round to see some Ruins--- they were scarcely worth the while---we went on towards Stranrawier in a burning Sun and had gone about six Miles when the Mail overtook us---we got up---were at Portpatrick in a jiffy, and I am writing now in little Ireland ---The dialect on the neighbouring shores of Scotland and Ireland is much the same---yet I can perceive a great difference in the nations from the Chambermaid at this nate Inn kept by Mr Kelly. She is fair, kind and ready to laugh, because she is out of the horrible dominion of the Scotch Kirk. A Scotch Girl stands in terrible awe of the Elders---poor little Susannas---They will scarcely laugh--- they are greatly to be pitied and the Kirk is greatly to be damn'd. These Kirkmen have done Scotland good (Query?) they have made Men, Women, Old Men Young Men old Women young women boys, girls and infants all careful---so that they are formed into regular Phalanges of savers and gainers---such a thrifty army cannot fail to enrich their Country and give it a greater appearance of comfort than that of their poor irish neighbours---These Kirkmen have done Scotland harm---they have banished puns and laughing and Kissing (except in cases where the very danger and crime must make it very fine and gustful.  408 I shall make a full stop at Kissing for after that there should be a better parent thesis: and go on to remind you of the fate of Burns. Poor unfortunate fellow---his disposition was Southern---how sad it is when a luxurious imagination is obliged in self defence to deaden its delicacy in vulgarity, and not  409 in things attainable that it may not have leisure to go mad after things which are not. No Man in such matters will be content with the experience of others ---It is true that out of suffrance there is no greatness, no dignity; that in the most abstracted Pleasure there is no lasting happiness: yet who would not like to discover over again that Cleopatra was a Gipsey, Helen a Rogue and Ruth a deep one? I have not sufficient reasoning faculty to settle the doctrine of thrift---as it is consistent with the dignity of human Society--- with the happiness of Cottagers---All I can do is by plump contrasts---Were the fingers made to squeeze a guinea or a white hand?---Were the Lips made to hold a pen or a Kiss? And yet in Cities Man is shut out from his fellows if he is poor, the Cottager must be dirty and very wretched if she be not thrifty--- The present state of society demands this and this convinces me that the world is very young and in a verry ignorant state---We live in a barbarous age. I would sooner be a wild deer than a Girl under the dominion of the Kirk, and I would sooner be a wild hog than be the occasion of a Poor Creatures pennance before those execrable elders. It is not so far to the Giant's Cause way as we supposed---we thought it 70, and hear it is only 48 Miles---so we shall leave one of our Knapsacks here at Donoghadee, take our immediate wants and be back in a week---when we shall proceed to the County of Ayr. In the Packet Yesterday we heard some Ballads from two old Men---one was a romance which seemed very poor---then there was the Battle of the Boyne---then Robin Huid as they call him--- 'Before the King you shall go, go, go, before the King you shall go'. There were no Letters for me at Port Patrick so I am behind hand with you I dare say in news from George. Direct to Glasgow till the 17th of this month. 9th We stopped very little in Ireland and that you may not have leisure to marvel at our speedy return to Port-patrick I will tell you that is it as dear living in Ireland as at the Hummums  410 \---thrice the expence of Scotland---it would have cost us £15 before our return---Moreover we found those 48 Miles to be irish ones which reach to 70 english---So having walked to Belfast one day and back to Donoghadee the next we left Ireland with a fair breeze--- We slept last night at Port patrick where I was gratified by a letter from you. On our walk in Ireland we had too much opportunity to see the worse than nakedness, the rags, the dirt and misery of the poor common Irish---A Scotch cottage, though in that sometimes the Smoke has no exit but at the door, is a pallace to an irish one. We could observe that impetiosity in Man boy and Woman. We had the pleasure of finding our way through a Peat-Bog--- three miles long at least---dreary, black, dank, flat and spongy: here and there were poor dirty creatures and a few strong men cutting or carting peat. We heard on passing into Belfast through a most wretched suburb that most disgusting of all noises worse than the Bag pipe, the laugh of a Monkey, the chatter of women solus the scream of  a Macaw---I mean the sound of the Shuttle. What a tremendous difficulty is the improvement of the condition of such people. I cannot conceive how a mind 'with child'  411 of Philanthropy could grasp at possibility--- with me it is absolute despair. At a miserable house of entertainment half way between Donaghadee and Bellfast were two Men Sitting at Whiskey---one a Laborer and the other I took to be a drunken Weaver---The Laborer took me for a Frenchman and the other hinted at Bounty Money saying he was ready to take it. On calling for the Letters at Port patrick the man snapp'd out 'what Regiment'? On our return from Bellfast we met a Sadan--- the Duchess of Dunghill---It is no laughing matter tho--- Imagine the worst dog kennel you ever saw placed upon two poles from a mouldy fencing. In such a wretched thing sat a squalid old Woman squat like an ape half starved from a scarcity of Buiscuit in its passage from Madagascar to the cape,---with a pipe in her mouth and looking out with a round-eyed skinny lidded inanity---with a sort of horizontal idiotic movement of her head---squab and lean she sat and puff'd out the smoke while two ragged tattered Girls carried her along. What a thing would be a history of her Life and sensations. I shall endeavour when I know more and have thought a little more, to give you my ideas of the difference between the scotch and irish  412 \---The two Irishmen I mentioned were speaking of their treatment in England when the Weaver said---'Ah you were a civil Man but I was a drinker'Remember me to all---I intend writing to Haslam---but dont tell him for fear I should delay---We left a notice at Portpatrick that our Letters should be thence forwarded to Glasgow--- Our quick return from Ireland will occasion our passing Glasgow sooner than we thought---so till further notice you must direct to Inverness Your most affectionate Brother John--- Remember me to the Bentleys Address : Mr J H Reynolds  Little Britain  Christs Hospital  London. Postmark : not recorded. Maybole July 11 My Dear Reynolds. I'll not run over the ground we have passed, that would be merely as bad as telling a dream---unless perhaps I do it in the manner of the Laputan printing press---that is I put down Mountains, Rivers Lakes, dells, Glens, Rocks, and Clouds, with beautiful enchanting, Gothic picturesque fine, delightful, enchanting, Grand, sublime--- a few Blisters, &c.---and now you have our journey thus far: where I begin a letter to you because I am approaching Burns's Cottage very fast---We have made continual enquiries from the time we saw his Tomb at Dumfries--- his name of course is known all about---his great reputation among the plodding people is "that he wrote a good mony sensible things"---One of the pleasantest means of annulling self is approaching such a shrine as the Cottage of Burns---we need not think of his misery---that is all gone---bad luck to it---I shall look upon it hereafter with unmixed pleasure as I do upon my Stratford on Avon day with Bailey.  413 I shall fill this sheet for you in the Bardie's Country, going no further than this till I get into the Town of Ayr which will be a 9 miles'walk to Tea--- 13 July We were talking on different and indifferent things, when on a sudden we turned a corner upon the immediate Country of Ayr---the Sight was as rich as possible---I had no Conception that the native place of Burns was so beautiful ---the Idea I had was more desolate, his rigs of Barley seemed always to me but a few strips of Green on a cold hill---O prejudice! it was rich as Devon---I endeavour'd to drink in the Prospect, that I might spin it out to you as the Silkworm makes silk from Mulberry leaves---I cannot recollect it---Besides all the Beauty, there were the Mountains of Arran Isle, black and huge over the Sea--- We came down upon every thing suddenly---there were in our way, the "bonny Doon", with the Brig that Tam O' Shanter crossed---Kirk Alloway, Burns's Cottage and then the Brigs of Ayr---First we stood upon the Bridge across the Doon; surrounded by every Phantasy of Green in tree, Meadow, and Hill,---the Stream of the Doon, as a Farmer told us, is covered with trees from head to foot  414 \---you know those beautiful heaths so fresh against the weather of a summers evening---there was one stretching along behind the trees. I wish I knew always the humour my friends would be in at opening a letter of mine, to suit it to them as nearly as possible. I could always find an egg shell for Melancholy  415 and as for Merriment a Witty humour will turn any thing to Account---My head is sometimes in such a whirl in considering the million likings and antipathies of our Moments---that I can get into no settled strain in my Letters---My Wig! Burns and sentimentality coming across you and frank Floodgate  416 in the office--- O scenery that thou shouldst be crush'd between two Puns ---As for them I venture the rascalliest in the Scotch Region---I hope Brown does not put them punctually in his journal---If he does I must sit on the cutty-stool all next winter. We went to Kirk allow'y "a Prophet is no Prophet in his own Country" ---We went to the Cottage and took some Whiskey---I wrote a sonnet for the mere sake of writing some lines under the Roof---they are so bad I cannot transcribe them---The Man at the Cottage was a great Bore with his Anecdotes ---I hate the Rascal--- his Life consists in fuz, fuzzy, fuzziest---He drinks glasses five for the Quarter and twelve for the hour,  417 \---he is a mahogany faced old Jackass who knew Burns---He ought to have been kicked for having spoken to him. He calls himself "a curious old Bitch"---but he is a flat old Dog--- I shod like to employ Caliph Vatheck to kick him  418 \---O the flummery of a birth place! Cant! Cant! Cant! It is enough to give a spirit the guts-ache---Many a true word they say is spoken in jest---this may be because his Gab hindered my sublimity.---The flat dog made me write a flat sonnet. ---My dear Reynolds---I cannot write about scenery and visitings--- Fancy is indeed less than a present palpable reality, but it is greater than remembrance---you would lift your eyes from Homer only to see close before you the real Isle of Tenedos.---you would rather read Homer afterwards than remember yourself---One song of Burns's is of more worth to you than all I could think for a whole year in his native country.---His Misery is a dead weight upon the nimbleness of one's quill---I tried to forget it---to drink Toddy without any Care---to write a merry Sonnet---it wont do---he talked with Bitches---he drank with blackguards, he was miserable---We can see horribly clear in the works of such a Man his whole life, as if we were God's spies. 419 \---What were his addresses to Jean in the latter part of his life---I should not speak so to you---yet why not--- you are not in the same case---you are in the right path, and you shall not be deceived---I have spoken to you against Marriage, but it was general. the Prospect in those matters has been to me so blank, that I have not been unwilling to die---I would not now, for I have inducements to Life---I must see my little Nephews in America, and I must see you marry your lovely Wife---My sensations are sometimes deadened for weeks together  420 \---but believe me I have more than once yearne'd for the time of your happiness to come, as much as I could for myself after the lips of Juliet.--- From the tenor of my occasional rhodomontade in chit-chat, you might have been deceived concerning me in these points---upon my soul, I have been getting more and more close to you every day, ever since I knew you, and now one of the first pleasures I look to is your happy Marriage---the more, since I have felt the pleasure of loving a sister in Law. I did not think it possible to become so much attached in so short a time. Things like these, and they are real,  421 have made me resolve to have a care of my health---you must be as careful--- The rain has stopp'd us to day at the end of a dozen Miles, yet we hope to see Loch-Lomond the day after to Morrow;---I will piddle out my information, as Rice says, next Winter at any time when a substitute is wanted for Vingt-un. We bear the fatigue very well.---20 Miles a day in general---A cloud came over us in getting up Skiddaw---I hope to be more lucky in Ben Lomond---and more lucky still in Ben Nevis--- What I think you wod enjoy is poking about Ruins, sometimes Abbey, sometimes Castle. The short stay we made in Ireland has left few remembrances---but an old woman  422 in a dog-kennel Sedan with a pipe in her Mouth, is what I can never forget---I wish I may be able to give you an idea of her---Remember me to your Mother and Sisters, and tell your Mother how I hope she will pardon me for having a scrap of paper pasted in the Book sent to her.  423 I was driven on all sides and had not time to call on Taylor---So Bailey is coming to Cumberland---well, if you'll let me know where at Inverness, I will call on my return and pass a little time with him---I am glad 'tis not Scotland---Tell my friends I do all I can for them, that is drink their healths in Toddy--- Perhaps I may have some lines by and by to send you fresh on your own Letter---Tom has a few to shew you. Your affectionate friend John Keats Address : Mr Thos. Keats  Well Walk  Hampstead  Middx--- Postmarks : GLASGOW 14 JULY, and 17 JY 1818. 424 Belantree July 10- Ah! ken ye what I met the day Out oure the Mountains A coming down by craggies grey An mossie fountains A goud hair'd Marie yeve I pray Ane minute's guessing--- For that I met upon the way Is past expressing. As I stood where a rocky brig A torrent crosses I spied upon a misty rig A troup o'Horses--- And as they trotted down the glen I sped to meet them To see if I might know the Men To stop and greet them. First Willie on his sleek mare came At canting gallop His long hair rustled like a flame On board a shallop. Then came his brother Rab and then Young Peggy's Mither And Peggy too---adown the glen They went togither--- I saw her wrappit in her hood Fra wind and raining--- Her cheek was flush wi timid blood Twixt growth and waning--- She turn'd her dazed head full oft For there her Brithers Came riding with her Bridegroom soft And mony ithers. Young Tam came up an'eyed me quick With reddened cheek Braw Tam was daffed like a chick He coud na speak--- Ah Marie they are all gane hame Through blustring weather An every heart is light on full on flame An light as feather Ah! Marie they are all gone hame Fra happy wedding, Whilst I---Ah is it not a shame? Sad tears am shedding.  425 My dear Tom The reason for my writing these lines was that Brown wanted to impose a galloway song upon dilke---but it wont do. The subject I got from meeting a wedding just as we came down into this place---Where I am affraid we shall be emprisoned awhile by the weather---Yesterday we came 27 Miles from Stranraer---enterd Ayrshire a little beyond Cairn, and had our path through a delightful Country. I shall endeavour that you may follow our steps in this walk---it would be uninteresting in a Book of Travels ---it can not be interesting but by my having gone through it. When we left Cairn our Road lay half way up the sides of a green mountainous shore, full of Clefts of verdure and eternally varying---sometimes up sometimes down, and over little Bridges going across green chasms of moss rock and trees---winding about every where. After two or three Miles of this we turned suddenly into a magnificent glen finely wooded in Parts---seven Miles long---with a Mountain Stream winding down the Midst--- full of cottages in the most happy Situations---the sides of the Hills coverd with sheep---the effect of cattle lowing I never had so finely. At the end we had a gradual ascent and got among the tops of the Mountains whence In a little time I descried in the Sea Ailsa Rock 940 feet hight---it was 15 Miles distant and seemed close upon us---The effect of ailsa with the peculiar perspective of the Sea in connection with the ground we stood on, and the misty rain then falling gave me a complete Idea of a deluge. Ailsa struck me very suddenly---really I was a little alarmed---Thus far had I written before we set out this morning. Now we are at Girvan 13 Miles north of Belantree. Our Walk has been along a more grand shore to day than yesterday---Ailsa beside us all the way---From the heights we could see quite at home Cantire and the large Mountains of Arran Annan one of the Hebrides. We are in comfortable Quarters. The Rain we feared held up bravely and it has been 'fu fine this day '---To-morrow we shall be at Ayr. Hearken thou craggy ocean pyramid, Give answer by thy voice the Sea fowls screams! When were thy shoulders mantled in huge Streams? When from the Sun was thy broad forehead hid? How long ist since the mighty Power bid Thee heave to airy sleep from fathom dreams--- Sleep in the Lap of Thunder or Sunbeams, Or when grey clouds are thy cold Coverlid--- Thou answerst not for thou art dead asleep Thy Life is but two dead eternities The last in Air, the former in the deep--- First with the Whales, last with the eglle skies--- Drown'd wast thou till an Earth quake made thee steep--- Another cannot wake thy giant Size! This is the only Sonnet of any worth I have of late written---I hope you will like it. 'Tis now the 11th of July and we have come 8 Miles to Breakfast to Kirkoswald. I hope the next Kirk will be Kirk Alloway. I have nothing of consequence to say now concerning our Journey---so I will speak as far as I can judge on the irish and Scotch--- I know nothing of the higher Classes--- yet I have a persuasion that there the Irish are victorious. As to the "profanum vulgus'I must incline to the scotch. They never laugh---but they are always comparitively neat and clean. Their constitutions are not so remote and puzzling as the irish. The Scotchman will never give a decision on any point ---he will never commit himself in a sentence which may be referred to as a meridian in his notion of things--- so that you do not know him---and yet you may come in nigher neighbourhood to him than to the irishman who commits himself in so many places that it dazes your head. A Scotchman's motive is more easily discovered than an irishman's. A Scotchman will go wisely about to deceive you, an irishman cunningly. An Irishman would bluster out of any discovery to his disadvantage. An Irishman Scotchman would retire perhaps without much desire of revenge. An Irishman likes to be thought a gallous fellow. A scotchman is contented with himself. It seems to me they are both sensible of the Character they hold in England and act accordingly to Englishmen. Thus the Scotchman will become over grave and over decent and the Irishman over-impetuous. I like a Scotchman best because he is less of a bore ---I like the Irishman best because he ought to be more comfortable---The Scotchman has made up his Mind within himself in a Sort of snail shell wisdom--- The Irishman is full of strong headed instinct---The Scotchman is farther in Humanity than the Irishman---there his  for he  will stick perhaps when the Irishman shall be refined beyond him---for the former thinks he cannot be improved the latter would grasp at it for ever, place but the good plain before him. Maybole---Since breakfast we have come only four Miles to dinner, not merely, for we have examined in the way two Ruins, one of them very fine called Crossraguel Abbey---there is a winding Staircase to the top of a little Watch Tower. July 13. Kings-wells \---I have been writing to Reynolds---therefore any particulars since Kirkoswald have escaped me---from said Kirk we went to Maybole to dinner--- then we set forward to Burnes's town Ayr---the Approach to it is extremely fine---quite outwent my expectations---richly meadowed, wooded, heathed and rivuleted---with a grand Sea view terminated by the black Mountains of the isle of Annan. As soon as I saw them so nearly I said to myself 'How is it they did not beckon Burns to some grand attempt at Epic'---The bonny Doon is the sweetest river I ever saw overhung with fine trees as far as we could see ---we stood some time on the Brig across it, over which Tam o'Shanter fled--- we took a pinch of snuff on the Key stone---Then we proceeded to the 'auld Kirk Alloway'. As we were looking at it a Farmer pointed out the spots where Mungo's Mither hang'd hersel'  426 and 'drunken Charlie brake's neck's bane'.  427 Then we proceeded to the Cottage he was born in---there was a board to that effect by the door side ---it had the same effect as the same sort of memorial at Stradford on Avon  428 \---We drank some Toddy to Burns's Memory with an old Man who knew Burns--- damn him and damn his Anecdotes---he was a great bore---it was impossible for a Southren to understand above 5 words in a hundred---There was something good in his description of Burns's melancholy the last time he saw him. I was determined to write a sonnet in the Cottage---I did---but it is so bad I cannot venture it here.  429 Next we walked into Ayr Town and before we went to Tea, saw the new Brig and the Auld Brig and Wallace tower---Yesterday we dinned with a Traveller---We were talking about Kean--- He said he had seen him at Glasgow 'in Othello in the Jew, I mean er, er, er, the Jew in Shylock' He got bother'd completely in vague ideas of the Jew in Othello, Shylock in the Jew, Shylock in Othello, Othello in Shylock, the Jew in Othello  &c &c &c he left himself in a mess at last--- Still satisfied with himself he went to the Window and gave an abortive whistle of some tune or other---it might have been Handel. There is no end to these Mistakes--- he'll go and tell people how he has seen 'Malvolio in the Countess'---'Twelvth night' in 'Midsummer nights dream---Bottom in much ado about Nothing---Viola in Barrymore---Antony in Cleopatra---Falstaff in the mouse Trap  430 .---July 14 We enterd Glasgow last Evening under the most oppressive Stare a body could feel---When we had crossed the Bridge Brown look'd back and said its whole population had turned to wonder at us---we came on till a drunken Man came up to me---I put him off with my Arm---he returned all up in Arms saying aloud that, 'he had seen all foreigners bu-u-ut he never saw the like o' me---I was obliged to mention the word Officer and Police before he would desist---The City of Glasgow I take to be a very fine one---I was astonished to hear it was twice the size of Edinburgh---It is built of Stone and has a much more solid appearance than London---We shall see the Cathedral this morning---they have devilled it into a 'High Kirk'---I want very much to know the name of the ship George is goner in---also what port he will land in--- I know nothing about it---I hope you are leading a quiet Life and gradually improving. Make a long lounge of the whole Summer---by the time the Leaves fall I shall be near you with plenty of confab---there are a thousand things I cannot write---Take care of yourself---I mean in not being vexed or bothered at any thing---God bless you! John--- Address : Mr Thos Keats  Well Walk  Hampstead  Middx--- Imperfect postmark : 30 JY 1818 431 Cairn-something July 17th--- My dear Tom, Here's Brown going on so that I cannot bring to Mind how the two last days have vanished---for example he says 'The Lady of the Lake went to Rock herself to sleep on Arthur's seat and the Lord of the Isles coming to Press a Piece and seeing her Assleap remembered their last meeting at Corrystone Water so touching her with one hand on the Vallis Lucis while the other un-Derwent her Whitehaven, Ireby stifled her clack man on, that he might her Anglesea and give her a Buchanan and said'.  blank  I told you last how we were stared at in Glasgow---we are not out of the Crowd yet. Steam Boats on Loch Lomond and Barouches on its sides take a little from the Pleasure of such romantic chaps as Brown and I. The Banks of the Clyde are extremely beautiful---the north End of Loch Lomond grand in excess---the entrance at the lower end to the narrow part from a little distance is precious good--- the Evening was beautiful nothing could surpass our fortune in the weather---yet was I wordly enough to wish for a fleet of chivalry Barges with Trumpets and Banners just to die away before me into that blue place among the mountains---I must give you an outline as well as I can.  432 433 Not B---the Water was a fine Blue silverd and the Mountains a dark purple the Sun setting aslant behind them--- meantime the head of ben Lomond was covered with a rich Pink Cloud---We did not ascend Ben Lomond---the price being very high and a half a day of rest being quite acceptable---We were up at 4 this morning and have walked to breakfast 15 Miles through two tremendous Glens--- at the end of the first there is a place called rest and be thankful which we took for an Inn---it was nothing but a Stone and so we were cheated into 5 more Miles to Breakfast---I have just been bathing in Loch fine a saltwater Lake opposite the Window---quite pat and fresh but for the cursed Gad flies---damn 'em they have been at me ever since I left the Swan and two necks \--- All gentle folks who owe a grudge To any living thing Open your ears and stay your trudge Whilst I in dudgeon sing--- The gad fly he hath stung me sore O may he ne'er sting you! But we have many a horrid bore He may sting black and blue. Has any here an old grey Mare With three Legs all her store O put it to her Buttocks bare And Straight she'll run on four Has any here a Lawyer suit Of 17,43 Take Lawyer's nose and put it to't And you the end will see Is there a Man in Parliament Dum founder'd in his speech O let his neighbour make a rent And put one in his breech O Lowther  434 how much better thou Hadst figur'd t'other day When to the folks thou madst a bow And had no more to say If lucky gad fly had but ta'en His seat upon thine A--e And put thee to a little pain To save thee from a worse. Better than Southey it had been Better than Mr. D--- Better than Wordsworth too I ween Better than Mr. V---  435 Forgive me pray good people all For deviating so In spirit sure I had a call--- And now I on will go. Has any here a daughter fair Too fond of reading novels Too apt to fall in love with care And charming Mister Lovels  436 O put a gadfly to that thing She keeps so white and pert I mean the finger for the ring And it will breed a Wort--- Has any here a pious spouse Who seven times a day Scolds as King David pray'd  437 ; to chouse And have her holy way--- O let a Gadfly's little sting Persuade her sacred tongue That noises are a common thing But that her bell has rung And as this is the summum bo Num of all conquering I leave withouten wordes mo  438 The Gadfly's little sting Last Evening we came round the End of Loch Fine to Inverary---the Duke of Argyle's Castle is very modern magnificent and more so from the place it is in ---the woods seem old enough to remember two or three changes in the Crags about them---the Lake was beautiful and there was a Band at a distance by the Castle. I must say I enjoyed two or three common tunes---but nothing could stifle the horrors of a Solo on the Bag-pipe---I thought the Beast would never have done---Yet was I doomed to hear another---On entering Inverary we saw a Play Bill--- Brown was knock'd up from new shoes---so I went to the Barn alone where I saw the Stranger  439 accompanied by a Bagpipe---There they went on about 'interesting creaters' and 'human nater' till the Curtain fell and then Came the Bag pipe. When Mrs Haller fainted down went the Curtain and out came the Bagpipe---at the heartrending, shoemending reconciliation the Piper blew amain. I never read or saw this play before; not the Bag pipe, nor the wretched players themselves were little in comparison with it---thank heaven it has been scoffed at lately almost to a fashion--- Of late two dainties where before me plac'd Sweet holy pure sacred and innocent From the ninth sphere to me benignly sent That Gods might know my own particlar taste--- First the soft bag pipe mourn'd with zealous haste The Stranger next with head on bosom bent Sigh'd; rueful again the piteous bag-pipe went ings fresh did Again the Stranger sighd waste O Bag-pipe thou didst steal my heart away O Stranger thou my nerves from Pipe didst charm O Bag pipe---thou did'st reassert thy sway Again thou Stranger gave'st me fresh alarm--- Alas! I could not choose. Ah! my poor heart Mum chance art thou with both obliged to part. I think we are the luckiest fellows in Christendom--- Brown could not proceed this morning on account of his feet and lo there is thunder and rain--- July 20th For these two days past we have been so badly accommodated more particularly in coarse food that I have not been at all in cue to write. Last night poor Brown with his feet blistered and scarcely able to walk, after a trudge of 20 Miles down the Side of Loch Awe had no supper but Eggs and Oat Cake---we have lost the sight of white bread entirely---Now we had eaten nothing but Eggs all day---about 10 a piece and they had become sickening---. To day we have fared rather better---but no oat Cake wanting--- we had a small Chicken and even a good bottle of Port but all together the fare is too coarse--- I feel it a little---another week will break us in---I forgot to tell you that when we came through Glencroe it was early in the morning and we were pleased with the noise of Shepherds Sheep and dogs in the misty heights close above us---we saw none of them for some time, till two came in sight creeping among the Craggs like Emmets, yet their voices came quite plainly to us---The Approach to Loch Awe was very solemn towards nightfall---the first glance was a streak of water deep in the Bases of large black Mountains---We had come along a complete mountain road, where if one listened there was not a sound but that of Mountain Streams. We walked 20 Miles by the side of Loch Awe---every ten steps creating a new and beautiful picture---sometimes through little wood---there are two islands on the Lake each with a beautiful ruin--- one of them rich in ivy---We are detained this morning by the rain. I will tell you exactly where we are. We are between Loch Craignish and the Sea just opposite Long Island.  440 Yesterday our walk was of this description---the near Hills were not very lofty but many of their steeps beautifully wooded---the distant Mountains in the Hebrides very grand the Saltwater Lakes coming up between Crags and Islands fulltided and scarcely ruffled---sometimes appearing as one large Lake, sometimes as three distinct ones in different directions---At one point we saw afar off a rocky opening into the main Sea---We have also seen an Eagle or two. They move about without the least motion of Wings when in an indolent fit---I am for the first time in a country where a foreign Language is spoken ---they gabble away Gaelic at a vast rate---numbers of them speak English---There are not many Kilts in Argylshire ---At Fort William they say a Man is not admitted into Society without one---the Ladies there have a horror at the indecency of Breeches. I cannot give you a better idea of Highland Life than by describing the place we are in---The Inn or public is by far the best house in the immediate neighbourhood---It has a white front with tolerable windows---the table I am writing on surprises me as being a nice flapped Mehogany one; at the same time the place has no watercloset nor any thing like it. You may if you peep see through the floor chinks into the ground rooms. The old Grandmother of the house seems intelligent though not over clean. N.B. No snuff being to be had in the village she made us some. The Guid Man is a rough looking hardy stout Man who I think does not speak so much English as the Guid wife who is very obliging and sensible and moreover though stockingless, has a pair of old Shoes---Last night some Whisky Men sat up clattering Gaelic till I am sure one o'Clock to our great annoyance--- There is a Gaelic testament on the Drawers in the next room---White and blue China ware has crept all about here---Yesterday there passed a Donkey laden with tinpots ---opposite the Window there are hills in a Mist---a few Ash trees and a mountain stream at a little distance--- They possess a few head of Cattle--- If you had gone round to the back of the House just now---you would have seen more hills in a Mist---some dozen wretched black Cottages scented of peat smoke which finds its way by the door or a hole in the roof---a girl here and there barefoot There was one little thing driving Cows down a slope like a mad thing---there was another standing at the cowhouse door rather pretty fac'd all up to the ankles in dirt.  441 We have walk'd 15 Miles in a soaking rain to Oban opposite the Isle of Mull which is so near Staffa we had thought to pass to it---but the expense is 7 Guineas and those rather extorted---Staffa you see is a fashionable place and therefore every one concerned with it either in this town or the Island are what you call up. 'Tis like paying sixpence for an apple at the playhouse--- this irritated me and Brown was not best pleased---we have therefore resolved to set northward for fort William tomorrow morning---I feel  for fell  upon a bit of white Bread to day like a Sparrow---it was very fine---I cannot manage the cursed Oatcake--- Remember me to all and let me hear a good account of you at Inverness---I am sorry Georgy had not those Lines. Good bye. Your affectionate Brother John--- Address : Mr B. Bailey  T. Bailey Esqre  Thorney Abbey  Peterborough. Imperfect postmark : GLASGOW 31 JULY. 442 Inverary July 18th. My dear Bailey, The only day I have had a chance of seeing you when you were last in London I took every advantage of---some devil led you out of the way. Now I have written to Reynolds to tell me where you will be in Cumberland  443 \--- so that I cannot miss you---and when I see you the first thing I shall do will be to read that about Milton and Ceres and Proserpine  444 \---for though I am not going after you to John o' Grotts it will be but poetical to say so. And here Bailey I will say a few words written in a sane and sober Mind, a very scarce thing with me, for they may hereafter save you a great deal of trouble about me, which you do not deserve, and for which I ought to be bastinadoed. I carry all matters to an extreme---so that when I have any little vexation it grows in five Minutes into a theme for Sophocles ---then and in that temper if I write to any friend I have so little selfpossession that I give him matter for grieving at the very time perhaps when I am laughing at a Pun. Your last Letter made me blush for the pain I had given you. I know my own disposition so well that I am certain of writing many times hereafter in the same strain to you---now you know how far to believe in them---you must allow for imagination. I know I shall not be able to help it. I am sorry you are grieved at my not continuing my visits to little Britain 445 \---yet I think I have as far as a Man can do who has Books to read to  for and  subjects to think upon---for that reason I have been no where else except to Wentworth place so nigh at hand---moreover I have been too often in a state of health that made me think it prudent not to hazard the night Air. Yet further I will confess to you that I cannot enjoy Society small or numerous. I am certain that our fair friends are glad I should come for the mere sake of my coming; but I am certain I bring with me a Vexation they are better without--- If I can possibly at any time feel my temper coming upon me I refrain even from a promised visit. I am certain I have not a right feeling towards Women ---at this moment I am striving to be just to them but I cannot---Is it because they fall so far beneath my Boyish imagination? When I was a Schoolboy I thought a fair Woman a pure Goddess, my mind was a soft nest in which some one of them slept, though she knew it not--- I have no right to expect more than their reality. I thought them etherial above Men---I find them perhaps equal--- great by comparison is very small. Insult may be inflicted in more ways than by Word or action---one who is tender of being insulted does not like to think an insult against another---I do not like to think insults in a Lady's Company ---I commit a Crime with her which absence would have not known. Is it not extraordinary? When among Men I have no evil thoughts, no malice, no spleen---I feel free to speak or to be silent---I can listen and from every one I can learn---my hands are in my pockets I am free from all suspicion and comfortable. When I am among Women I have evil thoughts, malice spleen---I cannot speak or be silent---I am full of Suspicions and therefore listen to nothing---I am in a hurry to be gone---You must be charitable and put all this perversity to my being disappointed since Boyhood. Yet with such feelings I am happier alone among Crowds of men, by myself or with a friend or two---With all this trust me Bailey I have not the least idea that Men of different feelings and inclinations are more short-sighted than myself---I never rejoiced more than at my Brother's Marriage and shall do so at that of any of my friends---. I must absolutely get over this---but how? The only way is to find the root of evil, and so cure it "with backward mutters of dissevering Power"  446 \---that is a difficult thing; for an obstinate Prejudice can seldom be produced but from a gordian complication of feelings, which must take time to unravell and care to keep unravelled. I could say a good deal about this but I will leave it in hopes of better and more worthy dispositions--- and also content that I am wronging no one, for after all I do think better of Womankind than to suppose they care whether Mister John Keats five feet high likes them or not. You appeard to wish to avoid any words on this subject--- don't think it a bore my dear fellow---it shall be my Amen---I should not have consented to myself these four Months tramping in the highlands but that I thought it would give me more experience, rub off more Prejudice, use me to more hardship, identify finer scenes load me with grander Mountains, and strengthen more my reach in Poetry, than would stopping at home among Books even though I should reach Homer. By this time I am comparitively a a mountaineer---I have been among wilds and Mountains too much to break out much about thelr Grandeur. I have fed upon Oat cake---not long enough to be very much attached to it---The first Mountains I saw, though not so large as some I have since seen, weighed very solemnly upon me. The effect is wearing away--- yet I like them mainly---We have come this evening  447 with a Guide, for without was impossible, into the middle of the Isle of Mull, pursuing our cheap journey to Iona and perhaps Staffa---We would not follow the common and fashionable mode from the great imposition of expense. We have come over heath and rock and river and bog to what in England would be called a horrid place---yet it belongs to a Shepherd pretty well off perhaps. The family speak not a word but gaelic and we have not yet seen their faces for the smoke which after visiting every cranny, (not excepting my eyes very much incommoded for writing), finds its way out at the door. I am more comfortable than I could have imagined in such a place, and so is Brown. The People are all very kind. We lost our way a little yesterday and enquiring at a Cottage, a yound Woman without a word threw on her cloak and walked a Mile in a missling rain and splashy way to put us right again. I could not have had a greater pleasure in these parts than your mention of my Sister. She is very much prisoned from me. I am affraid it will be some time before I can take her to many places I wish---I trust we shall see you ere long in Cumberland---at least I hope I shall before my visit to America more than once I intend to pass a whole year with George if I live to the completion of the three next---My sisters well- fare and the hopes of such a stay in America will make me observe your advice ---I shall be prudent and more careful of my health than I have been---I hope you will be about paying your first visit to Town after settling when we come into Cumberland--- Cumberland however will be no distance to me after my present journey---I shall spin to you in a minute---I begin to get rather a contempt for distances. I hope you will have a nice convenient room for a Library. Now you are so well in health do keep it up by never missing your dinner by not reading hard and by taking proper exercise. You'll have a horse I suppose so you must make a point of sweating him. You say I must study Dante ---well the only Books I have with me are those three little Volumes.  448 I read that fine passage you mention a few days ago. Your Letter followed me from Hampstead to Port Patrick and thence to Glasgow---you must think me by this time a very pretty fellow. One of the pleasantest bouts we have had was our walk to Burns's Cottage, over the Doon and past Kirk Alloway---I had determined to write a Sonnet in the Cottage. I did but lauk it was so wretched I destroyed it  449 \--- howevr in a few days afterwards I wrote some lines cousingerman to the Circumstance which I will transcribe or rather cross scribe in the front of this---Reynolds's illness has made him a new Man---he will be stronger than ever ---before I left London he was really getting a fat face. Brown keeps on writing volumes of adventures to Dilke--- when we get in of an evening and I have perhaps taken my rest on a couple of Chairs he affronts my indolence and Luxury by pulling out of his Knapsack 1st his paper---2ndly his pens and last his ink. Now I would not care if he would change about a little. I say now why not Bailey take out his pens first sometimes---But I might as well tell a hen to hold up her head before she drinks instead of afterwards. Your affectionate friend John Keats--- There is a joy in footing slow across a silent plain Where Patriot Battle has been fought when Glory had the gain; There is a pleasure on the heath where Druids old have been, Where Mantles grey have rustled by and swept the nettles green: There is a joy in every spot, made known by times of old, New to the feet, although the tale a hundred times be told: There is a deeper joy than all, more solemn in the heart, More parching to the tongue than all, of more divine a smart, When weary feet forget themselves upon a pleasant turf, Upon hot sand, or flinty road, or Sea shore iron scurf, Toward the Castle or the Cot where long ago was born One who was great through mortal days and died of fame unshorn. Light Heather bells may tremble then, but they are far away; Woodlark may sing from sandy fern,---the Sun may hear his Lay; Runnels may kiss the grass on shelves and shallows clear But their low voices are not heard though come on travels drear; Bloodred the sun may set behind black mountain peaks; Blue tides may sluice and drench their time in Caves and weedy creeks; Eagles may seem to sleep wing wide upon the Air; Ring doves may fly convuls'd across to some high cedar'd lair; But the forgotten eye is still fast wedded  450 to the ground--- As Palmer's that with weariness mid desert shrine hath found. At such a time the Soul's a Child, in Childhood is the brain Forgotten is the worldly heart---alone, it beats in vain--- Aye if a Madman could have leave to pass a healthful day, To tell his forehead's swoon and faint when first began decay, He might make tremble many a Man whose Spirit had gone forth To find a Bard's low Cradle place about the silent north. Scanty the hour and few the steps beyond the Bourn of Care, Beyond the sweet and bitter world---beyond it unaware; Scanty the hour and few the steps because a longer stay Would bar return and make a Man forget his mortal way. O horrible! to lose the sight of well remember'd face, Of Brother's eyes, of Sister's Brow, constant to every place; Filling the Air as on we move with Portraiture intense More warm than those heroic tints that fill a Painter's sense, When Shapes of old come striding by and visages of old, Locks shining black, hair scanty grey and passions manifold. No, No that horror cannot be---for at the Cable's length Man feels the gentle Anchor pull and gladdens in its strength--- One hour half ideot he stands by mossy waterfall, But in the very next he reads his Soul's memorial: He reads it on the Mountain's height where chance he may sit down Upon rough marble diadem, that Hill's eternal crown. Yet be the Anchor e'er so fast, room is there for a prayer That Man may never loose his Mind on Mountains bleak and bare; That he may stray league after League some great Berthplace to find And keep his vision clear from speck, his inward sight unblind---  451 Address : Mr Thos Keats  Well Walk  Hampstead  Middx--- Imperfect postmarks : 31 JUL 18 and AU 318. Dun an cullen 452  My dear Tom, Just after my last had gone to the Post in came one of the Men with whom we endeavoured to agree about going to Staffa---he said what a pitty it was we should turn aside and not see the Curiosities. So we had a little talk and finally agreed that he should be our guide across the Isle of Mull---We set out, crossed two ferries, one to the isle of Kerrara of little distance, the other from Kerrara to Mull 9 Miles across---we did it in forty minutes with a fine Breeze---The road through the Island, or rather the track is the most dreary you can think of---between dreary Mountains---over bog and rock and river with our Breeches tucked up and our Stockings in hand. About eight oClock we arrived at a Shepherd's Hut into which we could scarcely get for the Smoke through a door lower than my Shoulders---We found our way into a little compartment with the rafters and turf thatch blackened with smoke--- the earth floor full of Hills and Dales---We had some white Bread with us, made a good Supper and slept in our Clothes in some Blankets, our Guide snored on another little bed about an Arm's length off---This morning we came about sax Miles to Breakfast by rather a better path and we are now in by comparison a Mansion--- Our Guide is I think a very obliging fellow---in the way this morning he sang us two Gaelic songs---one made by a Mrs Brown on her husband's being drowned the other a jacobin one on Charles Stuart. For some days Brown has been enquiring out his Genealogy here---he thinks his Grandfather came from long Island---he got a parcel of people about him at a Cottage door last Evening---chatted with ane who had been a Miss Brown and who I think from a likeness must have been a Relation---he jawed with the old Woman ---flatterd a young one---kissed a child who was afraid of his Spectacles and finally drank a pint of Milk---They handle his Spectacles as we do a sensitive leaf---. July 26th  453 Well---we had a most wretched walk of 37 Miles across the Island of Mull and then we crossed to Iona or Icolmkill from Icolmkill we took a boat at a bargain to take us to Staffa and land us at the head of Loch Nakgal whence we should only have to walk half the distance to Oban again and on a better road ---All this is well pass'd and done with this singular piece of Luck that there was an intermission in the bad Weather just as we saw Staffa at which it is impossible to land but in a tolerable Calm Sea---But I will first mention Icolmkill---I know not whether you have heard much about this Island, I never did before I came night it. It is rich in the most interesting AntiquIties. Who would expect to find the ruins of a fine Cathedral Church, of Cloisters, Colleges, Monastaries and Nunneries in so remote an Island? The Beginning of these things was in the sixth Century under the superstition of a would-be Bishop-saint who landed from Ireland and chose the spot from its Beauty---for at that time the now treeless place was covered with magnificent Woods. Columba in the Gaelic is Colm signifying Dove---Kill signifies church and I is as good as Island---so I-colm-kill means the Island of Saint Columba's Church. Now this Saint Columba became the Dominic of the barbarian Christians of the north and was famed also far south---but more especially was reverenced by the Scots the Picts the Norwegians the Irish. In a course of years perhaps the Island was considered the most holy ground of the north, and the old Kings of the afore mentioned nations chose it for their burial place. We were shown a spot in the Churchyard where they say 61 Kings are buried 48 Scotch from Fergus 2nd to Mackbeth 8 Irish 4 Norwegian and 1 french---they lie in rows compact---Then we were shown other matters of later date but still very ancient---many tombs of Highland Chieftains---their effigies in complete armour face upwards---black and moss covered---Abbots and Bishops of the island always of one of the chief Clans. There were plenty Macleans and Macdonnels, among these latter the famous Macdonel Lord of the Isles---There have been 300 Crosses in teh Island but the Presbyterians destroyed all but two, one of which is a very fine one and completely covered with a shaggy coarse Moss. The old Schoolmaster  454 an ignorant little man but reckoned very clever, showed us these things---He is a Macklean and as much above 4 foot as he is under 4 foot 3 inches---he stops at one glass of wiskey unless you press another and at the second unless you press a third. I am puzzled how to give you an Idea of Staffa. It can only be represented by a first rate drawing ---One may compare the surface of the Island to a roof ---this roof is supported by grand pillars of basalt standing together as thick as honeycombs. The finest thing is Fingal's Cave---it is entirely a hollowing out of Basalt Pillars. Suppose now the Giants who rebelled against Jove had taken a whole Mass of black Columns and bound them together like bunches of matches---and then with immense Axes had made a cavern in the body of these columns--- of course the roof and floor must be composed of the broken ends of the Columns---such is fingal's Cave except that the Sea has done the work of excavations and is continually dashing there---so that we walk along the sides of the cave on the pillars which are left as if for convenient Stairs--- the roof is arched somewhat gothic wise and the length of some of the entire side pillars is 50 feet---About the island you might seat an army of Men each on a pillar. The length of the Cave is 120 feet and from its extremity the view into the sea through the large Arch at the entrance  455 \--- the colour of the columns is a sort of black with a lurking gloom of purple therein---For solemnity and grandeur it far surpasses the finest Cathedrall  456 \---At the extremity of the Cave there is a small perforation into another cave, at which the waters meeting and buffetting each other there is sometimes produced a report as of a cannon heard as far as Iona which must be 12 Miles ---As we approached in the boat there was such a fine swell of the sea that the pillars appeared rising immediately out of the crystal---But it is impossible to describe it. Not Aladin magian Ever such a work began. Not the Wizard of the Dee Ever such a dream could see Not St John in Patmos isle In the passion of his toil When he saw the churches seven Golden-aisled built up in heaven Gazed at such a rugged wonder. As I stood its roofing  457 under Lo! I saw one sleeping there On the marble cold and bare While the surges washed his feet And his garments white did beat Drench'd about the sombre rocks, On his neck his well-grown locks Lifted dry above the Main Were upon the curl again--- What is this and what art thou? Whisper'd I and touch'd his brow. What art thou and what is this? Whisper'd I and strove to Kiss The Spirit's hand to wake his eyes. Up he started in a thrice. I am Lycidas said he Fam'd in funeral Minstrelsey. This was architected thus By the great Oceanus Here his mighty waters play Hollow Organs all the day Here by turns his dolphins all Finny palmers great and small Come to pay devotion due--- Each a mouth of pearls must strew Many a Mortal of these days Dares to pass our sacred ways Dares to touch audaciously This Cathedral of the Sea--- I have been the Pontif priest Where the Waters never rest Where a fledgy sea bird choir Soars for ever---holy fire I have hid from Mortal Man. Old Proteus is my Sacristan. But the stupid eye of Mortal Hath pass'd beyond the Rocky portal So for ever will I leave Such a taint and soon unweave All the magic of the place--- 'Tis now free to stupid face To cutters and to fashion boats To cravats and to Petticoats. The great Sea shall war it down For its fame shall not be blown At every farthing quadrille dance. So saying with a Spirits glance He dived---  458 I am sorry I am so indolent as to write such stuff as this--- it cant be help'd.---The western coast of Scotland is a most strange place---it is composed of rocks Mountains, mountainous and rocky Islands intersected by Lochs---you can go but a small distance any where from salt water in the highlands I have a slight sore throat and think it best to stay a day or two at Oban. Then we shall proceed to Fort William and Inverness---Where I am anxious to be on account of a Letter from you---Brown in his Letters puts down every little circumstance. I should like to do the same but I confess myself too indolent and besides next winter every thing will come up in prime order as we verge on such and such things. Have you heard in any way of George? I should think by this time he must have landed---I in my carelessness never thought of knowing where a letter would find him on the other side---I think Baltimore but I am affraid of directing to the wrong place. I shall begin some chequer work for him directly and it will be ripe for the post by the time I hear from you next after this---I assure you I often long for a seat and a Cup o' tea at well Walk--- especially now that mountains, castles and Lakes are becoming common to me---yet I would rather summer it out for on the whole I am happier than when I have time to be glum---perhaps it may cure me---Immediately on my return I shall begin studying hard with a peep at the theatre now and then---and depend upon it I shall be very luxurious---With respect to Women I think I shall be able to conquer my passions hereafter better than I have yet done. You will help me to talk of george next winter and we will go now and then to see Fanny---Let me hear a good account of your health and comfort telling me truly how you do alone--- Remember me to all including Mr and Mrs Bentley---  459 Your most affectionate Brother John--- Address : Mr Thos Keats  Well Walk  Hampstead  Middx--- Postmarks : INVERNESS 6 AUG 1818; TOO LATE; AUG 9 1818 and 10 O'CLOCK AU 12 1818. 460 Letter Findlay, August 3rd, Ah mio Ben. My dear Tom, We have made but poor progress Lately, chiefly from bad weather for my throat is in a fair way of getting quite well, so I have had nothing of consequence to tell you till yesterday when we went up Ben Nevis, the highest Mountain in Great Britain---On that account I will never ascend another in this empire--- Skiddaw is nothing to it either in height or in difficulty. It is above 4300 feet from the Sea level and Fortwilliam stands at the head of a Salt water Lake, consequently we took it completely from that level. I am heartily glad it is done---it is almost like a fly crawling up a wainscoat---Imagine the task of mounting 10 Saint Pauls without the convenience of Stair cases. We set out about five in the morning with a Guide in the Tartan and Cap and soon arrived at the foot of the first ascent which we immediately began upon--- after much fag and tug and a rest and a glass of whiskey apiece we gained the top of the first rise and saw then a tremendous chap above us which the guide said was still far from the top---After the first Rise our way lay along a heath valley in which there was a Loch---after about a Mile in this Valley we began upon the next ascent---more formidable by far than the last and kept mounting with short intervals of rest untill we got above all vegetation, among nothing but loose Stones which lasted us the very top---the Guide said we had three Miles of a stony ascent---we gained the first tolerable level after the valley to the height of what in the Valley we had thought the top and saw still above us another huge crag which still the Guide said was not the top---to that we made with an obstinate fag, and having gained it there came on a Mist, so that from that part to the very top we walked in a Mist. The whole immense head of the Mountain is composed of large loose stones--- thousands of acres---Before we had got half way up we passed large patches of snow and near the top there is a chasm some hundred feet deep completely glutted with it ---Talking of chasms they are the finest wonder of the whole ---they appear great rents in the very heart of the mountain though they are not, being at the side of it, but other huge crags arising round it give the appearance to Nevis of a shattered heart or Core in itself---These Chasms are 1500 feet in depth and are the most tremendous places I have ever seen---they turn one giddy if you choose to give way to it---We tumbled in large stones and set the echoes at work in fine style. Sometimes these chasms are tolerably clear, sometimes there is a misty cloud which seems to steam up and sometimes they are entirely smothered with clouds. After a little time the Mist cleared away but still there were large Clouds about attracted by old Ben to a certain distance so as to form as it appear'd large dome curtains which kept sailing about, opening and shutting at intervals here and there and everywhere; so that although we did not see one vast wide extent of prospect all round we saw something perhaps finer---these cloud-veils opening with a dissolving motion and showing us the mountainous region beneath as through a loop hole---these cloudy loop holes ever varying and discovering fresh prospect east, west north and South. Then it was misty again and again it was fair---then puff came a cold breeze of wind and bared a craggy chap we had not yet seen though in close neighbourhood---Every now and then we had over head blue Sky clear and the sun pretty warm. I do not know whether I can give you an Idea of the prospect from a large Mountain top---You are on a stony plain which of course makes you forget you are on any but low ground---the horison or rather edges of this plain being above 4000 feet above the Sea hide all the Country immediately beneath you; so that the next objects you see all round next to the edges of the flat top are the Summits of Mountains of some distance off---as you move about on all sides you see more or less of the near neighbour country according as the Mountain you stand upon is in different parts steep or rounded---but the most new thing of all is the sudden leap of the eye from the extremity of what appears a plain into so vast a distance. On one part of the top there is a handsome pile of stones done pointedly by some soldiers of artillery, I climbed onto them and so got a little higher than old Ben himself. It was not so cold as I expected--- yet cold enough for a glass of Wiskey now and then---There is not a more fickle thing than the top of a Mountain---what would a Lady give to change her headdress as often and with as little trouble!---There are a good many red deer upon Ben Nevis we did not see one---the dog we had with us keep  for kept  a very sharp look out and really languished for a bit of a worry---I have said nothing yet of out  for our  getting on among the loose stones large and small sometimes on two sometimes on three, sometimes four legs--sometimes two and stick, sometimes three and stick, then four again, then two, then a jump, so that we kept on ringing changes on foot, hand, stick, jump, boggle, stumble, foot, hand, foot, (very gingerly) stick again, and then again a game at all fours. After all there was one Mrs Cameron of 50 years of age and the fattest woman in all inverness shire who got up this Mountain some few years ago---true she had her servants---but then she had her self---She ought to have hired Sysiphus---"Up the high hill he heaves a huge round  461 \---Mrs Cameron" 'Tis said a little conversation took place between the mountain and the Lady---After taking a glass of Wiskey as she was tolerably seated at ease she thus began Upon my Life Sir Nevis I am pique'd That I have so far panted tugg'd and reek'd To do an honor to your old bald pate And now am sitting on you just to bate, Without your paying me one compliment. Alas 'tis so with all, when our intent Is plain, and in the eye of all Mankind We fair ones show a preference, too blind! You Gentleman immediately turn tail--- O let me then my hapless fate bewail! Ungrateful Baldpate have I not disdaind The pleasant Valleys---have I not mad braind Deserted all my Pickles and preserves My China closet too---with wretched Nerves To boot---say wretched ingrate have I not Left my soft cushion chair and caudle pot. 'Tis true I had no corns---no! thank the fates My Shoemaker was always Mr Bates. And if not Mr Bates why I'm not old! Still dumb ungrateful Nevis---still so cold! Here the Lady took some more wiskey and was putting even more to her lips when she dashed it to the Ground for the Mountain began to grumble---which continued for a few Minutes before he thus began, What whining bit of tongue and Mouth thus dares Disturb'd my Slumber of a thousand years---  462 Even so long my sleep has been secure--- And to be so awaked I'll not endure. Oh pain---for since the Eagle's earliest scream  463 I've had a dam'd  464 confounded ugly dream you? A Nightmare sure. What Madam was it true It cannot be! My old eyes are not true! Red-Crag,  465 My Spectacles! Now let me see! Good Heavens Lady how the gemini Did you get here? O I shall split my Sides! I shall earthquake--- Sweet Nevis do not quake, for though I love Your honest Countenance all things above Truly I should not like to be convey'd So far into your Bosom---gentle Maid Loves not too rough a treatment gentle sir--- Pray thee be calm and do not quake nor stir No not a Stone or I shall go in fits--- I must---I shall---I meet not such tit bits--- I meet not such sweet creatures every day By my old night cap night cap night and day I must have one sweet Buss---I must and shall! Red Crag!---What Madam can you then repent Of all the toil and vigour you have spent To see Ben Nevis and to touch his nose? Red Crag I say! O I must have you close! Red Crag, there lies beneath my farthest toe A vein of Sulphur---go dear Red Crag go--- And rub your flinty back against it---budge! Dear Madam I must kiss you, faith I must! I must Embrace you with my dearest gust! Block-head,  466 d'ye hear---Block-head I'll make her feel There lies beneath my east leg's northern heel A cave of young earth dragons---well my boy Go thither quick and so complete my joy Take you a bundle of the largest pines And where the sun on fiercest Phosphor shines  467 Fire them and ram them in the Dragons' nest Then will the dragons fry and fizz their best Until ten thousand now no bigger than Poor Aligators poor things of one span Will each one swell to twice ten times the size Of northern whale---then for the tender prize--- The moment then---for then will red Crag rub His flinty back and I shall Kiss and snub And press my dainty morsel to my breast Blockhead make haste! O Muses weep the rest--- The Lady fainted and he thought her dead So pulled the clouds again about his head  468 And went to sleep again---soon she was rous'd By her affrighted Servants---next day hous'd Safe on the lowly ground she bless'd her fate That fainting fit was not delayed too late But what surprises me above all is how this Lady got down again. I felt it horribly. 'Twas the most vile descent ---shook me all to pieces---Over leaf you will find a Sonnet I wrote on the top of Ben Nevis. We have just entered Inverness. I have three Letters from you and one from Fanny---and one from Dilke. I would set about crossing this all over for you but I will first write to Fanny and Mrs Wilie. Then I will begin another to you and not before because I think it better you should have this as soon as possible---My Sore throat is not quite well and I intend stopping here a few days Read me a Lesson muse, and speak it loud Upon the top of Nevis blind in Mist! I look into the Chasms and a Shroud Vaprous doth hide them; just so much I wist Mankind do know of Hell: I look o'erhead And there is sullen Mist; even so much Mankind can tell of Heaven: Mist is spread Before the Earth beneath me--even such Even so vague is Man's sight of himself. Here are the craggy Stones beneath my feet; Thus much I know, that a poor witless elf I tread on them; that all my eye doth meet Is mist and Crag---not only on this height But in the world of thought and mental might--- Good bye till tomorrow Your most affectionate Brother John--- Address : Mrs Wylie  Henrietta Street  London Postmark : not recorded. Inverness, 6 August. My dear Madam--- It was a great regret to me that I should leave all my friends, just at the moment when I might have helped to soften away the time for them. I wanted not to leave my brother Tom, but more especially, believe me, I should like to have remained near you, were it but for an atom of consolation after parting with so dear a daughter; My brother George has ever been more than a brother to me, he has been my greatest friend, and I can never forget the sacrifice you have made for his happiness. As I walk along the Mountains here I am full of these things, and lay in wait, as it were, for the pleasure of seeing you, immediately on my return to town. I wish above all things, to say a word of Comfort to you, but I know not how. It is impossible to prove that black is white. it is impossible to make out, that sorrow is joy, or joy is sorrow--- Tom tells me that you called on Mr Haslam with a Newspaper giving an account of a Gentleman in a Fur cap, falling over a precipice in Kirkcudbrightshire. If it was me, I did it in a dream, or in some magic interval between the first and second cup of tea; which is nothing extraordinary, when we hear that Mahomet, in getting out of Bed, upset a jug of water, and whilst it was falling, took a fortnight's trip as it seemed, to Heaven; yet was back in time to save one drop of water being spilt. As for Fur caps, I do not remember one beside my own, except at Carlisle---this was a very good Fur cap I met in the High Street, and I dare say was the unfortunate one. I dare say that the Fates seeing but two Fur caps in the North, thought it too extraordinary, and so threw the Dies which of them should be drowned. The lot fell upon Jonas. I dare say his name was Jonas. All I hope is that the gaunt Ladies said not a word about hanging, if they did I shall one day regret that I was not half- drowned in Kirkcudbright. Stop! let me see!---being half-drowned by falling from a precipice is a very romantic affair---why should I not take it to myself? Keep my secret & I will. How glorious to be introduced in a drawing- room to a Lady who reads Novels, with "Mr So-and-so---Miss So- and-so; Miss So-and-so, this is Mr So-and-so who fell off a precipice and was half- drowned.' Now I refer it to you whether I should lose so fine an opportunity of making my fortune---No romance lady could resist me---None--- Being run under a Wagon; side-lamed at a playhouse; Apoplectic through Brandy; and a thousand other tolerably decent things for badness would be nothing; but being tumbled over a precipice into the sea---oh it would make my fortune--- especially if you could contrive  469 to hint, from this bulletin's authority, that I was not upset on my own account, but that I dashed into the waves after Jessy of Dumblane  470 \---and pulled her out by the hair.---but that, alas! she was dead or she would have made me happy with her hand---however in this you may use your own discretion ---But I must leave joking, and seriously aver, that I have been werry romantic indeed, among these Mountains and Lakes. I have got wet through day after day--- eaten oat- cake, and drank Whisky, walked up to my knees in Bog, got a sore throat, gone to see Icolmkill and Staffa, met with wholesome food, just here and there as it happened; went up Ben Nevis, and---N.B., came down again. Sometimes when I am rather tired I lean rather languishingly on a Rock, and long for some famous Beauty to get down from her Palfrey in passing, approach me with---her saddle-bags and give me---a dozen or two capital roastbeef Sandwiches--- When I come into a large town, you know there is no putting one's Knapsack into one's fob; so the people stare. We have been taken for Spectacle-venders, Razor-sellers, Jewellers, travelling linen-drapers, Spies, Excisemen, and many things else I have no idea of. When I asked for letters at the Post Office, Port Patrick; the man asked what regiment? I have had a peep also at Little Ireland. Tell Henry I have not camped quite on the bare Earth yet; but nearly as bad, in walking through Mull---for the Shepherd's huts you can scarcely breathe in, for the Smoke which they seem to endeavour to preserve for smoking on a large scale. Besides riding about 400, we have walked above 600 Miles, and may therefore reckon ourselves as set out. I wish, my dear Madam, that one of the greatest pleasures I shall have on my return, will be seeing you and that I shall ever be Yours with the greatest Respect and sincerity John Keats. 1818. Inverness. 7th August 1818. My dear Sir, What shall I write about? I am resolved to send you a letter, but where is the subject? I have already stumped away on my ten toes 642 miles, and seen many fine sights, but I am puzzled to know what to make choice of. Suppose I begin with myself,---there must be a pleasure in that,---and, by way of variety, I must bring in Mr Keats. Then, be it known, in the first place, we are in as continued a bustle as an old Dowager at Home. Always moving---moving from one place to another, like Dante's inhabitants of the Sulphur Kingdom in search of cold ground,---prosing over the Map,---calculating distances,--- packing up knapsacks,---and paying bills. There's so much for yourself, my dear. "Thank ye, Sir." How many miles to the next Town? "Seventeen lucky miles, Sir." That must be at least twenty; come along, Keats; here's your stick; why, we forgot the map!---now for it; seventeen lucky miles! I must have another hole taken up in the strap of my Knapsack. Oh, the misery of coming to the meeting of three roads without a finger post! There's an old woman coming,---Godbless her! she'll tell us all about it. Eh! she can't speak English! Repeat the name of the town over in all ways, but the true spelling way, and possibly she may understand. No, we have not got the brogue. Then toss up heads or tails---for right and left, and fortune send us the right road! Here's a soaking shower coming! ecod! it rolls between the mountains as if it would drown us. At last we come wet and weary to the long wished for Inn. What have you for Dinner? "Truly nothing." No Eggs? "We have two." Any loaf bread? "No, Sir, but we've nice oat-cakes." Any bacon? any dried fish? "No, no, no, Sir!" But you've plenty of Whiskey? "O yes, Sir, plenty of Whiskey!" This is melancholy. Why should so beautiful a Country be poor? Why can't craggy mountains, and granite rocks, bear corn, wine, and oil? These are our misfortunes,---these are what make me "an Eagle's talon in the waist".  471 But I am well repaid for my sufferings. We came out to endure, and to be gratified with scenery, and lo! we have not been disappointed either way. As for the Oat-cakes, I was once in despair about them. I was not only too dainty, but they absolutely made me sick. With a little gulping, I can manage them now. Mr Keats however is too unwell for fatigue and privation. I am waiting here to see him off in the Smack for London. He caught a violent cold in the Island of Mull, which, far from leaving him, has become worse, and the Physician here thinks him too thin and fevered to proceed on our journey. It is a cruel disappointment. We have been as happy as possible together. Alas! I shall have to travel thro' Perthshire and all the Counties round in solitude! But my disappointment is nothing to his; he not only loses my company, (and that's a great loss,) but he loses the Country. Poor Charles Brown will have to trudge by himself, ---an odd fellow, and moreover an odd figure;---imagine me with a thick stick in my hand, the knapsack on my back, "with spectacles on nose", a white hat, a tartan coat and trowsers, and a Highland plaid thrown over my shoulders! Don't laugh at me, there's a good fellow,---altho' Mr Keats calls me the Red Cross Knight, and declares my own shadow is ready to split its sides as it follows me. This dress is the best possible dress, as Dr. Pangloss would say. It is light and not easily penetrated by the wet, and when it is, it is not cold,---it has little more than a kind of heavy smoky sensation about it. I must not think of the wind, and the sun, and the rain, after my journey thro' the island of Mull. There's a wild place! Thirty seven miles of jumping and flinging over great stones along no path at all, up the steep and down the steep, and wading thro' rivulets up to the knees, and crossing a bog, a mile long, up to the ancles. I should like to give you a whole and particular account of the many---many wonderful places I have visited,---but why should I ask a man to pay vigentiple postage? In one word then,---that is to the end of the letter,---let me tell you I have seen one half of the Lakes in Westmoreland &Cumberland,---I have travelled over the whole of the coast of Kirkcudbrightshire, and skudded over to Donaghadee. But I did not like Ireland,---at least that part,---and would go no farther than Belfast. So back came I in a whirligig,---that is in a hurry,---and trotted up to Ayr; where I had the happiness of drinking Whiskey in the very house that Robin Burns was born in,---and I saw the banks of bonny Doon,---and the brigs of Ayr,---and Kirk Alloway,---I saw it all! After this we went to Glasgow, & then to Loch Lomond,---but you can read all about that place in one of the fashionable guide-books. Then to Loch Awe and down to the foot of it, ---oh, what a glen we went thro' to get at it! At the top of the glen my Itinerary mentioned a place called "Rest and be thankful" nine miles off; now we had set out without breakfast, intending to take our meal there, when, horror and starvation! "Rest and be thankful" was not an Inn, but a stone seat!  472 Address : Miss Keats  Miss Tucker's  Walthamstow. Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 19 AU 1818. Hampstead August 18th. My dear Fanny, I am affraid you will think me very negligent in not having answered your Letter---I see it is dated June 12- I did not arrive at Inverness till the 8th 473 of this Month so I am very much concerned at your being disappointed so long a time. I did not intend to have returned to London so soon but have a bad sore throat from a cold I caught in the island of Mull: therefore I thought it best to get home as soon as possible and went on board the Smack from Cromarty. We had a nine days passage and were landed at London Bridge yesterday. I shall have a good deal to tell you about Scotland---I would begin here but I have a confounded tooth ache. Tom has not been getting better since I left London and for the last fortnight has been worse than ever---he has been getting a little better for these two or three days. I shall ask Mr Abbey to let me bring you to Hampstead. If Mr A should see this Letter tell him that he still must if he pleases forward the Post Bill to Perth as I have empowered my fellow traveller to receive it. I have a few scotch pebbles for you from the Island of Icolmkill--- I am affraid they are rather shabby---I did not go near the Mountain of Cairn Gorm. I do not know the Name of George's ship---the Name of the Port he has gone to is Philadelphia when ce he will travel to the Settlement across the Country---I will tell you all about this when I see you ---The Title of my last Book is 'Endymion' you shall have one soon. I would not advise you to play on the Flageolet however I will get you one if you please. I will speak to Mr Abbey on what you say concerning school. I am sorry for your poor Canary. You shall have another volume of my first Book. My tooth Ache keeps on so that I cannot write with any pleasure---all I can say now is that your Letter is a very nice one without fault and that you will hear from or see in a few days if his throat will let him, Your affectionate Brother John. Address : Miss Keats  Miss Tucker's  Walthamstow Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 25 AU 1818. Hampstead Tuesday My dear Fanny, I have just written to Mr Abbey to ask him to let you come and see poor Tom who has lately been much worse. He is better at present sends his Love to you and wishes much to see you---I hope he will shortly---I have not been able to come to Walthamstow on his account as well as a little Indisposition of my own. I have asked Mr A. to write me---if he does not mention any thing of it to you, I will tell you what reasons he has though I do not think he will make any objection. Write me what you what  for want  with a Flageolet and I will get one ready for you by the time you come. Your affectionate Brother John--- Address : Miss Reynolds  Little Britain--- Postmark : 1 SP 1818. Well Walk Septr 1st. My dear Jane, Certainly you kind note would rather refresh than than trouble me, and so much the more would your coming if as you say, It could be done without agitating my Brother too much. Receive on your Hearth our deepest thanks for your Solicitude concerning us. I am glad John is not hurt, but gone safe  474 into Devonshire ---I shall be in great expectation of his Letter---but the promise of it in so anxious and friendly a way I prize more than a hundred. I shall be in town to day on some business with my guardian  475 'as was' with scarce a hope of being able to call on you. For these two last days Tom has been more cheerful; you shall hear again soon how he will be--- Remember us particularly to your Mother. Your sincere friend John Keats--- Address : C. W. Dilke Esqre  ---Snook's Esqre  Bedhampton  near Havant--- Hants. Postmark : 21 SP 1818. My dear Dilke, According to the Wentworth place Bulletin you have left Brighton much improved: therefore now a few lines will be more of a pleasure than a bore. I have a few things to say to you and would fain begin upon them in this fourth line: but I have a Mind too well regulated to proceed upon any thing without due preliminary remarks ---you may perhaps have observed that in the simple process of eating radishes I never begin at the root but constantly dip the little green head in the salt---that in the Game of Whist if I have an ace I constantly play it first. So how can I with any face begin without a dissertation on letter writing---Yet when I consider that a sheet of paper contains room only for three pages, and a half how can I do justice to such a pregnant subject? however as you have seen the history of the world stamped as it were by a diminishing glass in the form of a chronological Map, so will I 'with retractile claws'  476 draw this in to the form of a table---whereby it will occupy merely the remainder of this first page  477 \--- Folio---  Parsons, Lawyers, Statesmen, Physicians out of place---Ut--- Eustace---Thornton out of practice or on their travels--- --- Foolscap---  1 superfine rich or noble poets---ut Byron. 2 common ut egomet---. Quarto---  Projectors, Patentees, Presidents, Potatoe growers--- Bath  Boarding schools, and suburbans in general Gilt edge  Dandies in general, male female and literary--- Octavo or tears  All who make use of a lascivious seal--- Duodec.  May be found for the most part on Milliners and Dressmakers Parlour tables--- Strip  At the Playhouse doors, or any where--- Slip  Being but a variation--- Snip  So called from its size being disguised by a twist--- I suppose you will have heard that Hazlitt has on foot a prosecution against Blackwood.  478 I dined with him a few days since at Hessey's---there was not a word said about it, though I understand he is excessively vexed---Reynolds by what I hear is almost over happy  479 and Rice is in town. I have not seen him, nor shall I for some time as my throat has become worse after getting well, and I am determined to stop at home till I am quite well. I was going to Town tomorrow with Mrs D. but I thought it best to ask her excuse this morning---I wish I could say Tom was any better. His identity presses upon me so all day that I am obliged to go out---and although I intended to have given some time to study alone I am obliged to write, and plunge into abstract images to ease myself of his countenance his voice and feebleness---so that I live now in a continual fever ---it must be poisonous to life although I feel well. Imagine 'the hateful siege of contraries'  480 \---if I think of fame of poetry it seems a crime to me, and yet I must do so or suffer---I am sorry to give you pain---I am almost resolv'd to burn this--- but I really have not self possession and magninimity enough to manage the thing otherwise---after all it may be a nervousness proceeding from the Mercury--- Bailey I hear is gaining his Spirits and he will yet be what I once thought impossible a cheerful Man---I think he is not quite so much spoken of in Little Brittain. I forgot to ask Mrs Dilke if she had any thing she wanted to say immediately to you---This morning look'd so unpromising that I did not think she would have gone--- but I find she has on sending for some volumes of Gibbon. I was in a little funk yesterday, for I sent an unseal'd note of sham abuse, until I recollected from what I had heard Charles say, that the servant could neither read nor write ---not even to her Mother as Charles observed. I have just had a Letter from Reynolds---he is going on gloriously. The following is a translation of a Line of Ronsard--- 'Love poured her Beauty into my warm veins'  481 \--- You have passed your Romance and I never gave into it or else I think this line a feast for one of your Lovers--- How goes it with Brown? Your sincere friend John Keats--- 482 My dear Reynolds, Believe me I have rather rejoiced in your happiness than fretted at your silence. Indeed I am grieved on your account that I am not at the same time happy---But I conjure you to think at present of nothing but pleasure "Gather the rose, &c."  483 \---Gorge the honey of life. I pity you as much that it cannot last for ever, as I do myself now drinking bitters.---Give yourself up to it---you cannot help it---and I have a consolation in thinking so. I never was in love---yet the voice and the shape of a Woman  484 has haunted me these two days---at such a time when the relief, the feverous relief of Poetry seems a much less crime ---This morning Poetry has conquered ---I have relapsed into those abstractions which are my only life---I feel escaped from a new strange and threatening sorrow.---and I am thankful for it. 485 \---There is an awful warmth about my heart like a load of Immortality. Poor Tom---that woman---and Poetry were ringing changes in my senses.---Now I am in comparison happy--- I am sensible this will distress you---you must forgive me. Had I known you would have set out so soon I could have sent you the 'Pot of Basil' for I had copied it Here is a free translation of a Sonnet of Ronsard, which I think will please you---I have the loan  486 of his works--- they have great Beauties. Nature withheld Cassandra in the skies, For more adornment, a full thousand years; She took their cream of Beauty's fairest dyes, And shap'd and tinted her above all Peers: Meanwhile Love kept her dearly with his wings, And underneath their shadow fill'd her eyes With such a richness that the cloudy Kings Of high Olympus utter'd slavish sighs. When from the Heavens I saw her first descend, My heart took fire, and only burning pains, They were my pleasures---they my Life's sad end; Love pour'd her beauty into my warm veins. \---     \---     \---     \--- \---     \---     \---     \--- I had not the original by me when I wrote it, and did not recollect the purport of the last lines---  487 I should have seen Rice ere this---but I am confined by Sawrey's mandate in the house now, and have as yet only gone out in fear of the damp night---You know what an undangerous matter it is. I shall soon be quite recovered--- Your offer I shall remember as though it had even now taken place in fact---I think it cannot be--- Tom is not up yet---I cannot say he is better. I have not heard from George. Yr affecte friend John Keats. Postmark: 1818. Bridgewater, Sept. 25th. My dear Keats Here I am as Shakespeare says 'Chewing the cud of sweet & bitter fancy,' solitary in the midst of society with no human being to exchange a notion with except my sister and she begins to be so occupied with her little brats that if I attempt to quote Shakespeare to her I am ordered into silence for fear I should wake the children---I came here for repose of mind---as I am now getting better I am again on the rack to be again in the midst of all the objects of my ambition.---I am getting about again my hero---and I hope to God I shall yet finish my picture to the satisfaction of all of you.---I am longing to be among you ---and hear your account of your last Tour---if it has done as much good to the inside as the outside of your head you will feel the effects of it as long as you live.---I shall leave this place to-morrow or Monday  & hope to be in Town by Wednesday at furthest. I hope your brother Tom does not suffer much---poor fellow---I shall never forget his look when I saw him last.---I can never say as much when I dictate a letter  488 as when I write it myself---and this I hope will be a sufficient excuse for not writing a longer one to you---at any rate this is better treatment than you gave me when you went on your Tour.--- Believe me my dear Keats most affectionately & sincerely Yours ever B R Haydon. P.S. to give you an idea of the elegant taste of this place the other day, in company when I illustrated something by a quotation, one of the company said with great simplicity, 'Lord Mr Haydon, you are full of scraps .'---adieu--- my eyes will not permit me. Address : Miss Keats  Miss Tuckey's  Walthamstow--- Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 9 OC. 1818. My dear Fanny, Poor Tom is about the same as when you saw him last; perhaps weaker---were it not for that I should have been over to pay you a visit these fine days I got to the Stage half an hour before it set out and counted the buns and tarts in a Pastrycooks window and was just beginning with the Jellies. There was no one in the Coach who had a Mind to eat me like Mr Sham-deaf. I shall be punctual in enquiring about next Thursday--- Your affectionate Brother John No address or postmark. 489 My dear Richards, I think the fortnight has passed in which I promised to call on you---I have not been able to come---My Brother Tom gets weaker every day and I am not able to leave him for more than a few hours. As I know you will be anxious about us, if I cannot come I will send you now and then a note of this nature that you may see how we are. Remember me to Mrs R---and to Vincent. Yours most sincerely John Keats Address : J.A. Hessey Esqr, Fleet St. Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 9 OC 1818. My dear Hessey, You are very good in sending me the letter from the Chronicle  490 \---and I am very bad in not acknowledging such a kindness sooner.---pray forgive me.---It has so chanced that I have had that paper every day---I have seen today's. I cannot but feel indebted to those Gentlemen who have taken my part---As for the rest, I begin to get a little acquainted with my own strength and weakness.---Praise or blame has but a momentary effect on the man whose love of beauty in the abstract makes him a severe critic on his own Works. My own domestic criticism has given me pain without comparison beyond what Blackwood or the Quarterly could possibly inflict, and also when I feel I am right, no external praise can give me such a glow as my own solitary reperception & ratification of what is fine. J.S. is perfectly right in regard to the slip-shod Endymion. That it is so is no fault of mine.---No!---though it may sound a little paradoxical. It is as good as I had power to make it--- by myself. Had I been nervous about its being a perfect piece, & with that view asked advice, & trembled over every page, it would not have been written; for it is not in my nature to fumble---I will write independantly.---I have written independently without Judgment .---I may write independently,  & with Judgement hereafter. The Genius of Poetry must work out its own salvation in a man: It cannot be matured by law and precept, but by sensation & watchfulness in itself. That which is creative must create itself---In Endymion, I leaped headlong into the Sea, and thereby have become better acquainted with the Soundings, the quicksands, & the rocks, than if I had stayed upon the green shore, and piped a silly pipe, and took tea & comfortable advice.---I was never afraid of failure; for I would sooner fail than not be among the greatest. But I am nigh getting into a rant. So, with remembrances to Taylor and Woodhouse &c I am Yrs very sincerely John Keats. 491 My Dear Keats I was most delighted at seeing you yesterday,---for I hardly knew how I was to meet with you, situated as you are, and confined as I am. I wish I could have stayed longer with you. As to the Poem I am of all things anxious that you should publish it, for its completeness will be a full answer to all the ignorant malevolence of cold lying Scotchmen and stupid Englishmen. The overweening struggle to oppress you only shows the world that so much of endeavour cannot be directed to nothing. Men do not set their muscles, and strain their sinews to break a straw. I am confident, Keats, that the Pot of Basil hath that simplicity and quiet pathos, which are of sure Sovereignty over all hearts. I must say that it would delight me to have you prove yourself to the world, what we know you to be; to have you annul the Quarterly Review, by the best of all answers. When I see you I will give you the Poem, and pray look it over with that eye to the littlenesses which the world are so fond of excepting to (though I confess with that word altered which I mentioned I see nothing that can be cavilled at) ---And let us have the Tale put forth, now that an interest is aroused. One or two of your Sonnets you might print, I am sure---And I know that I may suggest to you, which---because you can decide as you like   a portion of the sheet is lacking here  ... I give over all intention and you ought to be alone. I can never write anything now---my mind is taken the other way:---But I shall set my heart on having you, high, as you ought to be. Do you get Fame, 492 \---and I shall have it in being your affectionate and steady friend. There is no one I am more interested in---and there is no one that I have more pleasure in communicating my own happiness to. You will gratify me much by letting me have, whenever you have leisure, copies of what you write;---for more than myself have a sincere interest in you. When shall I see you--- & when shall I go with you to Severn's Your ever affectionate Wedn Morn. J.H. Reynolds Address : Miss Keats  Miss Tuckey's  Walthamstow Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 16 OC 1818. Hampstead Friday Morn My dear Fanny, You must not condemn me for not being punctual to Thursday, for I really did not know whether it would not affect poor Tom too much to see you. You know how it hurt him to part with you the last time. At all events you shall hear from me; and if Tom keeps pretty well tomorrow---I will see Mr Abbey the next day, and endeavour to settle that you shall be with us on Tuesday or Wednesday. I have good news from George. He has landed safely with our Sister ---they are both in good health ---their prospects are good---and they are by this time nighing to their journeys end---you shall hear the particulars soon--- Your affectionate Brother John--- Tom's love to you. Address : Miss Keats  Miss Tuckey's  Walthamstow--- Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 26 OC. 1818. My dear Fanny, I called on Mr Abbey in the beginning of last Week: when he seemed averse to letting you come again from having heard that you had been to other places besides Well Walk. I do not mean to say you did wrongly in speaking of it, for there should rightly be no objection to such things: but you know with what People we are obliged in the course of Childhood to associate; whose conduct forces us into duplicity and fa1shood to them. To the worst of People we should be openhearted: but it is as well as things are to be prudent in making any communication to any one, that may throw an impediment in the way of any of the little pleasures you may have. I do not recommend duplicity but prudence with such people. Perhaps I am talking too deeply for you: if you do not now, you will understand what I mean in the course of a few years. I think poor Tom is a little Better: he sends his love to you. I shall call on Mr Abbey tomorrow: when I hope to settle when to see you again. Mrs Dilke has been for some time at Brighton---she is expected home in a day or two. She will be pleased I am sure with your present. I will try for permission for you to remain here all Night should Mrs D. return in time. Your affectionate Brother John--- From a draft. My dear Keats, Whilst in the country, from whence I am but lately returned, I met with that malicious, but weak & silly article on Endymion in the last Quarterly Review. God help the Critic, whoever he be! He is as ignorant of the rudiments of his own craft as of the Essentials of true Poetry. I take it the precious article in question once formed a portion of the critique in the former No upon L. Hunt's foliage.---That the reviewer, in a moment of compunction, changed his plan, & reviewed Hunt's work by itself, intending to leave you alone; tho the scissors with which this sentence of divorce was card into effect left in the earlier article a few traces of the origl union.---But that the Editor, finding himself at a loss for a few pages of matter to eke out his prest No, bethought himself of the fragments of his former review, which he has cooked up afresh, as a side dish for his readers.---That his very equitable censures may have the effect of scaring from the perusal of the Work some of the "Dandy" readers, male  & female, who love to be spared the trouble of judging for themselves, is to be expected. But with men of sense, (as the example of J.S. in the Chronicle proves) the effect must be the reverse---The Criticism is felo dese---It bears on its front the sentence of its own condemng: for the reviewer in his undiscriminating stupidity, has laid his finger of contempt upon passages of such beauty, that no one with a spark of poetic feeling can read them without a desire to know more of the poem.---"If" ---said a friend of mine at Bath, who had seen the critique, but not the work, "These are the worst passages, what must the best be". To be praised in the same review that slabbers with its eulogy Barrett's woman  493 would have been damnation. Such a pestering insect may annoy for a moment, but its impotent attacks can cause no permanent uneasiness.---And I am happy to see by the daily papers, that the crying injustice of the decision has roused indignation in a few who "do look with a jealous eye on the honor of English literature". But enough of such a cobbling, carping, decasyllabic, finger-scanning, criticaster.---His hour of "brief authority" must be nigh over. His blindness will soon work its own way into the earth.--- The appearance of this "critical morsel", however, determines me to address you on the subject of our late conversation at Hessey's, on which I have often since reflected, and never without a degree of pain ---I may have misconceived you; but I understood you to say, you thought there was now nothing original to be written in poetry; that its riches were already exhausted, & all its beauties forestalled---& that you should, consequently, write no more.---I cannot assent to your premises, and I most earnestly deprecate your conclusion.---For my part I believe most sincerely, that the wealth of poetry is unexhausted & inexhaustible---The ideas derivable to us from our senses singly and in their various combinns with each other store the mind with endless images of natural beauty the Passions life & motion & reflection & the moral sense give adn  for additional  relief & harmony to this mighty world of inanimate matter.---It is in the gleaning of the highest, the truest & the sweetest of these ideas, in the orderly grouping of them, & arraying them in the garb of exquisite numbers, that Poetry may be said to consist.--- It is then for the Poeta factus, the imitator of others, who sings only as has been sung, to say that our measure of poesy is full, & that there is nothing new to be written, thus charging upon "most innocent nature" a dearth existg only in his own dull brain---But the poeta natus, the true born son of Genius, who creates for himself the world in which his own fancy ranges, who culls from it fair forms of truth beauty & purity & apparels them in hues chosen by himself should hold a different language---he need never fear that the treasury he draws upon can be exhausted, nor despair of being always able to make an original selection. It is true that in this age; the mass are not of soul to conceive of themselves or even to apprehend when presented to them, the truly & simply beautiful of poetry.---A taste vitiated by the sweetmeats & kickshaws of the past century may be the reason of this. Still fewer of this generation are capable of properly embodying the high conceptions they may have---and of the last number few are the individuals who do not allow their fire & originality to be damped by apprehensions of shallow censures from the groveling & the "cold hearted". In these "evil days however & these evil tonges" (in the spirit of truth & sincerity & not of flattery I say it) I believe there has appeared one bard who "preserves his vessel" in purity independance & honor--- who judges of the beautiful for himself, careless who thinks with him---who pursues his own selfappointed & selfapproved course right onward---who stoops not from his flight to win sullied breath from the multitude---and who "leans away for highest heaven, and sings; 494 pointing  illegible " to a standard of excellence dimly visible as yet even to himself, & scarcely free from the shadows in which from unknown time it has been vested and of which the meaner spirits of his day seem to be without even a conception---And shall such a one, upon whom anxious eyes are fixed, at whose noble aspirings "unnumbered souls breathe out a still applause",  495 be dismayed at the yelpings of the tuneless, the envious, the malignant or the undiscerning? or shall he fall into the worse error of supposing that there is left no corner of the universal heaven of poesy unvisited by Wing? Shall he subtract himself from the expectations of his country; and leave its ear & its soul to be soothed only by the rhymers & the coupleteers? Shall he let "so fair a house fall to decay"---and shall he give the land which let Chatterton & K. White die of unkindness & neglect,---but which yet retained the grace to weep over their ashes, no opportunity of redeeming its Character, & paying the vast debt it owes to Genius?---Your conduct, my Dear Keats, must give these Questions an answer.--- "Know thine own worth, and reverence the lyre"!--- The world, I hope & trust, is not quite so dead dull and ungrateful as you may have apprehended---or as a few malevolent spirits may have given you reason to imagine. It contains, I know, many who have a warm "affection for the cause Of stedfast Genius toiling gallantly", 496 \---many who, tho' personally unknown to you, look with the eye of hope & anticipation to your future course---but very few who in sincere wishes for your welfare, & passion for your fame, exceed, Dear Keats, Yours most truly, Richd Woodhouse Temple 21st Oct. 1818. Address : Richd. Woodhouse Esqre  Temple--- Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 27 OC 1818. My dear Woodhouse, Your Letter gave me a great satisfaction; more on account of its friendliness, than any relish of that matter in it which is accounted so acceptable in the 'genus irritabile'  497 . The best answer I can give you is in a clerk-like manner to make some observations on two principle points, which seem to point like indices into the midst of the whole pro and con, about genius, and views and atchievements and ambition and coetera. 1st. As to the poetical Character itself (I mean that sort of which, if I am any thing, I am a Member; that sort distinguished from the wordsworthian or egotistical sublime; which is a thing per se and stands alone) it is not itself---it has no self---it is every thing and nothing---It has no character---it enjoys light and shade; it lives in gusto, be it foul or fair, high or low, rich or poor, mean or elevated---It has as much delight in conceiving an Iago as an Imogen. What shocks the virtuous philosopher, delights the camelion Poet. It does no harm from its relish of the dark side of things any more than from its taste for the bright one; because they both end in speculation. A poet is the most unpoetical of any thing in existence; because he has no Identity---he is continually in for--- 498 and filling some other Body---The Sun, the Moon, the Sea and Men and Women who are creatures of impulse are poetical and have about them an unchangeable attribute---the poet has none; no identity---he is certainly the most unpoetical of all God's Creatures. If then he has no self, and if I am a Poet, where is the Wonder that I should say I would write no more? Might I not at that very instant have been cogitating on the Characters of Saturn and Ops? It is a wretched thing to confess; but is a very fact that not one word I ever utter can be taken for granted as an opinion growing out of my identical nature---how can it, when I have no nature? When I am in a room with People if I ever am free from speculating on creations of my own brain, then not myself goes home to myself: but the identity of every one in the room begins to to press upon me that I am in a very little time annihilated---not only among Men; it would be the same in a Nursery of children: I know not whether I make myself wholly understood: I hope enough so to let you see that no dependence is to be placed on what I said that day. In the second place I will speak of my views, and of the life I purpose to myself. I am ambitious of doing the world some good: if I should be spared that may be the work of maturer years---in the interval I will assay to reach to as high a summit in Poetry as the nerve bestowed upon me will suffer. The faint conceptions I have of Poems to come brings the blood frequently into my forehead. All I hope is that I may not lose all interest in human affairs--- that the solitary indifference I feel for applause even from the finest Spirits, will not blunt any acuteness of vision I may have. I do not think it will---I feel assured I should write from the mere yearning and fondness I have for the Beautiful even if my night's labours should be burnt every morning, and no eye ever shine upon them. But even now I am perhaps not speaking from myself: but from some character in whose soul I now live. I am sure however that this next sentence is from myself. I feel your anxiety, good opinion and friendliness in the highest degree, and am Your's most sincerely John Keats Oct. 1818 . No address or postmark. My dear George; There was a part in your Letter which gave me a great deal of pain, that where you lament not receiving Letters from England---I intended to have written immediately on my return from Scotland (which was two Months earlier than I had intended on account of my own as well as Tom's health) but then I was told by Mrs Wylie that you had said you would not wish any one to write till we had heard frome you. This I thought odd and now I see that it could not have been so; yet at the time I suffered my unreflecting head to be satisfied and went on in that sort of abstract careless and restless Life with which you are well acquainted. This sentence should it give you any uneasiness do not let it last for before I finish it will be explained away to your satisfaction--- I am grieved to say that I am not sorry you had not Letters at Philadelphia; you could have had no good news of Tom and I have been withheld on his account from beginning these many days; I could not bring myself to say the truth, that he is no better but much worse---However it must be told and you must my dear Brother and Sister take example frome me and bear up against any Calamity for my sake as I do for your's. Our's are ties which independent of their own Sentiment are sent us by providence to prevent the deleterious effects of one great, solitary grief. I have Fanny  499 and I have you---three people whose Happiness to me is sacred---and it does annul that selfish sorrow which I should otherwise fall into, living as I do with poor Tom who looks upon me as his only comfort---the tears will come into your Eyes ---let them---and embrace each other---thank heaven for what happiness you have and after thinking a moment or two that you suffer in common with all Mankind hold it not a Sin to regain your cheerfulness--- I will relieve you of one uneasiness of overleaf: I returned I said on account of my health---I am now well from a bad sore throat which came of bog trotting in the Island of Mull---of which you shall hear by the coppies I shall make from my Scotch Letters--- Your content in each other is a delight to me which I cannot express---the Moon is now shining full and brilliant---she is the same to me in Matter, what you are to me in Spirit---If you were here my dear Sister I could not pronounce the words which I can write to you from a distance; I have a tenderness for you, and an admiration which I feel to be as great and more chaste than I can have for any woman in the world. You will mention Fanny--- her character is not formed, her identity does not press upon me as yours does. I hope from the bottom of my heart that I may one day feel as much for her as I do for you---I know not how it is, but I have never made any acquaintance of my own---nearly all through your medium my dear Brother--- through you I know not only a Sister but a glorious human being---And now I am talking of those to whom you have made me known I cannot forbear mentioning Haslam as a most kind and obliging and constant friend---His behaviour to Tom during my absence and since my return has endeared him to me for ever--- besides his anxiety about you. Tomorrow I shall call on your Mother and exchange information with her---On Tom's account I have not been able to pass so much time with her as I would otherwise have done---I have seen her but twice---once I dined with her and Charles--- She was well, in good Spirits and I kept her laughing at my bad jokes---We went to tea at Mrs Millar's and in going were particularly struck with the light and shade through the Gate way at the Horse Guards. I intend to write you such Volumes that it will be impossible for me to keep any order or method in what I write: that will come first which is uppermost in my Mind, not that which is uppermost in my heart---besides I should wish to give you a picture of our Lives here whenever by a touch I can do it; even as you must see by the last sentence our walk past Whitehall all in good health and spirits---this I am certain of, because I felt so much pleasure from the simple idea of your playing a game at Cricket---At Mrs Millars I saw Henry quite well---there was Miss Keasle---and the goodnatured Miss Waldegrave---Mrs Millar began a long story and you know it is her Daughter's way to help her on as though her tongue were ill of the gout---Mrs M. certainly tells a Story as though she had been taught her Alphabet in Crutched Friars. Dilke has been very unwell; I found him very ailing on my return---he was under Medical care for some time, and then went to the Sea Side whence he has returned well---Poor little Mrs D---has had another gall-stone attack; she was well ere I returned---she is now at Brighton---Dilke was greatly pleased to hear from you and will write a Letter for me to enclose---He seems greatly desirous of hearing from you of the Settlement itself---I came by ship from Inverness and was nine days at Sea without being Sick---a little Qualm now and then put me in mind of you--- however as soon as you touch the shore all the horrors of Sickness are soon forgotten; as was the case with a Lady on board who could not hold her head up all the way. We had not been in the Thames an hour before her tongue began to some tune; paying off as it was fit she should all old scores. I was the only Englishman on board. There was a downright Scotchman who hearing that there had been a bad crop of Potatoes in England had brought some triumphant Specimens from Scotland---these he exhibited with national pride to all the Lightermen and Watermen from the Nore to the Bridge. I fed upon beef all the way; not being able to eat the thick Porridge which the Ladies managed to manage with large awkward horn spoons into the bargain. Severn has had a narrow escape of his Life from a Typhous fever: he is now gaining strength--- Reynolds has returned from a six weeks enjoyment in Devonshire, he is well and persuades me to publish my pot of Basil as an answer to the attacks made on me in Blackwood's Magazine and the Quarterly Review.  500 There have been two Letters in my defence in the Chronicle  501 and one in the Examiner, coppied from the Alfred Exeter paper and written by Reynolds---I dont know who wrote those in the Quarterly Chronicle---This is a mere matter of the moment---I think I shall be among the English Poets after my death. The Even as a Matter of present interest the attempt to crush me in the Chro Quarterly has only brought me more into notice and it is a common expression among book men "I wonder the Quarterly should cut its own throat.' It does me not the least harm in Society to make me appear little and rediculous: I know when a Man is superior to me and give him all due respect ---he will be the last to laugh at me and as for the rest I feel that I make an impression upon them which insures me personal respect while I am in sight whatever they may say when my back is turned---Poor Haydon's eyes will not suffer him to proceed with his picture---he has been in the Country  502 \---I have seen him but once since my return---I hurry matters together here because I do not know when the Mail sails---I shall enquire to-morrow and then shall know whether to be particular or general in my letter---you shall have at least two sheets a day till it does sail whether it be three days or a fortnight---and then I will begin a fresh one for the next Month. The Miss Reynoldses are very kind to me---but they have lately displeased me much and in this way---Now I am coming the Richardson. On my return the first day I called they were in a sort of taking or bustle about a Cousin of theirs who having fallen out with her Grandpapa in a serious manner was invited by Mrs R---eynolds to take Asylum in her house---She is an east indian and ought to be her Grandfather's Heir. At the time I called Mrs R. was in conference with her up stairs and the young Ladies were warm in her praises down stairs, calling her genteel, interesting and a thousand other pretty things to which I gave no heed, not being partial to 9 days wonders---Now all is completely changed---they hate her; and from what I hear she is not without faults---of a real kind: but she has others which are more apt to make women of inferior charms hate her. She is not a Cleopatra, but she is at least a Charmian. She has a rich eastern look; she has fine eyes and fine manners. When she comes into a room she makes an impression the same as the Beauty of a Leopardess. She is too fine and too conscious of her Self to repulse any Man who may address her---from habit she thinks that nothing particular . I always find myself more at ease with such a woman; the picture before me always gives me a life and animation which I cannot possibly feel with anything inferior---I am at such times too much occupied in admiring to be awkward or on a tremble. I forget myself entirely because I live in her. You will by this time think I am in love with her; so before I go any further I will tell you I am not---she kept me awake one Night as a tune of Mozart's might do---I speak of the thing as a passtime and an amuzement than which I can feel none deeper than a conversation with an imperial woman the very 'yes' and 'no' of whose Lips is to me a Banquet. I dont cry to take the moon home with me in my Pocket not   for norr do I fret to leave her behind me. I like her and her like because one has no sensations \---what we both are is taken for granted---You will suppose I have by this had much talk with her--- no such thing---there are the Miss Reynoldses on the look out---They think I dont admire her because I did not stare at her---They call her a flirt to me ---What a want of Knowledge? She walks across a room in such a manner that a Man is drawn towards her with a magnetic Power. This they call flirting! they do not know things. They do not know what a Woman is. I believe tho' she has faults---the same as Charmian and Cleopatra might have had. Yet she is a fine thing speaking in a worldly way: for there are two distinct tempers of mind in which we judge of things--- the worldly, theatrical and pantomimical; and the unearthly, spiritual and etherial---in the former Buonaparte, Lord Byron and this Charmian hold the first place in our Minds; in the latter John Howard, Bishop Hooker  503 rocking his child's cradle and you my dear Sister are the conquering feelings. As a Man in the world I love the rich talk of a Charmian; as an eternal Being I love the thought of you. I should like her to ruin me, and I should like you to save me.  504 Do not think my dear Brother from this that my Passions are headlong or likely to be ever of any pain to you---no "I am free from Men of Pleasure's cares, By dint of feelings far more deep than theirs" This is Lord Byron,  505 and is one of the finest things he has said---I have no town talk for you, as I have not been much among people---as for Politics they are in my opinion only sleepy because they will soon be too wide awake---Perhaps not---for the long and continued Peace of England itself has given us notions of personal safety which are likely to prevent the re-establishment of our national Honesty--- There is of a truth nothing manly or sterling in any part of the Government. There are many Madmen In the Country, I have no doubt, who would like to be beheaded on tower Hill merely for the sake of eclat, there are many Men like Hunt who from a principle of taste would like to see things go on better, there are many like Sir F. Burdett who like to sit at the head of political dinners---but there are none prepared to suffer in obscurity for their Country---the motives of our worst Men are interest and of our best Vanity---We have no Milton, no Algernon Sidney---Governers in these days loose the title of Man in exchange for that of Diplomat and Minister We breathe in a sort of Officinal Atmosphere---All the departments of Government have strayed far from Spimpicity which is the greatest of Strength---there is as much difference in this respect between the present Government and oliver Cromwell's, as there is between the 12 Tables of Rome and the volumes of Civil Law which were digested by Justinian. A Man now entitlerd Chancellor has the same honour paid to him whether he be a Hog or a Lord Bacon. No sensation is created by Greatness but by the number of orders a Man has at his Button holes Notwithstanding the part which the Liberals take in the Cause of Napoleon I cannot but think he has done more harm to the life of Liberty than any one else could have done: not that the divine right Gentlemen have done or intend to do any good---no they have taken a Lesson of him, and will do all the further harm he would have done without any of the good---The worst thing he has done is, that he has taught them how to organize their monstrous armies---The Emperor Alexander it is said intends to divide his Empire as did Diocletian---creating two Czars besides himself, and continuing the supreme Monarch of the whole---Should he do this and they for a series of Years keep peacable among themselves Russia may spread her conquest even to China---I think it a very likely thing that China itself may fall Turkey certainly will. Meanwhile european north Russia will hold its horns against the rest of Europe, intrieguing constantly with France. Dilke, whom you know to be a Godwin perfectibility Man, pleases himself with the idea that America will be the country to take up the human intellect where england leaves off---I differ there with him greatly---A country like the united states whose greatest Men are Franklins and Washingtons will never do that---They are great Men doubtless but how are they to be compared to those our countreymen Milton and the two Sidneys---The one is a philosophical Quaker full of mean and thrifty maxims the other sold the very Charger who had taken him through all his Battles. Those Americans are great but they are not sublime Man---the humanity of the United States can never reach the sublime--- Birkbeck's mind  506 is too much in the American Stryle---you must endeavour to infuse a little Spirit of another sort into the Settlement, always with great caution, for thereby you may do your descendents more good than you may imagine. If I had a prayer to make for any great good, next to Tom's recovery, it should be that one of your Children should be the first American Poet. I have a great mind to make a prophecy and they say prophecies work out their own fullfillment--- 'Tis 'the witching time of night'  507 Orbed is the Moon and bright And the Stars they glisten, glisten Seeming with bright eyes to listen For what listen they? For a song and for a charm See they glisten in alarm And the Moon is waxing warm To hear what I shall say. Moon keep wide thy golden ears Hearken Stars, and hearken Spheres Hearken thou eternal Sky I sing an infant's lullaby, A pretty Lullaby! Listen, Listen, listen, listen Glisten, glisten, glisten, glisten And hear my lullaby? Though the Rushes that will make Its cradle still are in the lake: Though the f linnen then that will be Its swathe is on the cotton tree; Though the wollen that will keep It warm, is on the silly sheep; Listen Stars light, listen, listen, Glisten, Glisten, glisten, glisten And hear my lullaby! Child! I see thee! Child I've found thee Midst of the quiet all around thee!  508 Child I see thee! Child I spy thee And thy mother sweet is nigh thee!--- Child I know thee! Child no more But a Poet ever more See, See the Lyre, the Lyre In a flame of fire Upon the little cradle's top Flaring, flaring, flaring Past the eyesight's bearing--- Awake it from its sleep And see if it can keep Its eyes upon the blaze. Amaze, Amaze! It stares, it stares, it stares It dares what no one dares  509 It lifts its little hand into the flame Unharm'd, and on the strings Paddles a little tune and signs sings With dumb endeavour sweetly! Bard art thou completely! Little Child O' the western wild Bard art thou completely!--- Sweetly with dumb endeavour--- A Poet now or never! Little Child O' the western wild A Poet now or never! This is friday, I know not what day of the Month  510 \--- I will enquire tomorrow for it is fit you should know the time I am writing. I went to Town yesterday, and calling at Mrs Millar's was told that your Mother would not be found at home---I met Henry as I turned the corner--- I had no leisure to return, so I left the letters with him--- He was looking very well. Poor Tom is no better to-night ---I am affraid to ask him what Message I shall send from him---And here I could go on complaining of my Misery, but I will keep myself cheerful for your Sakes. With a great deal of trouble I have succeeded in getting Fanny to Hampstead---She has been several times. Mr Lewis  511 has been very kind to Tom all the Summer there has scarce a day passed but he has visited him, and not one day without bringing or sending some fruit of the nicest kind. He has been very assiduous in his enquiries after you. It would give the old Gentleman a great pleasure if you would send him a Sheet enclosed in the next parcel to me, after you receive this---how long it will be first---Why did I not write to Philadelphia? Really I am sorry for that neglect--- I wish to go on writing ad infinitum, to you---I wish for interresting matter, and a pen as swift as the wind---But the fact is I go so little into the Crowd now that I have nothing fresh and fresh every day to speculate upon, except my own Whims and Theroies. I have been but once to Haydon's, onece to Hunt's, once to Rice's, once to Hessey's. I have not seen Taylor, I have not been to the Theatre---Now if I had been many times to all these and was still in the habit of going I could on my return at night have each day something new to tell you of without any stop---But now I have such a dearth that when I get to the end of this sentence and to the bottom of this page I much  for must  wait till I can find something interesting to you before I begin another.  512 \---After all it is not much matter what it may be about; for the very words from such a distance penned by this hand will be grateful to you---even though I were to coppy out the tale of Mother Hubbard or Little Red Riding Hood---I have been over to Dilke's this evening---there with Brown we have been talking of different and indifferent Matters---of Euclid, of Metaphisics of the Bible, of Shakspeare, of the horrid System and consequences of the fagging at great Schools---I know not yet how large a parcel I can send---I mean by way of Letters---I hope there can be no objection to my dowling up a quire made into a small compass---That is the manner in which I shall write. I shall send you more than Letters---I mean a tale---which I must begin on account of the activity of my Mind; of its inability to remain at rest. It must be prose and not very exciting. I must do this because in the way I am at present situated I have too many interruptions to a train of feeling to be able to write Poetry---So I shall write this Tale, and if I think it worth while get a duplicate made before I send it off to you--- This is a fresh beginning the 21st October. Charles and Henry were with us on Sunday and they brought me your Letter to your Mother---we agreed to get a Packet off to you as soon as possible. I shall dine with your Mother tomorrow, when they have promised to have their Letters ready. I shall send as soon as possible without thinking of the little you may have from me in the first parcel, as I intend as I said before to begin another Letter of more regular information. Here I want to communicate so largely in a little time that I am puzzled where to direct my attention. Haslam has promised to let me know from Capper and Hazlewood. For want of something better I shall proceed to give you some extracts from my Scotch Letters---Yet now I think on it why not send you the letters themselves---I have three of them at present. I believe Haydon has two 513 which I will get in time.  514 I dined with your Mother & Henry at Mrs Millar's on thursday when they gave me their Letters Charles's I have not yet---he has promised to send it. The thought of sending my scotch Letters has determined me to enclose a few more which I have received and which will give you the best cue to how I am going on better than you could otherwise know ---Your Mother was well and I was sorry I could not stop later. I called on Hunt yesterday---it has been always my fate to meet Ollier  515 there---On thursday I walked with Hazlitt as far as covent Garden: he was going to play Rackets---I think Tom has been rather better these few last days ---he has been less nervous. I expect Reynolds tomorrow Since I wrote thus far I have met with that same Lady again, whom I saw at Hastings and whom I met when we were going to the English Opera. It was in a Street which goes from Bedford Row to Lamb's Conduit Street---I passed her and turned back---she seemed glad of it; glad to see me and not offended at my passing her before. We walked on towards Islington where we called on a friend of her's who keeps a Boarding School. She has always been an enigma to me---she has new been in a Room with you and with Reynolds and wishes we should be acquainted without any of our common acquaintance knowing it. As we went along, some times through shabby, sometimes through decent Streets I had my guessing at work, not knowing what it would be and prepared to meet any surprise---First it ended at this House at Islington: on parting from which I pressed to attend her home. She consented, and then again my thoughts were at work what it might lead to, tho' now they had received a sort of genteel hint from the Boarding School. Our Walk ended in 34 Gloucester Street, Queen Square ---not exactly so for we went up stairs into her sitting room---a very tasty sort of place with Books, Pictures a bronze statue of Buonaparte, Music, acolian Harp; a Parrot, a Linnet---a Case of choice Liqueurs &c. &c. &c. She behaved in the kindest manner---made me take home a Grouse for Tom's dinner ---Asked for my address for the purpose of sending more game---As I had warmed with her before and kissed her--- I thought it would be living backwards not to do so again---she had a better taste: she perceived how much a thing of course it was and shrunk from it---not in a prudish way but in as I say a good taste. She contrived to disappoint me in a way which made me feel more pleasure than a simple Kiss could do---She said I should please her much more if I would only press her hand and go away. Whether she was in a different disposition when I saw her before---or whether I have in fancy wrong'd her I cannot tell. I expect to pass some pleasant hours with her now and then: in which I feel I shall be of service to her in matters of knowledge and taste: if I can I will. I have no libidinous thought about her---she and your George are the only women a peu pres de mon age whom I would be content to know for their mind and friendship alone. I shall in a short time write you as far as I know how I intend to pass my Life---I cannot think of those things now Tom is so unwell and weak. Notwithstanding your Happiness and your recommendation I hope I shall never marry. Though the most beautiful Creature were waiting for me at the end of a Journey or a Walk; though the carpet were of Silk, the Curtains of the morning Clouds; the chairs and Sofa stuffed with Cygnet's down; the food Manna, the Wine beyond Claret, the Window opening on Winander mere, I should not feel---or rather my Happiness would not be so fine, as my Solitude is sublime. Then instead of what I have described, there is a Sublimity to welcome me home. The roaring of the wind is my wife and the Stars through the window pane are my Children. The mighty abstract Idea I have of Beauty in all things stifles the more divided and minute domestic happiness---an amiable wife and sweet Children I contemplate as a part of that Beauty---but I must have a thousand of those beautiful particles to fill up my heart. I feel more and more every day, as my imagination strengthens, that I do not live in this world alone but in a thousand worlds. No sooner am I alone than shapes of epic greatness are stationed around me, and serve my Spirit the office of which is equivalent to a King's body guard---then 'tragedy with scepter'd pall, comes sweeping by."  516 According to my state of mind I am with Achilles shouting in the Trenches, or with Theocritus in the Vales of Sicily. Or I throughw my whole being into Triolus, and repeating those lines, 'I wander, like a lost Soul upon the stygian Banks staying for waftage",  517 I melt into the air with a voluptuousness so delicate that I am content to be alone. These things combined with the opinion I have of the generallity of women---who appear to me as children to whom I would rather give a Sugar Plum than my time, form a barrier against Matrimony which I rejoice in. I have written this that you might see I have my share of the highest pleasures and that though I may choose to pass my days alone I shall be no Solitary. You see there is nothing spleenical in all this. The only thing that can ever effect me personally for more than one short passing day, is any doubt about my powers for poetry---I seldom have any, and I look with hope to the nighing time when I shall have none. I am as happy as a Man can be---that is in myself I should be happy if Tom was well, and I knew you were passing pleasant days ---Then I should be most enviable---with the yearning Passion I have for the beautiful, connected and made one with the ambition of my intellect. Think of my Pleasure in Solitude, in comparison of my commerce with the world--- there I am a child---there they do not know me, not even my most intimate acquaintance---I give into their feelings as though I were refraining from irritating a little child---Some think me middling, others silly, others foolish---every one thinks he sees my weak side against my will, when in truth it is with my will---I am content to be thought all this because I have in my own breast so great a resource. This is one great reason why they like me so; because they can all show to advantage in a room, and eclipese from a certain tact one who is reckoned to be a good Poet---I hope I am not here playing tricks  518 'to make the angels weep': I think not: for I have not the least contempt for my species; and though it may sound paradoxical: my greatest elevations of Soul leave me every time more humbled---Enough of this---though in your Love for me you will not think it enough.  519 Haslam has been here this morning, and has taken all the Letters except this sheet, which I shall send him by the Twopenny, as he will put the Parcel in the Boston post Bag by the advice of Capper and Hazlewood, who assure him of the safety and expedition that way---the Parcel will be forwarded to Warder and thence to you all the same. There will not be a Philadelphia Ship for these six weeks---by that time I shall have another Letter to you. Mind you I mark this Letter A.  520 By the time you will receive this you will have I trust passed through the greatest of your fatigues. As it was with your Sea sickness I shall not hear of them till they are past. Do not set to your occupation with too great an anxiety---take it calmly---and let your health be the prime consideration. I hope you will have a Son, and it is one of my first wishes to have him in my Arms---which I will do please God before he cuts one double tooth. Tom is rather more easy than he has been: but is still so nervous that I cannot speak to him of these Matters---indeed it is the care I have had to keep his Mind aloof from feelings too acute that has made this Letter so short a one---I did not like to write before him a Letter he knew was to reach your hands---I cannot even now ask him for any Message---his heart speaks to you---Be as happy as you can. Think of me and for my sake be cheerful. Believe me my dear Brother and Sister Your anxious and affectionate Brother John. This day  521 is my Birth day--- All our friends have been anxious in their enquiries and all send their remembrances Address : Miss Keats  Miss Tuckey's  Walthamstow--- Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and NO 5 1818. My dear Fanny, I have seen Mr Abbey three times about you, and have not been able to get his consent--- He says that once more between this and the Holy-days will be sufficient. What can I do? I should have been at Walthamstow several times, but I am not able to leave Tom for so long a time as that would take me. Poor Tom has been rather better these 4 last days in consequence of obtaining a little rest a nights. Write to me as often as you can, and believe that I would do any thing to give you any pleasure---we must as yet wait patiently. Your affectionate Brother John--- Address : Mr James Rice  Poland Street--- Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and NO 25 1818. Well Walk---Novr 24. My dear Rice, Your amende honorable, I must call 'un surcroit d'amitie' for I am not at all sensible of any thing but that you were unfortunately engaged and I was unfortunately in a hurry. I completely understand your feeling in this mistake, and find in it that ballance of comfort which remains after regretting your uneasiness. I have long made up my Mind to take for granted the genuine heartedness of my friends notwithstanding any temporery ambiguousness in their behaviour or their tongues; nothing of which however I had the least scent of this morning. I say completely understand; for I am everlastingly getting my mind into such like painful trammels---and am even at this moment suffering under them in the case of a friend of ours. I will tell you---Two most unfortunate and parallel slips---it seems downright preintention. A friend  522 says to me 'Keats I shall go and see Severn this Week' 'Ah' says I 'You want him to take your Portrait' and again 'Keats' says a friend 'When will you come to town again' 'I will' says I 'let you have the Mss next week' In both these I appear'd to attribute and  for an  interested motive to each of my friends' questions---the first made him flush; the second made him look angry ---And yet I am innocent---in both cases my Mind leapt over every interval between to what I saw was per se a pleasant subject with him---You see I have no allowances to make---you see how far I am from supposing you could show me any neglect. I very much regret the long time I have been obliged to exile from you---for I have had one or two rather pleasant occasions to confer upon with you---What I have heard from George is favorable---I expect soon a Letter from the Settlement itself--- Your sincere friend John Keats I cannot give any good news of Tom--- Address : Miss Keats  Miss Caley's School  Walthamstow Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and DE 1 1818. Tuesday Morn My dear Fanny, Poor Tom  523 has been so bad that I have delayed your visit hither---as it would be so painful to you both. I cannot say he is any better this morning---he is in a very dangerous state---I have scarce any hopes of him. Keep up your spirits for me my dear Fanny---repose entirely in Your affectionate Brother John. Address : Jno. Keats Esqr 524 My dear Keats, I have to thank you for a mark of kind consideration, shewn at a moment when an attention to such matters must have been peculiarly irksome. Accept this late acknowledgment of it.---Believe me, I deeply sympathised with you, though I could not bring myself to interrupt the sacredness of recent affliction with commonplaces of condolence.---Your brother is now, we trust, happier than we have ability to wish him---and it is our duty to turn eyes of gratitude around, for the many blessings that yet remain to us.---It will please me to hear that you are well and are recovering from the shock of your loss. I send enclosed a letter; which when read, take the trouble to return to me--- The History of its reaching me is this.---My Cousin Miss Frogley of Hounslow borrowed my copy of Endymion, for a specified Time---Before she had time to look into it, her and my friend, Mr. H. Neville, of Esher, who was House Surgeon to the late Princess Charlotte, insisted upon havg. it to read for a day or 2 & undertook to make my cousin's peace with me on a/c of Extra delay ---Neville told me that one of the Misses Porter (of romance celebrity) had seen it on his table, dipped into it, & expressed a wish to read it.---I desired he wd. keep it as long, and lend it to as many as he pleased--- provided it was not allowed to slumber on any one's shelf. I learned subsequently from Miss F. that these ladies had requested of Neville, if he was acquainted with the author, that they might have the pleasure of an Introduction.---About a week back, the enclosed was transmd. by Mr Neville to my cousin, as a species of apology for keeping her so long without the Book--- and she sent it to me, knowing it would give me pleasure.---I forward it to you for somewhat the same reason, but principally because it gives me the opportunity of naming to you (which it wd. have been fruitless to do before) the opening there is for an introduction to a class of society from which you may possibly derive advantage as well as gratifn, if you think proper to avail yourself of it.---In such case I should be very happy to further your wishes. ---But do just as you please---if you decline the overture rely upon it no intimation from me will ever reach the quarter in question, that the Lr enclosed or any thing that has transpired has come to yr ears. The whole is entirely at present "inter nos". I go out of Town tomorrow for 3 or 4 days. Do not therefore write to me till aft Tuesday next. Believe me my Dr Keats most sincerely Yrs Richd Woodhouse. Temple 10 Decr 1818. P.S. I bele you are not at Hampstead---I shall therefore? beg Taylor to forward you this. 1818-Monday 4 Jan. 1819. No address or postmark. B My dear Brother and Sister, You will have been prepared, before this reaches you for the worst news you could have, nay if Haslam's letter arrives in proper time, I have a consolation in thinking the first shock will be past before you receive this. The last days of poor Tom were of the most distressing nature; but his last moments were not so painful, and his very last was without a pang. I will not enter into any parsonic comments on death---yet the common observations of the commonest people on death are as true as their proverbs. I have scarce a doubt of immortality of some nature of  for or  other---neither had Tom.  525 My friends have been exceedingly kind to me every one of them---Brown detained me at his House. I suppose no one could have had their time made smoother than mine has been. During poor Tom's illness I was not able to write and since his death the task of beginning has been a hindrance to me. Within this last Week I have been every where---and I will tell you as nearly as possible how all go on. With Dilke and Brown I am quite thick---with Brown indeed I am going to domesticate---that is, we shall keep house together---I shall have the front parlour and he the back one---by which I shall avoid the noise of Bentley's Children---and be the better able to go on with my Studies---which have been greatly interrupted lately, so that I have not the Shadow of an idea of a book in my head, and my pen seems to have grown too goutty for verse. How are you going on now? The going on of the world makes me dizzy---There you are with Birkbeck---here I am with brown---sometimes I fancy an immense separation, and sometimes, as at present, a direct communication of Spirit with you. That will be one of the grandeurs of immortality ---There will be no space and consequently the only commerce between spirits will be by their intelligence of each other---when they will completely understand each other---while we in this world merely comprehend each other in different degrees---the higher the degree of good so higher is our Love and friendship. I have been so little used to writing lately that I am affraid you will not smoke my meaning so I will give an example---Suppose Brown or Haslam or any one whom I understand in the next degree to what I do you, were in America, they would be so much the farther from me in proportion as their identity was less impressed upon me. Now the reason why I do not feel at the present moment so far from you is that I remember your Ways and Manners and actions; I known your manner of thinking, your manner of feeling: I know what shape your joy or your sorrow would take; I know the manner of you walking, standing, sauntering, sitting down, laughing, punning, and every action so truly that you seem near to me. You will remember me in the same manner---and the more when I tell you that I shall read a passage of Shakspeare every Sunday at ten oClock--- you read one at the same time and we shall be as near each other as blind bodies can be in the same room. I saw your Mother the day before yesterday, and intend now frequently to pass half a day with her---she sceem'd tolerably well. I called in Henrietta Street and so was speaking with your Mother about Miss Millar---we had a chat about Heiresses---she told me I think of 7 or eight dying Swains. Charles was not at home. I think I have heard a little more talk about Miss Keasle---all I know of her is she had a new sort of shoe on of bright leather like our Knapsacks---Miss Millar gave me one of her confounded pinches. N. B. did not like it. Mrs Dilke went with me to see Fanny last week, and Haslam went with me last Sunday---she was well---she gets a little plumper and had a little Colour. On Sunday  526 I brought from her a present of facescreens and a work bag for Mrs D. they were  527 very pretty---From walthamstow we walked to Bethnal green---where I felt so tired from my long walk that I was obliged to go to Bed at ten  528 \---Mr and Mrs Keasle were there. Haslam has been excessively Kind---and his anxiety about you is great; I never meet him but we have some chat thereon. He is always doing me some good turn---he gave me this thin paper for the purpose of writing to you. I have been passing an hour this morning with Mr Lewis  529 \---he wants news of you very much. Haydon was here yesterday---he amused us much by speaking of young Hopner  530 who went with Captn Ross  531 on a voyage of discovery to the Poles---The Ship was sometimes entirely surrounded with vast mountains and crags of ice and in a few Minutes not a particle was to be seen all round the Horizon. Once they met with with so vast a Mass that they gave themselves over for lost; their last recourse was in meeting it with the Bowsprit, which they did, and split it asunder and glided through it as it parted for a great distance---one Mile and more. Their eyes were so fatigued with the eternal dazzle and whiteness that they lay down on their backs upon deck to relieve their sight on the blue sky. Hopner describes his dreadful weariness at the continual day---the Sun ever moving in a circle round above their heads---so pressing upon him that he could not rid himself of the sensation even in the dark Hold of the Ship---The Esquimaux are described as the most wretched of Beings---they float from the Summer to their winter residences and back again like white Bears on the ice floats--- They seem never to have washed, and so when their features move, the red skin shows beneath the cracking peal of dirt. They had no notion of any inhabitants in the World but themselves. The sailors who had not seen a Star for some time, when they came again southwards, on the hailing of the first revision of one all ran upon deck with feelings of the most joyful nature. Haydon's eyes will not suffer him to proceed with his Picture---his Physician tells him he must remain two months more, inactive. Hunt keeps on in his old way---I am completely tired of it all---He has lately publish'd a Pocket-Book call'd the litterary Pocket-Book---full of the most sickening stuff you can imagine. Reynolds is well--- he has become an edinburgh Reviewer---I have not heard from Bailey. Rice I have seen very little of lately---and I am very sorry for it. The Miss R's  532 are all as usual--- Archer  533 above all people called on me one day---he wanted some information by my means, from Hunt and Haydon, concerning some Man they knew. I got him what he wanted, but know none of the whys and wherefores. Poor Kirkman left wentworth place one evening about half past eight and was stopped, beaten and robbed of his Watch in Pond Street. I saw him a few days since, he had not recovered from his bruize. I called on Hazlitt the day I went to Romney Street---I gave John Hunt extracts from your Letters---he has taken no notice. I have seen Lamb lately---Brown and I were taken by Hunt to Novello's ---there we were devastated and excruciated with bad and repeated puns---Brown dont want to go again. We went the other evening to see Brutus a new Trageday by Howard Payne, 534 an American---Kean was excellent---the play was very bad. It is the first time I have been since I went with you to the Lyceum. Mrs Brawne who took Brown's house for the Summer, still resides in Hampstead ---she is her a very nice woman---and her daughter senior is I think beautiful and elegant, graceful, silly, fashionable and strange we have a little tiff now and then---and she behaves a little better, or I must have sheered off---I find by a sidelong report from your Mother that I am to be invited to Miss Millar's birthday dance---Shall I dance with Miss Waldegrave? Eh! I shall be obliged to shirk a good many there---I shall be the only Dandy there---and indeed I merely comply with the invitation that the party may not be entirely destitute of a specimen of that Race. I shall appear in a complete dress of purple Hat and all---with a list of the beauties I have conquered embroidered round my Calves--- Thursday 535 This morning is so very fine, I should have walked over to Walthamstow if I had thought of it yesterday---What are you doing this morning? Have you a clear hard frost as we have? How do you come on with the gun? Have you shot a Buffalo? Have you met with any Pheasants? My Thoughts are very frequently in a foreign Country---I live more out of England than in it---The Mountains of Tartary are a favourite lounge, if I happen to miss the Allegany ridge, or have no whim for Savoy. There must be great pleasure in pursuing game---pointing your gun ---no, it wont do---now no---rabbit it---now bang---smoke and feathers---where is it? Shall you be able to get a good pointer or so? Have you seen Mr Trimmer ---He is an acquaintance of Peachey's. Now I am not addressing miself to G. minor,  536 and yet I am---for you are one---Have you some warm furs? By your next Letters I shall expect to hear exactly how you go on---smother nothing---let us have all---fair and foul---all plain. Will the little bairn have made his entrance before you have this? Kiss it for me, and when it can first know a cheese from a Caterpillar show it my picture twice a Week---You will be glad to hear that Gifford's attack upon me has done me service---it has got my book among several Sets \---Nor must I forget to mention once more, what I suppose Haslam has told you, the present of a  £25 note I had anonymously sent me---I have many things to tell you---the best way will be to make coppies of my correspondence; and I must not forget the Sonnet I received with the Note--- Last Week I received the following from Woodhouse, whom you must recollect---"My dear Keats,---I send enclosed a Letter which, when read take the trouble to return to me. The Historey of its reaching me is this. My Cousin, Miss Frogley of Hounslow borrowed my copy of Endymion for a specified time. Before she had time to look into it; she and my friend Mr Hy Neville of Esher,  537 who was house Surgeon to the late Princess Charlotte, insisted upon having it to read for a day or two, and undertook to make my Cousin's peace with me on account of the extra delay---Neville told me that one of the Misses Porter  538 (of romance Celebrity) had seen it on his table, dipped into it, and expressed a wish to read it---I desired he should keep it as long, and lend it to as many, as he pleased, provided it was not allowed to slumber on any one's shelf. I learned subsequently from Miss Frogley that these Ladies had requested of Mr Neville, if he was acquainted with the Author the Pleasure of an introduction---About a week back the enclosed was transmitted by Mr Neville to my Cousin, as a species of Apology for keeping her so long without the Book ---And she sent it to me, knowing it would give me Pleasure---I forward it to you for somewhat the same reason, but principally because it gives me the opportunity of naming to you (which It would have been fruitless to do before) the opening there is for an introduction to a class of society, from which you may possibly derive advantage as well as gratification, if you think proper to avail yourself of it. In such case I should be very happy to further your Wishes. But do just as you please. The whole is entirely entre nous---Your's &c;.--- R.W." Well---now this is Miss Porter's  539 Letter to Neville--- ---"Dear Sir, as my Mother is sending a Messenger to Esher, I cannot but make the same the bearer of my regrets for not having had the pleasure of seeing you, the morning you called at the gate---I had given orders to be denied: I was so very unwell with my still adhaesive cold; but had I known it was you I should have taken off the interdict for a few minutes, to say, how very much I am delighted with Endymion---I had just finished the Poem, and have done as you permitted lent it to Miss Fitzgerald. I regret you are not personally acquainted with the Author: for I should have been happy to have acknowledged to him, through the advantage of your Communication the very rare delight my Sister and myself have enjoyed from this first fruits of Genius. I hope the illnatured Review will not have damaged (or damped)  540 such true Parnassian fire---it ought not for when Life is granted &c;." and so she goes on---Now I feel more obliged than flattered by this---so obliged that I will not at present give you an extravaganza of a Lady Romancer. I will be introduced to them if it be merely for the pleasure of writing to you about it ---I shall certainly see a new race of People---I shall more certainly have no time for them---Hunt has asked me to meet Tom Moore some day---so you shall hear of him. The night we went to Novello's there was a complete set too of Mozart and punning---I was so completely tired of it that if I were to follow my own inclinations I should never meet any one of that set again, not even Hunt---who is certainly a pleasant fellow in the main when you are with him--- but in reallity he is vain, egotistical, and disgusting in matters of taste and in morals. He understands many a beautiful thing; but then, instead of giving other minds credit for the same degree of perception as he himself possesses---he begins an explanation in such a curious manner that our taste and self-love is offended continually. Hunt does one harm by making fine things petty and beautiful things hateful---Through him I am indifferent to Mozart, I care not for white Busts ---and many a glorious thing when associated with him becomes a nothing---This distorts one's mind---makes one's thoughts bizarre---perplexes one in the standard of Beauty. Martin  541 is very much irritated against Blackwood for printing some Letters in his Magazine which were Martin's property---he always found excuses for Blackwood till he himself was injured and now he is enraged. I have been several times thinking whether or not I should send you the examiners as Birkbeck no doubt has all the good periodical Publications---I will save them at all events. I must not forget to mention how attentive and useful Mrs Bentley has been---I am sorry to leave her---but I must, and I hope she will not be much a looser by it---Bentley is very well---he has just brought me a cloathe's basket of Books. Brown has gone to town to day to take his Nephews who are on a visit here to see the Lions. I am passing a Quiet day---which I have not done a long while---and if I do continue so---I feel I must again begin with my poetry---for if I am not in action mind or Body I am in pain---and from that I suffer greatly by going into parties where from the rules of society and a natural pride I am obliged to smother my Spirit and look like an Idiot---because I feel my impulses given way to would too much amaze them---I live under an everlasting restraint--- never relieved except when I am composing---so I will write away. Friday.  542 I think you knew before you left England that my next subject would be 'the fall of Hyperion" I went on a little with it last night---but it will take some time to get into the vein again. I will not give you any extracts because I wish the whole to make an impression---I have however a few Poems which you will like and I will copy out on the next sheet. I shall dine with Haydon on Sunday and go over to Walthamstow on Monday if the frost hold.  543 I think also of going into Hampshire this Christmas to Mr Snooks---they say I shall be very much amused---But I dont know---I think I am in too huge a Mind for study---I must do it---I must wait at home, and let those who wish come to see me. I cannot always be (how do you spell it?) trapsing---Here I must tell you that I have not been able to keep the journal or write the Tale I promised ---now I shall be able to do so. I will write to Haslam this morning to know when the Packet sails and till it does I will write something every day--- after that my journal shall go on like clockwork---and you must not complain of its dullness---for what I wish is to write a quantity to you---knowing well that dullness itself will from me be interesting to you. You may conceive how this not having been done has weighed upon me---I shall be able to judge from your next what sort of information will be of most service or amusement to you. Perhaps as you were fond of giving me sketches of character you may like a little pic nic of scandal even across the Atlantic---But now I must speak particularly to you my dear Sister---for I know you love a little quizzing, better than a great bit of apple dumpling. Do you know Uncle Redhall? He is a little Man with an innocent, powdered, upright head; he lisps with a protruded under lip---he has two Neices each one would weigh three of him--- one for height and the other for breadth---he knew Barttolozzi---he gave a supper and ranged his bottles of wine all up the Kitchen and cellar stairs quite ignorant of what might be drank  544 \---it might have been a good joke to pour on the sly bottle after bottle into a washing tub and roar for more. If you were to trip him up it would discompose a Pigtail and bring his under lip nearer to his nose. He never had the good luck to loose a silk Handkerchief in a Crowd and therefore has only one topic of conversation---Bartolotzzi---Shall I give you Miss Brawne? She is about my height---with a fine style of countenance of the lengthen'd sort ---she wants sentiment in every feature---she manages to make her hair look well--- her nostrills are fine---though a little painful---her mouth is bad and good---her Profil is better than her fullface which indeed is not full put pale and thin without showing any bone---Her shape is very graceful and so are her movements---her Arms are good her hands badish--- her feet tolerable ---she is not seventeen---but she is ignorant---monstrous in her behaviour flying out in all directions, calling people such names---that I was forced lately to make use of the term Minx \---this is I think no t from any innate vice but from a penchant she has for acting stylishly. I am however tired of such style and shall decline any more of it. She had a friend  545 to visit her lately---you have known plenty such---Her face is raw as if she was standing out in a frost---her lips raw and seem always ready for a Pullet ---she plays the Music  546 without one sensation but the feel of the ivory at her fingers---She is a downright Miss without one set off ---We hated her and smoked her and baited her, and I think drove her away--- Miss B---thinks her a Paragon of fashion, and says she is the only woman she would change persons with---What a Stupe---She is superior as a Rose to a Dandelion---When we went to bed Brown observed as he put out the Taper what an ugly old woman that Miss Robinson would make---at which I must have groan'd aloud for I'm sure ten minutes. I have not seen the thing Kingston  547 again---George will describe him to you---I shall insinuate some of these Creatures into a Comedy some day---and perhaps have Hunt among them---Scene, a little Parlour---Enter Hunt---Gattie  548 \---Hazlitt--- Mrs Novello---Ollier---Gattie) Ha! Hunt! got into your new house? Ha! Mrs Novello seen Altam and his Wife?  549 Mrs N. Yes (with a grin) its Mr Hunts is'nt it? Gattie. Hunt's no ha! Mr Olier I congratulate you upon the highest compliment I ever heard paid to the Book. Mr Haslit, I hope you are well. (Hazlitt.---yes Sir, no Sir--- Mr Hunt (at the Music) La Biondina &c; Mr Hazlitt did you ever hear this---La Biondina &c;. Hazlitt---O no Sir--- I never---Olier---Do Hunt give it us over again--- divino--- Gattie/divino---Hunt when does your Pocket Book come out---/Hunt/What is this absorbs me quite? O we are spinning on a little, we shall floridize soon I hope---Such a thing was very much wanting---people think of nothing but money-getting---now for me I am rather inclined to the liberal side of things--- torn  I am reckoned lax in my christian principles---&c; &c; &c; &c; It is some days since I wrote the last page---and what have I been about since I have no Idea---I dined at Haslam's on sunday---with Haydon yesterday and saw Fanny in the morning---she was well---Just now I took out my poem to go on with it ---but the thought of my writing so little to you came upon me and I could not get on---so I have began at random---and I have not a word to say---and yet my thoughts are so full of you that I can do nothing else. I shall be confined at Hampstead a few days on account of a sore throat---the first thing I do will be to visit your Mother again. The last time I saw Henry he show'd me his first engraving which I thought capital---Mr Lewis  550 called this morning and brought some american Papers. I have not look'd into them---I think we ought to have heard of you before this---I am in daily expectation of Letters---Nil desperandum---Mrs Abbey wishes to take Fanny from School---I shall strive all I can against that---There has happened great Misfortune in the Drewe Family  551 \---old Drewe has been dead some time; and lately George Drewe expired in a fit---on which account Reynolds has gone into Devonshire. He dined a few days since at Horace Twisse's  552 with Liston  553 and Charles Kemble  554 \---I see very little of him now, as I seldom go to little Britain because the Ennui always seizes me there, and John Reynolds is very dull at home. Nor have I seen Rice---How you are now going on is a Mystery to me---I hope a few days will clear it up. I never know the day of the Month ---It is very fine here to-day though I expect a Thunder-cloud or rather a snow cloud in less than an hour. I am at present alone at Wentworth place---Brown being at Chichester and Mr and Mrs Dilke making a little stay in Town. I know not what I should do without a Sunshiny morning now and then---it clears up one's spirits. Dilke and I frequently have some chat about you. I have now and then some doubts but he seems to have a great confidence--- I think there will soon be perceptible a chance  for change  in the fashionable slang literature of the day---it seems to me that Reviews have had their day---that the public have been surfeited---there will soon be some new folly to keep the Parlours in talk--- What it is I care not---We have seen three literary Kings in our Time--- Scott---Byron---and then the scotch novels.  555 All now appears to be dead---or I may mistake---literary Bodies may still keep up the Bustle which I do not hear. Haydon show'd me a letter he had received from Tripoli---Ritchey  556 was well and in good Spirits, among Camels, Turbans, Palm Trees and Sands--- You may remember I promised to send him an Endymion which I did not---however he has one---you have one---One is in the Wilds of america---the other is on a Camel's back in the plains of Egypt. I am looking into a Book of Dubois's  557 \---he has written directions to the Players---one of them is very good. "In singing never mind the music---observe what time you please. It would be a pretty degradation indeed if you were obliged to confine your genius to the dull regularity of a fiddler---horse hair and cat's guts---no, let him keep your time and play your tune--- dodge him ." I will now copy out the Letter and Sonnet I have spoken of. The outside cover was thus directed 'Messrs Taylor and Hessey (Booksellers) No 93 Fleet Street, London' and it contained this 'Messrs Taylor and Hessey are requested to forward the enclosed letter by some safe mode of conveyance to the Author of Endymion, who is not known at Teignmouth: or if they have not his address, they will return the letter by post, directed as below within a fortnight "Mr P. Fenbank P. O Teignmouth" 9th Novr 1818---In this sheet was enclosed the following---with a superscription 'Mr John Keats Teignmouth'---Then came Sonnet to John Keats--- which I would not copy for any in the world but you---who know that I scout "mild light and loveliness" or any such nonsense in myself--- Star of high promise!---not to this dark age Do thy mild light and loveliness belong;--- For it is blind intolerant and wrong; Dead to empyreal soarings, and the rage Of scoffing spirits bitter war doth wage With all that hold integrity of song. Yet thy clear beam shall shine through ages strong To ripest times a light---and heritage. And there breathe now who dote upon thy fame, Whom thy wild numbers wrap beyond their being, Who love the freedom of thy Lays---their aim Above the scope of a dull tribe unseeing--- And there is one whose hand will never scant From his poor store of fruits all thou canst want.  558 turn over November, 1818. I turn'd over, and found a £25-note---Now this appears to me all very proper ---if I had refused it---I should have behaved in a very bragadochio dunder- headed manner--- and yet the present galls me a little---and I do not know whether I shall not return it if I ever meet with the donor---after whom to no purpose I have written---I have your Miniature on the Table George the great ---it's very like--- though not quite about the upper lip---I wish we had a better of you little George---I must not forget to tell you that a few days since I went with Dilke a shooting on the heath and stot  for shot  a Tomtit---There were as many guns abroad as Birds. I intended to have been at Chichester this Wednesday---but on account of this sore throat I wrote him (Brown) my excuse yesterday--- Thursday  I will date when I finish---I received a Note from Haslam yesterday ---asking if my letter is ready---now this is only the second sheet--- notwithstanding all my promises---But you must reflect what hindrances I have had. However on sealing this I shall have nothing to prevent my proceeding in a gradual journal---which will increase in a Month to a considerable size. I will insert any little pieces I may write---though I will not give any extracts from my large poem  559 which is scarce began. I what  for want  to hear very much whether Poetry and literature in general has gained or lost interest with you---and what sort of writing is of the highest gust with you now. With what sensation do you read Fielding?---and do not Hogarth's pictures seem an old thing to you? Yet you are very little more removed from general association than I am--- recollect that no Man can live but in one society at a time---his enjoyment in the different states of human society must depend upon the Powers of his Mind---that is you can imagine a roman triumph, or an olympic game as well as I can. We with our bodily eyes see but the fashion and Manners of one country for one age---and then we die. Now to me manners and customs long since passed whether among the Babylonians or the Bactrians are as real, or eveven more real than those among which I now live---My thoughts have turned lately this way---The more we know the more inadequacy we discover in the world to satisfy us---this is an old observation; but I have made up my Mind never to take any thing for granted---but even to examine the truth of the commonest proverbs---This however is true---Mrs Tighe  560 and Beattie  561 once delighted me---now I see through them and can find nothing in them---or weakness---and yet how many they still delight! Perhaps a superior being may look upon Shakspeare in the same light---is it possible? No---This same inadequacy is discovered (forgive me little George you know I don't mean to put you in the mess) in Women with few exceptions---the Dress Maker, the blue Stocking and the most charming sentimentalist differ but in a Slight degree, and are equally smokeable---But I'll go no further---I may be speaking sacrilegiously---and on my word I have thought so little that I have not one opinion upon any thing except in matters of taste---I never can feel certain of any truth but from a clear perception of its Beauty---and I find myself very young minded even in that perceptive power---which I hope will encrease ---A year ago I could not understand in the slightest degree Raphael's cartoons---now I begin to read them a little---and how did I learn to do so? By seeing something done in quite an opposite spirit---I mean a picture of Guido's in which all the Saints, instead of that heroic simplicity and unaffected grandeur which they inherit from Raphael, had each of them both in countenance and gesture all the canting, solemn melodramatic mawkishness of MacKenzie's  562 father Nicholas. When I was last at Haydon's I looked over a Book of Prints taken from the fresco of the Church at Milan the name of which I forget---in it are comprised Specimens of the first and second age of art in Italy---I do not think I ever had a greater treat out of Shakspeare--- Full of Romance and the most tender feeling---magnificence of draperies beyond any I ever saw not excepting Raphael's. But Grotesque to a curious pitch---yet still making up a fine whole---even finer to me than more accomplish'd works ---as there was left so much room for Imagination. I have not heard one of this last course of Hazlitt's lectures---They were upon 'Wit and Humour, the english comic writers'. Saturday Jany 2nd Yesterday Mr and Mrs D and myself dined at Mrs Brawn'es--- nothing particular passed. I never intend hereafter to spend any time with Ladies unless they are handsome---you lose time to no purpose. For that reason I shall beg leave to decline going again to Redall's or Butlers or any Squad where a fine feature cannot be mustered among them all ---and where all the evening's amusement consists in saying your good health your good health, and  YOUR good health---and (O I beg your pardon) your's Miss----- and such things not even dull enough to keep one awake ---with respect to amiable speaking I can read---let my eyes be fed or I'll never go out to dinner any where. Perhaps you may have heard of the dinner given to Thos Moore in Dublin, because I have the account here by me in the Philadelphia democratic paper.  563 The most pleasant thing that accured was the speech Mr Tom made on his Farther's health being drank. I am affraid a great part of my Letters are filled up with promises and what I will do rather than any great deal written ---but here I say once for all---that circumstances prevented me from keeping my promise in my last, but now I affirm that as there will be nothing to hinder me I will keep a journal for you. That I have not yet done so you would forgive if you knew how many hours I have been repenting of my neglect. For I have no thought pervading me so constantly and frequently as that of you---my Poem cannot frequently drive it away---you will retard it much more that  for than  you could by taking up my time if you were in England. I never forget you except after seeing now and then some beautiful woman---but that is a fever---the thought of you both is a passion with me but for the most part a calm one. I asked Dilke for a few lines for you---he has promised them---I shall send what I have written to Haslam on Monday Morning 564 \---what I can get into another sheet tomorrow I will---there are one or two little poems you might like---I have given up snuff very nearly quite---Dilke has promised to sit with me this evening, I wish he would come this minute for I want a pinch of snuff very much just now---I have none though in my own snuff box---My sore throat is much better to day---I think I might venture on a crust. Here are the Poems---they will explain themselves ---as all pomems should do without any comment. Ever let the Fancy roam, Pleasure never is at home. At a touch sweet pleasure melteth Like to bubbles when rain pelteth. Then let winged fancy wander To wards heaven still spread beyond her--- Open wide the mind's cage door She'll dart forth and cloudward soar. O sweet Fancy, let her loose! Summer's joys are spoilt by use, And the enjoying of the spring Fades as doth its blossoming: Autumn's red-lipp'd fruitage too Blushing through the mist and dew Cloys with kissing. What do then? Sit thee in an ingle when The sear faggot blazes bright, Spirit of a winter night; When the soundless earth is muffled, And the caked snow is shuffled From the Ploughboy's heavy shoon: When the night doth meet the noon In a dark conspiracy To banish vesper from the sky. Sit thee then and send abroad With a Mind self overaw'd Fancy high commission'd; send her,--- She'll have vassals to attend her--- She will bring thee, spite of frost, Beauties that the Earth has lost; She will bring thee all together All delights of summer weather, All the faery buds of May On spring turf or scented spray; All the heaped Autumn's wealth With a still mysterious stealth; She will mix these pleasures up Like three fit wines in a cup And thou shalt quaff it---Thou shalt hear Distant harvest carols clear, Rustle of the reaped corn Sweet Birds antheming the Morn; And, in the same moment hark To the early April lark, And the rooks with busy caw Forraging for sticks and straw. Thou shalt at one glance behold The daisy and the marigold; White plumed lillies and the first Hedgerow primrose that hath burst; Shaded Hyacynth alway Sapphire Queen of the Mid-may;--- And every leaf and every flower Pearled with the same soft shower. Thou shalt see the fieldmouse creep Meagre from its celled sleep, And the snake all winter shrank Cast its skin on sunny bank; Freckled nest eggs shalt thou see Hatching in the hawthorn tree; When the hen bird's wing doth rest Quiet on its mossy nest--- Then the hurry and alarm When the Beehive casts its swarm--- Acorns ripe down pattering While the autumn breezes sing, For the same sleek throated mouse To store up in its winter house. O sweet Fancy, let her loose! Every joy is spoilt by use, Every pleasure, every joy--- Not a Mistress but doth cloy. Where's the cheek that doth not fade Too much gaz'd at? Where's the Maid Whose lip mature is ever new? Where's the eye however blue Doth not weary? Where's the face One would meet in every place? Where's the voice however soft One would hear too oft and oft? At a touch sweet pleasure melteth Like to bubbles when rain pelteth. Let then winged fancy find Thee a Mistress to thy mind. Dulcet-eyed as Ceres' daughter Ere the God of torment taught her How to frown and how to chide; With a waist and with a side White as Hebe's when her Zone Slipp'd its golden clasp, and down Fell her Kirtle to her feet While she held the goblet sweet, And Jove grew languid. Mistress fair, Thou shalt have that tressed hair Adonis tangled all for spite, And the mouth he would not kiss, And the treasure he would miss; And the hand he would not press, And the warmth he would distress, O the Ravishment---the Bliss! Fancy has her there she is--- Never fulsome, ever new, There she steps! and tell me who Has a Mistress to  for so  divine? Be the palate ne'er so fine She cannot sicken. Break the Mess  for Mesh  Of the Fancy's silken leash Where she's tether'd to the heart--- Quickly break her prison string And such joys as these she'll bring Let the winged fancy roam Pleasure never is at home. I did not think this had been so long a Poem---I have another not so long--- but as it will more conveniently be coppied on the other side I will just put down here some observations on Caleb Williams by Hazlitt---I meant to say St Leon for although he has mentioned all the Novels of Godwin very finely I do not quote them, but this only on account of its being a specimen of his usual abrupt manner, and fiery laconiscism---He says of St Leon 'He is a limb torn off from Society. In possession of eternal youth and beauty he can feel no love; surrounded, tantalized and tormented with riches, he can do no good. The faces of Men pass before him as in a speculum; but he is attached to them by no common tie of sympathy or suffering. He is thrown back into himself and his own thoughts. He lives in the solitude of his own breast,---without wife or child or friend or Enemy in the world. His is the solitude of the Soul, not of woods, or trees or mountains \---but the desert of society--- the waste and oblivion of the heart. He is himself alone. His existence is purely intellectual, and is therefore intolerable to one who has felt the rapture of affection, or the anguish of woe.'  565 As I am about it I might as well give you his c haracter of Godwin as a Romancer "Whoever else is, it is pretty clear that the author of Caleb Williams is not the Author of waverly. Nothing can be more distinct or excellent in their several ways than these two writers. If the one owes almost every thing to external observation and traditional character, the other owes every thing to internal conception and contemplation of the possible workings of the human Mind. There is little knowledge of the world, little variety, neither an eye for the picturesque nor a talent for the humourous in Caleb Williams, for instance, but you can not doubt for a moment of the originality of the work and the force of the conception. The impression made upon the reader is the exact measure of the strength of the authors genius. For the effect both in Caleb Williams and St Leon, is entirely made out, not by facts nor dates, by blackletter or magazine learning, by transcript nor record, but by intense and patient study of the human heart, and by an imagination projecting itself into certain situations, and capable of working up its imaginary feelings to the height of reality."  566 This appears to me quite correct---Now I will copy the other Poem---it is on the double immortality of Poets--- Bards of Passion and of Mirth Ye have left your souls on earth--- Have ye souls in heaven too Double liv'd in regions new? Yes---and those of heaven commune With the spheres of Sun & Moon; With the noise of fountains wondrous, And the parle of voices thundrous; With the Whisper of heavens trees, And one anothers, in soft ease Seated on elysian Lawns, Browsed by none but Dian's fawns; Underneath large bluebells tented Where the daisies are rose scented, And the rose herself has got Perfume that on Earth is not. Where the nightingale doth sing Not a senseless tranced thing; But melodious truth divine Philosophic numbers fine; Tales and golden histories Of Heaven and its Mysteries. Thus ye live on Earth  567 and then On the Earth ye live again; And the souls ye left behind you Teach us here the way to find you, Where your other Souls are joying Never slumber'd, never cloying. Here your earth born souls still speak To mortals of the little week They must sojourn with their cares; Of their sorrows and delights Of their Passion and their spites; Of their glory and their shame--- What doth strengthen and what maim. Thus ye teach us every day Wisdom though fled far away. Bards of Passion and of Mirth Ye have left your Souls on Earth Ye have Souls in heaven too Double liv'd in Regions new! These are specimens of a sort of rondeau which I think I shall become partial to---because you have one idea amplified with greater case and more delight and freedom than in the sonnet. It is my intention to wait a few years before I publish any minor poems---and then I hope to have a volume of some worth--- and which those people will realish who cannot bear the burthen of a long poem. In my journal I intend to copy the poems I write the days they are written---there is just room I see in this page to copy a little thing I wrote off to some Music as it was playing  568 \--- I had a dove and the sweet dove died, And I have thought it died of grieving: O what could it mourn for? it was tied With a silken thread of my own hands weaving. Sweet little red-feet why did you die? Why would you leave me---sweet dove why? You liv'd alone on the forest tree. Why pretty thing could you not live with me? I kiss'd you oft, and I gave you white peas--- Why not live sweetly as in the green trees! Sunday.  569 I have been dining with Dilke to day---He is up to his Ears in Walpole's letters. Mr Manker  570 is there, I have come round to see if I can conjure up any thing for you---Kirkman came down to see me this morning--- his family has been very badly off lately---He told me of a villainous trick of his Uncle William in Newgate Street who became sole Creditor to his father under pretence of serving him, and put an execution on his own Sister's goods. He went in to the family at Portsmouth; conversed with them, went out and sent in the Sherif's officer. He tells me too of abominable behaviour of Archer to Caroline Mathew  571 \---Archer has lived nearly at the Mathews these two years; he has been amusing Caroline all this time--- and now he has written a Letter to Mrs M. declining on pretence of inability to support a wife as he would wish, all thoughts of marriage. What is the worst is, Caroline is 27 years old---It is an abominable matter. He has called upon me twice lately---I was out both times. What can it be for---There is a letter to day in the Examiner to the Electors of Westminster on Mr Hobhouse's account---In it there is a good Character of Cobbet---I have not the paper by me or I would copy it---I do not think I have mentioned the Discovery of an african Kingdom---the account is much the same as the first accounts of Mexico---all magnificence ---there is a Book being written about it---I will read it and give you the cream in my next. The romance we have heard upon it runs thus: They have window frames of gold---100,000 infantry---human sacrifices---The Gentleman who is the adventurer  572 has his wife with him---she I am told is a beautiful little sylphid woman--- her husband was to have been sacrificed to their Gods and was led through a Chamber filled with different instruments of torture with priveledge to choose what death he would die, without their having a thought of his aversion to such a death they considering it a supreme distinction---However he was let off and became a favorite with the King who at last openly patronised him, though at first on account of the Jealousy of his Ministers he was wont to hold conversations with his Majesty in the dark middle of the night  573 \---All this sounds a little Bluebeardish---but I hope it is true---There is another thing I must mention of the momentous kind;---but I must mind my periods in it---Mrs Dilke has two Cats---a Mother and a Daughter---now the Mother is a tabby and the daughter a black and white like the spotted child--- Now it appears ominous to me, for the doors of both houses are opened frequently---so that there is a complete thoroughfare for both Cats (there being no board up to the contrary) they may one and several of them come into my room ad libitum. But no---the Tabby only comes---whether from sympathy from ann the Maid or me I can not tell---or whether Brown has left behind him uryatmospheric spirit of Maidenhood I cannot tell. The Cat is not an old Maid herself---her daughter is a proof of it. I have questioned her---I have look'd at the lines of her paw---I have felt her pulse---to no purpose---Why should the old Cat come to me? I ask myself---and myself has not a word to answer. It may come to light some day; if it does you shall hear of it. Kirkman this morning promised to write a few lines for you and send them to Haslam. I do not think I have anything to say in the Business way. You will let me know what you would wish done with your property in England---What things you would wish sent out---but I am quite in the dark about what you are doing---if I do not hear soon I shall put on my Wings and be after you---I will in my next, and after I have seen your next letter---tell you my own particular idea of America. Your next letter will be the key by which I shall open your hearts and see what spaces want filling, with any particular information---Whether the affairs of Europe are more or less interesting to you---whether you would like to hear of the Theatres---of the bear Garden---of the Boxers--- the Painters---The Lecturers---the Dress---the Progress of Dandyism---the Progress of Courtship---or the fate of Mary Millar---being a full true and tr es particular account of Miss M's ten Suitors---How the first tried the effect of swearing; the second of stammering; the third of whispering; the fourth of sonnets---the fifth of Spanish leather boots; the sixth of flattering her body---the seventh of flattering her mind---the eighth of flattering himself---the ninth stuck to the Mother---the tenth kissed the Chamber-maid and told her to tell her Mistress---But he was soon discharged his reading lead him into an error---he could not sport the Sir Lucius  574 to any advantage---And now for this time I bid you good by---I have been thinking of these sheets so long that I appear in closing them to take my leave of you---but that is not it---I shall immediately as I send this off begin my journal---when some days I shall write no more than 10 lines and others 10 times as much. Mrs Dilke is knocking at the wall for Tea is ready ---I will tell you what sort of a tea it is and then bid you--- Good bye--- This is monday morning  575 \---nothing particular happened yesterday evening, except that when the tray came up Mrs Dilke and I had a battle with celery stalks--- she sends her love to you---I shall close this and send it immediately to Haslam---remaining ever My dearest brother and sister Your most affectionate Brother John--- Address written by Keats : Miss Keats  Miss Tuckey's  Walthamstow Postmark : DE 21 1818.

Imperfect postmark : DE 1818. 580 Wentworth Place Tuesd. My dear Mrs Reynolds, When I left you yesterday, 'twas with the conviction that you thought I had received no previous invitation for Christmas day: the truth is I had, and had accepted it under the conviction that I should be in Hampshire at the time: else believe me I should not have done so, but kept in Mind my old friends. I will not speak of the proportion of pleasure I may receive at different Houses--- that never enters my head---you may take for a truth that I would have given up even what I did see to be a greater pleasure, for the sake of old acquaintanceship---time is nothing---two years are as long as twenty. Yours faithfully John Keats Address : B. R. Haydon.  Lisson Grove North  Paddington Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and DE 23 1818 Tuesday Wentworth Place--- My dear Haydon, Upon my Soul I never felt your going out of the room at all---and believe me I never rhodomontade any where but in your Company---my general Life in Society is silence. I feel in myself all the vices of a Poet, irritability, love of effect and admiration---and influenced by such devils I may at times say more rediculous things than I am aware of---but I will put a stop to that in a manner I have long resolved upon---I will buy a gold ring and put it on my finger---and from that time a Man of superior head shall never have occasion to pity me, or one of inferior Nunskull to chuckle at me---I am certainly more for greatness in a Shade than in the open day---I am speaking as a mortal---I should say I value more the Priviledge of seeing great things in loneliness than the fame of a Prophet ---Yet here I am sinning---so I will turn to a thing I have thought on more---I mean your means till your Picture be finished: not only now but for this year and half have I thought of it. Believe me Haydon I have that sort of fire in my Heart that would sacrifice every thing I have to your service---I speak without any reserve---I know you would do so for me---I open my heart to you in a few words---I will do this sooner than you shall be distressed: but let me be the last stay---ask the rich lovers of art first--- I'll tell you why---I have a little money which may enable me to study and to travel three or four years---I never expect to get any thing by my Books: and moreover I wish to avoid publishing---I admire Human Nature but I do not like Men \---I should like to compose things honourable to Man---but not fingerable over by Men . So I am anxious to exist with out troubling the printer's devil or drawing upon Men's and Women's admiration---in which great solitude I hope God will give me strength to rejoice. Try the long purses--- but do not sell your drawing or I shall consider it a breach of friendship. I am sorry I was not at home when Salmon  581 called. Do write and let me know all your present whys and wherefores. Your's most faithfully John Keats From an undated draft or rough copy wafered into Haydon's Journal. Keats! Upon my Soul I could have wept at your letter; to find one of real heart & feeling is to me a blessed solace; I have met with such heartless treatment from those to whom without reserve I had given my Friendship, that I expected not what I wished in human Nature. There is only one besides yourself whoever offered to act & did act with such affection, he was of a different temperament from us; cooler but not kinder, he did his best from moral feeling, and not from bursting impulse; but still he did it; you have behaved to me as I would have behaved to you my dear fellow, and if I am constrained to come to you at last; your property shall only be a transfer for a limited time on such security as will ensure you repayment in case of my Death \---that is whatever part of it you assist me with: but I will try every corner first---Ah my dear Keats my illness has been a severe touch!--- I declare to God I do not feel alone in the World now you have written me that letter. If you go on writing as you  repeated the other night, you may wish to live in a sublime solitude, but you will not be allowed---I approve most completely your plan of travels and study, and should suffer torture if my wants interrupted it---in short they shall not my dear Keats---I believe you from my soul when you say you would sacrifice all for me; and when your means are gone, if God give me means my heart & house & home & every thing shall be shared with you---I mean this too---It has often occurred to me but I have never spoken of it---My great object is the public encouragement of historical painting and the glory of England in high Art, to ensure these I would lay my head on the block this instant. My illness the consequence of early excess in study, has fatigued most of my Friends ---I have no reason to complain of the lovers of Art, I have been liberally assisted; but when a man comes again with a tale of his ill health; they dont believe him my dear Keats; can I bear the thousandth part of a dry hesitation, the searching scrutiny of an apprehension of insincerity; the musing hum of a sounding question; the prying, petty, paltr y whining doubt, that is inferred from a request? for a day to consider !-----Ah Kea ts, this is sad work for one of my soul, & Ambition. The truest thing you ever said of mortal was that I had a touch of Alexander in me!---I have, I know it, and the World shall know it, but this is the purgative drug I must first take.---Come soon my dear fellow---Sunday nobody is coming I believe---& I will lay my Soul bare before you--- Your affectionate Friend B.

I should have less chance with the people around me than Orpheus had with the Stones---I have been writing a little now and then lately: but nothing to speak off---being discontented and as it were moulting---yet I do not think I shall ever come to the rope or the Pistol: for after a day or two's melancholy, although I smoke more and more my own insufficiency ---I see by little and little more of what is to be done, and how it is to be done, should I ever be able to do it--- On my Soul there should be some reward for that continual 'agonie ennuiyeuse.'

Indeed I have had an earnest this last fortnight of the most glorious kind---My Exhibition has struck a blow my dear fellow, that will sound for ever!---I will walk over to see you Monday if well, & not rainy: the drawings have been felt by all classes to the core of their hearts, and to the core of the core. God give my eyes for ten years & such Friends as you---by Heaven I'll plunge into the bottom of the sea, where plummets have now never sounded, & never will be able to sound, with such impetus that the antipodes shall see my head drive through on their side of the Earth to their dismay & terror.---I am glad you take care of your throat, if you are cautious it will radically leave you; dont trifle & keep it always getting well , but get it quite well.  & Believe me my dear Keats most affectionately & ardently attached to you B.

Dilke Esqr  Navy Pay Office  Somerset house  London. Postmark : 25 JA 1819. Bedhampton. 24th Jany 1819. Dear Dilke, This letter is for your Wife, and if you are a Gentleman, you will deliver it to her, without reading one word further. 'read thou Squire. There is a wager depending on this.  My charming dear Mrs Dilke, It was delightful to receive a letter from you,---but such a letter! what presumption in me to attempt to answer it! Where shall I find, in my poor brain, such gibes, such jeers, such flashes of merriment? Alas! you will say, as you read me, Alas! poor Brown! quite chop 591 fallen! But that's not true; my chops have been beautifully plumped out since I came here; my dinners have been good & nourishing, & my inside never washed by a red herring broth. Then my mind has been so happy! I have been smiled on by the fair ones, the Lacy's, the Prices, & the Mullings's, but not by the Richards's; Old Dicky has not called here during my visit,---I have not seen him; the whole of the family are shuffling to carriage folks for acquaintances, cutting their old friends, and dealing out pride  & folly, while we allow they have got the odd trick , but dispute their honours . I was determined to be beforehand with them,  & behaved cavalierly & neglectingly to the family, & passed the girls in Havant with a slight bow.--- Keats is much better, owing to a strict forbearance from a third glass of wine. He & I walked from Chichester yesterday; we were here at 3, but the Dinner was finished; a brace of Muir fowl had been dressed; I ate a piece of the breast cold, & it was not tainted; I dared not venture further. Mr Snook was nearly turned sick by being merely asked to take a mouthful. The other brace was so high , that the Cook declined preparing them for the spit,  & they were thrown away. I see your husband declared them to be in excellent order; I suppose he enjoyed them in a disgusting manner,---sucking the rotten flesh off the bones, & crunching the putrid bones. Did you eat any? I hope not, for an ooman should be delicate in her food.---O you Jezabel! to sit quietly in your room, while the thieves were ransacking my house! No doubt poor Ann's throat was cut; has the Coroner sat on her yet? ---Mrs Snook says she knows how to hold a pen very well,  & wants no lessons from me; only think of the vanity of the ooman ! She tells me to make honourable mention of your letter which she received at Breakfast time, but how can I do so? I have not read it;  & I'll lay my life it is not a tenth part so good as mine,---pshaw on your letter to her!--- On Tuesday night I think you'll see me. In the mean time I'll not say a word about spasms in the way of my professon, tho' as your friend I must profess myself very sorry. Keats & I are going to call on Mr Butler & Mr Burton this morning, & to-morrow we shall go to Sanstead  592 to see Mr Way's Chapel consecrated by the two Bigwigs of Gloucester & St. Davids. If that vile Carver & Gilder does not do me justice, I'll annoy him all his life with legal expences at every quarter, if my rent is not sent to the day, & that will not be revenge enough for the trouble & confusion he has put me to.---Mrs Dilke is remarkably well for Mrs Dilke  593 in winter.---Have you heard any thing of John 594 Blagden; he is off! want of business has made him play the fool,---I am sorry \---that Brown and you are getting so very witty---my modest feathered Pen frizzles like baby roast beef at making its entrance among such tantrum sentences---or rather ten senses. Brown super or supper sirnamed the Sleek has been getting thinner a little by pining opposite Miss Muggins--- (Brown says Mullins but I beg leave to differ from him) ---we sit it out till ten o'Clock---Miss M. has persuaded Brown to shave his whiskers---he came down to Breakfast like the Sign of the full Moon---his Profile is quite alter'd--- He looks more like an oman than I ever could think it possible---and on putting on Mrs D's Calash the deception was complete especially as his voice is trebbld by making love in the draught of a door way. I too am metamorphosed ---a young oman here in Bed ---hampton has over persuaded me to wear my Shirtcollar up to my eyes. Mrs Snook I catch smoaking it every now and then and I believe Brown does---but I cannot now look sideways--- Brown wants to scribble more so I will finish with a marginal note---Viz. Remember me to Wentworth Place and Elm Cottage---not forgetting Millamant---Your's if possible J. Keats--- This is abominable! I did but go up stairs to put on a clean & starched hand- kerchief, & that overweening rogue read my letter, & scrawled over one of my sheets, and given him a counterpain, ---I wish I could blank-it all over and beat him with a [K]certain rod, & have a fresh one bolstered up, Ah! he may dress me as he likes but he shan't ticlke me pillow the feathers, \---I would not give a tester for such puns, let us ope brown  (erratum---a large B \---a Bumble B.)  595 will go no further in the Bedroom  & not call Mat Snook a relation to Matt- rass--- This is grown to a conclusion---I had excellent puns in my head but one bad one from Brown has quite upset me but I am quite set-up for more, but I'm content to be conqueror. Your's in love, Chas Brown. N.B. I beg leaf to withdraw all my Puns---they are all wash, an base uns--- Address : Mr Wm Mayor  Gibbons Buildings  Islington.

Believe me I am very sorry for it. In about a fortnight I will see you either in Town or at Islington. In the mean time, could you spare a day for Hampstead? You can have a bed---Do come by the coach, and enquire your way through Pond street, to Mr Brown's, Wentworth Place---This will be charitable to one not ill enough to forget out-of-doors. Remember me to your Cousin---and to all whom I may know---If C.C.C. should chance to be with you---give my particular greeting to him; with the assurance of my constant idea of him---notwithstanding our long separation and my antipathy = indolentissimum to letter writing. Yours truly John Keats Address : Miss Keats. No postmark : probably sent by coach. Wentworth Place--- Feby. Thursday--- My dear Fanny, Your Letter to me at Bedhampton hurt me very much,--- What objection can there be to your receiving a Letter from me? At Bedhampton I was unwell and did not go out of the Garden Gate but twice or thrice during the fortnight I was there---Since I came back I have been taking care of myself---I have been obliged to do so, and am now in hopes that by this care I shall get rid of a sore throat which has haunted me at intervals nearly a twelve-month. I had always a presentiment of not being able to succeed in persuading Mr Abbey to let you remain longer at School---I am very sorry that he will not consent. I recommend you to keep up all that you know and to learn more by yourself however little. The time will come when you will be more pleased with Life---look forward to that time and, though it may appear a trifle, be careful not to let the idle and retired Life you lead fix any awkward habit or behaviour on you---whether you sit or walk--- endeavour to let it be in a seemely and if possible a graceful manner. We have been very little together: but you have not the less been with me in thought. You have no one in the world besides me who would sacrifice any thing for you---I feel myself the only Protector you have. In all your little troubles think of me with the thought that there is at least one person in England who if he could would help you out of them---I live in hopes of being able to make you happy ---I should not perhaps write in this manner, if it were not for the fear of not being able to see you often, or long together. I am in hopes Mr Abbey will not object any more to your receiving a letter now and then from me. How unreasonable! I want a few more lines from you for George---there are some young Men, acquaintances of a Schoolfellow of mine, going out to Birkbeck's at the latter end of this Month. I am in expectation every day of hearing from George---I begin to fear his last letters Miscarried. I shall be in town tomorrow---if you should not be in town, I shall send this little parcel by the Walthamstow Coach. I think you will like Goldsmith. Write me soon--- Your affectionate Brother John--- Mrs Dilke has not been very well---she is gone a walk to town to day for exercise Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbey's Esqre  Walthamstow--- Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 27 FE 1819. Wentworth Place Saturday Morn--- My dear Fanny, I intended to have not failed to do as you requested, and write you as you say once a fortnight. On looking to your letter I find there is no date; and not knowing how long it is since I received it I do not precisely know how great a sinner I am. I am getting quite well, and Mrs Dilke is getting on pretty well. You must pay no attention to Mrs Abbey's unfeeling and ignorant gabble. You can't stop an old woman's crying more than you can a Child's---The old woman is the greatest nuisance because she is too old for the rod. Many people live opposite a Blacksmith's till they cannot hear the hammer. I have been in Town for two or three days and came back last night. I have been a little concerned at not hearing from George---I continue in daily expectation. Keep on reading and play as much on the music and the grassplot as you can. I should like to take possession of those Grass-plots for a Month or so; and send Mrs A. to Town to count coffee berries instead of currant Bunches, for I want you to teach me a few common dancing steps---and I would buy a Watch box to practise them in by myself. I think I had better always pay the postage of these Letters. I shall send you another book the first time I am in Town early enough to book it with one of the morning Walthamstow Coaches. You did not say a word about your Chilblains. Write me directly and let me know about them--- Your Letter shall be answered like an echo. Your affectionate Brother John--- Address : Not recorded. Postmark : 8 MR 1819. My dear Haydon, You must be wondering where I am and what I am about! I am mostly at Hampstead, and about nothing; being in a sort of qui bono temper, not exactly on the road to an epic poem. Nor must you think I have forgotten you. No, I have about every three days been to Abbey's and to the Lawyers. Do let me know how you have been getting on, and in what spirits you are. You got out gloriously in yesterday's Examiner.  597 What a set of little people we live amongst! I went the other day into an ironmonger's shop---without any change in my sensations---men and tin kettles are much the same in these days---they do not study like children at five and thirty--- but they talk like men of twenty. Conversation is not a search after knowledge, but an endeavour at effect. In this respect two most opposite men, Wordsworth and Hunt, are the same. A friend of mine observed the other day that if Lord Bacon were to make any remark in a party of the present day, the conversation would stop on the sudden. I am convinced of this, and from this I have come to this resolution ---never to write for the sake of writing or making a poem, but from running over with any little knowledge or experience which many years of reflection may perhaps give me; otherwise I will be dumb. What imagination I have I shall enjoy, and greatly, for I have experienced the satisfaction of having great conceptions without the trouble of sonnetteering. I will not spoil my love of gloom by writing an Ode to Darkness!  598 With respect to my livelihood, I will not write for it,--- for I will not run with that most vulgar of all crowds, the literary. Such things I ratify by looking upon myself, and trying myself at lifting mental weights, as it were. I am three and twenty, with little knowledge and middling intellect. It is true that in the height of enthusiasm I have been cheated into some fine passages; but that is not the thing. I have not been to see you because all my going out has been to town, and that has been a great deal. Write soon. Yours constantly, John Keats Address : Not recorded. Imperfect postmark : 1819. 10th March. My dear Keats, I have been long, long convinced of the paltry subterfuges of conversation to weaken the effect of unwelcome truth, and have left company where truth is never found; of this be assured, effect and effect only, self-consequence and dictatorial controul, are what those love who shine in conversation, at the expense of truth, principle, and every thing else which interferes with their appetite for dominion--- temporary dominion. I am most happy you approve of my last Sunday's defence, I hope you will like next equally well. My dear Keats ---now I feel the want of your promised assistance---as soon as it is convenient it would indeed be a great, the greatest of blessings. I shall come and see you as soon as this contest is clear of my hands. I cannot before, every moment is so precious.---Take care of your throat, and believe me my dear fellow truly and affectionately your Friend--- B. R. Haydon. At any rate finish your present great intention of a poem---it is as fine a subject as can be---Once more adieu.---Before the 20th if you could help me it would be nectar and manna and all the blessings of gratified thirst. Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbey's Esqre  Walthamstow--- Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and MR 13. Wentworth Place March 13th My dear Fanny, I have been employed lately in writing to George---I do not send him very short letters---but keep on day after day. There were some young Men I think I told you of who were going to the Settlement: they have changed their minds, and I am disappointed in my expectation of sending Letters by them---I went lately to the only dance I have been to these twelve months or shall go to for twelve months again---it was to our Brother in laws' cousin's---She gave a dance for her Birthday and I went for the sake of Mrs Wylie. I am waiting every day to hear from George. I trust there is no harm in the silence: other people are in the same expectation as we are. On looking at your seal I cannot tell whether it is done or not with a Tassie 599 \--- it seems to me to be paste. As I went through Leicester Square lately I was going to call and buy you some, but not knowing but you might have some I would not run the chance of buying duplicates. Tell me if you have any or if you would like any---and whether you would rather have motto ones like that with which I seal this letter;  600 or heads of great Men such as Shakspeare, Milton &c.---or fancy pieces of Art; such as Fame, Adonis &c.---those gentry you read of at the end of the English Dictionary. Tell me also if you want any particular Book; or Pencils, or drawing paper---any thing but live stock. Though I will not now be very severe on it, remembering how fond I used to be of Goldfinches, Tomtits, Minnows, Mice, Ticklebacks, Dace, Cock salmons and all the whole tribe of the Bushes and the Brooks: but verily they are better in the Trees and the water---though I must confess even now a partiality for a handsome Globe of gold-fish---then I would have it hold 10 pails of water and be fed continually fresh through a cool pipe with another pipe to let through the floor---well ventilated they would preserve all their beautiful silver and Crimson---Then I would put it before a handsome painted window and shade it all round with myrtles and Japonicas. I should like the window to open onto the Lake of Geneva---and there I'd sit and read all day like the picture of somebody reading. The weather now and then begins to feel like spring; and therefore I have begun my walks on the heath again. Mrs Dilke is getting better than she has been as she has at length taken a Physician's advice. She ever and anon asks after you and always bids me remember her in my Letters to you--- She is going to leave Hampstead for the sake of educating their Son Charles at the Westminster school. We (Mr Brown and I) shall leave in the beginning of may; I do not know what I shall do or where be all the next Summer. Mrs Reynolds has had a sick house; but they are all well now. You see what news I can send you I do---we all live one day like the other as well as you do---the only difference is being sick and well---with the variations of single and double knocks; and the story of a dreadful fire in the Newspapers---I mentioned Mr Brown's name---yet I do not think I ever said a word about him to you. He is a friend of mine of two years standing--- with whom I walked through Scotland; who has been very kind to me in many things when I most wanted his assistance and with whom I keep house till the first of May--- 601 you will know him some day.

Wentworth Place Monday-aft--- 604 .My dear Severn, Your note gave me some pain, not on my own account, but on yours---Of course I should never suffer any petty vanity of mine to hinder you in any wise; and therefore I should say 'put the miniature in the exhibition' if only myself was to be hurt. But, will it not hurt you? What good can it do to any future picture. Even a large picture is lost in that canting place---what a drop of water in the ocean is a Miniature. Those who might chance to see it for the most part if they had ever heard of either of us--- and know what we were and of what years would laugh at the puff of the one and the vanity of the other. I am however in these matters a very bad judge---and would advise you to act in a way that appears to yourself the best for your interest. As your He rmia and Helena is finished send that without the prologue of a Miniature. I shall see you soon, if you do not pay me a visit sooner--- there's a Bull for you. Yours ever sincerely John Keats--- Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbeys Esqre  Walthamstow--- Postmark : MR 31 1819. Wednesday--- My dear Fanny, I shall be going to town tomorrow and will call at the Nursery on the road for those roots and seeds you want, which I will send by the Walthamstow stage. The best way, I thought, for you to learn to answer those questions, is to read over the little book, which I sent from a Bookseller's in town, or you should have had a Letter with it--- Tell me whether it will do: if not I will put down the answers for you. I have not yet heard from George---Perhaps if I just give you the heads of the answers it may be better ---though I think you will find them all in that little book. Ansr 1---It was instituted by John the Baptist when he baptised those people in the river Jordan who believed through him in the coming of Christ---and more particularly when he baptised christ himself. 2 It corresponds to the Jewish Circumscision 3 The meaning is that we are confirmed members of Christ. It is not administered till 14 years of age because before that age the mind is not judged to be sufficiently mature and capable. The act of confirmation imposes on the Christian self circumspection; as by that ceremony the Christian duties of God fathers and godmothers is annulled and put and end to ---as you see in the catechism---"they promise and vow three things in my name"---Confirmation absolves this obligation. 4 There are two Sacraments of our Church---Baptism and the Lord's Supper. The Church of Rome has seven Sacraments. The church of Rome includes several ceremonies ( I forget what they are) and the civil rite of marriage---I believe Confirmation is a Sacrament with them---Extreme unction or the annointing the extremities of dying persons with holy water. The reason why we have but two Sacraments is---that it is proved from the Scriptures by the great protestant reformers---that only two are commanded by god---the rest adopted by the Church of Rome are human institutions. 5 You must here repeat your belief---and say the question is too hard for you. 6 Look in Isaiah for " A virgin shall conceive "  &c---Look in the Psalms for " The Kings of the Earth set themselves and the Princes take counsel together " and " they parted my Garments among them &c" and " My god, my god why has t thou forsaken me &c" In Jeremiah " Comfort ye, comfort ye &c" In Daniel. The stone cut out of the mountain without hands that breaks the image in pieces is a type of the Kingdom of Christ. Look at the 2nd Chat. Isaiah---Chap 7-9---' For unto us a Child is born " 11---Jeremiah Chap XXXI Micah Chap 5---Zechariah Chap 6 and Chap. 13 verse 6\. Those I have marked will be sufficient. You will remember their completion in the new testament. 7th The communion of saints is the fruition they enjoy in heaven among one another and in the Divinity of Christ. 8th It was instituted on the night of the feast of the Passover at the Last supper with the Twelve; the night Judas betrayed Christ---and you may see in the 26 Matthew ---It corresponds to the Feast of the Passover in the Jewish Ritual. 9 They expected Christ to be a temporal Prince and being disappointed, rejected him. 10 Look to the Catechism---'What is your duty towards God?" 11th The Prophecy to our first parents is this---Genesis 3 Chapter, verse 15 "and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between they seed and her seed; it shall bruize thy head and thou shall bruize his heel---Christ the Son of David by dying on the Cross triumphed over death and the grave from which he saved mankind; and in that way did he 'bruize the serpent's head"--- Your affectionate Parson John--- Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbey Esqre  Walthamstow Imperfect postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 13 605 Wentworth Place My dear Fanny, I have been expecting a Letter from you about what the Parson said to your answers. I have thought also of writing to you often, and I am sorry to confess that my neglect of it has been but a small instance of my idleness of late--- which has been growing upon me, so that it will require a great shake to get rid of it. I have written nothing, and almost read nothing---but I must turn over a new leaf--- One most discouraging thing hinders me---we have no news yet from George---so that I cannot with any confidence continue the Letter I have been preparing for him. Many are in the same state with us and many have heard from the Settlement. They must be well however: and we must consider this silence as good news---I ordered some bulbous roots for you at the Gardeners, and they sent me some, but they were all in bud---and could not be sent, so I put them in our Garden There are some beautiful heaths now in bloom in Pots---either heaths or some seasonable plants I will send you instead---perhaps some that are not yet in bloom that you may see them come out. Tomorrow night I am going to a rout---a thing I am not at all in love with. Mr Dilke and his Family have left Hampstead ---I shall dine with them to day in Westminster where I think I told you they were going to reside for the sake of sending their Son Charles to the Blue Westminster School. I think I mentioned the Death of Mr Haslam's Father--- Yesterday week the two Mr Wylies dined with me. I hope you have good store of double violets---I think they are the Princesses of flowers and in a shower of rain, almost as fine as barley sugar drops are to a schoolboy's tongue. I suppose this fine weather the lambs tails give a frisk or two extraordinary--- when a boy would cry huzza and a Girl O my! a little Lamb frisks its tail. I have not been lately through Leicester Square---the first time I do I will remember your Seals. I have thought it best to live in Town this Summer, chiefly for the sake of books, which cannot be had with any comfort in the Country---besides my Scotch journey gave me a doze of the Picturesque with which I ought to be contented for some time. Westminster is the place I have pitched upon---the City or any place very confined would soon turn me pale and thin---which is to be avoided. You must make up your mind to get Stout this summer---indeed I have an idea we shall both be corpulent 606 old folkes with tripple chins and stumpy 607 thumbs. Your affectionate Brother John Address : John Keats Esq  Brown's Esq  Wandsworth Terrace  Hampstead. Postmark : 13 AP 1819. Monday My dear Keats, Why did you hold out such delusive hopes every letter on such slight foundations?---You have led me on step by step, day by day; never telling me the exact circumstances; you paralized my exertions in other quarters---and now when I find it is out of your power to do what your heart led you to offer ---I am plunged into all my old difficulties with scarcely any time to prepare for them---indeed I cannot help telling you this---because if you could not have commanded it you should have told me so at once. I declare to you I scarcely know which way to turn--- I am dear Keats Yours ever (over)     B R Haydon I am sensible of the trouble you took I am grateful for it, but upon my Soul I cannot help complaining because the result has been so totally unexpected & sudden---and I am floundering where I hoped to be firm.---Dont mistake me---I am as attached to you as much & more than to any Man---but really you dont know how you may affect me by not letting me know earlier--- Address :  B. R. Haydon Esqr  Lisson Grove North  Paddington. Postmark cut away. 608 Tuesday My dear Haydon, When I offered you assistance I thought I had it in my hand; I thought I had nothing to do, but to do. The difficulties I met with arose from the alertness and suspicion of Abbey: and especially from the affairs being still in a Lawyer's hand---who has been draining our Property for the last 6 years of every charge he could make---I cannot do two things at once, and thus this affair has stopped my pursuits in every way---from the first prospect I had of difficulty. I assure you I have harrassed myself 10 times more than if I alone had been concerned in so much gain or loss. I have also ever told you the exact particulars as well as and as literally as my hopes or fear could translate them: for it was only by parcels that I found all those petty obstacles which for my own sake should not exist a moment ---and yet why not ---for from my own imprudence and neglect all my accounts are entirely in my Guardians Power. This has taught me a Lesson. Hereafter I will be more correct. I find myself possessed of much less than I thought for and now if I had all on the table all I could do would be to take from it a moderate two years subsistence and lend you the rest; but I cannot say how soon I could become possessed of it. This would be no sacrifice nor any matter worth thinking of---much less than parting as I have more than once done with little sums which might have gradually formed a library to my taste---These sums amount together to nearly 200, which I have but a chance of ever being repaid or paid at a very distant period. I am humble enough to put this in writing from the sense I have of your struggling situation and the great desire that you should do me the justice to credit the unostentatious and willing state of my nerves on all such occasions. It has not been my fault. I am doubly hurt at the slightly reproachful tone of your note as well as and at the occasion of it,---for it must be some other disappointment; you seem'd so sure of some important help when I last saw you---now you have maimed me again; I was whole I had began reading again---when your note came I was engaged in a Book---I dread as much as a Plague the idle fever of two months more without any fruit. I will walk over the first fine day: then see what aspect your affairs have taken, and if they should continue gloomy walk into the City to Abbey and get his consent for I am persuaded that to me alone he will not concede a jot.

I continue increasing my letter to George  610 to send it by one of Birkbeck's sons who is going out soon--- so if you will let me have a few more lines, they will be in time---I am glad you got on so well with Monsr. le Cure\--- is he a nice Clergyman---a great deal depends upon a cock'd hat and powder---not gun powder, lord love us, but lady-meal, violet-smooth, dainty-scented lilly-white, feather-soft, wigsby-dressing, coat-collar-spoiling whisker-reaching, pig-tail loving, swans down-puffing, parson-sweetening powder---I shall call in passing at the tottenham nursery and see if I can find some seasonable plants for you.

No address or postmark. Sunday Morn Feby 14th Letter C---  613 . My dear Brother & Sister--- How is it we have not heard from you from the Settlement yet? The Letters must surely have miscarried. I am in expectation every day---Peachey wrote me a few days ago saying some more acquaintances of his were preparing to set out for Birkbeck---therefore I shall take the opportunity of sending you what I can muster in a sheet or two--- I am still at Wentworth Place---indeed I have kept in doors lately, resolved if possible to rid myself of my sore throat--- consequently I have not been to see your Mother since my return from Chichester---but my absence from her has been a great weight upon me. I say since my return from Chichester---I believe I told you I was going thither---I was nearly a fortnight at Mr John Snook's and a few days at old Mr Dilke's 614 \---Nothing worth speaking of happened at either place---I took down some of the thin paper and wrote on it a little Poem call'd 'St Agnes Eve'--- which you shall have as it is when I have finished the blank part of the rest for you. I went out twice at Chichester to old Dowager card parties. I see very little now, and very few Persons---being almost tired of Men and things. Brown and Dilke are very kind and considerate towards me. The Miss Reynoldses have been stopping next door lately---but all very dull. Miss Brawne and I have every now and then a chat and a tiff. Brown and Dilke are walking round their Garden hands in Pockets making observations. The Literary world I know nothing about---There is a Poem from Rogers  615 dead born ---and another Satire is expected from Byron call'd Don Giovanni--- Yesterday I went to town for the first time for these three weeks. I met people from all parts and of all sets---Mr Towers  616 \---one of the Holts  617 \---Mr Domine Williams ---Mr Woodhouse Mrs Hazlitt and Son---Mrs Webb---Mrs Septimus Brown---Mr Woodhouse was looking up at a Book-window in newgate street and being short-sighted twisted his Muscles into so queer a stupe  618 that I stood by in doubt whether it was him or his brother, if he has one and turning round saw Mrs Hazlitt  619 with that little Nero her son. Woodhouse on his features subsiding proved to be Woodhouse and not his Brother---I have had a little business with Mr Abbey ---From time to time he has behaved to me with a little Brusquerie---this hurt me a little especially when I knew him to be the only Man in England who dared to say a thing to me I did not approve of without its being resented or at least noticed---So I wrote him about it and have made an alteration in my favor--- I expect from this to see more of Fanny---who has been quite shut out from me. I see Cobbet has been attacking the Settlement  620 \---but I cannot tell what to believe---and shall be all out at elbows till I hear from you. I am invited to Miss Millar's Birthday dance on the 19th I am nearly sure I shall not be able to go---a Dance would injure my throat very much. I see very little of Reynolds. Hunt I hear is going on very badly---I mean in money Matters I shall not be surprised to hear of the worst---Haydon too in consequence of his eyes is out at elbows. I live as prudently as it is possible for me to do. I have not seen Haslam lately---I have not seen Richards for this half year--- Rice for three Months or C C. C. for God knows when. When I last called in Henrietta Street  621 \---Mrs Millar was verry unwell---Miss Waldegrave as staid and self possessed as usual---Miss Millar was well---Henry was well. There are two new tragedies ---one by the Apostate Man,  622 and one  623 by Miss Jane Porter. Next week I am going to stop at Taylor's for a few days when I will see them both and tell you what they are. Mrs and Mr Bentley are well and all the young Carrots. I said nothing of consequence passed at Snook's---no more than this that I like the family very much Mr and Mrs Snook were very kind---we used to have over a little Religion and politics together almost every evening---and sometimes about you ---He proposed writing out for me all the best part of his experience in farming to send to you if I should have an opportunity of talking to him about it I will get all I can at all events---but you may say in your answer to this what value you place upon such information. I have not seen Mr Lewis  624 lately for I have shrunk from going up the hill. Mr Lewis went a few mornings ago to town with Mrs Brawne they talked about me---and I heard that Mr L said a thing I am not at all contented with---Says he 'O, he is quite the little Poet' now this is abominable--- you might as well say Buonaparte is quite the little Soldier ---You see what it is to be under six foot and not a lord--- There is a long fuzz to day in the examiner about a young Man who delighted a young woman with a Valentine--- I think it must be Ollier's.  625 Brown and I are thinking of passing the summer at Brussels if we do we shall go about the first of May---We i e Brown and I sit opposite one another all day authorizing (N.B. an s. instead of a z would give a different meaning) He is at present writing a Story of an old Woman who lived in a forest and to whom the Devil or one of his Aid de feus came one night very late and in disguise. The old Dame sets before him pudding after pudding--- mess after mess---which he devours and moreover casts his eyes up at a side of Bacon hanging over his head and at the same time asks whether her Cat is a Rabbit. On going he leaves her three pips of eve's apple  626 \---and some how she, having liv'd a virgin all her life, begins to repent of it and wishes herself beautiful enough to make all the world and even the other world fall in love with her. So it happens---she sets out from her smoaky Cottage in magnificent apparel; the first city she enters every one falls in love with her---from the Prince to the Blacksmith. A young gentleman on his way to the church to be married leaves his unfortunate Bride and follows this nonsuch. A whole regiment of soldiers are smitten at once and follow her. A whole convent of Monks in corpus christi procession join the Soldiers. The Mayor and Corporation follow the same road. Old and young, deaf and dumb---all but the blind are smitten and form an immense concourse of people who---what Brown will do with them I know not. The devil himself falls in love with her flies away with her to a desert place---in consequence of which she lays an infinite number of Eggs. The eggs being hatched from time to time fill the world with many nuisances such as John Knox---George Fox--- Johanna Southcote---Gifford. There have been within a fortnight eight failures of the highest consequence in London---Brown went a few evenings since to Davenport's,  627 and on his coming in he talk'd about bad news in the City with such a face, I began to think of a national Bankruptcy. I did not feel much surprised---and was rather disappointed. Carlisle,  628 a Bookseller on the Hone principle has been issuing Pamphlets from his shop in fleet Street called the Deist---he was conveyed to Newgate last Thursday---he intends making his own defence. I was surprised to hear from Taylor the amount of Murray the Booksellers last sale---what think you of £25,000? He sold 4000 coppies of Lord Byron. I am sitting opposite the Shakspeare I brought from the Isle of wight---and I never look at it but the silk tassels  629 on it give me as much pleasure as the face of the Poet itself---except that I do not know how you are going on. In my next packet as this is one by the by way, I shall send you the Pot of Basil, St Agnes eve, and if I should have finished it a little thing call'd the 'eve of St Mark' you see what fine mother Radcliff  630 names I have---it is not my fault---I did not search for them---I have not gone on with Hyperion---for to tell the truth I have not been in great cue for writing lately---I must wait for the spring to rouse me up a little ---The only time I went out from Bedhampton was to see a Chapel consecrated---Brown I and John Snook the boy,  631 went in a chaise behind a leaden horse Brown drove, but the horse did not mind him---This Chapel is built by a Mr Way  632 a great Jew converter---who in that line has spent one hundred thousand Pounds. He maintains a great number of poor Jews--- Of course his communion plate was stolen---he spoke to the Clerk about it--- The Clerk said he was very sorry---adding 'I dare shay your honour its among ush'. The Chapel is built in Mr Way's park--- The Consecration was---not amusing---there were numbers of carriages, and his house crammed with Clergy ---they sanctified the Chapel---and it being a wet day consecrated the burial ground through the vestry window. I begin to hate Parsons---they did not make me love them that day--- when I saw them in their proper colours---A Parson is a Lamb in a drawing room and a lion in a Vestry. The notions of Society will not permit a Parson to give way to his temper in any shape---so he festers in himself---his features get a peculiar diabolical self sufficient iron stupid expression. He is continually acting. His mind is against every Man and every Mans mind is against him. He is an Hippocrite to the Believer and a Coward to the unbeliever. He must be either a Knave or an Ideot. And there is no Man so much to be pitied as an ideot parson. The Soldier who is cheated into an esprit du corps by a red coat, a Band and Colours for the purpose of nothing---is not half so pitiable as the Parson who is led by the nose by the Bench of Bishops---and is smothered in absurdities---a poor necessary subaltern of the Church  633 \--- 634 Friday Feby 18 .---The day before yesterday I went to Romney Street---your Mother was not at home---but I have just written her that I shall see her on wednesday. I call'd on Mr Lewis  635 this morning---he is very well---and tells me not to be uneasy about Letters the chances being so arbitary ---He is going on as usual among his favorite democrat papers---We had a chat as usual about Cobbett: and the westminster electors. Dilke has lately been very much harrassed about the manner of educating his Son---he at length decided for a public school---and then he did not know what school---he at last has decided for Westminster; and as Charley is to be a day boy, Dilke will remove to Westminster. We lead very quiet lives here---Dilke is at present in greek histories and antiquit ies---and talks of nothing but the electors of Westminster and the retreat of the ten-thousand---I never drink now above three glasses of wine---and never any spirits and water. Though by the bye the other day---Woodhouse took me to his coffee house--- and ordered a Bottle of Claret---now I like Claret whenever I can have Claret I must drink it,---'tis the only palate affair that I am at all sensual in.  636 Would it not be a good Speck to send you some vine roots---could It be done? I'll enquire---If you could make some wine like Claret to drink on Summer evenings in an arbour! For really 'tis so fine---it fills the mouth one's mouth with a gushing freshness---then goes down cool and feverless---then you do not feel it quarrelling with your liver---no it is rather a Peace maker and lies as quiet as it did in the grape--- then it is as fragrant as the Queen Bee; and the more ethereal Part of it mounts into the brain, not assaulting the cerebral apartments like a bully in a bad-house looking for his trul and hurrying from door to door bouncing against the waistcoat: but rather walks like Aladin about his own enchanted palace so gently that you do not feel his step. Other wines of a heavy and spirituous nature transform a Man to a Silenus; this makes him a Hermes--- and gives a Woman the soul and immortality of Ariadne for whom Bacchus always kept a good cellar of claret--- and even of that he could never persuade her to take above two cups ---I said this same Claret is the only palate-passion I have I forgot game---I must plead guilty to the breast of a Partridge, the back of a hare, the backbone of a grouse, the wing and side of a Pheasant and a Woodcock passim . Talking of game (I wish I could make it) the Lady whom I met at Hastings and of whom I said something in my last I think,  637 has lately made me many presents of game, and enabled me to make as many---She made me take home a Pheasant the other day which I gave to Mrs Dilke; on which, tomorrow, Rice, Reynolds and the Wentworthians will dine next door--- The next I intend for your Mother. These moderate sheets of paper are much more pleasant to write upon than those large thin sheets which I hope you by this time have received---though that cant be now I think of it---I have not said in any Letter yet a word about my affairs---in a word I am in no despair about them---my poem has not at all succeeded---in the course of a year or so I think I shall try the public again--- in a selfish point of view I should suffer my pride and my contempt of public opinion to hold me silent---but for your's and fanny's sake I will pluck up a spirit and try again. I have no doubt of success in a course of years if I persevere---but it must be patience---for the Reviews have enervated and made indolent mens minds---few think for themselves---These Reviews too are getting more and more powerful and especially the Quarterly. they are like a superstition which the more it prostrates the Crowd and the longer it continues the more powerful it becomes just in proportion to their increasing weakness---I was in hopes that when people saw, as they must do now, all the trickery and iniquity of these Plagues they would scout them, but no they are like the spectators at the Westminster cock-pit ---they like the battle and do not care who wins or who looses. Brown is going on this morning with the story of his old woman and the Devil---He makes but slow progress ---The fact is it is a Libel on the Devil and as that person is the Brown's Muse, look ye, if he libels his own Muse how can he expect to write---Either Brown or his muse must turn tale---Yesterday was Charley Dilkes birth day.--- Brown and I were invited to tea.---During the evening noth ing passed worth notice but a little conversation between Mrs Dilke and Mrs Brawne.---The subject was the watchman.---It was ten o'Clock and Mrs Brawne, who lived during the summer in Brown's house and now lives in the Road, recognized her old Watchman's voice and said that he came as far as her now: 'indeed' said Mrs D. 'does he turn the Corner?' There have been some Letters pass between me and Haslam: but I have not seen him lately---the day before yesterday---which I made a day of Business,---I call'd upon him---he was out as usual---Brown has been walking up and down the room a breeding---now at this moment he is being delivered of a couplet---and I dare say will be as well as can be expected.---Gracious--- he has twins! I have a long Story to tell you about Bailey ---I will say first the circumstances as plainly and as well as I can remember and then I will make my comment. You know that Bailey was very much cut up about a little Jilt in the country somewhere; I thought he was in a dying state about it when at Oxford with him: little supposing as I have since heard, that he was at that very time making impatient Love to Marian Reynolds ---and guess my astonishment at hearing after this that he had been trying at Miss Martin---So Matters have been. So Matters stood ---when he got ordained and went to a Curacy near Carlisle where the family of the Gleigs reside--- There his susceptible heart was conquered by Miss Gleig---and thereby all his connections in town have been annulled---both male and female---I do not now remember clearly the facts---These however I know---He showed his correspondence with Marian to Gleig---returnd all her Letters and asked for his own---he also wrote very abrubt Letters to Mrs Reynolds---I do not know any more of the Martin affair  638 than I have written above---No doubt his conduct has been very bad. The great thing to be considered is--- whether it is want of delicacy and principle or want of Knowledge and polite experience---And again Weakness ---yes that is it ---and the want of a Wife---yes that is it--- and then Marian made great Bones of him although her Mother and Sister have teased her very much about it. Her conduct has been very upright throughout the whole affair---She liked Bailey as a Brother---but not as a Husband ---especially as he used to woo her with the Bible and Jeremy Taylor under his arm---they walked in no grove but Jeremy Taylors  639 \---Marians obstinacy is some excuse--- but his so quickly taking to miss Gleig can have no excuse ---except that of a Ploughmans who wants a wife---The thing which sways me more against him than any thing else is Rice's conduct on the occasion; Rice would not make an immature resolve: he was ardent in his friendship for Bailey, he examined the whole for and against minutely; and he has abandoned Bailey entirely. All this I am not supposed by the Reynoldses to have any hint of---It will be a good Lesson to the Mother and Daughters--- nothing would serve but Bailey---If you mentioned the word Tea pot some one of them came out with an a propos about Bailey---noble fellow---fine fellow! was always in their mouths---this may teach them that the man who redicules romance is the most romantic of Men---that he who abuses women and slights them---loves them the most \---that he who talks of roasting a Man alive would not do it when it came to the push---and above all that they are very shallow people who take every thing literally. A Man's life of any worth is a continual allegory---and very few eyes can see the Mystery of his life---a life like the scriptures, figurative---which such people can no more make out than they can the hebrew Bible. Lord Byron cuts a figure---but he is not figurative---Shakspeare led a life of Allegory: his works are the comments on it--- March 12 Friday---I went to  640 town yesterday chiefly for the purpose of seeing some young Men who were to take some Letters for us to you---through the medium of Peachey. I was surprised and disappointed at hearing they had changed their minds and did not purpose going so far as Birkbeck's  641 \---I was much disappointed; for I had counted upon seeing some persons who were to see you---and upon your seeing some who had seen me---I have not only lost this opportunity---but the sail of the Post-Packet to new york or Philadelphia---by which last your Brothers  642 have sent some Letters---The weather in town yesterday was so stifling that I could not remain there though I wanted much to see Kean in Hotspur---I have by me at present Hazlitt's Letter to Gifford  643 \---perhaps you would like an extract or two from the high-seasond parts. It begins thus. "Sir, You have an ugly trick of saying what is not true of any one you do not like; and it will be the object of this Letter to cure you of it. You say what you please of others; it is time you were told what you are. In doing this give me leave to borrow the familiarity of your style:---for the fidelity of the picture I shall be answerable. You are a little person but a considerable cat's paw; and so far worthy of notice. Your clandestine connection with persons high in office constantly influences your opinions and alone gives importance to them. You are the government critic, a character nicely of differing from that of a government spy---the invisible link, that connects literature with the Police." Again---"Your employers Mr Gifford, do not pay their hirelings for nothing--- for condescending to notice weak and wicked sophistry; for pointing out to contempt what excites no admiration; for cautiously selecting a few specimens of bad taste and bad grammar where nothing else is to be found. They want your invincible pertness, your mercenary malice, your impenetrable dullness, your barefaced impudence, your pragmatical self-sufficiency, your hypocritical zeal, your pious frauds to stand in the gap of their Prejudices and pretensions, to fly blow and taint public opinion, to defeat independent efforts, to apply not the touch of the scorpion but the touch of the Torpedo to youthful hopes, to crawl and leave the slimy track of sophistry and lies over every work that does not 'dedicate its sweet leaves'  644 to some Luminary of the treasury bench, or is not fostered in the hot bed of corruption. This is your office; "this is what is look'd for at your hands and this you do not baulk"  645 \---to sacrifice what little honesty and prostitute what little intellect you possess to any dirty job you are commission'd to execute. "They keep you as an ape does an apple in the corner of his jaw, first mouth'd to be at last swallow'd"  646 \---You are by appointment literary toadeater to greatness and taster to the court---You have a natural aversion to whatever differs from your own pretensions, and an acquired one for what gives offence to your superiors. Your vanity panders to your interest, and your malice truckles only to your love of Power. If your instinctive or premeditated abuse of your enviable trust were found wanting in a single instance; if you were to make a single slip in getting up your select committee of enquiry and green bag report of the state of Letters, your occupation would be gone. You would never after obtain a squeeze of the hand from a great man, or a smile from a Punk of Quality. The great and powerful (whom you call wise and good) do not like to have the privacy of their self love startled by the obtrusive and unmanageable claims of Literature and Philosophy, except through the intervention of people like you, whom, if they have common penetration, they soon find out to be without any superiority of intellect; or if they do not, whom they can despise for their meanness of soul. You "have the office opposite to saint Peter."  647 You "keep a corner in the public mind, for foul prejudice and corrupt power to knot and gender in";  648 you volunteer your services to people of quality to ease scruples of mind and qualmes of conscience; you lay the flattering unction  649 of venal prose and laurell'd verse to their souls---You persuade them that there is neither purity of morals, nor depth of understanding except in themselves and their hangers on; and would prevent the unhallow'd names of Liberty and humanity from ever being whispered in years  sic  polite! You, sir, do you not all this? I cry you mercy then: I took you for  650 the Editor of the Quarterly Review!" This is the sort of feu de joie he keeps up---there is another extract or two---one especially which I will copy tomorrow---for the candles are burnt down and I am using the wax taper---which has a long snuff on it---the fire is at its last click---I am sitting with my back to it with one foot rather askew upon the rug and the other with the heel a little elevated from the carpet---I am writing this on the Maid's tragedy which I have read since tea with Great pleasure---Besides this volume of Beaumont & Fletcher  651 \---there are on the table two volumes of chaucer and a new work of Tom Moores call'd 'Tom Cribb's memorial to Congress  652 \---nothing in it---these are trifles but I require nothing so much of you as that you will give me a like description of yourselves, however it may be when you are writing to me---Could I see the same thing done of any great Man long since dead it would be a great delight: As to know in what position Shakspeare sat when he began 'To be or not to be"---such things become interesting from distance of time or place. I hope you are both now in that sweet sleep which no two beings deserve more that  for than  you do---I must fancy you so--- and please myself in the fancy of speaking a prayer and a blessing over you and your lives---God bless you---I whisper good night in your ears and you will dream of me. Saturday 13 March . I have written to Fanny  653 this morning; and received a note from Haslam. I was to have dined with him to morrow: he give s me an bad account of his Father who has not been in Town for 5 weeks--- and is not well enough for company---Haslam is well---and from the prosperous state of some love affair he does not mind the double tides he has to work. I have been a Walk past westend---and was going to call at Mr Monkhouse's--- but I did not, not being in the humour---I know not why Poetry and I have been so distant lately I must make some advances soon or she will cut me entirely. Hazlitt has this fine Passage in his Letter: Gifford, in his Review of Hazlitt's characters of Shakspeare's plays, attacks the Coriolanus critique---He says that Hazlitt has slandered Shakspeare in saying that he had a leaning to the arbitary side of the question. Hazlitt thus defends himself "My words are "Coriolanus is a storehouse of political commonplaces The Arguments for and against aristocracy and democracy, on the Privileges of the few and the claims of the many, on Liberty and slavery, power and the abuse of it, peace and war, are here very ably handled, with the spirit of a poet and the acuteness of a Philosopher. Shakspeare himself seems to have had a leaning to the arbitary side of the question, perhaps from some feeling of contempt for his own origin, and to have spared no occasion of bating the rabble, What he says of them is very true; what he says of their betters is also very true, though he dwells less upon it . "I then proceed to account for this by showing how it is that "the cause of the people is but little calculated for a subject for Poetry; or that the language of Poetry naturally falls in with the language of power." I affirm, Sir, that Poetry, that the imagination, generally speaking, delights in power, in strong excitement, as well as in truth, in good, in right, whereas pure reason and the moral sense approve only of the true and good. I proceed to show that this general love or tendency to immediate excitement or theatrical effect, no matter how produced, gives a Bias to the imagination often  inconsistent with the greatest good, that in Poetry it triumphs over Principle, and bribes the passions to make a sacrifice of common humanity. You say that it does not, that there is no such original Sin in Poetry, that it makes no such sacrifice or unworthy compromise between poetical effect and the still small voice of reason And how do you prove that there is no such principle giving a bias to the imagination, and a false colouring to poetry? Why by asking in reply to the instances where this principle operates, and where no other can with much modesty and simplicity---"But are these the only topics that afford delight in Poetry &c" No; but these objects do afford delight in poetry, and they afford it in proportion to their strong and often tragical effect, and not in proportion to their strong and often tragical effect,  654 and not in proportion to the good produced, or their desireableness in a moral point of view? "Do we read with more pleasure of the ravages of a beast of prey than of the Shepherds pipe upon the Mountain?" No but we do read with pleasure of the ravages of a beast of prey, and we do so on the principle I have stated, namely from the sense of power abstracted from the sence of good; and it is the same principle that makes us read with admiration and reconciles us in fact to the triumphant progress of the conquerers and mighty Hunters of mankind, who come to stope the shepherd's Pipe upon the Mountains and sweep away his listening flock. Do you mean to deny that there is any thing imposing to the imagination in power, in grandeur, in outward shew, in the accumulation of individual wealth and luxury, at the expense of equal justice and the common weal? Do you deny that there is anything in the "Pride, Pomp, and Circumstance of glorious war, that makes ambition virtue"!  655 in the eyes of admiring multitudes? Is this a new theory of the Pleasures of the imagination, which says that the pleasures of the imagination do not take rise soly in the calculations of the understanding? Is it a paradox of my creating that "one murder makes a villain, millions a Hero!"  656 or is it not true that here, as in other cases, the enormity of the evil overpowers and makes a convert of the imagination by its very magnitude? You contradict my reasoning, because you know nothing of the question, and you think that no one has a right to understand what you do not. My offence against purity in the passage alluded to, "which contains the concentrated venom of my malignity," is, that I have admitted that there are tyrants and slaves abroad in the world; and you would hush the matter up, and pretend that there is no such thing in order that there may be nothing else. Farther I have explained the cause, the subtle sophistry of the human mind, that tolerates and pampers the evil in order to guard against its approaches; you would conceal the cause in order to prevent the cure, and to leave the proud flesh about the heart to harden and ossify into one impenetrable mass of selfishness and hypocrisy, that we may not "sympathise in the distresses of suffering virtue" in any case in which they come in competition with the fictitious wants and "imputed weaknesses of the great." You ask "are we gratified by the cruelties of Domitian or Nero?" No not we---they were too petty and cowardly to strike the imagination at a distance; but the Roman senate tolerated them, addressed their perpetrators, exalted them into gods, the fathers of the people, they had pimps and scribblers of all sorts in their pay, their Senecas, &c. till a turbulent rabble thinking there were no injuries to Society greater than the endurance of unlimited and wanton oppression, put an end to the farce and abated the nuisance as well as they could. Had you and I lived in those times we should have been what we are now, I  657 "a sour mal content," and you "a sweet courtier." '  658 The manner in which this is managed: the force and innate power with which it yeasts and works up itself---the feeling for the costume of society; is in a style of genius--- He hath a demon, as he himself says of Lord Byron---We are to have a party this evening. The Davenports from Church row  659 \---I dont think you know anything of them--- they have paid me a good deal of attention. I like Davenport himself The names of the rest are Miss Barnes Miss Winter with the Children.  660 On Monday we had to dinner Severn and Cawthorn, the Bookseller and print- virtuoso; in the evening Severn went home to paint, and we other three went to the play, to see Sheil's  661 new tragedy ycleped 'Evadne'. In the morning Severn and I took a turn round the Museum--- there is a sphinx there of a giant size, and most voluptuous Egyptian expression, I had not seen it before. The play was bad even in comparison with 1818, the Augustan age of the Drama, 'comme on sait', as Voltaire says, the whole was made up of a virtuous young woman, an indignant brother, a suspecting lover, a libertine prince, a gratuitous villain, a street in Naples, a Cypress grove, lilies and roses, virtue and vice,  662 a bloody sword, a spangled jacket, one Lady Olivia, one Miss O'Neil  663 alias Evadne, alias Bellamira, alias---(Alias---Yea, and I say unto you a greater than Elias---There was Abbot,  664 and talking of Abbot his name puts me in mind of a spelling book lesson, descriptive of the whole Dramatis personae---Abbot---Abbess--- Actor--- Actress---). The play is a fine amusement, as a friend of mine once said to me---'Do what you will,' says he, 'a poor gentleman who wants a guinea cannot spend his two shillings better than at the playhouse.' The pantomime was excellent, I had seen it before and I enjoyed it again. Your mother and I had some talk about Miss---. Says I, Will Henry have that Miss---, a lath with a boddice, she who has been fine drawn---fit for nothing but to cut up into Cribbage pins, to the tune of 15-2; one who is all muslin; all feathers and bone; once in travelling she was made use of as a lynch pin; I hope he will not have her, though it is no uncommon thing to be smitten with a staff ; though she might be very useful as his walking-stick, his fishing-rod, his tooth-pick, his hat-stick (she runs so much in his head)---let him turn farmer, she would cut into hurdles; let him write poetry, she would be his turn-style. Her gown is like a flag on a pole; she would do for him if he turn freemason; I hope she will prove a flag of truce; when she sits languishing with her one foot on a stool, and one elbow on the table, and her head inclined, she looks like the sign of the crooked billet---or the frontispiece to Cinderella or a tea-paper wood-cut of Mother Shipton at her studies; she is a make-believe---She is bona side a thin young 'oman---But this is mere talk of a fellow creature; yet pardie I would not that Henry have her--- Non volo ut eam possideat, nam, for, it would be a bam, for it would be a sham--- Don't think I am writing a petition to the Governors of St. Luke  665 \---no, that would be in another style. May it please your Worships; forasmuch as the undersigned has committed, transferred, given up, made over, consigned, and aberrated himself, to the art and mystery of poetry; forasmuch as he hath cut, rebuffed affronted, huffed, and shirked, and taken stint, at all other employments, arts, mysteries and occupations, honest, middling, and dishonest; forasmuch as he hath at sundry times and in diverse places, told truth unto the men of this generation, and eke to the women; moreover, forasmuch as he hath kept a pair of boots that did not fit, and doth not admire Sheil's play, Leigh Hunt, Tom Moore, Bob Southey and Mr Rogers; and does admire Wm. Hazlitt; more overer for as more as he liketh half of Wordsworth, and none of Crabbe; more over-est for as most as he hath written this page of penmanship---he prayeth your Worships to give him a lodging---Witnessed by Rd. Abbey and Co. cum familiaribus & consanguiniis (signed) Count de Cockaigne. The nothing of the day is a machine called the velocipede.  666 It is a wheel carriage to ride cock-horse upon, sitting astride and pushing it along with the toes, a rudder wheel in hand---they will go seven miles an hour. A handsome gelding will come to eight guineas; however they will soon be cheaper, unless the army takes to them. I look back upon the last month, and find nothing to write about; indeed I do not recollect any thing particular in it. It's all alike; we keep on breathing. The only amusement is a little scandal, of however fine a shape, a laugh at a pun--- and then after all we wonder how we could enjoy the scandal or laugh at the pun. I have been at different times turning it in my head whether I should go to Edinburgh and study for a physician; I am afraid I should not take kindly to it; I am sure I could not take fees---and yet I should like to do so: it's not worse than writing poems, and hanging them up to be fly-blown on the Review shambles. Every body is in his own mess: Here is the Parson at Hampstead  667 quarrelling with all the world, he is in the wrong by this same token; when the black cloth was put up in the Church for the Queen's mourning,  668 he asked the workmen to hang it the wrong side outwards, that it might be better when taken down, it being his perquisite.---Parsons will always keep up their character, but as it is said there are some animals the ancients knew which we do not, let us hope our posterity will miss the black badger with tri-cornered hat; Who knows but some Reviewer of Buffon or Pliny may put an account of the parson in the Appendix; No one will then believe it any more than we believe in the Phoenix. I think we may class the lawyer in the same natural history of Monsters; a green bag will hold as much as a lawn sleeve. The only difference is that one is fustian and the other flimsy; I am not unwilling to read Church history---at present I have Milner  669 in my eye---his is reckoned a very good one. 18th September 1819. In looking over some of my papers I found the above specimen of my carelessness. It is a sheet you ought to have had long ago---my letter must have appeared very unconnected, but as I number the sheets you must have discovered how the mistake happened. How many things have happened since I wrote it. How have I acted contrary to my resolves. The interval between writing this sheet and the day I put this supplement to it, has been completely filled with generous and most friendly actions of Brown towards me. How frequently I forget to speak of things which I think of and feel most. 'Tis very singular, the idea about Buffon above has been taken up by Hunt in the Examiner, in some papers which he calls 'A Preternatural History.'  670  March 17th . Wednesday---On Sunday I went to Davenports'  671 where I dined---and had a nap. I cannot bare a day annihilated in that manner---there is a great difference between an easy and an uneasy indolence---An indolent day---fill'd with speculations even of an unpleasant colour---is bearable and even pleasant alone\--- when one's thoughts cannot find out any thing better in the world; and experience has told us that locomotion is no change: but to have nothing to do, and to be surrounded with unpleasant human identities; who press upon one just enough to prevent one getting into a lazy position; and not enough to interest or rouse one; is a capital punishment of a capital crime: for is not giving up, through good-nature, one's time to people who have no light and shade a capital crime? Yet what can I do?---they have been very kind and attentive to me. I do not know what I did on monday---nothing---nothing--- nothing---I wish this was any thing extraordinary. Yesterday I went to town: I called on Mr Abbey; he began again (he has done it frequently lately) about that hat making concern---saying he wish you had hearkened to it: he wants to make me a Hatmaker\--- I really believe 'tis all interested: for from the manner he spoke withal and the card he gave me I think he is concerned in Hat-making himself.  672 He speaks well of Fanny's health---Hodgkinson is married---From this I think he takes a little Latitude---Mr A was waiting very impatiently for his return to the counting house---and meanwhile observed how strange it was that Hodgkinson should have been not able to walk two months ago and that now he should be married.---"I do not', says he 'think it will do him any good: I should not be surrprised if he should die of a consumption in a year or two. I called at Taylor's, and found that he and Hilton had set out to dine with me: so I followed them immediately back ---I walk'd with them townwards again as far as Cambden Town and smoak'd home  673 a Segar---This morning I have been reading the ' False one '  674 I have been up to Mrs Bentley's---shameful to say I was in bed at ten---I mean this morning---The Blackwood's review has committed themselves in a scandalous heresy---they have been putting up Hogg the ettrick shepherd against Burns 675 \---the senseless villains. I have not seen Reynolds Rice of   for or  any of our set lately---. Reynolds is completely buried in the law: he is not only reconcil'd to it but hobbyhorses upon it---Blackwood wanted very much to see him---the Scotch cannot manage by themselves at all---they want imagination--- and that is why they are so fond of Hogg who has a little of it--- Friday 19th . Yesterday I got a black eye---the first time I took a Cr icket bat. Brown who is always one's friend in a disaster applied a leech to the eyelid, and there is no inflammation this morning though the ball hit me  torn  on the sight---'twas a white ball. I am glad it was not a clout. This is the second black eye I have had since leaving school---during all my school days I never had one at all---we must eat a peck before we die ---This morning I am in a sort of temper indolent and supremely careless: I long after a stanza or two of Thompson's Castle of indolence. My passions are all alseep from my having slumbered till nearly eleven and weakened the animal fibre all over me to a delightful sensation about three degrees on this side of faintness---if I had teeth of pearl and the breath of lillies I should call it langour---but as I am  676 I must call it Laziness. In this state of effeminacy the fibres of the brain are relaxed in common with the rest of the body, and to such a happy degree that pleasure has no show of enticement and pain no unbearable frown. Neither Poetry, nor Ambition, nor Love have any alertness of countenance as they pass by me: they seem rather like three figures on a greek vase---a Man and two women whom no one but myself could distinguish in their disguisement.  677 This is the only happiness; and is a rare instance of advantage in the body overpowering the Mind. I have this moment received a note from Haslam in which he expects the death of his Father---who has been for some time in a state of insensibility---his mother bears up he says very well---I shall go to twon 678 tommorrow to see him. This is the world---thus we cannot expect to give way many hours to pleasure---Circumstances are like Clouds continually gathering and bursting---While we are laughing the seed of some trouble is put into the wide arable land of events---while we are laughing it sprouts is  for it  grows and suddenly bears a poison fruit which we must pluck--- Even so we have leisure to reason on the misfortunes of our friends; our own touch us too nearly for words. Very few men have ever arrived at a complete disinterestedness of Mind: very few have been influenced by a pure desire of the benefit of others---in the greater part of the Benefactors of to Humanity some meretricious motive has sullied their greatness---some melodramatic scenery has fascinated them---From the manner in which I feel Haslam's misfortune I perceive how far I am from any humble standard of disinterestedness---Yet this feeling ought to be carried to its highest pitch as there is no fear of its ever injuring Society---which it would do I fear pushed to an extremity---For in wild nature the Hawk would loose his Breakfast of Robins and the Robin his of Worms---the Lion must starve as well as the swallow. The greater part of Men make their way with the same instinctiveness, the same unwandering eye from their purposes, the same animal eagerness as the Hawk. The Hawk wants a Mate, so does the Man---look at them both they set about it and procure one in the same manner. They want both a nest and they both set about one in the same manner---they get their food in the same manner---The noble animal Man for his amusement smokes his pipe--- the Hawk balances about the Clouds---that is the only difference of their leisures. This it is that makes the Amusement of Life---to a speculative Mind. I go among the Fields and catch a glimpse of a Stoat or a fieldmouse peeping out of the withered grass---the creature hath a purpose and its eyes are bright with it. I go amongst the buildings of a city and I see a Man hurrying along---to what? the Creature has a purpose and his eyes are bright with it. But then, as Wordsworth says, "we have all one human heart"  679 \---there is an ellectric fire in human nature tending to purify---so that among these human creatures there is continually some birth of new heroism. The pity is that we must wonder at it: as we should at finding a pearl in rubbish. I have no doubt that thousands of people never heard of have had hearts completely disinterested: I can remember but two---Socrates and Jesus---their Histories evince it. What I heard a little time ago, Taylor observe with respect to Socrates may be said of Jesus--- That he was so great a man that though he transmitted no writing of his own to posterity, we have his Mind and his sayings and his greatness handed to us by others. It is to be lamented that the history of the latter was written and revised by Men interested in the pious frauds of Religion. Yet through all this I see his splendour. Even here though I myself am pursueing the same instinctive course as the veriest human animal you can think of--- I am however young writing at random---straining at particles of light in the midst of a great darkness---without knowing the bearing of any one assertion of any one opinion. Yet may I not in this be free from sin?  680 May there not be superior beings amused with any graceful, though instinctive attitude my mind may fall into, as I am entertained with the alertness of a Stoat or the anxiety of a Deer? Though a quarrel in the Streets is a thing to be hated, the energies displayed in it are fine; the commonest Man shows a grace in his quarrel---By a superior being our reasonings may take the same tone--- though erroneous they may be fine---This is the very thing in which consists poetry; and if so it is not so fine a thing as philosophy---For the same reason that an eagle is not so fine a thing as a truth---Give me this credit---Do you not think I strive---to know myself? Give me this credit--- and you will not think that on my own account I repeat Milton's lines "How charming is divine Philosophy Not harsh and crabbed as dull fools suppose But musical as is Apollo's lute"---  681 No---not for myself---feeling grateful as I do to have got into a state of mind to relish them properly---Nothing ever becomes real till it is experienced---Even a Proverb is no proverb to you till your Life has illustrated it. I am ever affraid that your anxiety for me will lead you to fear for the violence of my temperament continually smothered down: for that reason I did not intend to have sent you the following sonnet---but look over the two last pages and ask yourselves whether I have not that in me which will well bear the buffets of the world. It will be the best comment on my sonnet; it will show you that it was written with no Agony but that of ignorance; with no thirst of any thing but Knowledge when pushed to the point though the first steps to it were through my human passions---they went away, and I wrote with my Mind---and perhaps I must confess a little bit of my heart--- Why did I laugh tonight? No voice will tell: No God no Deamon of severe response Deigns to reply from heaven or from Hell.---  682 Then to my human heart I turn at once--- Heart! thou and I are here sad and alone; Say, wherefore did I laugh? O mortal pain! O Darkness! Darkness!  683 ever must I moan To question Heaven and Hell and Heart in vain!  684 Why did I laugh? I know this being's lease My fancy to its utmost blisses spreads: Yet could I on this very midnight cease  685 And the world's gaudy ensigns see in shreds. Verse, fame and Beauty are intense indeed But Death intenser---Death is Life's high mead." I went to bead bed, and enjoyed an uninterrupted Sleep ---Sane I went to bed and sane I arose. This the 15th of April---you see what a time it is since I wrote---all that time I have been day by day expecting Letters from you. I write quite in the dark---In the hopes of a Letter daily I have deferred that I might write in the light. I was in town yesterday and at Taylor's heard that young Birkbeck had been in Town and was to set forward in six or seven days---so I shall dedicate that time to making up this parcel ready for him. I wish I could hear from you to make me "whole and general as the casing air."  686 A few days after the 19th of april  687 I received a note from Haslam containing the news of his father's death---The Family has all been well---Haslam has his father's situation. The Framptons have behaved well to him---The day before yesterday I went to a rout at Sawrey's  688 \---it was made pleasant by Reynolds being there, and our getting into conversation with one of the most beautiful Girls I ever saw---She gave a remarkable prettiness to all those commonplaces which most women who talk must utter--- I liked Mrs Sawrey very well. The Sunday before last your Brothers were to come by a long invitation---so long that for the time I forgot it when I promised Mrs Brawne to dine with her on the same day---On recollecting my engagement with your Brothers I immediately excused myself with Mrs Brawne but she would not hear of it and insisted on my bringing my friends with me. So we all dined at Mrs Brawne's. I have been to Mrs Bentley's this morning and put all the Letters two  for to  and from you and poor Tom and me---I have found some of the correspondence between him and that degraded Wells and Amena 689 \---It is a wretched business. I do not know the rights of it---but what I do know would I am sure affect you so much that I am in two Minds whether I will tell you any thing about it---And yet I do not see why---for any thing tho' it be unpleasant, that calls to mind those we still love, has a compensation in itself for the pain it occasions---so very likely tomorrow I may set about coppying the whole of what I have about it: with no sort of a Richardson self satisfaction---I hate it to a sickness---and I am affraid more from indolence of mind than any thing else. I wonder how people exist with all their worries. I have not been to Westminster but once lately and that was to see Dilke in his new Lodgings---I think of living somewhere in the neighbourhood myself--- Your mother was well by your Brother's account. I shall see her perhaps to- morrow---yes I shall---We have had the Boys here lately---they make a bit of a racket---I shall not be sorry when they go.  690 I found also this morning in a note from George to you my dear sister a lock of your hair which I shall this moment put in the miniature case. A few days ago Hunt dined here and Brown invited Davenport  691 to meet him. Davenport from a sense of weakness thought it incumbent on him to show off---and pursuant to that never ceased talking and boaring all day, till I was completely fagged out---Brown grew melancholy---but Hunt perceiving what a complimentary tendency all this had bore it remarkably well---Brown grumbled about it for two or three days---I went with Hunt to Sir John Leicester's gallery there I saw Northcote---Hilton---Bewick and many more of great and Little note. Haydons picture  692 is of very little progress this last year. He talks about finishing it next year---Wordsworth is going to publish a Poem called Peter Bell---what a perverse fellow it is! Why wilt he talk about Peter Bells---I was told not to tell---but to you it will not be tellings---Reynolds hearing that said Peter Bell was coming out, took it into his head to write a skit upon it call'd Peter Bell. He did it as soon as thought on it is to be published this morning, and comes out before the real Peter Bell, with this admirable motto from the "Bold stroke for a Wife'  693 "I am the real Simon Pure" It would be just as well to trounce Lord Byron in the same manner. I am still at a stand in versifying---I cannot do it yet with any pleasure---I mean however to look round at my resources and means---and see what I can do without poetry---To that end I shall live in Westminster---I have no doubt of making by some means a little to help on or I shall be left in the Lurch---with the burden of a little Pride---However I look in time--- The Dilkes like their lodging in Westminster tolerably well. I cannot help thinking what a shame it is that poor Dilke should give up his comfortable house & garden for his Son, whom he will certainly ruin with too much care--- The boy has nothing in his ears all day but himself and the importance of his education. Dilke has continually in his mouth "My Boy" This is what spoils princes: it may have the same effect with Commoners. Mrs Dilke has been very well lately---But what a shameful thing it is that for that obstinate Boy Dilke should stifle himself in Town Lodgings and wear out his Life by his continual apprehension of his Boys fate in Westminsterschool with the rest of the Boys and the Masters. Every one has some wear and tear--- One would think Dilke ought to be quiet and happy---but no---this one Boy makes his face pale, his society silent and his vigilance jealous---He would I have no doubt quarrel with any one who snubb'd his Boy---With all this he has no notion how to manage him. O what a farce is our greatest cares! Yet one must be in the pother for the sake of Clothes food and Lodging. There has been a squabble between Kean and Mr Bucke---There are faults on both sides---on Bucks the faults are positive to the Question: Keans fault is a want of genteel knowledge and high Policy---The formor writes knavishly foolish and the other silly bombast. It was about a Tragedy written by said Mr Bucke; which it appears Mr Kean kick'd at---is  for it  was so bad---After a little struggle of Mr Bucke's against Kean drury Lane had the policy to bring it on and Kean the impolicy not to appear in it---It was damn'd---The people in the Pit had a favourite call on the night of "Buck Buck rise up" and "Buck Buck how many horns do I hold up.  694 Kotzebue the German Dramatist and traitor to his country was murdered lately by a young student whose name I forget  695 \---he stabbed himself immediately after crying out Germany! Germany! I was unfortunate to miss Richards the only time I have been for many months to see him. Shall I treat you with a little extempore. When they were come unto the Faery's Court They rang---no one at home---all gone to sport And dance and kiss and love as faerys do For Faeries be as humans lovers true--- Amid the woods they were so lone and wild Where even the Robin feels himself exild And where the very brooks as if affraid Hurry along to some less magic shade. 'No one at home'! the fretful princess cry'd 'And all for nothing such a dreary ride And all for nothing my new diamond cross No one to see my persian feathers toss No one to see my Ape my Dwarf, my Fool Or how I pace my otahaietan mule--- Ape, Dwarf and Fool why stand you gaping there Burst the door open, quick---or I declare, I'll switch you soundly and in pieces tear.' The Dwarf began to tremble and the Ape Star'd at the Fool, the Fool was all agape The Princess grasp'd her switch but just in time The dwarf with piteous face began to rhyme. 'O mighty Princess did you never hear tell What your poor servants know but too too well Know you the three great crimes in faery land The first alas! poor Dwarf I understand I made a whipstock of a faery's wand The next is snoring in their company The next, the last the direst of the three Is making free when they are not at home I was a Prince---a baby prince---my doom You see, I made a whipstock of a wand My top has henceforth slept in faery land. He was a Prince, the Fool a grown up Prince But he has never been a King's son since He fell a snoring at a faery Ball--- Your poor Ape was a Prince, and he poor thing Picklock'd a faery's boudour---now no king But ape---so pray your highness stay awhile 'Tis sooth indeed We know it to our sorrow--- Persist and you may be an ape tomorrow--- While the Dwarf spake the Princess all for spite Peal'd the brown hazel twig to lilly white Clench'd her small teeth, and held her lips apart Try'd to look unconcern'd with beating heart They saw her highness had made up her mind quavering like the reeds before the wind--- And they had had it, but O happy chance The Ape for very fear began to dance And grin'd as all his ugliness did ache--- She staid her vixen fingers for his sake, He was so very ugly: then she took Her pocket mirror and began to look First at herself and then at him and then She smil'd at her own beauteous face again. Yet for all this---for all her pretty face--- She took it in her head to see the place Women gain little from experience Either in Lovers husbands or expence The more the beauty, the more fortune too. Beauty before the wide world never knew So each Fair reasons---tho' it oft miscarries. She thought her pretty face would please the fa eries 'My darling Ape I wont whip you today Give me the Picklock sirrah and go play'--- They all three wept---but counsel was as vain As crying cup biddy to drops of rain. Yet lingeringly did the sad Ape forth draw The Picklock from the Pocket in his Jaw. The Princess took it and dismounting straight Trip'd in blue silver'd slippers to the gate And touch'd the wards, the Door opes full courteously Opened---she enter'd with her servants three Again it clos'd and there was nothing seen But the Mule grasing on the herbage green. End of Canto xii The Mule no sooner saw himself alone Than he prickd up his Ears---and said well done At least unhappy Prince I may be free--- No more a Princess shall side saddle me O King of Othaiete\---tho a Mule 'Aye every inch a King'  696 \---tho---'Fortune's fool'  697 Well done---for by what Mr Dwarfy said I would not give a sixpence for her head' Even as he spake he trotted in high glee To the knotty side of an old Pollard tree And rub'd his sides against the mossed bark Till his Girths burst and left him naked stark Except his Bridle---how get rid of that Buckled and tied with many a twist and plait At last it struck him to pretend to sleep And then the thievish Monkies down would creep And filch the unpleasant trammels quite away No sooner thought of than adown he lay Sham'd a good snore---the Monkey-men descended And whom they thought to injure they befriended. They hung his Bridle on a topmost bough And off he went run, trot, or any how--- Brown is gone to bed---and I am tired of rhyming---there is a north wind blowing playing young gooseberry with the trees---I don't care so it helps even with a side wind a Letter to me---for I cannot put faith in any reports I hear of the Settlement some are good some bad---Last Sunday I took a Walk towards highgate and in the lane that winds by the side of Lord Mansfield's park I met Mr Green our Demonstrator at Guy's in conversation with Coleridge--- I joined them, after enquiring by a look whether it would be agreeable---I walked with him at his alderman-after-dinner pace for near two miles I suppose. In those two Miles he broached a thousand things---let me see if I can give you a list---Nightingales, Poetry---on Poetical Sensation--- Metaphysics---Different genera and species of Dreams---Nightmare---a dream accompanied with by a sense of touch---single and double touch---A dream related ---First and second consciousness---the difference explained between will and Volition---so many metaphysicians from a want of smoking the second consciousness---Monsters ---the Kraken---Mermaids---Southey believes in them ---Southey's belief too much diluted---A Ghost story--- Good morning---I heard his voice as he came towards me ---I heard it as he moved away---I had heard it all the interval---if it may be called so. He was civil enough to ask me to call on him at Highgate Good night!  698 It looks so much like rain I shall not go to town to day: but put it off till tomorrow---Brown this morning is writing some spenserian stanzas against Mrs Miss Brawne and me; so I shall amuse myself with him a little: in the manner of Spenser--- He is to weet a melancholy Carle Thin in the waist, with bushy head of hair As hath the seeded thistle when in parle It holds the Zephyr ere it sendeth fair Its light balloons into the summer air Therto his beard had not began to bloom No brush had touch'd his chin or razor sheer No care had touch'd his cheek with mortal doom But new he was and bright as scarf from persian loom. Ne cared he for wine, or half and half Ne cared he for fish or flesh or fowl And sauces held he worthless as the chaff He 'sdeign'd the swine heard at the wassail bowl Ne with lewd ribbalds sat he cheek by jowl Ne with sly Lemans in the scorner's chair But after water brooks this Pilgrim's soul Panted, and all his food was woodland air Though he would ofttimes feast on gilliflowers rare--- The slang of cities in no wise he knew Tipping the wink to him was he athen greek He sipp'd no olden Tom or ruin blue Or nantz or cheery brandy drank full meek By many a Damsel hoarse and rouge of cheek Nor did he know each aged Watchman's beat--- Nor in obscured perlieus would he seek For curled Jewesses  699 with ankles neat Who as they walk abroad make tinkling with their feet  700 \--- This character would ensure him a situation in the establishment of patient Griselda---The servant has come for the little Browns this morning---they have been a toothache to me which I shall enjoy the riddance of---Their little voices are like wasps stings---'Some times am I all wound with Browns'.  701 We had a claret feast some little while ago---There were Dilke, Reynolds, Skinner, Mancur, John Brown, Martin, Brown and I. We all got a little tipsy--- but pleasantly so---I enjoy Claret to a degree. I have been looking over the correspondence of the pretended Amena and Wells  702 this evening---I now see the whole cruel deception ---I think Wells must have had an accomplice in it--- Amena's Letters are in a Man's language, and in a Man's hand imitating a woman's---The instigations to this diabolical scheme were vanity, and the love of intrigue. It was no thoughtless hoax---but a cruel deception on a sanguine Temperament, with every show of friendship. I do not think death too bad for the villain--- The world will would look upon it in a different light should I expose it--- they would call it a frolic---so I must be wary---but I consider it my duty to be prudently revengeful. I will hang over his head like a sword by a hair. I will be opium to his vanity---if I cannot injure his interests---He is a rat and he shall have ratsbane to his vanity---I will harm him all I possibly can ---I have no doubt I shall be able to do so--- Let us leave him to his misery alone except when we can throw in a little more---The fifth canto of Dante pleases me more and more---it is that one in which he meets with Paulo and Franchesca---I had passed many days in rather a low state of mind, and in the midst of them I dreamt of being in that region of Hell. The dream was one of the most delightful enjoyments I ever had in my life---I floated about the whirling atmosphere as it is described with a beautiful figure to whose lips mine were joined at  for as  it seem'd for an age---and in the midst of all this cold and darkness I was warm---even flowery tree tops sprung up and we rested on them sometimes with the lightness of a cloud till the wind blew us away again---I tried a Sonnet upon it---there are fourteen lines but nothing of what I felt in it---O that I could dream it every night--- As Hermes once took to his feathers light When lulled Argus, baffled, swoon'd and slept So on a delphic reed my idle spright So play'd, so charm'd so conquer'd, so bereft The dragon world of all its hundred eyes And seeing it asleep so fled away:--- Not to pure Ida with its snow clad cold skies, Nor unto Tempe where Jove grieved that day, But to that second cricle of sad hell, Where in the gust, the whirlwind and the flaw Of Rain and hailstones lovers need not tell Their sorrows---Pale were the sweet lips I saw Pale were the lips I kiss'd and fair the form I floated with about that melancholy storm--- I want very very much a little of your wit my dear Sister ---a Letter or two of yours just to bandy back a pun or two across the Atlantic and send a quibble over the Floridas. Now you have by this time crumpled up your large Bonnet, what do you wear---a cap? do you put your hair in papers of a night? do you pay the Miss Birkbeck's a morning visit ---have you any tea? or to  for do  you milk and water with them---What place of Worship do you go to---the Quakers the Moravians, the Unitarians or the Methodists ---Are there any flowers in bloom you like--- any beautiful heaths---any Streets full of Corset Makers What sort of shoes have you to fit those pretty feet of yours? Do you desire Compts to one another? Do you ride on Horseback? what do you have for breakfast, dinner and supper? without mentioning lunch and bever  703 and wet and snack and a bit to stay one's Stomach---Do you get any Spirits--- now you might easily distill some whiskey---and going into the woods set up a whiskey spop  for shop  for the Monkeys. Do you and the miss Birkbecks get groggy on any thing--- a little so so ish so as to be obliged to be seen home with a Lantern---You may perhaps have a game at puss in the corner---Ladies are warranted to play at this game though they have not whiskers. Have you a fiddle in the Settlement ---or at any rate a jew's harp---which will play in spite of one's teeth---When you have nothing else to do for a whole day I tell you how you may employ it---First get up and when you are dress'd, as it would be pretty early with a high wind in the woods give George a cold Pig  704 with my Compliments. Then you may saunter into the nearest coffeehouse and after taking a dram and a look at the chronicle---go and frighten the wild boars upon the strength---you may as well bring one home for breakfast serving up the hoofs garnished with bristles and a grunt or two to accompany the singing of the Kettle--- then if George is not up give him a colder Pig always with my Compliments---When you are both set down to breakfast I advise you to eat your full share---but leave off immediately on feeling yourself inclined to anything on the other side of the puffy---avoid that for it does not become young women---After you have eaten your breakfast keep your eye upon dinner--- it is the safest way---You should keep a Hawk's eye over your dinner and keep hovering over it till due time then pounce taking care not to break any plates---While you are hovering with your dinner in prospect you may do a thousand things---put a hedgehog into Georges hat---pour a little water into his rifle---soak his boots in a pail of water---cut his jacket round into shreds like a roman kilt or the back of my grandmothers stays---Sow off his buttons Yesterday I could not write a line I was so fatigued for the day before I went to town in the morning called on your Mother, and returned in time for a few friends we had to dinner. There were Taylor Woodhouse, Reynolds ---we began cards at about 9 o'Clock, and the night coming on and continuing dark and rainy they could not think of returning to town---So we played at Cards till very daylight---and yesterday I was not worth a sixpence--- Your Mother was very well but anxious for a Letter. We had half an hours talk and no more for I was obliged to be home. Mrs and Miss Millar were well---and so was Miss Waldegrave---I have asked your Brothers here for next Sunday---When Reynolds was here on Monday---he asked me to give Hunt a hint to take notice of his Peter Bell  705 in the Examiner---the best thing I can do is to write a little notice of it myself which I will do here and copy it out if it should suit my Purpose--- Peter Bell There have been lately advertized two Books bothe Peter Bell by name; what stuff the one was made of might be seen by the motto 'I am the real Simon Pure". This false florimel  706 has hurried from the press and obtruded herself into public notice while for ought we know the real one may be still wandering about the woods and mountains. Let us hope she may soon appear and make good her right to the magic girdle. The Pamphleteering Archimage we can perceive has rather a splenetic love than a downright hatred to real florimels---if indeed they had been so christened---or had even a pretention to play at bob cherry with Barbara Lewthwaite: but the he has a fixed aversion to those three rhyming Graces Alice Fell, Susan Gale and Betty Foy; and now at length especially to Peter Bell---fit Apollo. It may be seen from one or two Passages of in this little Skit, that the writer of it has felt the finer parts of Mr Wordsworths , and perhaps expatiated with his more remote and sublimer muse; This as far as it relates to Peter Bell is unlucky. The more he may love the sad embroidery of the Excursion; the more he will hate the coarse Samplers of Betty Foy and Alice Fell; and as they come from the same hand, the better will be able to imitate that which can be imitated---to wit Peter Bell---as far as can be imagined from the obstinate Name---We repeat, it is very unlucky---this real Simon Pure is in parts the very Man--- there is a pernicious likeness in the scenery a 'pestilent humour' in the rhymes and an inveterate cadence in some of the Stanzas that must be lamented. If we are one part amused at this we are three parts sorry that an appreciator of Wordsworth should show so much temper at this really provoking name of Peter Bell---! This will do well enough---I have coppied it and enclosed it to Hunt. You will call it a little politic--- seeing I keep clear of all parties. I say something for and against both parties ---and suit it to the tune of the examiner---I mean to say I do not unsuit it---and I believe I think what I say nay I am sure I do---I and my conscience are in luck to day--- which is an excellent thing---The other night I went to the Play with Rice, Reynolds and Martin---we saw a new dull and half damn'd Opera  707 call'd 'the heart of Mid Lothian' that was on Saturday---I stopt at Taylors on Sunday with Woodhouse---and passed a quiet Sort of pleasant day. I have been very much pleased with the Panorama of the Ships at the north Pole  708 \---with the icebergs, the Mountains, the Bears the Walrus---the seals the Penguins---and a large whale floating back above water---it is impossible to describe the place---Wednesday Evening--- La belle dame sans merci--- O what can ail thee Knight at arms Alone and palely loitering? The sedge has withered from the Lake And no birds sing! O what can ail thee Knight at arms So haggard, and so woe begone? The Squirrel's granary is full And the harvest's done. I see a lilly on thy brow With anguish moist and fever dew, And on thy cheeks a fading rose [Fast] Withereth too--- I met a Lady in the Meads Full beautiful, a faery's child Her hair was long, her foot was light And her eyes were wild--- I made a Garland for her head, And bracelets too, and fragrant Zone She look'd at me as she did love And made sweet moan--- I set her on my pacing steed--- And nothing else saw all day long For sidelong would she bend and sing A faerys song--- She found me roots of relish sweet And honey wild and manna dew And sure in language strange she said I love thee true--- She took me to her elfin grot And there she wept and sigh'd full sore, And there I shut her wild wild eyes With Kisses four. And there she lulled me asleep And there I dream'd Ah Woe betide! The latest dream I ever dreamt On the cold hill side I saw pale Kings and Princes too Pale warriors death pale were they all They cried La belle dame sans merci Thee hath in thrall. I saw their starv'd lips in the gloam With horrid warning/gaped wide agape And I awoke, and found me here On the cold hill's side And this is why  709 I sojourn here Alone and palely loitering; Though the sedge is wither'd frome the Lake And no birds sing--- ... Why four Kisses---you will say---why four because I wish to restrain the headlong impetuosity of my Muse---she would have fain said 'score' without hurting the rhyme--- but we must temper the Imagination as the Critics say with Judgment. I was obliged to choose an even number that both eyes might have fair play: and to speak truly I think two a piece quite sufficient. Suppose I had said seven; there would have been three and a half a piece---a very awkward affair---and well got out of on my side--- Chorus of Faeries 4 Fire, air, earth and water--- Salamander, Zephyr, Dusketha Breama--- Happy happy glowing fire! Fragrant air, delicious light! Let me to my glooms retire I to my greenweed rivers bright. Happy, happy glowing fire Dazzling bowers of soft retire! Ever let my nourish'd wing Like a bat's still wandering Faintless fan your fiery spaces Spirit sole in deadly places In unhaunted roar and blaze Open eyes that never daze Let me see the myriad shapes Of Men and Beasts and Fish and apes Portray'd in many a fiery den, And wrought by spumy bitumen On the deep intenser roof Arched every way aloof. Let me breathe upon my Skies And anger their live tapestries Free from cold and every care Of chilly rain and shivring air. Spright of fire---away away! Or your very roundelay Will sear my plumage newly budded From its quilled sheath all studded With the selfsame dews that fell On the Asphodel. Spright of fire away away! Spright of fire away away! Zephyr blue eyed faery turn And see my cool sedge shaded urn Where it rests its mossy brim Mid water mint and cresses dim Where And the flowers amid in sweet troubles Lift their eyes above the bubbles Like our Queen when she would please To sleep and Oberon will tease. Love me blue eyed Faery true Soothly I am sick for you.  710 Gentle Brema by the first Violet young nature nurst I will bathe myself with thee So you sometime follow me To my home far far in west Far beyond the search and quest Of the golden browed sun--- Come with me oer tops of trees To my fragrant Pallaces Where they ever-floating are Beneath the cherish of a star Call'd Vesper---who with silver veil Ever Hides his his brilliance pale Ever gently drows'd doth keep Twilight of the Fays to sleep Fear not that your watry hair Will thirst in drouthy ringlets there--- Clouds of stored summer rains Thou shalt taste before the stains Of the mountain soil they take And too unlucent for thee make I love thee chrystal faery true Sooth I am as sick for you Out ye agueish Faeries out! Chilly Lovers what a rout, Keep ye with your frozen breath Colder than the mortal death--- Adder-eyed Dusketha, speak Shall we leave these , and go seek In the Earths wide Entrails old Couches warm as theirs is cold O for a fiery gloom and thee Dusketha so enchantingly Freckel-wing'd and lizard-sided! By thee Spright will I be guided I lo care not for cold or heat Frost and and Flame or Sparks or sleet To my essence are the same--- But I honor more the flame--- Spright of fire I follow thee Wheresoever it may be, To the torrid spouts and fountains Underneath earth quaked mountains Or at thy supreme desire Touch the very pulse of fire With my bare unlidded eyes Sweet Dusketha: Paradise! Off ye icy Spirits---fly Frosty creatures of the Sky. Breathe upon them fiery Spright Zephyr Breama to each other Away Away to our delight Go feed on icicles while we Bedded in tongued flames will be Lead me to those fevrous glooms Spright of fire Me to the blooms Blue eyed Zephyr of those flowers Far in the west where the May cloud lours And the beams of still vesper, where winds are all wist Are shed through the rain and the milder mist And twilight your floating bowers--- I have been reading lately two very different books, Robertson's America and Voltaire's Siecle De Louis XIV. It is like walking arm and arm between Pizarro and the great-little Monarch. In How lementable a case do we see the great body of the people in both instances: in the first, where Men might seem to inherit quiet of Mind from unsophisticated senses; from uncontamination of civilisation; and especially from their being as it were estranged from the mutual helps of Society and its mutual injuries--- and thereby more immediately under the Protection of Providence---even there they had mortal pains to bear as bad; or even worse than Bailiffs, Debts and Poverties of civilised Life---The whole appears to resolve into this--- that Man is originally 'a poor forked creature'  711 subject to the same mischances as the beasts of the forest, destined to hardships and disquietude of some kind or other. If he improves by degrees his bodily accommodations and comforts ---at each stage, at each accent  for ascent  there are waiting for him a fresh set of annoyances---he is mortal and there is still a heaven with its Stars above his head. The most interesting question that can come before us is, How far by the persevering endeavours of a seldom appearing Socrates Mankind may be made happy---I can imagine such happiness carried to an extreme---but what must it end in?--- Death---and who could in such a case bear with death---the whole troubles of life which are now frittered away in a series of years, would then be accumulated for the last days of a being who instead of hailing its approach, would leave this world as Eve left Paradise--- But in truth I do not at all believe in this sort of perfectibility ---the nature of the world will not admit of it---the inhabitants of the world will correspond to itself. Let the fish Philosophise the ice away from the Rivers in winter time and they shall be at continual play in the tepid delight of Summer. Look at the Poles and at the Sands of Africa, Whirlpools and volcanoes---Let men exterminate them and I will say that they may arrive at earthly Happiness ---The point at which Man may arrive is as far as the parallel state in inanimate nature and no further---For instance suppose a rose to have sensation, it blooms on a beautiful morning it enjoys itself---but there comes a cold wind, a hot sun--- it cannot escape it, it cannot destroy its annoyances---they are as native to the world as itself: no more can man be happy in spite, the worldly elements will prey upon his nature---The common cognomen of this world among the misguided and superstitious is 'a vale of tears' from which we are to be redeemed by a certain arbitary interposition of God and taken to Heaven---What a little circumscribed straightened notion! Call the world if you Please "The vale of Soul-making". Then you will find out the use of the world (I am speaking now in the highest terms for human nature admitting it to be immortal which I will here take for granted for the purpose of showing a thought which has struck me concerning it) I say ' Soul making ' Soul as distinguished from an Intelligence ---There may be intelligences or sparks of the divinity in millions---but they are not Souls the till they acquire identities, till each one is personally itself. I ntelligences are atoms of perception---they know and they see and they are pure, in short they are God ---How then are Souls to be made? How then are these sparks which are God to have identity given them---so as ever to possess a bliss peculiar to each one's individual existence? How, but by the medium of a world like this? This point I sincerely wish to consider because I think it a grander system of salvation than the chrystiain religion---or rather it is a system of Spirit- creation---This is effected by three grand materials acting the one upon the other for a series of years. These three Materials are the Intelligence \---the human heart (as distinguished from intelligence or Mind) and the World or Elemental space suited for the proper action of Mind and Heart on each other for the purpose of forming the Soul or Intelligence destined to possess the sense of Identity . I can scarcely express what I but dimly perceive---and yet I think I perceive it---that you may judge the more clearly I will put it in the most homely form possible--- I will call the world a School instituted for the purpose of teaching little children to read---I will call the human heart the horn Book used in that School---and I will call the Child able to read, the Soul made from that School and its hornbook . Do you not see how necessary a World of Pains and troubles is to school an Intelligence and make it a Soul? A Place where the heart must feel and suffer in a thousand diverse ways! Not merely is the Heart a Hornbook, It is the Minds Bible, it is the Minds experience, it is the teat from which the Mind or intelligence sucks its identity. As various as the Lives of Men are---so various become their Souls, and thus does God make individual beings, Souls, Identical Souls of the Sparks of his own essence--- This appears to me a faint sketch of a system of Salvation which does not affront our reason and humanity ---I am convinced that many difficulties which christians labour under would vanish before it---there is one which even now Strikes me---the Salvation of Children---In them the Spark or intelligence returns to God without any identity ---it having had no time to learn of and be altered by the heart---or seat of the human Passions---It is pretty generally suspected that the chr istian scheme has been coppied from the ancient persian and greek Philosophers. Why may they not have made this simple thing even more simple for common apprehension by introducing Mediators and Personages in the same manner as in the heathen mythology abstractions are personified--- Seriously I think it probable that this System of Soul-making---may have been the Parent of all the more palpable and personal Schemes of Redemption, among the Zoroastrians the Christians and the Hindoos. For as one part of the human species must have their carved Jupiter; so another part must have the palpable and named Mediator  712 and Saviour, their Christ their  713 Oromanes and their Vishnu---If what I have said should not be plain enough, as I fear it may not be, I will but  for put  you in the place where I began in this series of thoughts---I mean, I began by seeing how man was formed by circumstances---and what are circumstances? ---but touchstones of his heart---? and what are touchstones? but proovings of his heart? and what are proovings of his heart but fortifiers or alterers of his nature? and what is his altered nature but his Soul?---and what was his Soul before it came into the world and had these provings and alterations and perfectionings?---An intelligence ---without Identity---and how is this Identity to be made? Through the medium of the Heart? And how is the heart to become this Medium but in a world of Circumstances? There now I think what with Poetry and Theology you may thank your Stars that my pen is not very long winded ---Yesterday I received two Letters from your Mother and Henry which I shall send by young Birkbeck with this--- Friday---April 30---Brown has been here rummaging up some of my old sins--- that is to say sonnets. I do not think you remember them, so I will copy them out as well as two or three lately written---I have just written one on Fame which Brown is transcribing and he has his book and mine. I must employ myself perhaps in a sonnet on the same subject--- You cannot eat your Cake and have it too Proverb.  714 How [fever'd]/ is that Man who cannot look Upon his mortal days with temperate blood Who vexes all the leaves of his Life's book And robs his fair name of its maidenhood It is as if the rose should pluck herself Or the ripe plum&bstrike; finger its misty bloom As if a clear Lake meddling with itself Should cloud its pureness with a muddy gloom But the rose leaves herself upon the Briar For winds to kiss and grateful Bees to feed And the ripe plumb still wears its dim attire The undisturbed Lake has crystal space Why then should man teasing the world for grace Spoil his salvation by a fierce miscreed Fame like a wayward girl will still be coy To those who woo her with too slavish knees But makes surrender to some thoughtless boy And dotes the more upon a heart at ease--- She is a Gipsey will not speak to those Who have not learnt to be content without her A Jilt whose ear was never whisper'd close Who think they scandal her who talk about her--- A very Gipsey is she Nilus born, Sister in law to jealous Potiphar: Ye lovesick Bards, repay her scorn for scorn--- Ye lovelorn Artists madmen that ye are, Make your best bow to her and bid adieu Then if she likes it she will follow you. O soft embalmer of the still midnight Shutting with careful fingers and benign Our gloom-pleas'd eyes embowered from the light, Enshaded in forgetfulness divine--- O soothest sleep, if so it please thee close In midst of this thine hymn my willing eyes, Or wait the amen, ere thy poppy throws Around my bed its dewy Charities--- Then save me or the passed day will shine Upon my pillow breeding many woes; Save me from curious conscience that still lords Its strength for darkness, borrowing like the a Mole--- Turn the key deftly in the oiled wards And seal the hushed Casket of my soul.  The following Poem---the last I have written is the first and the only one with which I have taken even moderate pains. I have for the most part dash'd off my lines in a hurry. This I have done leisurely---I think it reads the more richly for it and will I hope encorage me to write other things in even a more peace able and healthy spirit. You must recollect that Psyche was not embodied as a goddess before the time of Apulieus the Platonist who lived after the Augustan age, and consequently the Goddess was never worshipped or sacrificed to with any of the ancient fervour---and perhaps never thought of in the old religion---I am more orthodox that  for than  to let a heathen Goddess be so neglected--- O Goddess hear these tuneless numbers, wrung By sweet enforcement and remembrance dear, And pardon that thy secrets should be sung Even to into thine own soft-chonched ear! Surely I dreamt today; or did I see The winged Psyche, with awaked eyes? I wander'd in a forest thoughtlessly, And on the sudden, fainting with surprise, Saw two fair Creatures couched side by side In deepest grass beneath the whisp'ring fan Of leaves and trembled blossoms, where there ran A Brooklet scarce espied 'Mid hush'd, cool-rooted flowers, fragrant eyed, Blue, freckle-pink, and budded Syrian They lay, calm-breathing on the bedded grass: Their arms embraced and their pinions too; Their lips touch'd not, but had not bid adieu, As if disjoined by soft-handed slumber, And ready still past kisses to outnumber, At tender eye dawn of aurorian love. The winged boy I knew: But who wast thou O happy happy dove? His Psyche true? O lastest born, and loveliest vision far Of all Olympus faded Hierarchy! Fairer than Phoebe's sapphire-region'd star, Or Vesper amorous glow worm of the sky; Fairer than these though Temple thou hadst none, Nor Altar heap'd with flowers; Nor virgin choir to make delicious moan Upon the midnight hours; No voice, no lute, no pipe no incense sweet From chain-swung Censer teeming No shrine, no grove, no Oracle, no heat Of pale-mouth'd Prophet dreaming! O Bloomiest! though too late for antique vows; Too, too late for the fond believing Lyre, When holy were the haunted forest boughs, Holy the Air, the water and the fire: Yet even in these days so far retir'd From happy Pieties, thy lucent fans, Fluttering among the faint Olympians, I see, and sing by my own eyes inspired. O let me be thy Choir and make a moan Upon the midnight hours; Thy voice, thy lute, thy pipe, thy incense sweet From swinged Censer teeming; Thy Shrine, thy Grove, thy Oracle, thy heat Of pale-mouth'd Prophet dreaming! Yes I will be thy Priest and build a fane In some untrodden region of my Mind, Where branched thoughts new grown with pleasant pain, Instead of pines shall murmur in the wind. Far, far around shall those dark cluster'd trees Fledge the wild-ridged mountains steep by steep, And there by Zephyrs' streams and birds and bees The moss-lain Dryads shall be charmd lull'd to sleep. And in the midst of this wide-quietness A rosy Sanctuary will I dress With the wreath'd trellis of a working brain; With buds and bells and stars without a mane;  716 With all the gardener fancy e'er could frame feign Who breeding flowers will never breed the same--- And there shall be for thee all soft delight That shadowy thought can win; A bright torch, and a casement ope at night To let the warm Love in. Here endethe ye Ode to Psyche.  Incipit altera Sonneta.  I have been endeavouring to discover a better Sonnet Stanza than we have. The legitimate does not suit the language over-well from the pouncing rhymes---the other kind appears too elegiac  717 \---and the couplet at the end of it has seldom a pleasing effect---I do not pretend to have succeeded---it will explain itself--- If by dull rhymes our English must be chaind And, like Andromeda, the Sonnet sweet, Fetterd, in spite of pained Loveliness; Let us find out, if we must be constrain'd,  718 Sandals more interwoven and complete To fit the naked foot of poesy; Let us inspect the Lyre, and weigh the stress Of every chord, and see what may be gain'd By ear industrious, and attention meet; Misers of sound and syllable, no less Than Midas of his coinage, let us be Jealous of dead leaves in the bay wreath crown, So, if we may not let the muse be free, She will be bound with Garlands of her own. This is the third of May, and everything is in delightful forwardness; the violets are not withered before the peeping of the first rose. You must let me know everything--- how parcels go and come---what papers you have, and what newspapers you want, and other things. God bless you, my dear brother and sister, Your ever affectionate brother, John Keats. Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbey Esqre  Walthamstow. Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 13 MY 1819. My dear Fanny, I have a Letter from George at last---and it contains, considering all things, good news---I have been with it to day to Mrs Wylie's, with whom I have left it. I shall have it again as soon as possible and then I will walk over and read it to you. They are quite well and settled tolerably in comfort after a great deal of fatigue and harrass. They had the good chance to meet at Louisville with a School-fellow of ours. You may expect me within three days. I am writing to night several notes concerning this to many of my friends.  719 Good night! god bless you. John Keats--- Address : Mr Wm Haslam  Frampton & Co.  Leadenhall Street. Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 13 MY 1819. 12 o'Clock Nn. 720 My dear Haslam, We have news at last---and tolerably good too all considered ---they have not gone to the Settlement---they are both in good Health. I read the letter to Mrs Wylie to day and requested her after her Sons had read it---they would enclose it to you immediately which was faithfully promised. Send it me like Lightning that I may take it to Walthamstow. Yours ever and Amen John Keats Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbey Esqre  Walthamstow Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 26 MY 1819. 721 My dear Fanny, I have been looking for a fine day to pass at Walthamstow: there has not been one Morning (except Sunday and then I was obliged to stay at home) that I could depend upon. I have I am sorry to say had an accident with the Letter---I sent it to Haslam and he returned it torn into a thousand pieces. So I shall be obliged to tell you all I can remember from Memory. You would have heard from me before this, but that I was in continual expectation of a fine Morning---I want also to speak to you concerning myself. Mind I do not purpose to quit England, as George has done; but I am affraid I shall be forced to take a voyage or two. However we will not think of that for some Months---Should it be a fine morning tomorrow you will see me. Your affectionate Brother John--- Address : Miss Jeffry  Teignmouth  Devon. Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 31 MY 1819 C. Brown Esqre's Wentworth Place---Hampstead--- My dear Lady, I was making a day or two ago a general conflagration of all old Letters and Memorandums, which had become of no interest to me---I made however, like the Barberinquisitor in Don Quixote some reservations---among the rest your and your Sister's Letters. I assure you you had not entirely vanished from my Mind, or even become shadows in my remembrance: it only needed such a memento as your Letters to bring you back to me. Why have I not written before? Why did I not answer your Honiton Letter? I had no good news for you---every concern of ours, (ours I wish I could say) and still I must say ours \---though George is in America and I have no Brother left. Though in the midst of my troubles I had no relation except my young Sister---I have had excellent friends. Mr B. at whose house I now am, invited me,---I have been with him ever since. I could not make up my mind to let you know these things. Nor should I now---but see what a little interest will do---I want you to do me a Favor; which I will first ask and then tell you the reasons. Enquire in the Villages round Teignmouth if there is any Lodging commodious for its cheapness; and let me know where it is and what price. I have the choice as it were of two Poisons (yet I ought not to call this a Poison) the one is voyaging to and from India for a few years;  722 the other is leading a fevrous life alone with Poetry---This latter will suit me best; for I cannot resolve to give up my Studies. It strikes me it would not be quite so proper for you to make such inquiries ---so give my love to your Mother and ask her to do it. Yes, I would rather conquer my indolence and strain my nerves at some grand Poem---than be in a dunderheaded indiaman---Pray let no one in Teignmouth know any thing of this. Fanny must by this time have altered her name---perhaps you have also---are you all alive? Give my Compts to Mrs---your Sister. I have had good news, (tho' 'tis a queerish world in which such things are call'd good) from George ---he and his wife are well. I will tell you more soon---Especially dont let the Newfoundland fisherman know it---and especially no one else. I have been always till now almost as careless of the world as a fly---my troubles were all of the Imagination--- My Brother George always stood between me and any dealings with the world. Now I find I must buffet it--- I must take my stand upon some vantage ground and begin to fight---I must choose between despair & Energy---I choose the latter---though the world has taken on a quakerish look with me, which I once thought was impossible--- 'Nothing can bring back the hour Of splendour in the grass and glory in the flower.'  723 I once thought this a Melancholist's dream--- But why do I speak to you in this manner? No believe me I do not write for a mere selfish purpose---the manner in which I have written of myself will convince you. I do not do so to Strangers. I have not quite made up my mind. Write me on the receipt of this---and again at your Leisure; between whiles you shall hear from me again--- Your sincere friend John Keats Address : Miss Jeffrey  Teignmouth. Postmark : 9 JU 1819. Wentworth Place. My Dear young Lady, I am exceedingly obliged by your two letters---Why I did not answer your first immediately was that I have had a little aversion to the South of Devon from the continual remembrance of my Brother Tom. On that account I do not return to my old Lodgings in Hampstead though the people of the house have become friends of mine--- This however I could think nothing of, it can do no more than keep one's thoughts employed for a day or two. I like your description of Bradley very much and I dare say shall be there in the course of the summer; it would be immediately but that a friend  724 ; with ill health and to whom I am greatly attached call'd on me yesterday and proposed my spending a Month with him at the back of the Isle of Wight. This is just the thing at present---the morrow will take care of itself---I do not like the name of Bishop's Teigntown  725 \---I hope the road from Teignmouth to Bradley does not lie that way---Your advice about the Indiaman is a very wise advice, because it justs suits me, though you are a little in the wrong concerning its destroying the energies of Mind: on the contrary it would be the finest thing in the world to strengthen them---To be thrown among people who care not for you, with whom you have no sympathies forces the Mind upon its own resources, and leaves it free to make its speculations of the differences of human character and to class them with the calmness of a Botanist. An Indiaman is a little world. One of the great reasons that the English have produced the finest writers in the world is, that the English world has illtreated them during their lives and foster'd them after their deaths. They have in general been trampled aside into the bye paths of life and seen the festerings of Society. They have not been treated like the Raphaels of Italy. And where is the Englishman and Poet who has given a magnificient Entertainment at the christening of one of his Hero's Horses as Boyardo did? He had a Castle in the Appenine. He was a noble Poet of Romance; not a miserable and mighty Poet of the human Heart.  726 The middle age of Shakespeare was all clouded over; his days were not more happy than Hamlet's who is perhaps more like Shakspeare himself in his common every day Life than any other of his Characters---Ben Johnson was a common Soldier and in the Low countries, in the face of two armies, fought a single combat with a french Trooper and slew him---For all this I will not go on board an Indiaman, nor for example's sake run my head into dark alleys: I dare say my discipline is to come, and plenty of it too. I have been very idle lately, very averse to writing; both from the overpowering idea of our dead poets and from abatement of my love of fame. I hope I am a little more of a Philosopher than I was, consequently a little less of a versifying Pet-lamb. 727 I have put no more in Print or you should have had it. you will judge of my 1819 temper when I tell you that the thing I have most enjoyed this year has been writing an ode to Indolence. Why did you not make your long-haired sister put her great brown hard fist to paper and cross your Letter? Tell her when you write again that I expect chequer-work---My friend Mr Brown is sitting opposite me employed in writing a Life of David.  728 He reads me passages as he writes them stuffing my infidel mouth as though I were a young rook---Infidel Rooks do not provender with Elisha's Ravens. If he goes on as he has begun your new Church had better not proceed, for parsons will be superseeded---and of course the Clerks must follow. Give my love to your Mother with the assurance that I can never forget her anxiety for my Brother Tom. Believe also that I shall ever remember our leave-taking with you. Ever sincerely yours John Keats. Address : Miss Keats  R. Abbey's Esqre  Walthamstow Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 9 JU 1819. Wentworth Place. My dear Fanny, I shall be with you next monday at the farthest. I could not keep my promise of seeing you again in a week because I am in so unsettled a state of mind about what I am to do. I have given up the Idea of the Indiaman; I cannot resolve to give up my favorite Studies: so I purpose to retire into the Country and set my Mind at work once more. A Friend of Mine who has an ill state of health called on me yesterday and proposed to spend a little time with him at the back of the Isle of Wight where he said we might live very cheaply. I agreed to his proposal. I have taken a great dislike to Town I never go there--- some one is always calling one  for on  me and as we have spare beds they often stop a couple of days. I have written lately to some Acquaintances in Devonshire concerning a cheap Lodging and they have been very kind in letting me know all I wanted.  729 . They have described a pleasant place which I think I shall eventually retire to. How came you on With my young Master Yorkshire Man? Did not Mrs A. sport her Carriage and one? They really surprised me with super civility---how did Mrs A. manage it? How is the old tadpole gardener and little Master next door? it is to be hop'd they will both die some of these days. Not having been to Town I have not heard whether Mr A. purposes to retire from business. Do let me know if you have heard any thing more about it. Ifhe should not I shall be very disappointed. If any one deserves to be put to his shifts it is that Hodgkinson. As for the other he would live a long time upon his fat and be none the worse for a good long lent. How came milidi to give one Lisbon wine ---had she drained the Gooseberry? Truly I cannot delay making another visit ---asked to take Lunch, whether I will have ale, wine take su r gar,--- objection to green---like cream---thin bread and butter---another cup--- agreeable---enough sugar---little more cream---too weak--- 12 shillin & &c &c lord I must come again We are just going to Dinner.

I have asked for it repeatedly ever since I promised Mr Haydon and could not help the delay; which I regret. The verses can be struck out in no time, and will I hope be quite in time.

Tomorrow I am engaged---but the day after you shall see me. Mr Brown is waiting for me as we are going to Town together, so good bye. Your affectionate Brother John Address : Miss Keats  R. Abbey Esqre  Walthamstow Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and JU 18 1819 733 Wentworth Place My dear Fanny, Still I cannot afford to spend money by Coachire and still my throat is not well enough to warrant my walking. I went yesterday to ask Mr Abbey for some money; but I could not on account of a Letter he showed me from my Aunt's Solicitor---You do not understand the business--- I trust it will not in the end be detrimental to you. I am going to try the Press onece more and to that end shall retire to live cheaply in the country and compose myself and verses as well as I can. I have very good friends ready to help me---and I am the more bound to be careful of the money they lend me. It will all be well in the course of a year I hope. I am confident of it, so do not let it trouble you at all. Mr Abbey showed me a Letter he had received from George containing the news of the birth of a Niece for us---and all doing well---he said he would take it to you---so I suppose to day you will see it. I was preparing to enquire for a Situation with an Apothecary, put  for but  Mr Brown persuades me to try the press once more; so I will with all my industry and ability. Mr Rice a friend of mine in ill health has proposed retiring to the back of the isle of wight---which I hope will be cheap in the summer---I am sure it will in the winter. Thence you shall frequently hear from me and in the Letters I will coppy those lines I may write which will be most pleasing to you in the confidence you will show them to no one. I have not run quite aground yet I hope, having written this morning to several people to whom I have lent money, requesting repayment. I shall hencefore shake off my indolent fits, and among other reformation be more diligent in writing to you and mind you always answer me. I shall be obliged to go out of town on Saturday  734 and shall have no money till tomorrow, so I am very sorry to think I shall not be able to come to Walthamstow. The Head Mr Severn did of me is now too dear but here inclosed is a very capital Profile done by Mr Brown.  735 I will write again on Monday or Tuesday--- Mr and Mrs Dilke are well. Your affectionate Brother John--- Address : B. R. Haydon Esqre  Lisson grove north  Paddington Imperfect postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 17 JU. 736 Thursday Morning Wentworth Place My dear Haydon, I know you will not be quite prepared for this, because your Pocket must needs be very low having been at ebb tide so long: but what can I do? mine is lower. I was the day before yesterday much in want of Money: but some news I had yesterday has driven me into necessity. I went to Abbey's for some Cash, and he put into my hand a Letter from my Aunt's Solicitor containing the pleasant information that she was about to file a Bill in Chancery against us. Now in case of a defeat Abbey will be very undeservedly in the wrong box; so I could not ask him for any more money, nor can I till the affair is decided; and if it goes against him I must in conscience make over to him what little he may have remaining. My purpose is now to make one more attempt in the Press---if that fail, 'ye hear no more of me' as Chaucer says  737 \---Brown has lent me some money for the present. Do borrow or beg some how what you can for me. Do not suppose I am at all uncomfortable about the matter in any other way than as it forces me to apply to the needy. I could not send you those lines, for I could not get the only copy of them before last Saturday evening. I sent them Mr Elmes on Monday. I saw Monkhouse on sunday--- he told me you were getting on with the Picture. I would have come over to you to day, but I am fully employed--- Your's ever sincerely John Keats--- Address : Miss Brawne  Wentworth Place  Hampstead  Middx. Postmarks : NEWPORT and 3 JY 1819 Shanklin, Isle of Wight, Thursday. My dearest Lady, I am glad I had not an opportunity of sending off a Letter which I wrote for you on Tuesday night---'twas too much like one out of Rousseau's Heloise. 738 I am more reasonable this morning. The morning is the only proper time for me to write to a beautiful Girl whom I love so much: for at night, when the lonely day has closed, and the lonely, silent, unmusical Chamber is waiting to receive me as into a Sepulchre, then believe me my passion gets entirely the sway, then I would not have you see those Rhapsodies which I once thought it impossible I should ever give way to, and which I have often laughed at in another, for fear you should think me 739 either too unhappy or perhaps a little mad. I am now at a very pleasant Cottage window, looking onto a beautiful hilly country, with a glimpse of the sea; the morning is very fine. I do not know how elastic my spirit might be, what pleasure I might have in living here and breathing and wandering as free as a stag about this beautiful Coast if the remembrance of you did not weigh so upon me. I have never known any unalloy'd Happiness for many days together: the death or sickness of some one  740 . has always spoilt my hours---and now when none such troubles oppress me, it is you must confess very hard that another sort of pain should haunt me. Ask yourself my love whether you are not very cruel to have so entrammelled me, so destroyed my freedom. Will you confess this in the Letter you must write immediately and do all you can to console me in it ---make it rich as a draught of poppies to intoxicate me--- write the softest words and kiss them that I may at least touch my lips where yours have been. For myself I know not how to express my devotion to so fair a form: I want a brighter word than bright, a fairer word than fair. I almost wish we were butterflies and liv'd but three summer days---three such days with you I could fill with more delight than fifty common years could ever contain. But however selfish I may feel, I am sure I could never act selfishly: as I told you a day or two before I left Hampstead, I will never return to London if my Fate does not turn up Pam  741 or at least a Court-card. Though I could centre my Happiness in you, I cannot expect to engross your heart so entirely---indeed if I thought you felt as much for me as I do for you at this moment I do not think I could restrain myself from seeing you again tomorrow for the delight of one embrace. But no ---I must live upon hope and Chance. In case of the worst that can happen, I shall still love you---but what hatred shall I have for another! Some lines I read the other day are continually ringing a peal in my cars: To see those eyes I prize above mine own Dart favors on another--- And those sweet lips (yielding immortal nectar) Be gently press'd by any but myself--- Think, think Francesca, what a cursed thing It were beyond expression!  742 J. Do write immediately. There is no Post from this Place, so you must address Post Office, Newport, Isle of Wight. I know before night I shall curse myself for having sent you so cold a Letter; yet it is better to do it as much in my senses as possible. Be as kind as the distance will permit to your J. Keats. Present my Compliments to your mother, my love to Margaret and best remembrances to your Brother---if you please so.  743 Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbey Esqre  Walthamstow  near London. Postmarks : NEWPORT and JY 8 1819. Shanklin Isle of Wight Tuesday July 6th My dear Fanny, I have just received another Letter from George---full of as good news as we can expect. I cannot inclose it to you as I could wish, because it contains matters of Business to which I must for a Week to come have an immediate reference. I think I told you the purpose for which I retired to this place---to try the fortune of my Pen once more, and indeed I have some confidence in my success: but in every event, believe me my dear sister, I shall be sufficiently comfortable, as, if I cannot lead that life of competence and society I should wish, I have enough knowledge of my gallipots  744 to ensure me an employment & maintainance. The Place I am in now I visited once before  745 and a very pretty place it is were it not for the bad Weather. Our window looks over house tops and Cliffs onto the Sea, so that when the Ships sail past the Cottage chimneys you may take them for Weathercocks. We have Hill and Dale forest and Mead and plenty of Lobsters. I was on the Portsmouth Coach the Sunday before last in that heavy shower---and I may say I went to Portsmouth by water--- I got a little cold and as it always flies to my throat I am a little out of sorts that way---There were on the Coach with me some common french people, but very well behaved--- there was a woman amongst them to whom the poor Men in ragged coats were more gallant than ever I saw gentleman to Lady at a Ball. When we got down to walk up hill---one of them pick'd a rose, and on remounting gave it to the woman with 'Ma'mselle---voila une bellerose!' I am so hard at work that perhaps I should not have written to you for a day or two if Georges Letter had not diverted my attention to the interests and pleasure of those I love---and ever believe that when I do not behave punctually it is from a very necessary occupation, and that my silence is no proof of my not thinking of you, or that I want more than a gentle philip to bring your image with every claim before me. You have never seen mountains, or I might tell you that the hill at Steephill is I think almost of as much consequence as Mount Rydal on Lake Winander. Bonchurch too is a very delightful Place---as I can see by the Cottages all romantic---covered with creepers and honeysickles with roses and eglantines peeping in at the windows. Fit abodes for the People I guess live in them, romantic old maids fond of novels or soldiers widows with a pretty jointure---or any body's windows or aunts or anythings given to Poetry and a Piano forte---as far as in 'cm lies---as people say. If I could play upon the Guitar I might make my fortune with an old song---and get two blessings at once---a Lady's heart and the Rheumatism. But I am almost affraid to peep at those little windows---for a pretty window should show a pretty face, and as the world goes chances are against me. I am living with a very good fellow indeed, a Mr Rice. He is unfortunately labouring under a complaint which has for some years been a burthen to him. This is a pain to me. He has a greater tact in speaking to people of the village than I have, and in those matters is a great amusement as well as a good friend to me. He bought a ham the other day for saysr he 'Keats, I don't think a Ham is a wrong thing to have in a house.' Write to me, Shanklin Isle of Wight, as soon as you can; for a Letter is a great treat to me here---believing me ever Your affectionate Brother, John--- Address : Miss Brawne  Wentworth Place  Hampstead  Middx Postmarks : NEWPORT and 10 JY 1819. July 8th My sweet Girl, Your Letter gave me more delight, than any thing in the world but yourself could do; indeed I am almost astonished that any absent one should have that luxurious power over my senses which I feel. Even when I am not thinking of you I receive your influence and a tenderer nature steeling upon me. All my thoughts, my unhappiest days and nights have I find not at all cured me of my love of Beauty, but made it so intense that I am miserable that you are not with me: or rather breathe in that dull sort of patience that cannot be called Life. I never knew before, what such a love as you have made me feel, was; I did not believe in it; my Fancy was affraid of it, lest it should burn me up. But if you will fully love me, though there may be some fire, 'twill not be more than we can bear when moistened and bedewed with Pleasures. You mention 'horrid people' and ask me whether it depend upon them, whether I see you again. Do understand me, my love, in this. I have so much of you in my heart that I must turn Mentor when I see a chance of harm beffaling you. I would never see any thing but Pleasure in your eyes, love on your lips, and Happiness in your steps. I would wish to see you among those amusements suitable to your inclinations and spirits; so that our loves might be a delight in the midst of Pleasures agreeable enough, rather than a resource from vexations and cares. But I doubt much, in case of the worst, whether I shall be philosopher enough to follow my own Lessons: if I saw my resolution give you a pain I could not. Why may I not speak of your Beauty, since without that I could never have lov'd you. I cannot conceive any beginning of such love as I have for you but Beauty. There may be a sort of love for which, without the least sneer at it, I have the highest respect and can admire it in others: but it has not the richness, the bloom, the full form, the enchantment of love after my own heart. So let me speak of your Beauty, though to my own endangering; if you could be so cruel to me as to try elsewhere its Power. You say you are affraid I shall think you do not love me ---in saying this you make me ache the more to be near you. I am at the diligent use of my faculties here, I do not pass a day without sprawling some blank verse or tagging some rhymes; and here I must confess, that, (since I am on that subject,) I love you the more in that I believe you have liked me for my own sake and for nothing else. I have met with women whom I really think would like to be married to a Poem and to be given away by a Novel. I have seen your Comet,  746 and only wish it was a sign that poor Rice would get well whose illness makes him rather a melancholy companion: and the more so as so to conquer his feelings and hide them from me, with a forc'd Pun. I kiss'd your writing over in the hope you had indulg'd me by leaving a trace of honey---What was your dream? Tell it me and I will tell you the interpretation thereof. Ever yours, my love! John Keats. Do not accuse me of delay---we have not here an opportunity of sending letters every day. Write speedily. Address and postmark not recorded. Shanklin nr. Ryde Isle of Wight. Sunday 12 July 1819. 747  My dear Reynolds, ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) You will be glad to hear under my own hand (tho' Rice says we are like Sauntering Jack & Idle Joe) how diligent I have been, & am being. I have finish'd the Act,  748 and in the interval of beginning the 2d have proceeded pretty well with Lamia, finishing the 1st part which consists of about 400 lines. ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) I have great hopes of success, because I make use of my Judgment more deliberately than I yet have done; but in case of failure with the world, I shall find my content. And here (as I know you have my good at heart as much as a Brother), I can only repeat to you what I have said to George---that however I shod like to enjoy what the competences of life procure, I am in no wise dashed at a different prospect.  749 . I have spent too many thoughtful days & moralized thro' too many nights for that, and fruitless wod they be indeed, if they did not by degrees make me look upon the affairs of the world with a healthy deliberation. I have of late been moulting: not for fresh feathers and wings: they are gone, and in their stead I hope to have a pair of patient sublunary legs. I have altered, not from a Chrysalis into a butterfly, but the Contrary, having two little loopholes, whence I may look out into the stage of the world: and that world on our coming here I almost forgot. The first time I sat down to write, I cod scarcely believe in the necessity of so doing. It struck me as a great oddity. Yet the very corn which is now so beautiful, as if it had only took to ripening yesterday, is for the market: so, why shod I be delicate  750 \--- Address : Miss Brawne  Wentworth Place  Hampstead  Middx. Postmark not recorded. 751 Shanklin Thursday Evening My love, I have been in so irritable a state of health these two or three last days, that I did not think I should be able to write this week. Not that I was so ill, but so much so as only to be capable of an unhealthy teasing letter. To night I am greatly recovered only to feel the languor I have felt after you touched with ardency. You say you perhaps might have made me better: you would then have made me worse: now you could quite effect a cure: What fee my sweet Physician would I not give you to do so. Do not call it folly, when I tell you I took your letter last night to bed with me. In the morning I found your name on the sealing wax obliterated. I was startled at the bad omen till I recollected that it must have happened in my dreams, and they you know fall out by contraries. You must have found out by this time I am a little given to bode ill like the raven; it is my misfortune not my fault; it has proceeded from the general tenor of the circumstances of my life, and rendered every event suspicious. However I will no more trouble either you or myself with sad Prophecies; though so far I am pleased at it as it has given me opportunity to love your disinterestedness towards me. I can be a raven no more; you and pleasure take possession of me at the same moment. I am afraid you have been unwell. If through me illness have touched you (but it must be with a very gentle hand) I must be selfish enough to feel a little glad at it. Will you forgive me this? I have been reading lately an oriental tale of a very beautiful color  752 \---It is of a city of melancholy men, all made so by this circumstance. Through a series of adventures each one of them by turns reaches some gardens of Paradise where they meet with a most enchanting Lady; and just as they are going to embrace her, she bids them shut their eyes---they shut them---and on opening their eyes again find themselves descending to the earth in a magic basket. The remembrance of this Lady and their delights lost beyond all recovery render them melancholy ever after. How I applied this to you, my dear; how I palpitated at it; how the certainty that you were in the same world with myself, and though as beautiful, not so talismanic as that Lady; how I could not bear you should be so you must belive because I swear it by yourself. I cannot say when I shall get a volume ready. I have three or four stories half done, but as I cannot write for the mere sake of the press, I am obliged to let them progress or lie still as my fancy chooses. By Christmas perhaps they may appear,  753 but I am not yet sure they ever will. 'Twill be no matter, for Poems are as common as newspapers and I do not see why it is a greater crime in me than in another to let the verses of an half-fledged brain tumble into the reading- rooms and drawing room windows. Rice has been better lately than usual: he is not suffering from any neglect of his parents who have for some years been able to appreciate him better than they did in his first youth, and are now devoted to his comfort. Tomorrow I shall, if my health continues to improve during the night, take a look farther about the country, and spy at the parties about here who come hunting after the picturesque like beagles. It is astonishing how they raven down scenery like children do sweetmeats. The wondrous Chine here is a very great Lion: I wish I had as many guineas as there have been spy-glasses in it. I have been, I cannot tell why, in capital spirits this last hour. What reason? When I have to take my candle and retire to a lonely room, without the thought as I fall asleep, of seeing you tomorrow morning? or the next day, or the next---it takes on the appearance of impossibility and eternity---I will say a month---I will say I will see you in a month at most, though no one but yourself should see me; if it be but for an hour. I should not like to be so near you as London without being continually with you: after having once more kissed you Sweet I would rather be here alone at my task than in the bustle and hateful literary chitchat. Meantime you must write to me---as I will every week---for your letters keep me alive. My sweet Girl I cannot speak my love for you. Good night! and Ever yours John Keats Address : Miss Brawne  Wentworth Place  Hampstead  Middx. Postmark : 27 JY 1819. 754 Sunday Night. My sweet Girl, I hope you did not blame me much for not obeying your request of a Letter on Saturday: we have had four in our small room playing at cards night and morning leaving me no undisturb'd opportunity to write. Now Rice and Martin 755 are gone I am at liberty. Brown to my sorrow confirms the account you give of your ill health. You cannot conceive how I ache to be with you: how I would die for one hour---for what is in the world? I say you cannot conceive; it is impossible you should look with such eyes upon me as I have upon you: it cannot be. Forgive me if I wander a little this evening, for I have been all day employ'd in a very abstract Poem  756 and I am in deep love with you---two things which must excuse me. I have, believe me, not been an age in letting you take possession of me; the very first week I knew you I wrote myself your vassal; but burnt the Letter as the very next time I saw you I thought you manifested some dislike to me. If you should ever feel for Man at the first sight what I did for you, I am lost. Yet I should not quarrel with you, but hate myself if such a thing were to happen---only I should burst if the thing were not as fine as a Man as you are as a Woman. Perhaps I am too vehement, then fancy me on my knees, especially when I mention a part of your Letter which hurt me; you say speaking of Mr Severn 'but you must be satisfied in knowing that I admired you much more than your friend'. My dear love, I cannot believe there ever was or ever could be any thing to admire in me especially as far as sight goes---I cannot be admired, I am not a thing to be admired. You are, I love you; all I can bring you is a swooning admiration of your Beauty. I hold that place among Men which snubnos'd brunettes with meeting eyebrows do among women---they are trash to me---unless I should find one among them with a fire in her heart like the one that burns in mine. You absorb me in spite of myself---you alone: for I look not forward with any pleasure to what is call'd being settled in the world; I tremble at domestic cares---yet for you I would meet them, though if it would leave you the happier I would rather die than do so. I have two luxuries to brood over in my walks, your Loveliness and the hour of my death. O that I could have possession of them both in the same minute.  757 I hate the world: it batters too much the wings of my self-will, and would I could take a sweet poison from your lips to send me out of it. From no others would I take it. I am indeed astonish'd to find myself so careless of all charms but yours---remembering as I do the time when even a bit of ribband was a matter of interest with me. What softer words can I find for you after this---what it is I will not read. Nor will I say more here, but in a Postscript answer any thing else you may have mentioned in your Letter in so many words---for I am distracted with a thousand thoughts. I will imagine you Venus to-night and pray, pray, pray to your star like a Heathen. Your's ever, fair Star, John Keats My seal is mark'd like a family table cloth with my Mother's initial F for Fanny: put between my Father's initials. You will soon hear from me again. My respectful Compts to your Mother. Tell Margaret  758 . I'll send her a reef of best rocks and tell Sam  759 . I will give him my light bay hunter if he will tie the Bishop hand and foot and pack him in a hamper and send him down for me to bathe him for his health with a Necklace of good snubby stones about his Neck.  760 . Address : C. W. Dilke Esqre  Navy Pay Office  Somerset House  London--- Postmarks : NEWPORT and 2 AU 1819 Shanklin Saturday Eveng My dear Dilke, I will not make my diligence an excuse for not writing to you sooner---because I consider idleness a much better plea. A Man in the hurry of business of any sort is expected and ought to be expected to look to every thing---his mind is in a whirl, and what matters it---what whirl? But to require a Letter of a Man lost in idleness is the utmost cruelty, you cut the thread of his existence, you beat, you pummel him, you sell his goods and chattels, you put him in prison; you impale him; you crucify him. If I had not put pen to paper since I saw you this would be to me a vi et armis taking up before the Judge---but having got over my darling lounging habits a little, it is with scarcely any pain I come to this dating from Shankling and Dr Dilke, The Isle of Wight is but so so &c. Rice and I passed rather a dull time of it.  761 I hope he will not repent coming with me. He was unwell and I was not in very good health: and I am affraid we made each other worse by acting upon each others spirits. We would grow as melancholy as need be. I confess I cannot bear a sick person in a House especially alone---it weighs upon me day and night---and more so when perhaps the Case is irretrievable---Indeed I think Rice is in a dangerous state. I have had a Letter from him which speaks favourably of his health at present--- Brown and I are pretty well harnessed again to our dogcart. I mean the Tragedy which goes on sinkingly---We are thinking of introducing an Elephant but have not historical referance within reach to determine us as to Otho's Menagerie. When Brown first mention'd this I took it for a Joke; however he brings such plausible reasons, and discourses so eloquently on the dramatic effect that I am giving it a serious consideration.  762 The Art of Poetry is not sufficient for us, and if we get on in that as well as we do in painting we shall by next winter crush the Reviews and the royal Academy. Indeed if Brown would take a little of my advice he could not fail to be first pallet of his day. But odd as it may appear, he says plainly that he cannot see any force in my plea for putting Skies in the back ground---and leaving indian ink out of an ash tree---The other day he was sketching Shanklin Church and as I saw how the business was going on, I challenged him to a trial of Skill---he lent me Pencil and Paper---we keep the Sketches to contend for the Prize at the Gallery. I will not say whose I think best---but really I do not think Brown's done to the top of the Art---A word or two on the Isle of Wight---I have been no further than Steephill. If I may guess I should say that there is no finer part in the Island than from this Place to Steephill---I do not hesitate to say it is fine. Bonchurch is the best. But I have been so many finer walks, with a back ground of lake and mountain instedd of the sea, that I am not much touch'd with it, though I credit it for all the Surprise I should have felt if it had taken my cockney maidenhead. But I may call myself an old Stager in the picturesque, and unless it be something very large and overpowering I cannot receive any extraordinary relish. I am sorry to hear that Charles  763 . is so much oppress'd at Westminster: though I am sure it will be the finest touch stone for his Metal in the world---His troubles will grow day by day less, as his age and strength increase. The very first Battle he wins will lift him from the Tribe of Manassah.  764 I do not know how I should feel were I a Father---but I hope I should strive with all my Power not to let the present trouble me---When your Boy shall be twenty, ask him about his childish troubles and he will have no more memory of them than you have of yours. Brown tells me Mrs Dilke sets off to day for Chichester---I am glad---I was going to say she had a fine day---but there has been a great Thunder cloud muttering over Hampshire all day---I hope she is now at supper with a good Appetite---So Reynold's Piece  765 succeeded---that is all well. Papers have with thanks been duly received. We leave this Place on the 13th and will let you know where we may be a few days after---Brown says he will write when the fit comes on him. If you will stand law expenses I'll beat him into one before his time---When I come to town I shall have a little talk with you about Brown and one Jenny Jacobs.  766 Open daylight! he don't care. I am affraid there will be some more feet for little stockings--- of Keats' making . ( I mean the feet .) Brown here tried at a piece of Wit but it failed him, as you see though long a brewing,--- this is a 2d lie . Men should never despair---you see he has tried again and succeeded to a miracle.---He wants to try again, but as I have a right to an inside place in my own Letter---I take possession. Your sincere friend. John Keats--- Address : Miss Brawne  Wentworth Place  Hampstead Middx--- Postmarks : NEWPORT and 9 AU 1819 Shanklin Thursday Night My dear Girl, You say you must not have any more such Letters as the last: I'll try that you shall not by running obstinate the other way---Indeed I have not fair play---I am not idle enough for proper downright love-letters---I leave this minute a scene in our Tragedy and see you (think it not blasphemy) through the mist of Plots speeches, counterplots and counterspeeches---The Lover is madder than I am---I am nothing to him  767 \---he has a figure like the Statue of Maleager and double distilled fire in his heart. Thank God for my diligence! were it not for that I should be miserable. I encourage it, and strive not to think of you---but when I have succeeded in doing so all day and as far as midnight, you return as soon as this artificial excitement goes off more severely from the fever I am left in ---Upon my soul I cannot say what you could like me for. I do not think myself a fright any more than I do Mr A Mr B. and Mr C. yet if I were a woman I should not like A. B. C. But enough of this---So you intend to hold me to my promise of seeing you in a short time. I shall keep it with as much sorrow as gladness: for I am not one of the Paladins of old who livd upon water grass and smiles for years together---What though would I not give to-night for the gratification of my eyes alone? This day week we shall move to Winchester; for I feel the want of a Library.  768 Brown will leave me there to pay a visit to Mr Snook at Bedhampton: in his absence I will flit to you and back. I will stay very little while, for as I am in a train of writing now I fear to disturb it---let it have its course bad or good---in it I shall try my own strength and the public pulse. At Winchester I shall get your Letters more readily; and it being a cathedral City I shall have a pleasure always a great one to me when near a Cathedral, of reading them during the service up and down the Aisle. Friday Morning. Just as I had written thus far last night, Brown came down in his morning coat and nightcap, saying he had been refresh'd by a good sleep and was very hungry---I left him eating and went to bed being too tired to enter into any discussions. You would delight very greatly in the walks about here, the Cliffs, woods, hills, sands, rocks &c about here. They are however not so fine but I shall give them a hearty good bye to exchange them for my Cathedrall---Yet again I am not so tired of Scenery as to hate Switzerland--- We might spend a pleasant year at Berne or Zurich---if it should please Venus to hear my 'Beseech thee to hear us O Goddess" And if she should hear god forbid we should what people call, settle \---turn into a pond, a stagnant Lethe---a vile crescent, row or buildings.

You ask after my health, not telling me whether you are better. I am quite well. You going out is no proof that you are: how is it? Late hours will do you great harm. What fairing is it? I was alone for a couple of days while Brown went gadding over the country with his ancient knapsack. Now I like his society as well as any Man's, yet regretted his return---it broke in upon me like a Thunderbolt---I had got in a dream among my Books---really luxuriating in a solitude and silence you alone should have disturb'd--- Your ever affectionate John Keats--- Address: To the,  Revd B. Bailey  St. Andrews  N.B. Postmarks : WINCHESTER and 14 AU 1819. We removed to Winchester for the convenience of a Library and find it an exceeding pleasant Town, enriched with a beautiful Cathedrall and surrounded by a fresh-looking country. We are in tolerably good and cheap Lodgings. Within these two Months I have written 1500 Lines, most of which besides many more of prior composition you will probably see by next Winter. I have written two Tales, one from Boccac cio call'd the Pot of Basil; and another call'd St. Agnes' Eve on a popular superstition; and a third call'd Lamia---half finished---I have also been writing parts of my Hyperion and completed 4 Acts of a Tragedy. It was the opinion of most of my friends that I should never be able to write a scene. I will endeavour to wipe away the prejudice---I sincerely hope you will be pleased when my Labours since we last saw each other shall reach you. One of my Ambitions is to make as great a revolution in modern dramatic writing as Kean has done in acting---another to upset the drawling of the blue stocking literary world---if in the course of a few years I do these two things I ought to die content---and my friends should drink a dozen of Claret on my Tomb---I am convinced more and more every day that (excepting the human friend Philosopher) a fine writer is the most genuine Being in the World. Shakspeare and the paradise Lost every day become greater wonders to me.  769 I look upon fine Phrases like a Lover. I was glad to see, by a Passage in one of Brown's Letters some time ago from the north that you were in such good Spirits.  770 Since that you have been married and in congratulating you I wish you every continuance of them. Present my Respects to Mrs Bailey. This sounds oddly to me, and I dare say I do it awkwardly enough: but I suppose by this time it is nothing new to you---Brown's remembrances to you---As far as I know we shall remain at Winchester for a goodish while--- Ever your sincere friend John Keats.

Winchester August 17th 771 Winchester August 17 thI My dear Girl---what shall I say for myself? I have been here four days and not yet written you---'tis true I have had many teasing letters of business to dismiss---and I have been in the Claws, like a Serpent in an Eagle's, of the last act of our Tragedy.  772 This is no excuse; I know it; I do not presume to offer it. I have no right either to ask a speedy answer to let me know how lenient you are---I must remain some days in a Mist---I see you through a Mist: as I dare say you do me by this time. Believe in the first Letters I wrote you: I assure you I felt as I wrote---I could not write so now. The thousand images I have had pass through my brain---my uneasy spirits---my unguess'd fate---all spread as a veil between me and you---Remember I have had no idle leisure to brood over you---'tis well perhaps I have not. I could not have endured the throng of Jealousies  773 that used to haunt me before I had plunged so deeply into imaginary interests. I would feign, as my sails are set, sail on without an interruption for a Brace of Months longer---I am in complete cue---in the fever; and shall in these four Months do an immense deal---This Page as my eye skims over it I see is excessively unloverlike and ungallant---I cannot help it---I am no officer in yawning quarters; no Parson-romeo. My Mind is heap'd to the full; stuff'd like a cricket ball---if I strive to fill it more it would burst. I know the generallity of women would hate me for this; that I should have so unsoften'd so hard a Mind as to forget them; forget the brightest realities for the dull imaginations of my own brain. But I conjure you to give it a fair thinking; and as yourself whether 'tis not better to explain my feelings to you, than write artificial Passion---Besides you would see through it. It would be vain to strive to deceive you. 'Tis harsh, harsh, I know it---My heart seems now made of iron---I could not write a proper answer to an invitation to Idalia.  774 You are my Judge: my forehead is on the ground. You seem offended at a little simple innocent childish playfulness in my last.  775 I did not seriously mean to say that you were endeavouring to make me keep my promise. I beg your pardon for it. 'Tis but just you r Pride should take the alarm--- seriously . You say I may do as I please---I do not think with any conscience I can; my cash resourses are for the present stopp'd; I fear for some time. I spend no money but it increases my debts. I have all my life thought very little of these matters--- they seem not to belong to me. It may be a proud sentence; but, by heaven, I am as entirely above all matters of interest as the Sun is above the Earth---and though of my own money I should be careless; of my Friends I must be spare. You see how I go on---like so many strokes of a Hammer. I cannot help it---I am impell'd, driven to it. I am not happy enough for silken Phrases, and silver sentences. I can no more use soothing words to you than if I were at this moment engaged in a charge of Cavalry---Then you will say I should not write at all---Should I not? This Winchester is a fine place: a beautiful Cathedral and many other ancient building s in the Environs. The little coffin of a room at Shanklin is changed for a large room, where I can promenade at my pleasure---looks out onto a beautiful---blank side of a house. It is strange I should like it better than the view of the sea from our window at Shanklin. I began to hate the very posts there---the voice of the old Lady over the way was getting a great Plague. The Fisherman's face never altered any more than our black teapot---the nob however was knock'd off to my little relief. I am getting a great dislike of the picturesque; and can only relish it over again by seeing you enjoy it. One of the pleasantest things I have seen lately was at Cowes. The Regent in his Yatch  776 (I think they spell it) was anchored oppoisite---a beautiful vessel---and all the Yatchs and boats on the coast, were passing and repassing it; and curcuiting and tacking about it in every direction---I never beheld any thing so, silent, light, and graceful---As we pass'd over to Southampton, there was nearly an accident. There came by a Boat well mann'd; with two naval officers at the stern. Our Bowlines took the top of their little mast and snapped it off close by the board---Had the mast been a little stouter they would have been upset. In so trifling an event I could not help admiring our Seamen---Neither officer nor man in the whole Boat moved a Muscle---they scarcely notic'd it even with words---Forgive me for this flint-worded Letter, and believe and see that I cannot think of you without some sort of energy---though mal a propos---Even as I leave off it seems to me that a few more moments thought of you would uncrystallize and dissolve me. I must not give way to it---but turn to my writing again---if I fail I shall die hard. O my love, your lips are growing sweet again to my fancy---I must forget them. Ever your affectionate Keats--- Address : John Taylor, Esqre  Taylor and Hessey  Fleet Street  London Postmark : WINCHESTER 23 AU 1819 Winchester Monday morn. 24 Augst. My dear Taylor--- You will perceive that I do not write you till I am forced by necessity: that I am sorry for. You must forgive me for entering abrubtly on the subject, merely prefixing an entreaty that you will not consider my business manner of wording and proceeding any distrust of, or stirrup standing against you; but put it to the account of a desire of order and regularity. I have been rather unfortunate lately in money concerns---from a threatened chancery suit. I was deprived at once of all recourse to my Guardian. I relied a little on some of my debts being paid---which are of a tolerable amount--- but I have not had one pound refunded---For these three Months Brown has advanced me money: he is not at all flush and I am anxious to get some elsewhere. We have together been engaged (this I should wish to remain secret) in a Tragedy which I have just finish'd; and from which we hope to share moderate Profits. Being thus far connected, Brown proposed to me, to stand with me responsible for any money you may advance to me to drive through the summer---I must observe again that it is not from want of reliance on your readiness to assist me that I offer a B ill; but as a relief to myself from a too lax sensation of Life---which ought to be responsible which requires chains for its own sake---duties to fulfil with the more earnestness the less strictly they are imposed Were I completely without hope---it might be different---but am I not right to rejoice in the idea of not being Burthensome to my friends? I feel every confidence that if I choose I may be a popular writer; that I will never be; but for all that I will get a livelihood---I equally dislike the favour of the public with the love of a woman---they are both a cloying treacle to the wings of independence. I shall ever consider them (People) as debtors to me for verses, not myself to them for admiration ---which I can do without. I have of late been indulging my spleen by composing a preface at them: after all resolving never to write a preface at all. 'There are so many verses,' would I have said to them, 'give me so much means to buy pleasure with as a relief to my hours of labour---You will observe at the end of this if you put down the Letter 'How a solitary life engenders pride and egotism!' True: I know it does---but this Pride and egotism will enable me to write finer things than any thing else could---so I will indulge it. Just so much as I am hu mbled by the genius above my grasp, am I exalted and look with hate and contempt upon the literary world---A Drummer boy who holds out his hand familiarly to a field marshall---that Drummer boy with me is the good word and favour of the public. Who would wish to be among the commonplace crowd of the little-famous---who are each individually lost in a throng made up of themselves? is this worth louting or playing the hypocrite for? To beg suffrages for a seat on the benches of a myriad-aristocracy in Letters? This is not wise---I am not a wise man---Tis Pride. I will give you a definition of a proud Man---He is a Man who has neither vanity nor wisdom---one fill'd with hatreds cannot be vain---neither can he be wise. Pardon me for hammering instedd of writing--- Remember me to Woodhouse Hessey and all in Percey street--- Ever yours sincerely John Keats P.S. I have read what Brown has said on the other side---He agrees with me that this manner of proceeding might appear too harsh, distant and indelicate with you. This however will place all in a clear light. Had I to borrow money of Brown and were in your house, I should request the use of your name in the same manner---  777 The following note from Brown occupies the 'doublings' of this letter:--- Dear Sir, Keats has told me the purport of this letter. Had it been in my power to have prevented this application to you, I would have done so. What property I have is locked up, sending me quarterly & half yearly driblets, insufficient for the support of both of us. I am fully acquainted with his circumstances,---the monies owing to him amount to £230,---the Chancery Suit will not I think eventually be injurious to him,---and his perseverance in the employment of his talents,---will, in my opinion, in a short time, place him in a situation more pleasant to his feelings as far as his pocket is considered. Yet, for all this, I am aware, a man of business should have every security in his power, and Keats especially would be uncomfortable at borrowing unless he gave all in his power ; besides his own name to a Bill he has none to offer but mine, which I readilly agree to, and (speaking in a business-like way) consider I possess ample security for doing so. It is therefore to be considered as a matter of right on your part to demand my name in conjunction with his; and if you should be inclined to judge otherwise, still it would be painful to him not to give you a double security when he can do so, and painful to me to have it withheld when it ought to be given. Your's sincerely, Chas Brown. Address not recorded. Postmark : 24 AU 1819. Winchester Aug t 25 My dear Reynolds, By this post I write to Rice, who will tell you why we have left Shanklin; and how we like this place. I have indeed scarcely anything else to say, leading so monotonous a life, except I was to give you a history of sensations, and day-nightmares. You would not find me at all unhappy in it; as all my thoughts and feelings which are of the selfish nature, home speculations every day continue to make me more Iron. I am convinced more and more day by day that fine writing is next to fine doing, the top thing in the world, the Paradise Lost becomes a greater wonder.  778 The more I know what my diligence may in time probably effect; the more does my heart distend with Pride and Obstinacy  779 \---I feel it in my power to become a popular Writer---I feel it in my strength to refuse the poisonous suffrage of a public. My own being which I know to be becomes of more consequence to me than the crowds of Shadows in the shape of men and women that inhabit a Kingdom. The soul is a world of itself, and has enough to do in its own home. Those whom I know already, and who have grown as it were a part of myself, I could not do without: but for the rest of mankind, they are as much a dream to me as Milton's Hierarchies. I think if I had a free and healthy and lasting organization of heart, and lungs as strong as an ox's so as to be able to bear unhurt the shock of extreme thought and sensation without weariness, I could pass my life very nearly alone though it should last eighty years. But I feel my body too weak to support me to the height, I am obliged continually to check myself and strive to be nothing. It would be vain for me to endeavour after a more reasonable manner of writing to you. I have nothing to speak of but myself---and what can I say but what I feel? If you should have any reason to regret this state of excitement in me, I will turn the tide of your feelings in the right Channel, by mentioning that it is the only state for the best sort of Poetry--- that is all I care for, all I live for. Forgive me for not filling up the whole sheet; Letters become so irksome to me that the next time I leave London I shall petition them all to be spar'd me. To give me credit for constancy, and at the same time waive letter writing will be the highest indulgence I can think of Ever your affectionate friend John Keats Address : Miss Keats  Rd. Abbey's Esqre  Walthamstow  near London Postmark : WINCHESTER 29 AU 1819 Winchester August 28th My dear Fanny, You must forgive me for suffering so long a space to elapse between the dates of my letters. It is more than a fortnight since I left Shanklin, chiefly for the purpose of being near a tolerable Library, which after all is not to be found in this place. However we like it very much: it is the pleasantest Town I ever was in, and has the most recommendations of any. There is a fine Cathedrall which to me is always a source of amusement, part of it built 1400 years ago; and the more modern by a magnificent Man, you may have read of in our History, called William of Wickham. The whole town is beautifully wooded ---From the Hill at the eastern extremity you see a prospect of Streets, and old Buildings mixed up with Trees. Then there are the most beautiful streams about I ever saw---full of Trout. There is the Foundation of St Croix about half a mile in the fields---a charity greatly abused. We have a Collegiate School, a roman catholic School; a chapel ditto and a Nunnery! And what improves it all is, the fashionable inhabitants are all gone to Southampton. We are quiet---except a fiddle that now and then goes like a gimlet through my Ears. Our Landlady's Son not being quite a Proficient. I have still been hard at work, having completed a Tragedy I think I spoke of to you. But there I fear all my labour will be thrown away for the present, as I hear Mr Kean is going to America. For all I can guess I shall remain here till the middle of October---when Mr Brown will return to his house at Hampstead: whither I shall return with him. I some time since sent the Letter I told you I had received from George to Haslam with a request to let you and Mrs Wylie see it: he sent it back to me for very insufficient reasons without doing so; and I was so irritated by it that I would not send it travelling about by the post any more: besides the postage is very expensive. I know Mrs Wylie will think this a great neglect. I am sorry to say my temper gets the better of me ---I will not send it again. Some correspondence I have had with Mr Abbey about George's affairs---and I must confess he has behaved very kindly to me as far as the wording of his Letter went. Have you heard any further mention of his retiring from Business? I am anxious to hear whether Hodgkinson,  780 whose name I cannot bear to write, will in any likelihood be thrown upon himself. The delightful Weather we have had for two Months is the highest gratification I could receive---no chill'd red noses--- no shivering---but fair atmosphere to think in---a clean towel mark'd with the mangle and a basin of clear Water to drench one's face with ten times a day: no need of much exercise---a Mile a day being quite sufficient. My greatest regret is that I have not been well enough to bathe though I have been two Months by the sea side and live now close to delicious bathing---Still I enjoy the Weather I adore fine Weather as the greatest blessing I can have. Give me Books, fruit, french wine and fine whether and a little music out of doors, played by somebody I do not know--- not pay the price of one's time for a gig---but a little chance music: and I can pass a summer very quietly without caring much about Fat Louis,  781 fat Regent or the Duke of Wellington. Why have you not written to me? Because you were in expectation of George's Letter and so waited? Mr Brown is copying out our Tragedy of Otho the great in a superb style---better than it deserves ---there as I said is labour in vain for the present. I had hoped to give Kean another opportunity to shine. What can we do now? There is not another actor of Tragedy in all London or Europe. The Covent Garden Company is execrable. Young  782 is the best among them and he is a ranting, coxcombical tasteless Actor---A Disgust A Nausea---and yet the very best after Kean---What a set of barren asses are actors! I should like now to promenade round your Gardens--- apple tasting---pear-tasting---plumb-judging---apricot nibbling ---peach scrunching ---Nectarine-sucking and Melon carving. I have also a great feeling for antiquated cherries full of sugar cracks---and a white currant tree kept for company. I admire lolling on a lawn by a water-lillied pond to eat white currants and see gold fish: and go to the Fair in the Evening if I'm good. There is not hope for that--- one is sure to get into some mess before evening. Have these hot days I brag of so much been well or ill for your health? Let me hear soon--- Your affectionate Brother John--- Address : John Taylor Esqre  Taylor  &Hessey  Fleet Street  London Postmark : WINCHESTER 31 AU 1819 783 Winchester Septr 1st My dear Taylor, Brown and I have been employed for these three weeks past from time to time in writing to our different friends: a dead silence is our ownly answer: we wait morning after morning and nothing: tuesday is the day for the Examiner to arrive, this is the second tuesday which has been barren even of a news paper ---Men should be in imitation of Spirits 'responsive to each others note'  784 \---Instead of that I pipe and no one hath danced---We have been cursing this morning like Mandeville and Lisle  785 \---With this I shall send by the same Post a third Letter to a friend of mine ---who though it is of consequence has neither answered right or left. We have been much in want of news from the Theatres having heard that Kean is going to America--- but no---not a word. Why I should come on you with all these complaints, I cannot explain to myself: especially as I suspect you must be in the Country. Do answer me soon for I really must know something. I must steer myself by the rudder of information. And I am in want of a Month's cash---now believe me I do not apply to you as if I thought you had a gold Mine. no. I understand these matters well enough now having become well acquainted with the disbursements every Man is tempted to make beyond his means---From this time I have resolved myself to refuse all such requests: tell me you are not flush and I shall thank you heartily---That is a duty you owe to yourself as well as to me . I have mulcted Brown to o much: let it be my last sin of the kind. I will try what use it will be to insist on my debts being paid. Ever yours sincerely John Keats--- Address : Hessey Esqre  Taylor and Hessey  Fleet Street  London. Postmark : WINCHESTER 5 SE 1819. Winchester, Sunday Septr 5th My dear Hessey, I received this morning yours of yesterday enclosing a 30£ bank post bill. I have been in fear of the Winchester Jail for some time: neither Brown nor myself could get an answer from any one. This morning I hear that some unknown part of a Sum due to me and for which I had been waiting three weeks has been sent to Chichester by mistake. Brown has borrow'd money of a friend of his in Hampshire---A few days ago we had but a few shillings left ---and now between us we have 60£ besides what is waiting in the Chichester post office. To be a complete Midas I suppose some one will send me a pair of asses ears by the waggon---There has been such an embargo laid on our correspondence that I can scarcely believe your Letter was only dated yesterday. It seems miraculous. Ever yours sincerely John Keats. I am sorry to hear such a bad account of himself from Taylor. Address : John Taylor, Esqre  Mr James Taylor's  Retford  Notts. Postmark : WINCHESTER 5 SE 1819 Winchester Septr 5th My dear Taylor, This morning I received yours of the 2nd and with it a Letter from Hessey enclosing a Bank post Bill of 30£\--- an ample sum I assure you: more I had no thought of. You should not have delay'd so long in fleet Street; leading an inactive life as you did was breathing poison: you will find the country air do more for you than you expect. But it must be proper country air; you must choose a spot. What sort of a place is Retford? You should live in a dry, gravelly, barren, elevated country open to the currents of air, and such a place is generally furnish'd with the finest springs. The neighbourhood of a rich inclosed fulsome manured arrable Land especially in a valley and almost as bad on a flat, would be almost as bad as the smoke of fleetstreet. Such a place as this was shanklin only open to the south east and surrounded by hills in every other direction. From this south east came the damps from the sea which having no egress the air would for days together take on an unhealthy idiosyncrasy altogether enervating and weakening as a city Smoke---I felt it very much---Since I have been at Winchester I have been improving in health--- it is not so confined---and there is on one side of the city a dry chalky down where the air is worth sixpence a pint. So if you do not get better at Retford do not impute it to your own weakness before you have well considered the nature of the air and soil--- especially as Autumn is encroaching: for the autumn fogs over a rich land is like the steam from cabbage water--- What makes the great difference between valemen flatland men, and Mountaineers? The cultivation of the earth in a great measure. Our health temperament and dispositions are taken more (notwithstanding the contradiction of the history of cain and abel) from the air we breathe than is generally imagined. See the difference between a Peasant and a Butcher. I am convinced a great cause of it is the difference of the air they breathe---The one takes his mingled with the fume of slaughter the other with the damp exhalement from the glebe. The teeming damp that comes from the plough furrow is of great effect in taming the fierceness of a strong Man more than his labour---let him be mowing furze upon a Mountain and at the days end his thoughts will run upon a withe axe if he ever had handled one, let him leave the Plough and he will think quIetly of his supper. Agriculture is the tamer of men, the steam from the earth is like drinking their mother's milk. It enervates their natures. This appears a great cause of the imbecillity of the Chinese. And if this sort of atmosphere is a mitigation to the energies of a strong man; how much more must it injure a weak one--- unoccupied--- unexercised---For what is the cause of so many men maintaining a good state in Cities but occupation---An idle man; a man who is not sensitively alive to self interest in a city cannot continue long in good Health. This is easily explained. If you were to walk leisurely through an unwholesome path in the fens, with a little horror of them you would be sure to have your ague. But let macbeth cross the same path, with the dagger in the air leading him on, and he would never have an ague or any thing like it. You should give these things a serious consideration. Notts I believe is a flat County. You should be on the slope of one of the dry barren hills in somersetshire. I am convinced there is as harmful Air to be breath'd in the country as in Town. I am greatly obliged to you for your Letter. Perhaps if you had had strength and spirits enough you would have felt offended by my offering a note of hand; or rather express'd it. However, I am sure you will give me credit for not in any wise mistrusting you; or imagining you would take advantage of any power I might give you over me. No, it proceeded from my serious resolve not to be a gratuitous borrower: from a great desire to be correct in money matters; to have in my desk the Chronicles of them to refer to, and know my worldly non-estate: besides in case of my death such documents would be but just: if merely as memorials of the friendly turns I had had done to me. Had I known of your illness I should not of  for have  written in such fiery phrase in my first Letter. I hope that shortly you will be able to bear six times as much. Brown likes the Tragedy very much: but he is not a fit judge, as I have only acted as Midwife to his plot, and of course he will be fond of his child. I do not think I can make you any extracts without spoiling the effect of the whole when you come to read it. I hope you will then not think my labour misspent. Since I finish'd it I have finish'd Lamia: and am now occupied in revising St Agnes' Eve and studying Italian.  786 Ariosto I find as diffuse, in parts, as Spenser. I understand completely the difference between them---I will cross the letter with some lines from Lamia. Brown's kindest remembrances to you; and I am ever your most sincere friend John Keats--- A haunting music, sole perhaps and lone Supportress of the faery roof, made moan Throughout, as fearful the whole charm might fade. Fresh carved cedar, mimicking a glade Of Palm and Plantain, met, from either side, High in the midst in honour of the bride. Two palms, and then two plantains, and so on, From either side, their stems branch'd one to one All down the aisled place; and beneath all There ran a stream of lamps straight on from wall to wall. So canopied lay an untasted feast Teeming a perfume. Lamia regal drest Silverly pac'd about, and as she went, In pale contented sort of discontent Mission'd her viewless Servants to enrich The splendid cornicing of nook and niche. Between the Tree stems, wainscoated at first Came jasper pannels; then, anon, there burst Forth creeping imagery of slighter trees And with the larger wove in small intriccacies. Approving all, she faded at self will, And shut the chamber up close hush'd and still, Complete, and ready for the revels rude, When dreadful guests would come to spoil her solitude The day came soon and all the gossip rout. O senseless Lycius! Dolt! Fool! Madman! Lout! Why would you murder happiness like yours, And show to common eyes these secret bowers? The Herd came, and each guest, with buzzy brain, Arriving at the Portal, gaz'd amain, And enter'd wond'ring; for they knew the Street, Remember'd it from childhood all complete, Without a gap, but ne'er before had seen That royal Porch, that high-built fair demesne; So in went one and all maz'd, curious and keen. Save one; who look'd thereon with eye severe, And, with calm-planted steps, walk'd in austere; 'Twas Appolonius:---something too he laught; As though some knotty problem, that had daft His patient thought, had now begun to thaw, And solve, and melt;---'twas just as he foresaw! Soft went the music, and the tables all Sparkled beneath the viewless banneral Of Magic; and dispos'd in double row Seem'd edged Parterres of white bedded snow, Adorne'd along the sides with living flowers Conversing, laughing after sunny showers: And, as the pleasant appetite entic'd, Gush came the wine, and sheer the meats were slic'd. Soft went the Music; the flat salver sang Kiss'd by the emptied goblet,---and again it rang: Swift bustled by the servants:---here's a health Cries one---another---then, as if by stealth, A Glutton drains a cup of Helicon, Too fast down, down his throat the brief delight is gone. "Where is that Music?" cries a Lady fair. "Aye, where is it my dear? Up in the air?" Another whispers. 'Poo!' saith Glutton "Mum!" Then makes his shiny mouth a napkin for his thumb. &c. &c. &c. This is a good sample of the Story. Brown is going to Chichester and Bedhampton avisiting ---I shall be alone here for three weeks---expecting accounts of your health. Address : Miss Brawne  Wentworth Place  Hampstead Postmarks : LOMBARD ST. and 14 SE 1819 Fleet Street, Monday Morn My dear Girl, I have been hurried to Town by a Letter from my brother George; it is not of the brightest intelligence. Am I mad or not? I came by the Friday night coach and have not yet been to Hampstead. Upon my soul it is not my fault. I cannot resolve to mix any pleasure with my days: they go one like another undistinguishable. If I were to see you to day it would destroy the half comfortable sullenness I enjoy at present into downright perplexities. I love you too much to venture to Hampstead, I feel it is not paying a visit, but venturing into a fire. Que feraije? as the french novel writers say in fun, and I in earnest: really what can I do? Knowing well that my life must be passed in fatigue and trouble, I have been endeavouring to wean myself from you: for to myself alone what can be much of a misery? As far as they regard myself I can despise all events: but I cannot cease to love you. This morning I scarcely know what I am doing. I am going to Walthamstow. I shall return to Winchester to-morrow;  787 whence you shall hear from me in a few days. I am a Coward, I cannot bear the pain of being happy: 'tis out of the question: I must admit no thought of it. Yours ever affectionately John Keats Address : Mr J. H. Reynolds  8 Duke St.  Bath. Postmark : WINCHESTER 21 SE 1819 Winchester Tuesday My dear Reynolds, I was very glad to hear from Woodhouse that you would meet in the Country. I hope you will pass some pleasant time together. Which I wish to make pleasanter by a brace of letters, very highly to be estimated, as really I have had very bad luck with this sort of game this season. I "kepen in solitarinesse,"  788 for Brown has gone a visiting. I am surprized myself at the pleasure I live alone in. I can give you no news of the place here, or any other idea of it but what I have to this effect written to George. Yesterday I say to him was a grand day for Winchester.  789 They elected a Mayor. It was indeed high time the place should receive some sort of excitement. There was nothing going on: all asleep: not an old maid's sedan returning from a card party: and if any old woman got tipsy at Christenings they did not expose it in the streets. The first night tho' of our arrival here there was a slight uproar took place at about 10 o'the Clock. We heard distinctly a noise patting down the high Street as of a walking cane of the good old Dowager breed; and a little minute after we heard a less voice observe "What a noise the ferril made ---it must be loose"---Brown wanted to call the Constables, but I observed 'twas only a little breeze, and would soon pass over.---The side streets here are excessively maidenlady like: the door steps always fresh from the flannel. The knockers have a staid serious, nay almost awful quietness about them.---I never saw so quiet a collection of Lions'& Rams'heads. The doors are most part black, with a little brass handle just above the keyhole, so that in Winchester a man may very quietly shut himself out of his own house. How beautiful the season is now---How fine the air. A temperate sharpness about it. Really, without joking, chaste weather---Dian skies---I never lik'd stubble-fields so much as now---Aye better than the chilly green of the Spring. Somehow a stubble-plain looks warm ---in the same way that some pictures look warm---This struck me so much in my Sunday's walk that I composed upon it.  790 I hope you are better employed than in gaping after weather. I have been at different times so happy as not to know what weather it was---No I will not copy a parcel of verses. I always somehow associate Chatterton with autumn. He is the purest writer in the English Language. He has no French idiom, or particles like Chaucer---'tis genuine English Idiom in English Words. I have given up Hyperion---there were too many Miltonic inversions in it--- Miltonic verse can not be written but in an artful or rather artist's humour. I wish to give myself up to other sensations.  791 English ought to be kept up. It may be interesting to you to pick out some lines from Hyperion and put a mark x to the false beauty proceeding from art, and one Ἦ to the true voice of feeling. Upon my soul 'twas imagination I cannot make the distinction---Every now & then there is a Miltonic intonation---But I cannot make the division properly. The fact is I must take a walk: for I am writing so long a letter to George; and have been employed at it all the morning. You will ask, have I heard from George. I am sorry to say not the best news---I hope for better---This is the reason among others that if I write to you it must be in such a scraplike way. I have no meridian to date Interests from, or measure circumstances ---To-night I am all in a mist; I scarcely know what's what. But you knowing my unsteady &vagarish disposition, will guess that all this turmoil will be settled by to-morrow morning. It strikes me to-night that I have led a very odd sort of life for the two or three last years---Here & there ---No anchor---I am glad of it---If you can get a peep at Babbicomb before you leave the country, do.---I think it the finest place I have seen, or is to be seen in the South.  792 There is a Cottage there I took warm water at, that made up for the tea. I have lately skirk'd some friends of ours, and I advise you to do the same, I mean the blue-devils--- I am never at home to them. You need not fear them while you remain in Devonshire. there will be some of the family waiting for you at the Coach office---but go by another Coach.--- I shall beg leave to have a third opinion in the first discussion you have with Woodhouse---just half-way--- between both. You know I will not give up my argument ---In my walk today I stoop'd under a rail way  793 that lay across my path, and ask'd myself "Why I did not get over" Because, answered I, "no one wanted to force you under---" I would give a guinea to be a reasonable man---good sound sense---a says what he thinks, and does what he says man--- and did not take snuff. They say men near death however mad they may have been, come to their senses---I hope I shall here in this letter--- there is a decent space to be very sensible in---many a good proverb has been in less---nay, I have heard of the statutes at large being chang'd into the Statutes at Small and printed for a watch paper. Your sisters by this time must have got the Devonshire ees---short ees---you know 'em---they are the prettiest ees in the Language. O how I admire the middle-siz'd delicate Devonshire girls of about 15. There was one at an Inn door holding a quartern of brandy---the very thought of her kept me warm a whole stage---and a 16 miler too--- "You'll pardon me for being jocular." Ever your affectionate friend John Keats--- Address : To Mr Richd Woodhouse  8. Duke Street  Bath. Postmark : WINCHESTER 22 SE 1819 Tuesday--- Dear Woodhouse, If you see what I have said to Reynolds before you come to your own dose you will put it between the bars unread; provided they have begun fires in Bath--- I should like a bit of fire to night---one likes a bit of fire---How glorious the Blacksmiths' shops look now. I stood to night before one till I was verry near listing for one. Yes I should like a bit of fire---at a distance about 4 feet 'not quite hob nob'  794 \---as wordsworth says. The fact was I left Town on Wednesday---determined to be in a hurry. You don't eat travelling---you're wrong---beef---beef---I like the look of a sign. The Coachman's face says eat eat, eat. I never feel more contemptible than when I am sitting by a goodlooking coachman. One is nothing ---Perhaps I eat to persuade myself I am somebody. You must be when slice after slice---but it wont do---the Coachman nibbles a bit of bread---he's favour'd---he's had a Call---a Hercules Methodist---Does he live by bread alone? O that I were a Stage Manager---perhaps that's as old as 'doubling the Cape.'"How are ye old 'un? hey! why dont'e speak?' O that I had so sweet a Breast to sing as the Coachman hath!  795 I'd give a penny for his Whistle---and bow to the Girls on the road---Bow--- nonsense---'tis a nameless graceful slang action. Its effect on the women suited to it must be delightful. It touches 'em in the ribs---en passant--- very off hand---very fine---Sed thongum formosa vale vale inquit Heigh ho la!  796 You like Poetry better---so you shall have some I was going to give Reynolds. Season of Mists and mellow fruitfulness, Close bosom friend of the maturing sun; Conspiring with him how to load and bless The vines with fruit that round the thatch eaves run; To bend with apples the moss'd cottage trees, And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core; To swell the gourd, and plump the hazle-shells With a white kernel; to set budding more, And still more later flowers for the bees Untill they think warm days will never cease For summer has o'er brimm'd their clammy Cells. Who hath not seen thee oft, amid thy store  797 ? Sometimes, whoever seeks abroad may find Thee sitting careless on a granary floor, Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind; Or on a half reap'd furrow sound asleep, Dased with the fume of poppies, while thy hook Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers; And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep Steady  798 thy laden head across a brook; Or by a Cyder press, with patient look, Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours. Where are the songs of spring? Aye, Where are they? Think not of them, thou hast thy music too. While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day And touch the stubble plains with rosy hue: Then in a wailful quire the small gnats mourn Among the river sallows, borne aloft Or sinking as the light wind lives and dies; And full grown Lambs loud bleat from hilly bourne: Hedge crickets sing, and now with treble soft The Redbreast whistles from a garden Croft And gather'd Swallows twitter in the Skies---  799 I will give you a few lines from Hyperion on account of a word in the last line of a fine sound--- Mortal! that thou may'st understand aright I humanize my sayings to thine ear, Making comparisons of earthly things; Or thou might'st better listen to the wind Though it blows legend-laden th rough the trees.  800  I think you will like the following description of the Temple of Saturn--- I look'd around upon the carved sides Of an old Sanctuary, with roof august Builded so high, it seem'd that filmed clouds Might sail beneath, as o'er the stars of heaven. So old the place was I remember none The like upon the earth; what I had seen Of grey Cathedrals, buttress'd walls, rent towers The superannuations of sunk realms, Or nature's rocks hard toil'd in winds and waves, Seem'd but the failing of decrepit things To that eternal-domed monument. Upon the marble, at my feet, there lay Store of strange vessels and large draperies Which needs had been of dyed asbestus wove, Or in that place the moth could not corrupt, So white the linen, so, in some, distinct Ran imageries from a sombre loom. All in a mingled heap confused there lay Robes, golden tongs, censer and chasing dish Girdles, and chains and holy jewelries. Turning from these, with awe once more I rais'd My eyes to fathom the space every way; The embossed roof, the silent massive range Of Columns north and south, ending in Mist Of nothing; then to the eastward where black gates Were shut against the Sunrise evermore.  801  I see I have completely lost my direction. So I e'n make you pay double postage. I had begun a Sonnet in french of Ronsard---on my word 'tis verry capable of poetry  802 \---I was stop'd by a circumstance not worth mentioning ---I intended to call it La Platonique Chevalresque ---I like the second line--- Non ne suis si audace a languire De m'empresser au coeur vos tendres mains. &c Here is what I had written for a sort of induction--- Fanatics have their dreams wherewith they weave A Paradise for a Sect; the savage too From forth the loftiest fashion of his sleep Guesses at Heaven: pity these have not Trac'd upon vellum or wild indian leaf The shadows of melodious utterance: But bare of laurel they live, dream, and die, For Poesy alone can tell her dreams, With the fine spell of words alone can save Imagination from the sable charm And dumb enchantment.  803  My Poetry will never be fit for any thing it does n't cover its ground well. You see he she is off her guard and does n't move a peg though Prose is coming up in an awkward style enough. Now a blow in the spondee will finish her---But let it get over this line of circumvallation  804 if it can. These are unpleasant Phrases.  Now for all this you two must write me a letter apiece--- for as I know you will interread one another. I am still writing to Reynolds as well as yourself. As I say to George I am writing to you but at your Wife---  805 And don't forget to tell Reynolds of the fairy tale Undine.  806 Ask him if he has read any of the American Brown's  807 novels that Hazlitt speaks so much of---I have read one call'd Wieland---very powerful---something like Godwin. Between Schiller and Godwin. A Domestic prototype of S chiller's Armenian.  808 More clever in plot and incident than Godwin. A strange american scion of the German trunk. Powerful genius--- accomplish'd horrors---I shall proceed tomorrow. Wednesday ---I am all in a Mess here---embowell'd in Winchester. I wrote two Letters to Brown one from said Place, and one from London, and neither of them has reach'd him.  809 I have written him a long one this morning and am so perplex'd as to be an object to Curiosity to you quiet People. I hire myself a show waggan and trumpetour. Here's the wonderful Man whose Letters wont go!---All the infernal imaginarry thunderstorms from the Post office are beating upon me---so that 'unpoeted I write."  810 Some curious body has detained my Letters. I am sure of it. They know not what to make of me---not an acquaintance in the Place---what can I be about? so they open my Letters. Being in a lodging house, and not so self will'd, but I am a little cowardly I dare not spout my rage against the Ceiling. Besides I should be run through the Body by the major in the next room. I don't think his wife would attempt such a thing.  811 Now I am going to be serious. After revolving certain circumstances in my Mind; chiefly connected with a late american letter I have determined to take up my abode in a cheap Lodging in Town and get employment in some of our elegant Periodical Works. I will no longer live upon hopes. I shall carry my plan into execution speedily---I shall live in Westminster---from which a walk to the British Museum will be noisy and muddy---but otherwise pleasant enough I shall enquire of Hazlitt how the figures of the market stand. O that I could write something agrestunal, pleasant, fountanvoic'd ---not plague you with unconnected nonsense--- But things won't leave me alone . I shall be in Town as soon as either of you. I only wait for an answer from Brown: if he receives mine which is now a very moot point. I will give you a few reasons why I shall persist in not publishing The Pot of Basil. It is too smokeable. I can get it smoak'd at the Carpenters shaving chimney much more cheaply--- There is too much inexperience of live   for life , and simplicity of knowledge in it---which might do very well after one's death---but not while one is alive. There are very few would look to the reality. I intend to use more finesse with the Public. It is possible to write fine things which cannot be laugh'd at in any way. Isabella is what I should call were I a reviewer 'A weak-sided Poem'with an amusing sober-sadness about it. Not that I do not think Reynolds and you are quite right about it---it is enough for me. But this will not do to be public. If I may so say, in my dramatic capacity I enter fully into the feeling: but in Propria Persona I should be apt to quiz it myself---There is no objection of this kind to Lamia---A good deal to St. Agnes Eve---only not so glaring---Would as I say I could write you something sylvestran. But I have no time to think: I am an otiosus-peroccupatus Man. I think upon crutches, like the folks in your Pump room. Have you seen old Bramble  812 yet---they say he's on his last legs. The gout did not treat the old Man well so the Physician superseded it, and put the dropsy in office, who gets very fat upon his new employment, and behaves worse than the other to the old Man ---But he'll have his house about his ears soon. We shall have another fall of Siege-arms. I suppose Mrs Humphrey  813 persists in a big-belley---poor thing she little thinks how she is spoiling the corners of her mouth---and making her nose quite a piminy. Mr Humphrey I hear was giving a Lecture in the gaming-room ---when some one call'd out Spousey! I hear too he has received a challenge from a gentleman who lost that evening. The fact is Mr H. is a mere nothing out of his Bedroom.  814 Old Tabitha died in being bolstered up for a whist-party. They had to cut again---Chowder died long ago---Mrs H. laments that the last last time they put him (i.e. to breed) he didn't take. They say he was a direct descendent of Cupid and Veney in the Spectator. This may be eisily known by the Parish Books. If you do not write in the course of a day or two---direct to me at Rice's. Let me know how you pass your times and how you are. Your sincere friend John Keats--- Hav'nt heard from Taylor--- Address : Charles W. Dilke Esqre  Navy Pay Office  Somerset House London. No postmark. 815 Winchester Wednesday Eve. My dear Dilke, Whatever I take too for the time I cannot leave off in a hurry; letter writing is the go now; I have consumed a Quire at least. You must give me credit, now, for a free Letter when it is in reality an interested one, on two points, the one requestive, the other verging to the pros and cons--- As I expect they will lead me to seeing and conferring with you in a short time, I shall not enter at all upon a letter I have lately received  816 from george of not the most comfortable intelligence: but proceed to these two points, which if you can theme out in sexions and subsexions,  817 for my edification, you will oblige me. The first I shall begin upon, the other will follow like a tail to a Comet. I have written to Brown on the subject, and can but go over the same Ground with you in a very short time, it not being more in length than the ordinary paces between the Wickets. It concerns a resolution I have taken to endeavour to acquire something by temporary writing in periodical works. You must agree with me how unwise it is to keep feeding upon hopes, which depending so much on the state of temper and imagination, appear gloomy or bright, near or afar off just as it happens---Now an act has three parts---to act, to do, and to perform  818 \---I mean I should do something for my immediate welfare---Even if I am swept away like a Spider from a drawing room I am determined to spin---home spun any thing for sale. Yea I will traf fic. Any thing but Mortgage  819 my Brain to Blackwood. I am determined not to lay ie like a dead lump.  820 If Reynolds had not taken to the law, would he not be earning something? Why cannot I. You may say I want tact---that is easily acquired. You may be up to the slang of a cock pit in three battles. It is fortunate I have not before this been tempted to venture on the common. I should a year or two ago have spoken my mind on every subject with the utmost simplicity. I hope I have learnt a little better and am confident I shall be able to cheat as well as any literary Jew of the Market and shine up an article on any thing without much knowledge of the subject, aye like an orange. I would willingly have recourse to other means. I cannot; I am fit for nothing but literature. Wait for the issue of this Tragedy? No---there cannot be greater uncertainties east west, north, and south than concerning dramatic composition. How many months must I wait! Had I not better begin to look about me now? If better events supersede this necessity what harm will be done? I have no trust whatever on Poetry. I dont wonder at it--- the marvel it  for is  to me how people read so much of it. I think you will see the reasonableness of my plan. To forward it I purpose living in cheap Lodging in Town, that I may be in the reach of books and information, of which there is here a plentiful lack.  821 If I can find any place tolerably comfortable I will settle myself and fag till I can afford to buy Pleasure---which if I never can afford I must go without. Talking of Pleasure, this moment I was writing with one hand, and with the other holding to my Mouth a Nectarine---good god how fine. It went down soft pulpy, slushy, oozy---all its delicious embonpoint melted down my throat like a large beatified Strawberry. I shall certainly breed. Now I come to my request. Should you like me for a neighbour again? Come, plump it out, I wont blush. I should also be in the neighbourhood of Mrs Wylie, which I should be glad of, though that of course does not influence me. Therefore will you look about Marsham, or rodney  822 street for a couple of rooms for me. Rooms like the gallants legs in massingers time "as good as the times allow, Sir." I have written to day to Reynolds, and to Woodhouse. Do you know him? He is a Friend of Taylors at whom Brown has taken one of his funny odd dislikes. I'm sure he's wrong, because Woodhouse likes my Poetry---conclusive. I ask your opinion and yet I must say to you as to him, Brown that if you have any thing to say against it I shall be as obstinate &heady as a Radical. By the Examiner coming in your hand writing you must be in Town. They have put me into spirits: Notwithstanding my aristocratic temper I cannot help being verry much pleas'd with the present public proceedings. I hope sincerely I shall be able to put a Mite of help to the Liberal side of the Question before I die. If you should have left Town again (for your Holidays cannot be up yet) let me know ---when this is forwarded to you---A most extraordinary mischance has befallen two Letters I wrote Brown  823 \---one from London whither I was obliged to go on business for George;  824 the other from this place since my return. I cant make it out. I am excessively sorry for it. I shall hear from Brown and from you almost together for I have sent him a Letter to day: you must positively agree with me or by the delicate toe nails of the virgin I will not open your Letters. If they are as David says 'suspicious looking letters"  825 I wont open them. If St. John had been half as cunning he might have seen the revelations comfortably in his own room, without giving Angels the trouble of breaking open seals.  826 Remember me to Mrs D.---and the Westmonisteranian and believe me Ever your sincere friend John Keats--- Address and postmark not recorded. Winchester 23 September 1819. ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Now I am going to enter on the subject of self. It is quite time I should set myself doing something, and live no longer upon hopes. I have never yet exerted myself. I am getting into an idle-minded, vicious way of life, almost content to live upon others. In no period of my life have I acted with any self-will, but in throwing up the apothecary profession. That I do not repent of. Look at Reynolds,  827 if he was not in the law, he would be acquiring, by his abilities, something towards his support. My occupation is entirely literary: I will do so, too. I will write, on the liberal side of the question, for whoever will pay me. I have not known yet what it is to be diligent. I purpose living in town in a cheap lodging, and endeavouring, for a beginning, to get the theatricals of some paper. When I can afford to compose deliberate poems, I will. I shall be in expectation of an answer to this. Look on my side of the question. I am convinced I am right. Suppose the tragedy should succeed,---there will be no harm done. And here I will take an opportunity of making a remark or two on our friendship, and on all your good offices to me. I have a natural timidity of mind in these matters; liking better to take the feeling between us for granted, than to speak of it. But, good God! what a short while you have known me! I feel it a sort of duty thus to recapitulate, however unpleasant it may be to you. You have been living for others more than any man I know. This is a vexation to me, because it has been depriving you, in the very prime of your life, of pleasures which it was your duty to procure. As I am speaking in general terms, this may appear nonsense; you, perhaps, will not understand it; but if you can go over, day by day, any month of the last year, you will know what I mean. On the whole, however, this is a subject that I cannot express myself upon. I speculate upon it frequently; and, believe me, the end of my speculations is always an anxiety for your happiness. This anxiety will not be one of the least incitements to the plan I purpose pursuing. I had got into a habit of mind of looking towards you as a help in all difficulties. This very habit would be the parent of idleness and difficulties. You will see it is a duty I owe myself to break the neck of it. I do nothing for my subsistence---make no exertion. At the end of another year you shall applaud me, not for verses, but for conduct. If you live at Hampstead next winter---I like ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) and I cannot help it. On that account I had better not live there. While I have some immediate cash, 828 I had better settle myself quietly, and fag on as others do. I shall apply to Hazlitt, who knows the market as well as any one, for something to bring me in a few pounds as soon as possible. I shall not suffer my pride to hinder me. The whisper may go round; I shall not hear it. If I can get an article in the 'Edinburgh,' I will. One must not be delicate. Nor let this disturb you longer than a moment. I look forward with a good hope that we shall one day be passing free, untrammelled, unanxious time together. That can never be if I continue a dead lump.  829 ... I shall be expecting anxiously an answer from you. If if does not arrive in a few days this will have miscarried, and I shall come straight to Bedhampton? before I go to town, which you, I am sure, will agree had better be done while I still have some ready cash. By the middle of October I shall expect you in London. We will then set at the theatres. If you have anything to gainsay, I shall be even as the deaf adder which stopeth her ears.  830 ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Address and postmark not recorded.

Imaginary grievances have always been more my torment than real ones. You know this well. Real ones will never have any other effect upon me than to stimulate me to get out of or avoid them. This is easily accounted for. Our imaginary woes are conjured up by our passions, and are fostered by passionate feeling: our real ones come of themselves, and are opposed by an abstract exertion of mind. Real grievances are displacers of passion. The imaginary nail a man down for a sufferer, as on a cross; the real spur him up into an agent.  832 I wish, at one view, you would see my heart towards you. 'Tis only from a high tone of feeling that I can put that word upon paper---out of poetry. I ought to have waited for your answer to my last  833 before I wrote this. I felt, however, compelled to make a rejoinder to yours. I had written to Dilke  834 on the subject of my last, I scarcely know whether I shall send my letter now. I think he would approve of my plan; it is so evident. Nay, I am convinced, out and out, that by prosing for a while in periodical works, I may maintain myself decently. ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) No address or postmark. Winchester Septr Friday. My dear George, I was closely employed in reading and composition, in this place, whither I had come from Shanklin, for the convenience of a library, when I received your last, dated July 24th. You will have seen by the short Letter I wrote from Shanklin  835 how matters stand between us and Mrs Jennings. They had not at all mov'd and I knew no way of overcoming the inveterate obstinacy of our affairs. On receiving your last I immediately took a place in the same night's coach for London.  836 Mr Abbey behaved extremely well to me, appointed Monday evening at 7 to meet me and observed that he should drink tea at that hour. I gave him the inclosed note  837 and showed him the last leaf of yours to me. He really appeared anxious about it; promised he would forward your money as quickly as possible. I think I mention'd that Walton  838 was dead---He will apply to Mr Gliddon the partner; endeavour to get rid of Mrs Jennings's claim and be expeditious. He has received an answer from my Letter to Fry  839 \---that is something. We are certainly in a very low estate: I say we, for I am in such a situation that were it not for the assistance of Brown & Taylor I must be as badly off as a Man can be. I could not raise any sum by the promise of any Poem---no, not by the mortgage of my intellect. We must wait a little while. I really have hopes of success. I have finish'd a Tragedy  840 which if it succeeds will enable me to sell what I may have in manuscript to a good advantage. I have pass'd my time in reading, writing and fretting---the last I intend to give up and stick to the other two. They are the only chances of benefit to us. Your wants will be a fresh spur  841 to me. I assure you you shall more than share what I can get, whilst I am still young---the time may come when age will make me more selfish. I have not been well treated by the world---and yet I have capitally well. I do not know a Person to whom so many purse strings would fly open as to me---if I could possibly take advantage of them---which I cannot do for none of the owners of these purses are rich. Your present situation I will not suffer myself to dwell upon---when misfortunes are so real we are glad enough to escape them, and the thought of them. I cannot help thinking Mr Audubon  842 a dishonest man. Why did he make you believe that he was a Man of Property? How is it his circumstances have altered so suddenly? In truth I do not believe you fit to deal with the world, or at least the american world.  843 But good God--- who can avoid these chances---You have done your best--- Take matters as coolly as you can, and confidently expecting help from England, act as if no help was nigh. Mine I am sure is a tolerable tragedy---it would have been a bank to me, if just as I had finish'd it I had not heard of Kean's resolution to go to America. That was the worst news I could have had. There is no actor can do the principal character  844 besides Kean. At Covent Garden there is a great chance of its being damn'd. Were it to succeed even there it would lift me out of the mire. I mean the mire of a bad reputation which is continually rising against me. My name with the literary fashionables is vulgar---I am a weaver boy  845 to them---a Tragedy would lift me out of this mess. And mess it is as far as it regards our Pockets. But be not cast down any more than I am; I feel I can bear real ills better than imaginary ones.  846 Whenever I find myself growing vapourish, I rouse myself, wash and put on a clean shirt brush my hair and clothes, tie my shoe-strings neatly and in fact adonize as I were going out--- then all clean and comfortable I sit down to write.  847 This I find the greatest relief---Besides I am becoming accustom'd to the privations of the pleasures of sense. In the midst of the world I live like a Hermit. I have forgot how to lay plans for enjoyment of any Pleasure. I feel I can bear any thing,---any misery, even imprisonment---so long as I have neither wife nor child. Perhaps you will say yours are your only comfort--- they must be. I return'd to Winchester the day before yesterday  848 and am now here alone, for Brown some days before I left, went to Bedhampton and there he will be for the next fortnight. The term of his house  849 will be up in the middle of next month when we shall return to Hampstead. On Sunday I dined with your Mother and Hen and Charles in Henrietta Street---Mrs and Miss Millar were in the Country. Charles had been but a few days returned from Paris. I dare say you will have letters expressing the motives of his Journey. Mrs Wylie and Miss Waldegrave seem as quiet as two Mice there alone. I did not show your last---I thought it better not. For better times will certainly come and why should they be unhappy in the meantime. On Monday Morning I went to Walthamstow. Fanny look'd better than I had seen her for some time. She complains of my not hearing from you appealing to me as if it was half my fault. I had been so long in retirement that London appeared a very odd place. I could not make out I had so many acquaintance, and it was a whole day before I could feel among Men. I had another strange sensation there was not one house I felt any pleasure to call at. Reynolds was in the Country and saving himself I am prejudiced against all that family.  850 Dilke and his wife and child were in the Country. Taylor was at Nottingham. I was out and every body was out. I walk'd about the Streets as in a strange land. Rice was the only one at home. I pass'd some time with him. I know him better since we have liv'd a month together in the isle of Wight. He is the most sensible, and even wise Man I know---he has a few John Bull prejudices; but they improve him. His illness is at times alarming. We are great friends, and there is no one I like to pass a day with better. Martin call'd in to bid him good bye before he set out for Dublin. If you would like to hear one of his jokes here is one which at the time we laugh'd at a good deal. A Miss--- with three young Ladies, one of them Martin's sister had come a gadding in the Isle of wight and took for a few days a Cottage opposite ours---we dined with them one day, and as I was saying they had fish. Miss---said she thought they tasted of the boat . No says Martin very seriously they haven't been kept long enough. I saw Haslam he is very much occupied with love and business being one of Mr Saunders executors and Lover to a young woman. He show'd me her Picture by Severn. I think she is, though not very cunning, too cunning for him. Nothing strikes me so forcibly with a sense of the rediculous as love.  851 A Man in love I do think cuts the sorryest figure in the world. Even when I know a poor fool to be really in pain about it, I could burst out laughing in his face. His pathetic visage becomes irrisistable. Not that I take Haslam as a pattern for Lovers---he is a very worthy man and a good friend. His love is very amusing. Somewhere in the Spectator is related an account of a Man inviting a party of stutter ers and squinters to his table. 't would please me more to scrape together a party of Lovers, not to dinner---not to tea. There would be no fighting as among Knights of old. Pensive they sit, and roll their languid eyes. Nibble their toasts, and cool their tea with sighs, Or else forget the purpose of the night Forget their tea---forget their appetite. See with cross'd arms they sit---ah hapless crew The fire is going out, and no one rings For coals, and therefore no coals betty brings. A Fly is in the milk pot---must he die Circled by a humane Society? No no there Mr Werter  852 takes his spoon Inverts it---dips the handle and lo, soon The little struggler sav'd from perils dark Across the teaboard draws a long wet mark. Romeo! Arise! take Snuffers by the handle There's a large Cauliflower in each candle. A winding-sheet---Ah me! I must away To no 7 just beyond the Circus gay. 'Alas! my friend! your Coat sits very well: Where may your Taylor live?' 'I may not tell--- 'O pardon me---I'm absent: now and then." Where might my Taylor live?---I say again I cannot tell---let me no more be teas'd--- He lives in wapping might live where he pleasd. You see I cannot get on without writing as boys do at school a few nonsense verses. I begin them and before I have written six the whim has pass'd---if there is any thing deserving so respectable a name in them. I shall put in a bit of information any where just as it strikes me. Mr Abbey is to write to me as soon as he can bring matters to bear and then I am to go to Town to tell him the means of forwarding to you through Capper and Hazlewood. I wonder I did not put this before. I shall go on to-morrow---it is so fine now I must take a bit of a walk. Saturday 18 September\--- With my inconstant disposition it is no wonder that this morning, amid all our bad times and misfortunes, I should feel so alert and well spirited. At this moment you are perhaps in a very different state of Mind. It is because my hopes are very paramount to my despair. I have been reading over a part of a short poem I have composed lately call'd 'Lamia'---and I am certain there is that sort of fire in it which must take hold of people in some way--- give them either pleasant or unpleasant sensation. What they want is a sensation of some sort. I wish I could pitch the Key of your spirits as high as mine is--- but your organ loft is beyond the reach of my voice. I admire the exact admeasurement of my niece in your Mother's letter---O the little span long elf.  853 I am not in the least a judge of the proper weight and size of an infant. Never trouble yourselves about that: she is sure to be a fine woman. Let her have only delicate nails both on hands and feet and teeth as small as a May- fly's---who will live you his life on a square inch of oak-leaf. And nails she must have quite different from the market women here who plough into the butter and make a quarter pound taste of it. I intend to write a letter to your Wifie and there I may say more on this little plump subject---I hope she's plump. 'Still harping on my daughter'  854 This Winchester is a place tolerably well suited to me; there is a fine Cathedral, a College, a Roman-Catholic Chapel, a Methodist do, an independent do,---and there is not one loom or any thing like manufacturing beyond bread & butter in the whole City. There are a number of rich Catholics in the place. It is a respectable, ancient aristocratical place---and moreover it contains a nunnery. Our set are by no means so hail fellow, well met, on literary subjects as we were wont to be. Reynolds has turn'd to the law. By the bye, he brought out a little piece at the Lyceum call'd one, two, three, four, by advertisement. 855 It met with complete success. The meaning of this odd title is explained when I tell you the principal actor is a mimic who takes off four of our best performers in the course of the farce. Our Stage is loaded with mimics. I did not see the Piece being out of Town the whole time it was in progress. Dilke is entirely swallowed up in his boy: 'tis really lamentable to what a pitch he carries a sort of parental mania. I had a Letter from him at Shanklin. He went on a word or two about the isle of Wight which is a bit of  a hobby horse of his; but he soon deviated to his boy. 'I am sitting' says he "at the window expecting my Boy from School." I suppose I told you somewhere that he lives in Westminster, and his boy goes to the School there, where he gets beaten, and every bruise he has and I dare say deserves is very bitter to Dilke. The Place I am speaking of, puts me in mind of a circumstance which occurred lately at Dilkes. I think it very rich and dramatic and quite illustrative of the little quiet fun that he will enjoy sometimes. First I must tell you their house is at the corner of Great Smith Street, so that some of the windows look into one Street, and the back windows into another round the corner. Dilke had some old people to dinner, I know not who---but there were two old ladies among them--- Brown was there---they had known him from a Child. Brown is very pleasant with old women, and on that day, it seems, behaved himself so winningly they  for that  they became hand and glove together and a little complimentary. Brown was obliged to depart early. He bid them good bye and pass'd into the passage---no sooner was his back turn'd than the old women began lauding him. When Brown had reach'd the Street door and was just going, Dilke threw up the Window and call'd: 'Brown! Brown! They say you look younger than ever you did!' Brown went on and had just turn'd the corner into the other street when Dilke appeared at the back window crying "Brown! Brown! By God, they say you're handsome!" You see what a many words it requires to give any identity to a thing I could have told you in half a minute. I have been reading lately Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy; and I think you will be very much amused with a page I here coppy for you. I call it a Feu de joie round the batteries of Fort St. Hyphen-de-Phrase on the birthday of the Digamma. The whole alphabet was drawn up in a Phalanx on the cover of an old Dictionary. Band playing "Amo, Amas, &c." "Every Lover admires his Mistress, though she be very deformed of herself, ill-favored, wrinkled, pimpled, pale, red, yellow, tann'd, tallow-fac'd, have a swoln juglers platter face, or a thin, lean, chitty face, have clouds in her face, be crooked, dry, bald, goggle-eyed, blear-eyed or with staring eyes, she looks like a squis'd cat, hold her head still awry, heavy, dull, hollow-eyed, black or yellow about the eyes, or squint-eyed, sparrow-mouth'd, Persean hooknosed, have a sharp fox nose, a red nose, China flat, great nose, nare simo patuloque, a nose like a promontory gubber-tush'd, rotten teeth, black, uneven, brown teeth, beetle-brow'd, a witches beard, her breath stink all over the room, her nose drop winter and summer, with a Bavarian poke under her chin, a sharp chin, lave-eared, with a long crane's neck, which stands awry too, pendulis mammis, her dugs like two double jugs, or else no dugs in the other extream, bloody falln fingers, she have filthy, long, unpaired, nails, scabbed hands or wrists, a tan'd skin, a rotton carcass, crooked back, she stoops, is lame, splea footed, as slender in the middle as a cow in the wast, gowty legs, her ankles hang over her shooes, her feet stink, she breed lice, a meer changeling, a very monster, an aufe imperfect, her whole complexion savors, an harsh voice, incondite gesture, vile gate, a vast virago, or an ugly tit, a slug, a fat fustilugs, a trusse, a long lean raw- bone, a Skeleton, a Sneaker (si qua latent  856 meliora puta) and to thy Judgement looks like a mard in a Lanthorn, whom thou couldst not fancy for a world, but hatest, loathest, and wouldst have spit in her face, or blow thy nose in her bosom, remedium amoris to another man, a dowdy, a Slut, a scold, a nasty rank, rammy, filthy, beastly quean, dishonest peradventure, obscene, base, beggarly, rude, foolish, untaught---peevish, Irus' daughter, Thersite's sister, Grobian's Scholler; if he love her once, he admires her for all this, he takes no notice of any such errors or imperfections of boddy or mind." There's a dose for you---fine!! I would give my favourite leg to have written this as a speech in a Play: with what effect could Matthews pop-gun it at the pit! This I think will amuse you more than so much Poetry. Of that I do not like to copy any as I am affraid it is too mal apropos for you at present---and yet I will send you some---for by the time you receive it things in England may have taken a different turn. When I left Mr Abbey on monday evening I walk'd up Cheapside but returned to put some letters in the Post and met him again in Bucklersbury: we walk'd together through the Poultry as far as the hatter's shop he has some concern in. He spoke of it in such a way to me, I thought he wanted me to make an offer to assist him in it. I do believe if I could be a hatter I might be one.  857 He seems anxious about me. He began blowing up Lord Byron while I was sitting with him, however says he the fellow says true things now & then; at which he took up a Magasine and read me some extracts from Don Juan, (Lord Byron's last flash poem) and particularly one against literary ambition. I do think I must be well spoken of among sets, for Hodgkinson is more than polite, and the coffee-german  858 endeavour'd to be very close to me the other night at covent garden where I went at half-price before I tumbled into bed. Every one however distant an acquaintance behaves in the most conciliating manner to me. You will see I speak of this as a matter of interest. On the next sheet I will give you a little politics. In every age there has been in England for some two or three centuries subjects of great popular interest on the carpet: so that however great the uproar one can scarcely prophesy any material change in the government, for as loud disturbances have agitated this country many times. All civilized countries become gradually more enlighten'd and there should be a continual change for the better. Look at this Country at present and remember it when it was even thought impious to doubt the justice of a trial by Combat. From that time there has been a gradual change. Three great changes have been in progress---First for the better, next for the worse, and a third time for the better once more. The first was the gradual annihilation of the tyranny of the nobles, when Kings found it their interest to conciliate the common people, elevate them and be just to them. Just when baronial Power ceased and before standing armies were so dangerous, Taxes were few, Kings were lifted by the people over the heads of their nobles, and those people held a rod over Kings. The change for the worse in Europe was again this. The obligation of Kings to the Multitude began to be forgotten. Custom had made noblemen the humble servants of Kings. Then Kings turned to the Nobles as the adorners of their power, the slaves of it, and from the people as creatures continually endeavouring to check them. Then in every Kingdom there was a long struggle of Kings to destroy all popular privileges. The english were the only people in europe who made a grand kick at this. They were slaves to Henry 8th but were freemen under william 3rd at the time the french were abject slaves under Lewis 14th. The example of England, and the liberal writers of france and england sowed the seed of opposition to this Tyranny---and it was swelling in the ground till it burst out in the french revolution. That has had an unlucky termination. It put a stop to the rapid progress of free sentiments in England; and gave our Court hopes of turning back to the despotism of the 16 century. They have made a handle of this event in every way to undermine our freedom. They spread a horrid superstition against all innovation and improvement. The present struggle in England of the people is to destroy this superstition. What has rous'd them to do it is their distresses---Perhaps on this account the present distresses of this nation are a fortunate thing---tho so horrid in their experience. You will see I mean that the french Revolution but  for put  a temporary stop to this third change, the change for the better. Now it is in progress again and I thing in  for think it  an effectual one. This is no contest between whig and tory--- but between right and wrong. There is scarcely a grain of party spirit now in England. Right and Wrong considered by each man abstractedly is the fashion. I know very little of these things. I am convinced however that apparently small causes make great alterations. There are little signs whereby we many know how matters are going on. This makes the business about Carlisle  859 the Bookseller of great moment in my mind. He has been selling deistical pamphlets, republished Tom Payne  860 and many other works held in superstitious horror. He even has been selling for some time immense numbers of a work called 'The Deist' which comes out in weekly numbers. For this Conduct he I think has had above a dozen inditements issued against him; for which he has found Bail to the amount of many thousand Pounds. After all they are affraid to prosecute: they are affraid of his defence: it would be published in all the papers all over the Empire: they shudder at this: the Trials would light a flame they could not extinguish. Do you not think this of great import? You will hear by the papers of the proceedings at Manchester and Hunt's triumphal entry into London.  861 It would take me a whole day and a quire of paper to give you any thing like detail. I will merely mention that it is calculated that 30,000 people were in the streets waiting for him---The whole distance from the Angel Islington to the Crown and anchor was lined with Multitudes. As I pass'd Colnaghi's window I saw a profil Portrait of Sands 862 the destroyer of Kotzebue. His very look must interest every one in his favour. I suppose they have represented him in his college dress. He seems to me like a young Abelard---A fine Mouth, cheek bones (and this is no joke) full of sentiment; a fine unvulgar nose and plump temples. On looking over some Letters I found the one I wrote intended for you from the foot of Helvellyn to Liverpool---but you had sail'd and therefore It was returned to me. It contained among other nonsense an Acrostic of my Sister's name---and a pretty long name it is. I wrote it in a great hurry which you will see. Indeed I would not copy it if I thought it would ever be seen by any but yourselves--- Give me your patience Sister while I frame Exact in Capitals your golden name: Or sue the fair apollo and he will Rouse from his heavy slumber and instill Great love in me for thee and Poesy. Imagine not that greatest mastery And Kingdom over all the Realms of verse Nears more to Heaven in aught than when we nurse And surety give to love and Brotherhood. Anthropophagi in Othello's mood; Ulysses stormed, and his enchanted belt Glow with the Muse, but they are never felt Unbosom'd so and so eternal made, Such tender insence in their Laurel shade, To all the regent sisters of the Nine, As this poor offering to you sister mine. Kind Sister! aye, this third name says you are; Enchanted has it been the Lord knows where. And may it taste to you like good old wine Take you to real happiness and give Sons daughters and a home like honied hive. Foot of Helvellyn June 27--- I sent you in my first Packet some of my scotch Letters. I find I have one kept back which was written in the most interesting part of our Tour, and will copy parts of it in the hope you will not find it unamusing. I would give now any thing for Richardson's power of making mountains of mole hills. Incipit Epistola Caledoniensa , Dunancullen  863 \---I did not know the day of the month for I find I have not dated it---Brown must have been asleep. "Just after my last had gone to the post (before I go any further I must premise that I would send the identical Letter inste ad of taking the trouble to copy it: I do not do so for it would spoil my notion of the neat manner in which I intend to fold these thin genteel sheets.  864 The original is written on course paper---and the soft ones would ride in the Postbag very uneasy; perhaps there might be a quarrel---) Just after my last had gone to the post, in came one of the Men with whom we endeavoured to agree about going to Staffa: He said what a pity it was we should turn aside and not see the curiosities. So we had a little talk and finally agreed that he should be our guide across the isle of Mull. We set out, cross'd two ferries, one to the isle of Kerrara of a short distance; the other from Kerrara to Mull 9 miles across. We did it in forty minutes with a fine breeze. The road, or rather the track through the Island is the most dreary you can think of; between dreary mountains; over bog and rock and river with our trowsers  865 tuck'd up and our stockings in hand. About eight o'Clock we arrived at a Shepherds Hut, into which we could scarcely get for the smoke through a door lower than my shoulders. We found our way into a little compartment, with the rafters and turf thatch blackened with Smoke---the earth floor full of hills and dales. We had some white bread with us, made a good supper and slept in our Clothes in some Blankets: our guide snored on another little bed about an arms length off. This next morning we have come about six  866 Miles to breakfast by rather a better path, and are now, by comparison, in a Mansion. Our Guide is a very obligind fellow. In our way this morning he sang us two gaelic songs---one made by a Mrs Brown on her husbands being drown'd; the other a jacobin one on Charles Stuart. For some days brown has been enquiring out his genealogy here. He thinks his Grandfather came from long island. He got a parcel of People at a Cottage door about him last evening: chatted with one  867 who had been a miss brown and who I think by the family likeness must have been a Relation. He talk'd  868 with the old woman pretty briskly, flattered a young one, kiss'd a child who was afraid of his Spectacles 'Scar'd at the silver rim and "oval glass"  869 \---, and finally drank a pint of Milk. They handled his spectacles as we do a sensitive leaf. July 26. 1818 We had a most wretched walk across the island of Mull and then we cross'd to Iona, or Icolmkil: from Icolmkil we took a boat at a Bargain to take us to Staffa, and after land us at the head of Loch Nakgal na Keal, whence we should only have to walk half the distance to Oban again and by a better road. All this is well pass'd and done with this singular piece of Luck, that there took place an intermission in the bad Weather just as we came in sight of Staffa, on which it is impossible to land but in a tolerably calm sea. But I will first mention Icolmkil. I know not whether you have heard much about this island; I never did before I was close to it. It is rich in the most interesting Antiquities. Who would expect to find the ruins of a fine Cathedral church; of Cloisters Colleges---Monastaries and nunneries in so remote an island? The beginning of these things was in the sixth Century under the Chaperonage  870 of a  871 Bishop-saint who landed from Ireland choosing this spot for its beauty; for at that time the now treeless place was covered with magnificent woods. His name was St. Columba---Now this saint Columba became the Dominic of the barbarian Christians of the North, and was fam'd also far South; but more especially was reverenced by the Scots, the Picts, the Norwegians and the Irish. In a course of years the island became to be considered the most holy ground of the North, and the ancient Kings of the forementioned nations chose it for their burial Place. We were shown a spot in the churchyard where they say 61 Kings are buried. 48 Scotch from Fergus 2nd to Mackbeth, 8 irish, 2  872 Norwegian, and I french. They lie in rows compact. Then we were shown other matters of later date but still very ancient. Many tombs of Highland Chieftains, there effigies in complete armour face upwards ---b1ack marble half covered with moss. There is in the ruins of the Church a Bishop on his monument as you see them in our cathedrals---as fine as any one I remember 873 \--- Abbots and Bishops of the islands always from one of the chief clans. There were plenty of Macleans and Macdonnels, among these latter the famous Macdonnel Lord of the Isles. There have been 300 crosses in the island: the Presbyterians destroyed all but two, one of which is a very fine one and entirely covered with a very deep coarse moss. The old Schoolmaster  874 an ignorant little man, but reckoned very clever, showed us these things. He is a Maclean and is as much above 4 foot as he is under 4 foot, three---He stops at one glass of Wiskey unless you press a second, and at the second unless you press a third. I am puzzled how to give you an Idea of Staffa. It can only be represented by a first rate drawing. One may compare the Surface of the island to a roof---the roof is supported by grand pillars of Basalt standing together as thick as honey combs. The finest thing is Fingal's cave: it is entirely a breaking away of basalt pillars. Suppose now the Giants, who came down to the daughters of Men,  875 had taken a whole mass of these Columns and bound them together like Bunches of Matches; and then with immense axes had made a Cavern in the body of these Columns. Such is fingal's cave except that the Sea has done this work of excavation and is continually dashing there. So that we walk along the sides of the Cave on the heads of the shortest pillars which are left as for convenient stairs. The roof is arch'd somewhat gothic wise, and the length of some of the entire pillars is 50 feet. About the island you might seat an army of men one man on the extremity of each pillar snapped off at different heights. The length of the Cave is 120 feet, and from its extremity the View of the Sea through the large Arch at the Entrance is very grand.  876 The colour of the columns is a sort of black with a lurking gloom of purple therein. For solemnity and grandeur it far surpasses the finest Cathedral. As we approached in the Boat there was such a fine swell of the sea that the columns seem'd rising immediately out of the waves--- it is impossible to describe it (I find I must keep memorandums of the verses I send you for I do not remember whether I have sent the following lines upon Staffa). I hope not't would be a horrid balk to you, especially after reading this dull specimen of description. For myself I hate descriptions. I would not send if  for it  were it not mine. Not Aladin magian Ever such a work began; Not the wizard of the Dee Ever such a dream could see; Not st. John in Patmos isle, In the Passion of his toil Gaz'd on such a rugged wonder! As I stood its roofing under Lo! I saw one sleeping there On the marble cold and bare, While the surges washed his feet And his garments white did beat, Drench'd, about the sombre rocks. On his neck his well-grown locks, Lifted dry above the main Were upon the curl again. 'What is this? And who art thou?' Whisper'd I and touch'd his brow. 'What art thou and what is this?' Whisper'd I and strove to kiss The spirit's hand to wake his eyes. Up he started in a thrice. 'I am Lycidas' said he 'Fam'd in funeral Minstrelsey This was architected thus By the great Oceanus: Here his mighty waters play Hollow organs all the day; Here by turns his Dolphins all Finny Palmers, great and small Come to pay devotion due,--- Each a Mouth of pearls must strew. Many Mortals of these days Dare to pass our sacred ways, Dare to see audaciously This Cathedral of the Sea. I have been the Pontif Priest Where the waters never rest, Where a fledgy sea-bird quire Soars for ever; holy fire Have I hid from mortal Man; Proteus is my Sacristan---  877 I ought to make a large Q  878 here: but I had better take the opportunity of telling you I have got rid of my haunting sore throat---and conduct myself in a manner not to catch another. You speak of Lord Byron and me---There is this great difference between us. He describes what he sees---I describe what I imagine. Mine is the hardest task. You see the immense difference. The Edinburgh review are affraid to touch upon my Poem. They do not know what to make of it---they do not like to condemn it and they will not praise it for fear---They are as shy of it as I should be of wearing a Quaker's hat. The fact is they have no real taste---they dare not compromise their Judgements on so puzzling a Question. If on my next Publication they should praise me and so lug in Endymion  879 \---I will address them in a manner they will not at all relish. The Cowardliness of the Edinburgh is worse than the abuse of the Quarterly. Monday 20 September\---This day is a grand day for winchester---they elect the Mayor. It was indeed high time the place should have some sort of excitement. There was nothing going on---all asleep---Not an old Maids Sedan returning from a card party---and if any old women have got tipsy at christenings they have not exposed themselves in the Street. The first night tho' of our arrival here there was a slight uproar took place at about ten of the clock. We heard distinctly a noise patting down the high street as of a walking cane of the good old dowager breed; and a little minute after we heard a less voice observe 'What a noise the ferril made'---it must be loose." Brown wanted to call the Constables, but I observed't was only a little breeze and would soon pass over. The side-Streets here are excessively maiden lady like. The door steps always fresh from the flannel. The Knockers have a very staid, serious, nay almost awful quietness about them. I never saw so quiet a collection of Lions and rams heads---The doors are most part black with a little brass handle just above the Key hole---so that you may easily shut yourself out of your own house--- he! he! There is none of your Lady Bellaston  880 rapping and ringing here--- no thundering-Jupiter footmen, no opera-trebble- tattoos--- but a modest lifting up of the knocker by a set of little wee old fingers that peep through the grey mittens, and a dying fall  881 thereof. The great beauty of Poetry is, that it makes every thing every place interesting---The palatine venice and the abbotine Winchester are equally interesting. Some time since I began a Poem call'd 'The Eve of St Mark quite in the spirit of Town quietude. I think it will give you the Sensation of walking about an old county Town in a coolish evening. I know not yet whether I shall ever finish it---I will give it as far as I have gone. Ut tibi placent ! Upon a Sabbath day it fell; Thrice holy was the sabbath bell That call'd the folk to evening prayer. The City Streets were clean and fair From wholesome drench of April rains, And on the western window pains The chilly sunset faintly told Of immaturd, green vallies cold, Of the green, thorny, bloomless hedge, Of Rivers new with spring tide sedge, Of Primroses by shelterd rills, And Daisies on the aguish hills. Thrice holy was the sabbath bell: The silent streets were crowded well With staid and pious companies Warm from their fireside oratries, And moving with demurest air To even song and vesper prayer. Each arched porch and entry low Was fill'd with patient crowd and slow, With whispers hush, and shuffling feet While play'd the organs loud and sweet. The Bells had ceas'd, the Prayers begun, And Bertha had not yet half done A curious volume, patch'd and torn, That all day long, from earliest morn, Had taken captive her fair eyes, Among its golden broideries:--- Perplex'd her with a thousand things--- The Stars of heaven, and Angels wings; Martyrs in a fiery blaze; Azure Saints 'mid silver rays; Aaron's  882 breastplate, and the seven Candlesticks John saw in heaven;  883 The winged Lion of Saint Mark, And the Covenantal Arck With its many Misteries Cherubim and golden Mice. Bertha was a Maiden fair, Dwelling in the old Minster square; From her fireside she could see Sidelong its rich antiquity, Far as the Bishop's garden wall, Where Sycamores and clm trees tall Full leav'd the forest had outstript, By no sharp north wind ever nipt, So sheltered by the mighty pile. Bertha arose, and read a while With forehead 'gainst the window pane,--- Again she tried, and then again, Until the dusk eve left her dark Upon the Legend of St. Mark. From pleated lawn-frill fine and thin She lifted up her soft warm chin With aching neck and swimming eyes, All daz'd with saintly imageries. All was gloom, and silent all, Save now and then the still footfall Of one returning homewards late Past the echoing minster gate. The clamourous daws that all the day Above tree tops and towers play, Pair by Pair had gone to rest, Each in their ancient belfry nest Where asleep they fall betimes To music of the drowsy chimes. All was silent, all was gloom Abroad and in the homely room;--- Down she sat, poor cheated soul, And struck a swart Lamp from the coal, Leaned forward with bright drooping hair And slant book full against the glare. Her shadow, in uneasy guise, Hover'd about, a giant size, On ceiling, beam, and old oak chair, The Parrot's cage and pannel square, And the warm-angled winter screne, On which were many monsters seen, Call'd, Doves of Siam, Lima Mice, And legless birds of Paradise, Macaw, and tender Av'davat, And silken-furr'd Angora Cat. Untir'd she read---her shadow still Glowerd about as it would fill The room with gastly forms and shades--- As though some ghostly Queen of Spades Had come to mock behind her back, And dance, and ruffle her garments black. Untir'd she read the Legend page Of holy Mark from youth to age, On Land, on Sea, in pagan-chains, Rejoicing for his many pains. Sometimes the learned Eremite With golden star, or daggar bright, Refer'd to pious poesies Written in smallest crow quill size Beneath the text and thus the rhyme Was parcell'd out from time to time: What follows is an imitation of the Authors in Chaucer's time---'tis more ancient than Chaucer himself and perhaps between him and Gower.  \---Als writeth he of swevenis Men han beforne they waken in blis, When that hir friendes thinke hem bounde In crimpide shroude farre under grounde: And how a litling childe mote be A Scainte er its natavitie, Gif that the modre (Gode her blesse) Kepen in Solitarinesse, And kissen devoute the holy croce. Of Goddis love and Sathan's force He writithe; and things many moe, Of swiche thinges I may not show, Bot I must tellen verilie Somedele of Sainte Cicilie, And chieflie what he auctoreth Of Sainte Markis life and dethe. I hope you will like this for all its Carelessness. I must take an opportunity here to observe that though I am writing to you I am all the while writing at your Wife.  884 This explanation will account for my speaking sometimes hoity-toityishly . Whereas if you were alone I should sport a little more sober sadness. I am like a squint Ing gentleman who saying soft things to one Lady ogles another ---or what is as bad in arguing with a person on his left hand appeals with his eyes to one one  for on  the right. His Vision is elastic he bends it to a certain object but having a patent spring it flies off. Writing has this disadvantage of speaking---one cannot write a wink, or a nod, or a grin, or a purse of the Lips, or a smile---O law ! One can- not put ones finger to one's nose, or yerk ye in the ribs,  885 or lay hold of your button in writing---but in all the most lively and titterly parts of my Letter you must not fail to imagine me as the epic poets say---now here, now there, now with one foot pointed at the ceiling, now with another---now with my pen on my ear, now with my elbow in my mouth. O my friends you loose the action---and attitude is every thing as Fusili  886 said when he took up his leg like a Musket to shoot a Swallow just darting behind his shoulder. And yet does not the word mum! go for ones finger beside the nose. I hope it does. I have to make use of the word Mum! before I tell you that Severn has got a little Baby---all his own let us hope. He told Brown he had given up painting and had turn'd modeller. I hope sincerely tis not a party concern: that no Mr---or ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) is the real Pinxit and Severn the poor Sculpsit to this work of art. You know he has long studied in the Life- Academy. Haydon---yes your wife will say, 'here is a sum total account of Haydon again I wonder your Brother don't put a monthly bulleteen in the Philadelphia Papers about him  887 \---I wont hear---no--- skip down to the bottom---aye and there are some more of his verses, skip (lullaby-by) them too" "No, lets go regularly through" "I wont hear a word about Haydon---bless the child, how rioty she is!---there go on there" Now pray go on here for I have a few words to say about Haydon. Before this Chancery threat had cut of f every legitimate supply of Cash from me I had a little at my disposal: Haydon being very much in want I lent him 30£ of it. Now in this see-saw game of Life I got nearest to the ground and this chancery business rivetted me there so that I was sitting in that uneasy position where the seat slants so abominably. I applied to him for payment--- he could not---that was no wonder; but goodman Delver,  888 where was the wonder then, why marry, in this, he did not seem to care much about it---and let me go without my money with almost non-chalance when he ought to have sold his drawings to supply me.  889 I shall perhaps still be acquainted with him, but for friendship that is at an end. Brown has been my friend in this he got him to sign a Bond  890 payable at three Months. Haslam has assisted me with the return of part of the money you lent him. Hunt--- 'there,' says your wife, 'there's another of those dull folkes ---not a syllable about my friends---well---Hunt---what about Hunt pray---you little thing see how she bites my finger---my! is not this a tooth". Well, when you have done with the tooth read on. Not a syllable about your friends! Here are some syllables. As far as I could smoke things on the Sunday before last, thus matters stood in Henrietta street. Henry was a greater blade than ever I remember to have seen him. He had on a very nice coat, a becoming waistcoat and buff trowsers. I think his face has lost a little of the spanish-brown, but no flesh. He carv'd some beef exactly to suit my appetite, as if I had been measured for it. As I stood looking out of the window with Charles after dinner, quizzing the Passengers, at which, I am sorry to say he is too apt, I observed that his young, son of a gun's whiskers had begun to curl and curl---little twists and twists, all down the sides of his face getting properly thickish on the angles of the visage. He certainly will have a notable pair of Whiskers. "How shiny your gown is in front" says Charles "Why, dont you see 'tis an apron says Henry" Whereat I scrutiniz'd and behold your mother had a purple stuff gown on, and over it an apron of the same colour, being the same cloth that was used for the lining---and furthermore to account for the shining it was the first day of wearing. I guess'd as much of the Gown--- but that is entre- nous. Charles likes england better than france. They've got a fat, smiling, fair Cook as ever you saw---she is a little lame, but that improves her---it makes her go more swimmingly. When I ask'd 'Is Mrs Wylie within' she gave such a large, five-and-thirty-year-old smile, it made me look round upon the fourth stair---it might have been the fifth---but that's a puzzle. I shall never be able if I were to set myself a recollecting for a year, to recollect that. I think I remember two or three specks in her teeth but I really cant say exactly. Your mother said something about Miss Keasle---what that was is quite a riddle to me now. Whether she had got fatter or thinner, or broader or longer---straiter, or had taken to the zigzags---Whether she had taken to, or left off, asses Milk---that by the by she ought never to touch---how much better it would be to put her out to nurse with the Wise woman of Brentford. 891 I can say no more on so spare a subject. Miss Millar now is a different morsell if one knew how to divide and subdivide, theme her out into sections and subsections.  892 Say a little on every part of her body as it is divided in common with all her fellow creatures, in Moor's Almanac.  893 But Alas! I have not heard a word about her--- no cue to begin upon. There was indeed a buzz about her and her mother's being at old Mrs So and So's who was like to die \---as the jews say---but I dare say, keeping up their dialect, she was not like to die . I must tell you a good thing Reynolds did : 'twas the best thing he ever said . You know at taking leave of a party at a doorway, sometimes a Man dallies and foolishes and gets awkward, and does not know how to make off to advantage---Good bye---well---goodbye ---and yet he does not go---good bye and so on---well--- good bless you. You know what I mean. Now Reynolds was in this predicament and got out of it in a very witty way. He was leaving us at Hampstead. He delay'd, and we were joking at him and even said, 'be off'---at which he put the tails of his coat between his legs, and sneak'd off as nigh like a spanial as could be. He went with flying colours: this is very clever. I must, being upon the subject, tell you another good thing of him. He began, for the service it might be of to him in the law, to learn french. He had Lessons at the cheap rate of 2. 6 per fag, and observed to Brown, 'Gad says he, the man sells his Lessons so cheap he must have stolen 'em.' You have heard of Hook  894 the farce writer. Horace Smith said to one who ask'd him if he knew Hook "Oh yes' Hook and I are very intimate." Theres a page of Wit for you, to put John Bunyan's emblems  895 out of countenance. Tuesday  21 September. You see I keep adding a sheet daily till I send the packet off---which I shall not do for a few days as I am inclined to write a good deal: for there can be nothing so remembrancing and enchaining as a good long letter be it composed of what it may. From the time you left me, our friends say I have altered completely ---am not the same person---perhaps in this letter I am for in a letter one takes up one's existence from the time we last met---I dare say you have altered also---every man does---our bodies every seven years are completely fresh-materiald---seven years ago it was not this hand that clench'd itself against Hammond.  896 We are like the relict garments of a Saint; the same and not the same: for the careful Monks patch it and patch it: till there's not a thread of the original garment left, and still they show it for St Anthony's shirt. This is the reason why men who had been bosom friends, on being separated for any number of years, afterwards meet coldly, neither of them knowing why. The fact is they are both altered---Men who live together have a silent moulding, and influencing power over each other. They interassimulate. 'Tis an uneasy thought that in seven years the same hands cannot greet each other again. All this may be obviated by a willful and dramatic exercise of our Minds towards each other. Some think I have lost that poetic ardour and fire 'tis said I once had ---the fact is perhaps I have: but instead of that I hope I shall substitute a more thoughtful and quiet power. I am more frequently, now, contented to read and think---but now & then, haunted with ambitious thoughts. Quieter in my pulse, improved in my digestion; exerting myself against vexing speculations---scarcely content to write the best verses for the fever they leave behind. I want to compose without this fever. I hope I one day shall. You would scarcely imagine I could live alone so comfortably "Kepen in solitarinesse".  897 I told Anne, the Servant here, the other day, to say I was not at home if any one should call. I am not certain how I should endure loneliness and bad weather together. Now the time is beautiful. I take a walk every day for an hour before dinner and this is generally my walk. I go out at the back gate across one street, into the Cathedral yard, which is always interesting; then I pass under the trees along a paved path, pass the beautiful front of the Cathedral, turn to the left under a stone door way,--- then I am on the other side of the building---which leaving behind me I pass on through two college- like squares seemingly built for the dwelling place of Deans and Prebendaries ---garnished with grass and shaded with trees. Then I pass through one of the old city gates and then you are in one College Street through which I pass and at the end thereof crossing some meadows and at last a country alley of gardens I arrive, that is, my worship arrives at the foundation of Saint Cross,  898 which is a very interesting old place, both for its gothic tower and alms- square, and for the appropriation of its rich rents to a relation of the Bishop of Winchester. Then I pass across St. Cross meadows till you come to the most beautifully clear river--- now this is only one mile of my walk I will spare you the other two till after supper when they would do you more good. You must avoid going the first mile just after dinner. I could almost advise you to put by all this nonsense until you are lifted out of your difficulties---but when you come to this part feel with confidence what I now feel that though there can be no stop put to troubles we are inheritors of there can be and must be and  for an  end to immediate difficulties. Rest in the confidence that I will not omit any exertion to benefit you by some means or other. If I cannot remit you hundreds, I will tens and if not that ones. Let the next year be managed by you as well as possible---the next month I mean for I trust you will soon receive Abbey's remittance. What he can send you will not be a sufficient capital to ensure you any command in America. What he has of mine I nearly have anticipated by debts. So I would advise you not to sink it, but to live upon it in hopes of my being able to encrease it. To this end I will devote whatever I may gain for a few years to come---at which period I must begin to think of a security of my own comforts when quiet will become more pleasant to me than the World.  899 Still I would have you doubt my success. 'Tis at present the cast of a die with me. You say 'these things will be a great torment to me.' I shall not suffer them to be so. I shall only exert myself the more--- while the seriousness of their nature will prevent me from nursing up imaginary griefs. 900 I have not had the blue devils once since I received your last. I am advised not to publish till it is seen whether the Tragedy will or not succeed. Should it, a few months may see me in the way of acquiring property; should it not it will be a drawback and I shall have to perform a longer literary Pilgrimage. You will perceive that it is quite out of my interest to come to America. What could I do there? How could I employ myself? out of the reach of Libraries. You do not mention the name of the gentleman who assists you. 'Tis an extraordinary thing. How could you do without that assistance? I will not trust myself with brooding over this. The following is an extract from a Letter of Reynolds to me. "I am glad to hear you are getting on so well with your writings. I hope you are not neglecting the revision of your Poems for the press: from which I expect more than you do." The first thought that struck me on reading your last, was to mortgage a Poem to Murray: but on more consideration I made up my mind not to do so:  901 my reputation is very low: he would perhaps not have negociated my bill of intellect or given me a very small sum. I should have bound myself down for some time. 'Tis best to meet present misfortunes; not for a momentary good to sacrifice great benefits which one's own untrammell'd and free industry may bring one in the end. In all this do never think of me as in any way unhappy: I shall not be so. I have a great pleasure in thinking of my responsibility to you and shall do myself the greatest luxury if I can succeed in any way so as to be of assistance to you. We shall look back upon these times---even before our eyes are at all dim ---I am convinced of it. But be careful of those Americans ---I could almost advise you to come whenever you have the sum of 500£ to England---Those Americans will I am affraid still fleece you. If ever you should think of such a thing you must bear in mind the very different state of society here---The immense difficulties of the times---The great sum required per annum to maintain yourself in any decency. In fact the whole is with Providence. I know now  for not  how to advise you but by advising you to advise with yourself. In your next tell me at large your thoughts about america; what chance there is of succeeding there: for it appears to me you have as yet been somehow deceived. I cannot help thinking Mr Audubon has deceived you. I shall not like the sight of him. I shall endeavour to avoid seeing him. You see how puzzled I am. I have no meridian to fix you to---being the Slave of what is to happen. I think I may bid you finally remain in good hopes; and not tease yourself with my changes and variations of Mind. If I say nothing decisive in any one particular part of my Letter, you may glean the truth from the whole pretty correctly. You may wonder why I had not put your affairs with Abbey in train on receiving your Letter before last, to which there will reach you a short answer dated from Shanklin.  902 I did write and speak to Abbey but to no purpose. Your last, with the enclosed note has appealed home to him. He will not see the necessity of a thing till he is hit in the mouth. 'Twill be effectual. I am sorry to mix up foolish and serious things together--- but in writing so much I am obliged to do so---and I hope sincerely the tenor of your mind will maintain itself better. In the course of a few months I shall be as good an Italian Scholar as I am a french one. I am reading Ariosto  903 at present: not managing more than six or eight stanzas at a time. When I have done this language so as to be able to read it tolerably well---I shall set myself to get complete in latin, and there my learning must stop. I do not think of venturing upon Greek. I would not go even so far if I were not persuaded of the power the knowledge of any language gives one---the fact is I like to be acquainted with foreign languages. It is besides a nice way of filling up intervals &c Also the reading of Dante in  for is  well worth the while. And in latin there is a fund of curious literature of the middle ages. The Works of many great Men---Aretine and Sanazarius and Machievell.  904 \---I shall never become attach'd to a foreign idiom so as to put it into my writings. The Paradise lost though so fine in itself is a curruption of our Language---it should be kept as it is unique---a curiosity---a beautiful and grand Curiosity. The most remarkable Production of the world. A northern dialect accommodating itself to greek and latin inversions and intonations. The purest english I think---or what ought to be the purest---is Chatterton's. 905 The Language had existed long enough to be entirely uncorrupted of Chaucer's gallicisms, and still the old words are used. Chatterton's language is entirely northern. I prefer the native music of it to Milton's cut by feet. I have but lately stood on my guard against Milton. Life to him would be death to me. Miltonic verse cannot be written but it  for in  the vein of art--- I wish to devote myself to another sensation---  906 Friday, 24 September. I have been obliged to intermiten your Letter for two days (this being Friday morn) from having had to attend to other correspondence. Brown who was at Bedhampton, went thence to Chichester, and I still directing my letters Bedhampton---there arose a misunderstanding about them. I began to suspect my Letters had been stopped from curiosity. However yesterday Brown had four Letters from me  907 all in a Lump---and the matter is clear'd up---Brown complained very much in his Letter to me of yesterday of the great alteration the Disposition of Dilke has undergone. He thinks of nothing but 'Political Justice'  908 and his Boy. Now the first political duty a Man ought to have a Mind to is the happiness of his friends. I wrote Brown a comment  909 on the subject, wherein I explained what I thought of Dilke's Character. Which resolved itself into this conclusion. That Dilke was a Man who cannot feel he has a personal identity unless he has made up his Mind about every thing. The only means of strengthening one's intellect is to make up ones mind about nothing---to let the mind be a thoroughfare for all thoughts. Not a select party. The genus is not scarce in population. All the stubborn arguers you meet with are of the same brood. They never begin upon a subject they have not preresolved on. They want to hammer their nail into you and if you turn the point, still they think you wrong. Dilke will never come at a truth as long as he lives; because he is always trying at it. He is a Godwin-methodist. I must not forget to mention that your mother show'd me the lock of hair---'tis of a very dark colour for so young a creature. When it is two feet in length I shall not stand a barley corn higher. That's not fair---one ought to go on growing as well as others. At the end of this sheet I shall stop for the present---and send it off. You may expect another Letter immediately after it. As I never know the day of the month but by chance I put here that this is the 24th September . I would wish you here to stop your ears, for I have a word or two to say to your Wife. My dear sister. In the first place I must quarrel with you for sending me such a shabby sheet of paper---though that is in some degree made up for by the beautiful impression of the seal. You should like to know what I was doing the first of May  910 \---let me see---I cannot recollect. I have all the Examiners ready to send. They will be a great treat to you when they reach you. I shall pack them up when my Business with Abbey  911 has come to a good conclusion and the remittance is on the road to you. I have dealt round your best wishes to our friends like a pack of cards, but being always given to cheat, myself, I have turned up ace.  912 You see I am making game of you. I see you are not at all happy in that America. England however would not be over happy for us if you were here. Perhaps 'twould be better to be teased here than there. I must preach patience to you both. No step hasty or injurious to you must be taken. Your observation on the moschetos gives me great pleasure. 'Tis excessively poetical and humane. You say let one large sheet be all to me. You will find more than that in different parts of this packet for you. Certainly, I have been caught in rains. A Catch in the rain occasioned my last sore throat---but as for red- hair'd girls upon my word I do not recollect ever having seen one. Are you quizzing me or Miss Waldegrave when you talk of promenading. As for Pun- making, I wish it was as good a trade as pin-making. There is very little business of that sort going on now. We struck for wages like the Manchester we avers  913 \---but to no purpose---so we are all out of employ. I am more lucky than some you see by having an opportunity of exporting a few---getting into a little foreign trade--- which is a comfortable thing. I wish one could get change for a pun in silver currency. I would give three and a half any night to get into Drury-pit. But they wont ring at all. No more will notes you will say---but notes are differing things---though they make together a Pun-note---as the term goes. If I were your Son I should't mind you, though you rapt me with the Scissors. But lord! I should be out of favor sin the little un be comm'd. You have made an Uncle of me, you have, and I don't know what to make of myself. I suppose next there'll be a Nevey. You say---in may last---write directly. I have not received your Letter above 10 days. The thought of your little girl puts me in mind of a thing I heard a Mr Lamb say. A child in arms was passing by his chair toward the mother, in the nurses arms. Lamb took hold of the long clothes saying "Where, god bless me, where does it leave off?" Saturday 25 September. If you would prefer a joke or two to any thing else I have two for you fresh hatchd, just ris as the Baker's wives say by the rolls. The first I play'd off at Brown--- the second I play'd on on myself. Brown when he left me  914 "Keats" says he "my good fellow (staggering upon his left heel, and fetching an irregular pirouette with his right) Keats says he (depressing his left eyebrow and elevating his right one ((tho by the way, at the moment, I did not know which was the right one)) Keats says he (still in the same posture but furthermore both his hands in his waistcoat pockets and jutting out his stomach) "Keats---my---go-o-ood fell-o-o-o-ooh! says he (interlarding his exclamation with certain ventriloquial parentheses)---no this is all a lie ---He was as sober as a Judge when a judge happens to be sober; and said "Keat s, if any Letters come for me---Do not forward them, but open them and give me the marrow of them in few words. At the time when I wrote my first to him no Letters had arrived. I thought I would invent one, and as I had not time to manufacture a long one I dabbed off as  for a  short one---and that was the reason of the joke succeeding beyond my expectations. Brown let his house to a Mr Benjamin a Jew. Now the water which furnishes the house is in a tank sided with a composition of lime and the lime impregnates the water unpleasantly. Taking advantage of this circumstance I pretended that Mr Benjamin had written the following short note---"Sir. By drinking your damn'd tank water I have got the gravel ---what reparation can you make to me and my family? Nathan Benjamin" By a fortunate hit, I hit upon his right heathen name  915 \---his right Pronomen. Brown in consequence it appears wrote to the surprised Mr Benjamin the following "Sir, I cannot offer you any remuneration until your gravel shall have formed itself into a Stone when I will cut you with Pleasure. C. Brown" This of Browns Mr Benjamin has answered insisting on an explatinon of this singular circumstance. B. says "when I read your Letter and his following I roared, and in came Mr Snook who on reading them seem'd likely to burst the hoops of his fat sides---so the Joke has told well. Now for the one I played on myself---I must first give you the Scene and the dramatis Personoe. There are an old Major and his youngish wife live in the next apartments to me. His bed room door opens at an angle with my sitting room door. Yesterday I was reading as demurely as a Parish Clerk when I heard a rap at the door. I got up and opened it---no one was to be seen. I listened and heard some one in the Major's room. Not content with this I went up stairs and down look'd in the cubboards---and watch'd. At last I set myself to read again not quite so demurely---when there came a louder rap. I arose determin'd to find out who it was. I looked out the Stair cases were all silent. "This must be the Major's wife said I---at all events I will see the truth" so I rapt me at the Major's door and went in to the utter surprise and confusion of the Lady who was in reality there--- after a little explanation, which I can no more describe than fly, I made my retreat from her convinced of my mistake. She is to all appearance a silly body and is really surprised about it. She must have been, for I have discovered that a little girl in the house was the Rappee ---I assure you she has nearly make me Sneeze.  916 If the Lady tells tits I shall put a very grave and moral face on the matter with the old Gentleman, and make his little Boy a present of a humming top. My Dear George---This Monday morning the 27th I have received your last dated July 12th  917 You say you have not heard from Englan\---  918  nths---Then my Letter from Shanklin  919 written I think at the en\---  920  have reach'd you. You shall not have cause to think I neglect you. I have kept this back a little time in expectation of hearing from Mr Abbey---You will say I might have remained in Town to be Abbey's messenger in these affairs. That I offer'd him---but he in his answer convinced me he was anxious to bring the Business to an issue---He observed that by being himself the agent in the whole, people might be more expeditious. You say you have not heard for three months and yet your letters have the tone of knowing how our affairs are situated by which I conjecture I acquainted you with them in a Letter  921 previous to the Shanklin one. That I may not have done. To be certain I will here state that it is in consequence of Mrs Jennings threatening a Chancery suit that you have been kept from the receipt of monies and myself deprived of any help from Abbey. I am glad you say you keep up your Spirits---I hope you make a true statement on that score. Still keep them up---for we are all young. I can only repeat here that you shall hear from me again immediately. Notwithstanding their bad intelligence I have experienced some pleasure in receiving so correctly two Letters from you, as it gives me if I may so say a distant Idea of Proximity. This last improves upon my little niece. Kiss her for me. Do not fret yourself about the delay of money on account of any immediate opportunity being lost: for in a new country whoever has money must have opportunity of employing it in many ways. The report runs now more in favor of Kean stopping in England. If he should I have confident hopes of our Tragedy ---If he smokes the hotblooded character of Ludolph--- and he is the only actor that can do it---He will add to his own fame, and improve my fortune. I will give you a half dozen lines of it before I part as a specimen--- "Not as a Swordsman would I pardon crave, But as a Son: the bronz'd Centurion Long-toil'd in forreign wars, and whose high deeds Are shaded in a forest of tall spears, 922 Known only to his troop , hath greater plea Of favour with my Sire than I can have---"  923 Believe me my dear brother and Sister--- Your affectionate and anxious Brother  Signature cut out .  Address : Charles W. Dilke Esqre  Navy Pay Office  Somerset House, redirected to 3 Great Smith Street  Westminster Postmark : WINCHESTER 1 OC 1819 924 Winchester Friday Octr 1st My dear Dilke, For sundry reasons, which I will explain to you when I come to Town, I have to request you will do me a great favor as I must call it knowing how great a Bore it is. That your imagination may not have time to take too great an alarm I state immediateely that I want you to hire me a  925 couple of rooms in Westminster. Quietness and cheapness are the essentials: but as I shall with Brown be returned by next Friday you cannot in that space have sufficient time to make any choice selection, and need not be very particular as I can when on the spot suit myself at leisure. Brown bids me remind you not to send the Examiners after the third. Tell Mrs D. I am obliged to her for the late ones which I see are directed in her hand. Excuse this mere business letter for I assure you I have not a syllable at hand on any subject in the world. Your sincere friend John Keats--- Address : B. R. Haydon Esqre  Lisson Grove North  Paddington Postmark : WINCHESTER 3 OC 1819 926 Winchester Sunday Morn. My dear Haydon, Certainly I might: but, a few Months pass away before we are aware; I have a great aversion to letter writing, which grows more and more upon me; and a greater to summon up circumstances before me of an unpleasant nature---I was not willing to trouble you with them. Could I have dated from my Palace in Milan you would have heard from me---Not even now will I mention a word of my affairs---only that "I Rab am here" but shall not be here more than a Week more, as I purpose to settle in Town and work my way with the rest. I hope I shall never be so silly as to injure my health and industry for the future by speaking, writing or fretting about my non-estate. I have no quarrel, I assure you, of so weighty a nature, with the world, on my own account as I have on yours. I have done nothing---except for the amusement of a few people who refine upon their feelings till any thing in the ununderstandable way will go down with them--- people predisposed for sentiment. I have no cause to complain because I am certain any thing really fine will in these days be felt. I have no doubt that if I had written Othello I should have been cheered by as good a Mob as Hunt.  927 So would you be now if the operation of painting was as universal as that of writing---It is not: and therefore it did behove men I could mention among whom I must place Sir G. Beaumont  928 to have lifted you up above sordid cares---That this has not been done is a disgrace to the country. I know very little of Painting, yet your pictures follow me into the Country---when I am tired with reading I often think them over and as often condemn the spirit of modern Connoisseurs. Upon the whole indeed you have no complaint to make, being able to say what so few Men can "I have succeeded": On sitting down to write a few lines to you these are the uppermost in my mind, and however I may be beating about under the arctic while your spirit has passed the line, you may lay too a minute and consider I am earnest as far as I can see. Though at this present "I have great dispositions to write"  929 I feel every day more and more content to read. Books are becoming more interesting and valuable to me. I may say I could not live without them. If in the course of a fortnight you can procure me a ticket to the british museum  930 I will make a better use of it than I did in the first instance. I shall go on with patience in the confidence that if I ever do any thing worth remembering the Reviewers will no more be able to stumble-block me than the Academy could you. They have the same quarrel with you that the Scotch nobles had with Wallace---The fame they have lost through you is no joke to them. Had it not been for you Fuseli would have been not as he is major but maximus domo. What the Reviewers can put a hindrance to must be---a nothing---or mediocre which is worse. I am sorry to say that since I saw you I have been guilty of---a practical Joke upon Brown which has had all the success of an innocent Wild fire among people.  931 Some day in the next week you shall hear it from me by word of Mouth---I have not seen the portentous Book which was skummer'd  932 at you just as I left town. It may be light enough to serve you as a Cork Jacket and save you for awhile the trouble of swimming. I heard the Man went raking and rummaging about like any Richardson. That and the Memoirs of Menage 933 are the first I shall be at. From Sr G. B's Lord Ms  934 and particularly Sr John Leicesters good lord deliver us---I shall expect to see your Picture plumped out like a ripe Peach--- you would not be very willing to give me a slice of it. I came to this place in the hopes of meeting with a Library but was disappointed. The High Street is as quiet as a Lamb; the knockers are dieted to three raps per diem. The walks about are interresting ---from the many Buildings and arch ways---The view of the high street through the Gate of the City, in the beautiful September evening light has amused me frequently. The bad singing of the Cathedral I do not care to smoke---being by myself I am not very coy in my taste. At St. Cross there is an interresting Picture of Albert Durers  935 \---who living in such warlike times perhaps was forced to paint in his Gauntlets---so we must make all allowances--- I am my dear Haydon Yours ever John Keats Brown has a few words to say to you and will cross this My dear Sir, I heard yesterday you had written to me at Hampstead. I have not recd. your letter. You must, I think, accuse me of neglect, but indeed I do not merit it. This many worded Keats has left me no room to say more.---I shall be in Town in a few days.--- Your's truly Chas. Brown. Address : Miss Brawne  Wentworth Place  Hampstead. Postmark : 11 OC 1819 936 College Street. My sweet Girl, I am living to day in yesterday: I was in a complete fascination all day. I feel myself at your mercy. Write me ever so few lines and tell you  for me  you will never for ever be less kind to me than yesterday---. You dazzled me. There is nothing in the world so bright and delicate. When Brown came out with that seemingly true story against me last night, I felt it would be death to me if you had ever believed it---though against any one else I could muster up my obstinacy. Before I knew Brown could disprove it I was for the moment miserable. When shall we pass a day alone? I have had a thousand kisses, for which with my whole soul I thank love---but if you should deny me the thousand and first---'twould put me to the proof how great a misery I could live through. If you should ever carry your threat yesterday into execution---believe me 'tis not my pride, my vanity or any petty passion would torment me---really 'twould hurt my heart---I could not bear it. I have seen Mrs Dilke this morning; she says she will come with me any fine day. Ever yours John Keats Ah herte mine! Address : Miss Brawne  Wentworth Place  Hampstead--- Postmarks : COLLEGE ST and 13 OC 1819 25 College Street. My dearest Girl, This moment I have set myself to copy some verses out fair. I cannot proceed with any degree of content. I must write you a line or two and see if that will assist in dismissing you from my Mind for ever so short a time. Upon my Soul I can think of nothing else. The time is passed when I had power to advise and warn you against the unpromising morning of my Life. My love has made me selfish. I cannot exist without you. I am forgetful of every thing but seeing you again---my Life seems to stop there---I see no further. You have absorb'd me. I have a sensation at the present moment as though I was dissolving---I should be exquisitely miserable without the hope of soon seeing you. I should be affraid to separate myself far from you. My sweet Fanny, will your heart never change? My love, will it? I have no limit now to my love--- Your note came in just here---I cannot be happier away from you. 'Tis richer than an Argosy of Pearles. Do not threat me even in jest. I have been astonished that Men could die Martyrs for religion---I have shudder'd at it. I shudder no more---I could be martyr'd for my Religion---Love is my religion--- I could die for that. I could die for you. My Creed is Love and you are its only tenet. You have ravish'd me away by a Power I cannot resist; and yet I could resist till I saw you; and even since I have seen you I have endeavoured often 'to reason against the reasons of my Love'.  937 I can do that no more---the pain would be too great. My love is selfish. I cannot breathe without you. Yours for ever John Keats. Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbeys Esqre  Walthamstow--- Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 16 OC 1819 Wentworth Place My dear Fanny, My Conscience is always reproaching me for neglecting you for so long a time. I have been returned from Winchester this fortnight and as yet I have not seen you. I have no excuse to offer. I should have no excuse. I shall expect to see you the next time I call on Mr A about Georges affairs which perplex me a great deal---I should have to day gone to see if you were in Town, but as I am in an in-dustrious humour (which is so necessary to my livelihood for the future) I am loath to break through it though it be merely for one day, for when I am inclined I can do a great deal in a day---I am more fond of pleasure than study (many men have prefer'd the latter) but I have become resolved to know something which you will credit when I tell you I have left off animal food that my brains may never henceforth be in a greater mist than is theirs by nature---I took Lodgings in Westminster for the purpose of being in the reach of Books, but am now returned to Hampstead being induced to it by the habit I have acquired of this room I am now in and also from the pleasure of being free from paying any petty attentions to a diminutive house-keeping. Mr Brown has been my great friend for some time---without him I should have been in, perhaps, personal distress---as I know you love me though I do not deserve it, I am sure you will take pleasure in being a friend to Mr Brown even before you know him. My Lodgings for two or three days were close in the neighbourhood of Mrs Dilke who never sees me but she enquires after you---I have had letters from George lately which do not contain, as I think I told you in my last,  938 the best news. I have hopes for the best---I trust in a good termination to his affairs which you please god will soon hear of---It is better you should not be teased with the particulars. The whole amount of the ill news is that his mercantile speculations have not had success in consequence of the general depression of trade in the whole province of Kentucky and indeed all america. I have a couple of shells for you you will call pretty. Your affectionate Brother John--- Address : Miss Brawne,  Wentworth Place,  Hampstead. Postmarks : COLLEGE ST and 19 OC 1819 Great Smith Street Tuesday Morn My sweet Fanny, On awakening from my three days dream ("I cry to dream again")  939 I find one and another astonish'd at my idleness and thoughtlessness. I was miserable last night ---the morning is always restorative. I must be busy, or try to be so. I have several things to speak to you of tomorrow morning. Mrs Dilke I should think will tell you that I purpose living at Hampstead. I must impose chains upon myself. I shall be able to do nothing. I should like to cast the die for Love or death. I have no Patience with any thing else---if you ever intend to be cruel to me as you say in jest now but perhaps may sometimes be in earnest be so now---and I will---my mind is in a tremble, I cannot tell what I am writing. Ever my love yours John Keats Address : Joseph Seve rn Esqre  6 Goswell Street Road  Opposite Spencer Street. Postmark : HAMPSTEAD. No date. 940 Wentworth Place Wednesday Dear Severn, Either your Joke about staying at home is a very old one or I really call'd. I dont remember doing so. I am glad to hear you have finish'd the Picture and am more anxious to see it than I have time to spare: for I have been so very lax, unemployed, unmeridian'd, and objectless these two months that I even grudge indulging (and that is no great indulgence considering the Lecture is not over till 9 and the lecture room seven miles from wentworth Place) myself by going to Hazlitt's Lecture.  941 If you have hours to the amount of a brace of dozens to throw away you may sleep nine of them here in your little Crib and chat the rest---When your Picture is up and in a good light I shall make a point of meeting you at the Academy if you will let me know when. If you should be at the Lecture tomorrow evening I shall see you---and congratulate you heartily---Haslam I know "is very Beadle to an amorous sigh"  942 Your sincere friend John Keats. Address and postmark not recorded. 943 Wentworth Place November 2 My disposition is of so careless a nature that it is continually tormenting me for my neglect of matters of consequence. If you can command £30 you will cure me of a disease which at intervals comes upon me like a fever fit. Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbey's Esqre  Pancras Lane  Queen Street Cheapside Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 17 NO 1819 Wednesday Morn My dear Fanny, I received your Letter yesterday Evening and will obey it tomorrow. I would come to day but I have been to Town so frequently on Georges Business it makes me wish to employ to day at Hampstead. So I say Thursday without fail. I have no news at all entertaining and if I had I should not have time to tell them as I wish to send this by the morning Post. Your affectionate Brother John--- Address : John Taylor Esqre  Taylor and Hessey's  Fleet Street Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 17 NO 1819 Wentworth Place Wednesday, My dear Taylor, I have come to a determination not to publish any thing I have now ready written; but for all that to publish a Poem before long and that I hope to make a fine one. As the marvellous is the most enticing and the surest guarantee of harmonious numbers  944 I have been endeavouring to persuade myself to untether Fancy and let her manage for herself. I and myself cannot agree about this at all. Wonders are no wonders to me. I am more at home amongst Men and women. I would rather read Chaucer than Ariosto.  945 The little dramatic skill I may as yet have however badly it might show in a Drama would I think be sufficient for a Poem. I wish to diffuse the colouring of St Agnes eve throughout a Poem in which Character and Sentiment would be the figures to such drapery. Two or three such Poems, if God should spare me, written in the course of the next six years, would be a famous gradus ad Parnassum altissimum. I mean they would nerve me up to the writing of a few fine Plays---my greatest ambition--- when I do feel ambitious. I am sorry to say that is very seldom. The subject we have once or twice talked of appears a promising one, the Earl of Leicester's history. I am this morning reading Holingshed's  946 Elisabeth. You had some books awhile ago, you promised to lend me, illustrative of my Subject. If you can lay hold of them or any others which may be serviceable to me I know you will encourage my low-spirited Muse by sending them---or rather by letting me know when our Errand cart Man shall call with my little Box. I will endeavour to set my self selfishly at work on this Poem that is to be. Your sincere friend John Keats--- Address : Mr George Keats  Louisville  Kentucky No postmark. 947 Friday Evening Novr. My dear George, You must think my delay very great. I assure you it is no fault of mine. Not expecting you would want money so soon I did not send for the necessary power of attorney from Holl  948 and before I received your Letter which reached me in the middle of the summer at Shanklin.  949 I wrote for it then immediately and received it about ten days ago. You will also be much disappointed at the smallness of the Sum remitted to Warder's: there are two reasons for it, first that the Stocks are so very low, and secondly that Mr. Abbey is unwilling to venture more till this business of Mrs. Jennings's is completely at rest. Mr. Abbey promised me to day that he would do all in his power to forward it expressing his wish that by the time it was settled she would make no claim the Stocks might recover themselves so that your property should not be sold out at so horrible a disadvantage. I know not what comfort to give you under these circumstances. Our affairs are in an awkward state. You have done as much as a man can do: I am not as yet fortunate. I should, in duty, endeavour to write you a Letter with a comfortable nonchalance, but how can I do so when you are in so perplexing a situation, and I not able to help you out of it. The distance between us is so great, the Posts so uncertain. We must hope. I am affraid you are no more than myself form'd for a gainer of money. I have been daily expecting to hear from you again. Does the Steam boat make any return yet? Whether I shall at all be set affloat upon the world depends now upon the success of the Tragedy I spoke of.  950 We have heard nothing from Elliston who is now the Renter of Drury Lane since the piece was sent in which was three weeks and more ago. The reason may be that Kean has not return'd, whose opinion Elliston will partly rely on. Brown is still very sanguine. The moment I have any certain intelligence concerning it I will let you know. I have not been to see Fanny since my return from Winchester.  951 I have written and received a Letter from her. Mr Abbey says she is getting stouter. I call'd in Rodney Street about a fortnight since. Your Mother was quite well and Charles was to set out again for Paris on the day following. I do not call so often as I should do if I had any good news to tell---I am there in the character of a Prevaricator. I must not tell the truth. Mr. Abbey shows at times a little anxiety about me he wanted me the other day to turn Bookseller. Why does he not make some such proposal to you? Yet he can not care much for I till yesterday had had no money of him for ten months and he never enquired how I liv'd: nor how I had paid my last Christmas Bills (still unpaid) though I repeatedly mentioned them to him. We are not the only toilers and sufferers in the World. Hunt was arrested the other day. He soon however dated from his own house again. Hazlitt has begun another course of Lectures, on the Writers of Elizabeth's reign---I hear he quoted me in his last Lecture  952 \---Our Set still continue separate as we get older, each follows with more precision the bent of his own Mind. Brown and I by living together are an exception. Rice continues to every one his friendly behaviour: his illness and his wit stick by him as usual. In a note to me the other day he sent the following Pun--- Tune---the Harlot's Lament Between the two P-x's I've lost every Lover, But a difference I found 'twixt the great and the small: For by the Small Pox I gott pitted all over By the other I did not get pittied at all. Reynolds has settled in Lodgings very near to Rice's and seems set in for the Law. Dilke I called upon at his office the other day. We taiked about you; you being mostly my subject with him. He says you should have kept to your original design; in which I differ with him entirely. I think you have done perfectly right. I have this moment received a Letter from Severn, whom I have not seen for some time, he tells me he has finish'd a picture of Spenser's Cave of despair which is designed to contend for the Prize at the Academy and is now hung up there for Judgement.  953 He wishes me to see it. I have been endeavouring to write lately, but with little success as I require a little encouragement, as little better fortune to befall you and happier news from you before I can write with an untrammell'd mind. Nothing could have in all its circumstances fallen out worse for me than the last year has done, or could be more damping to my poetical talent---I comfort myself in the idea that you are a consolation to each other. Haslam told me the last time I saw him that he was about to write to you. He is entirely taken up with his Sweet-heart ---I feel very loath to write more than this Sheet---you must excuse the shortness of this Letter for  954 the length of the last and the length of the next I hope, if any thing occurs to enspirit me a little. Fanny would like a Letter from you. I should think that Abbey from the delay of Waltons  955 house has employed another Lawyer on our Business. Mrs. Jennings has not instituted any action against us yet, nor has she withdrawn her claim I think I told you that even if she were to lose her cause we should have to pay the expenses of the Suit. You urg'd me to get Mr. Abbey to advance you money---that he will by no means do---for besides the risk of the law (small enough indeed) he will never be persuaded but you will loose it in America. For a bit of a treat in the heart of all this I had a most abusive Letter from Fry  956 \---committing you and myself to destruction without reprieve---In your next Letter make some questions regularly upon which you wish to be informed concerning our's and any other subject and I will answer them as amply as I can. My dear Sister God bless you and your baby girl. The enquirIes about you are very frequent---My dear George I remain, in hopes, Your most affectionate Brother John Keats Address and postmark, see note. 957 Wentworth Place Monday Morn--- My dear Severn, I am very sorry that on Tuesday I have an appointment in the City of an undeferable nature; and Brown on the same day has some business at Guildhall. I have not been able to figure your manner of executing the Cave of despair, therefore it will be at any rate a novelty and surprise to me ---I trust on the right side. I shall call upon you some morning shortly early enough to catch you before you can get out---when we will proceed to the Academy. I think you must be suited with a good painting light in your Bay window. I wish you to return the Compliment by going with me to see a Poem I have hung up for the Prize in the Lecture Room of the surry Institution. I have many Rivals the most threatning are An Ode to Lord Castlereagh, and a news series of Hymns for the New, new Jerusalem Chapel ---You had best put me into your Cave of despair--- Ever yours sincerely John Keats Address : James Rice Junr Esqre  Poland Street  Oxford labr;Street  No postmark. Wentworth Place My dear Rice, As I want the coat on my back mended, I would be obliged if you will send me the one Brown left at your house, by the Bearer---During your late contest I heard regular reports of you; how that your time was entirely taken up, and your health improving---I shall call in the course of a few days and see whether your promotion has made any difference in your Behaviour to us. I suppose Reynolds has given you an account of Brown and Elliston. As he has not rejected our Tragedy I shall not venture to call him directly a fool; but as he wishes to put it off till next season I cant help thinking him little better than a Knave  958 \---That it will not be acted this Season is yet uncertain ---Perhaps we may give it another furbish and try it at covent Garden. 'Twould do one's heart good to see Macready in Ludolph. If you do not see me soon it will be from the humour of writing, which I have had for three days, continuing. I must say to the Muses what the maid says to the Man---"take me while the fit is on me." 959 Would you like a true Story "There was a Man and his Wife who being to go a long journey on foot, in the course of their travels came to a River which rolled knee deep over the pebbles---In these cases the Man generally pulls off his Back. This Man did so; and his Wife being pregnant and troubled, as in such cases is very common, with strange longings, took the strangest that ever was heard of. Seeing her Husband's foot, a handsome one enough, look very clean and tempting in the clear water, on their arrival at the other bank she earnestly demanded a bit of it; he being an affectionate fellow and fearing for the comeliness of his child gave her a bit which he cut off with his Clasp Knife---Not satisfied she asked another morsel---supposing there might be twins he gave her a slice more. Not yet contented she craved another Piece. "You Wretch cries the Man, would you wish me to kill myself? take that!" Upon which he stabb'd her with the knife, cut her open and found three Children in her Belly two of them very comfortable with their mouth's shut, the third with its eyes and mouth stark staring open. "Who would have thought it" cried the Widower, and pursued his journey---, Brown has a little rumbling in his Stomach this morning--- Ever yours sincerely John Keats--- Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbey's Esqre  Walthamstow Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 20 DE 1819 Wentworth Place Monday Morn--- My dear Fanny, When I saw you last, you ask'd me whether you should see me again before Christmas. You would have seen me if I had been quite well. I have not, though not unwell enough to have prevented me---not indeed at all---but fearful lest the weather should affect my throat which on exertion or cold continually threatens me. By the advice of my Doctor I have had a warm great Coat made and have ordered some thick shoes---so furnish'd I shall be with you if it holds a little fine before Christmas day. I have been very busy since I saw you especially the last Week and shall be for some time, in preparing some Poems to come out in the Spring and also in heightening the interest of our Tragedy. Of the Tragedy I can give you but news semigood. It is accepted at Drury Lane with a promise of coming out next season: as that will be too long a delay we have determined to get Elliston to bring it out this Season or to transfer it to Covent Garden. This Elliston will not like, as we have every motive to believe that Kean has perceived how suitable the principal Character will be for him. My hopes of success in the literary world are now better than ever. Mr Abbey, on my calling on him lately, appeared anxious that I should apply myself to something else---He mentioned Tea Brokerage. I supposed he might perhaps mean to give me the Brokerage of his concern, which might be executed with little trouble and a good profit; and therefore said I should have no objection to it especially as at the same time it occurred to me that I might make over the business to George---I questioned him about it a few days after. His mind takes odd turns. When I became a Suitor he became coy. He did not seem so much inclined to serve me. He described what I should have to do in the progress of business. It will not suit me. I have given it up. I have not heard again from George which rather disappoints me, as I wish to hear before I make any fresh remittance of his property. I received a note from Mrs Dilke a few days ago inviting me to dine with her on Xmas day, which I shall do. Mr Brown and I go on in our old dog trot of Breakfast, dinner (not tea for we have left that off) supper Sleep, Confab, stirring the fire and reading. Whilst I was in the Country last Summer Mrs Bentley tells me a woman in mourning call'd on me, ---and talk'd something of an aunt of ours---I am so careless a fellow I did not enquire, but will particularly. On Tuesday I am going to hear some Schoolboys Speechify on breaking up day---I'll lay you a pocket piece we shall have "My name is norval"  960 I have not yet look'd for the Letter you mention'd as it is mix'd up in a box full of papers---you must tell me, if you can recollect, the subject of it. This moment Bentley brought a Letter from George for me to deliver to Mrs Wylie---I shall see her and it before I see you. The direction was in his best hand, written with a good Pen and sealed with a Tassie's Shakspeare  961 such as I gave you---We judge of people's hearts by their Countenances; may we not judge of Letters in the same way? if so, the Letter does not contain unpleasant news---Good or bad spirits have an effect on the handwriting. This direction is at least unnervous and healthy. Our Sister is also well, or George would have made strange work with Ks and Ws. The little Baby is well or he would have formed precious vowels and Consonants---He sent off the Letter in a hurry, or the mail bag was rather a warm birth, or he has worn out his Seal, for the Shakespeare's head is flattened a little. This is close muggy weather as they say at the Ale houses--- I am, ever, my dear Sister Yours affectionately John Keats--- Address : Miss Keats  Rd. Abbeys Esqre  Pancras Lane  Queen Street Chea pside. Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 7 o'clock DE 22 1819 Wentworth Place, Wednesday--- My dear Fanny, I wrote to you a Letter directed Walthamstow the day before yesterday wherein I promised to see you before Christmas day. I am sorry to say I have been and continue rather unwell, and therefore shall not be able to promise certainly. I have not seen Mrs Wylie's Letter. Excuse my dear Fanny this very shabby note. Your affectionate Brother John. No address or postmark. 962 Thursday Jany 13th 1820--- My dear Sister, By the time you receive this your troubles will be over--- I wish you knew they were half over; I mean that George is safe in England, and in good health ---To write to you by him is almost like following ones own Letter in the Mail that it may not be quite so I will leave common intelligence out of the question and write wide of him as I can. I fear I must be dull having had no goodnatured flip from fortune's finger  963 since I saw you and so  for no  side way comfort in the success of my friends. I could almost promise that if I had the means I would accompany George back to America and pay you a Visit of a few Months. I should not think much of the time or my absence from my Books, or I have no right to think, for I am very idle: but then I ought to be diligent and at least keep myself within the reach of materials for diligence. Diligence! that I do not mean to say, I should say dreaming over my Books, or rather other peoples Books. George has promised to bring you to England when the five years have elapsed, I regret very much that I shall not be able to see you before that time; and even then then I must hope that your affairs will be in so prosperous a way as to induce you to stop longer. Yours is a hardish fate to be so divided from your friends and settled among a people you hate. You will find it improve. You have a heart that will take hold of your Children. Even Georges absence will make things better---his return will banish what must be your greatest sorrow and at the same time minor ones with it. Robinson Crusoe when he saw himself in danger of perishing on the Waters look'd back to his island as to the haven of his Happiness and on gaining it once more was more content with his Solitude. We smoke George about his little Girl, he runs the common beaten road of every father, as I dare say you do of every Mother---there is no Child like his Child---so original! original forsooth However I take you at your words; I have a lively faith that yours is the very gem of all Children. Aint I its Unkle? On Henry's Marriage there was a piece of Bride cake sent me---it miss'd its way---I suppose the Carrier or Coachman was a Conjurer and wanted it for his own private use. Last Sunday George and I dined at Millars--- there were your Mother and Charles with Fool Lacon Esqre who sent the sly disinterested Shawl to Miss Millar with his own heathen name  964 engraved in the Middle. Charles had a silk Handkerchief belonging to a Miss Grover with whom he pretended to be smitten and for her sake kept exhibiting and adoring the Handkerchief all the evening. Fool Lacon Esqre treated it with a little venturesome trembling Contumely, whereon Charles set him quietly down on the floor---from where he as quietly got up. This process was repeated at supper time, when your Mother said "If I were you Mr Lacon I would not let him do so." Fool Lacon Esqre did not offer any remark. He will undoubtedly die in his bed. Your Mother did not look quite so well on Sunday. Mrs Henry Wylie is excessively quiet before people; I hope she is always so. Yesterday we dined at Taylor's in Fleet Street. George left early after dinner to go to Deptford. He will make all square there for me. I could not go with him. I did not like the amusement. Haslam is a very good fellow indeed; he has been excessively anxious and kind to us. But is this fair? He has an innamorata at Deptford and he has been wanting me for some time past to see her. This is a thing which it is impossible not to shirk. A Man is like a Magnet, he must have a repelling end---so how am I to see Haslams lady and family if I even went, for by the time I got to greenwich I should have repell'd them to Blackheath and by the time I got to Deptford, they would be on Shooters hill, when I came to shooters Hill, they would alight at Chatham and so on till I drove them into the Sea, which I think might be inditeable. The Evening before yesterday we had a piano forte hop at Dilkes. There was very little amusement in the room but a Scotchman to hate. 965 Some people you must have observed have a most unpleasant effect upon you when you see them speaking in profile--- this Scotchman is the most accomplish'd fellow in this way I ever met with. The effect was complete---It went down like a dose of bitters and I hope will improve my digestion. At Taylor's too there was a Scotchman  966 \---not quite so bad for he was as clean as he could get himself. Not having succeeded at Drury Lane with our Tragedy, we have been making some alterations and are about to try Covent Garden. Brown has just done patching up the Copy, as it is altered. The only reliance I had on it was in Kean's acting. I am not affraid it will be damn'd in the Garden. You said in one of your Letters that there was nothing but Haydon and Co in mine.  967 There can be nothing of him in this for I never see him or Co---George has introduced to us an American of the Name of Hart---I like him in a Moderate way. He was at Mrs Dilkes party; and sitting by me, we began talking about english and american ladies--- The Miss Reynolds and some of their friends made not a very enticing row opposite us. I bade him mark them and form his Judgement of them---I told him I hated Englishmen because they were the only Men I knew. He does not understand this. Who would be Bragadocio to Johnny Bull? Johnny's house is his Castle, and a precious dull Castle it is. What a many Bull Castles there are in So and So Crescent. I never wish myself an unversd visitor an d news monger but when I write to you. I should like for a day or two to have somebody's knowledge, Mr Lacon's for instance of all the different folks of a wide acquaintance to tell you about. Only let me have his knowledge of family minutiae and I would set them in a proper light but bless me I never go any where---my pen is no more garrulous than my tongue---Any third person would think I was addressing myself to a Lover of Scandal. But we know we do not love scandal but fun, and if Scandal happens to be fun that is no fault of ours. There were very pretty pickings for me in Georges Letters about the Prairie Settlement, if I had had any taste to turn them to account in England. I knew a friend of Miss Andrews, yet I never mention'd her to him: for after I had read the letter I really did not recollect her Story. Now I have been sitting here a half hour with my invention at work to say something about your Mother or Charles or Henry but it is in vain. I know not what to say. Three nights since George went with your Mother to the play. I hope she will soon see mine acted. I do not remember ever to have thank'd you for your tassels 968 to my Shakspeare---there he hangs so ably supported opposite me. I thank you now. It is a continual memento of you. If you should have a Boy do not christen him John, and persuade George not to let his partiality for me come across. 'Tis a bad name, and goes against a Man. If my name had been Edmund I should have been more fortunate. I was surprised to hear of the State of Saciety at Louisville, is  for it  seems you are just as ridiculous there as we are here---threepenny parties, half penny Dances ---the best thing I have heard of is your shooting, for it seems you follow the Gun. Give my Compliments to Mrs Audubon and tell her I cannot think her either good looking or honest---Tell Mr Audubon he's a fool---and Briggs that 'tis well I was not Mr A--- Saturday Jany 15\. It is strange that George having to stop so short a time in England I should not have seen him for nearly two days. He has been to Haslam's and does not encourage me to follow his example---He had given promise to dine with the same party tomorrow, but has sent an excuse which I am glad of as we shall have a pleasant party with us tomorrow. We expect Charles here today--- This is a beautiful day: I hope you will not quarrel with it if I call it an american one. The Sun comes upon the Snow and makes a prettier candy than we have on twelvth-cakes. George is busy this morning in making copies of my verses. He is making now one of an Ode to the nightingale, which is like reading an account of the b lack hole at Calcutta on an ice bergh. You will say this is a matter of course, I am glad it is. I mean that I should like your Brothers more, the more I know them. I should spend much more time with them if our lives were more run in parallel, but we can talk but on one subject that is you. The more I know of Men the more I know how to value entire liberality in any of them. Thank God there are a great many who will sacrifice their worldly interest for a friend: I wish there were more who would sacrifice their passions. The worst of Men are those whose self interests are their passion---the next those whose passions are their self- interest. Upon the whole I dislike Mankind: whatever people on the other side of the question may advance they cannot deny that they are always surprised at hearing of a good action and never of a bad one. I am glad you have something to like in America, Doves. Gertrude of Wyoming  969 and Birkbeck's book  970 should be bound up together like a Brace of Decoy Ducks. One is almost as poetical as the other. Precious miserable people at the Prairie. I have been sitting in the Sun whilest I wrote this till it became quite oppressive, this is very odd for January. The vulcan fire is the true natural heat for Winter: the Sun has nothing to do in winter but to give "a little glooming light much like a Shade"  971 \---Our irish Servant has piqued me this morning by saying that her Father in Ireland was very much like my Shakspeare  972 only he had more color than the Engraving. You will find on Georges return that I have not been neglecting your affairs. The delay was unfortunate, not faulty;---perhaps by this time you have received my three last letters  973 not one of which had reach'd before George sail'd, I would give two pence to have been over the world as much as he has---I wish I had money enough to do nothing but travel about for years---Were you now in England I dare say you would be able (setting aside the pleasure you would have in seeing your mother) to suck out more amusemement for Saciety than I am able to do. To me it is all as dull here as Louisville could be. I am tired of the Theatres. Almost all the parties I may chance to fall into I know by heart. I know the different Styles of talk in different places: what subjects will be started how it will proceed, like an acted play, from the first to the last, Act---If I go to Hunt's I run my head into many-times heard puns and music. To Haydon's worn out discourses of poetry and painting: the Miss Reynolds I am affraid to speak to for fear of some sickly reiteration of Phrase or Sentiment. When they were at the dance the other night I tried manfully to sit near and talk to them, but to not  for no  purpose, and if I had't would have been to no purpose still. My question or observation must have been an old one, and the rejoinder very antique indeed. At Dilkes I fall foul of Politics. 'Tis best to remain aloof from people and like their good parts without being eternally troubled with the dull processes of their every day Lives. When once a person has smok'd the vapidness of the routine of Saciety he must have either self interest or the love of some sort of distinction to keep him in good humour with it. All I can say is that standing at Charing cross and looking east west north and South I can see nothing but dullness. I hope while I am young to live retired in the Country, when I grow in years and have a right to be idle I shall enjoy cities more. If the American Ladies are worse than the English they must be very bad. You say you should like your Emily brought up here. You had better bring her up yourself. You know a good number of english Ladies what encomium could you give of half a dozen of them---the greater part seem to me downright American. I have known more than one Mrs Audubon their affectation of fashion and politeness cannot transcend ours. Look at our Cheapside Tradesmans sons and daughters---only fit to be taken off by a plague. I hope now soon to come to the time when I shall never be forc'd to walk through the City and hate as I walk. Monday Jany 17\. George had a quick rejoinder to his Letter of excuse to Haslam so we had not his company yesterday which I was sorry for as there was our old set. I know three witty people all distinct in their excellence--- Rice, Reynolds and Richards.  974 Rice is the wisest, Reynolds the playfullest, Richards the out o' the wayest. The first makes you laugh and think, the second makes you laught and not think, the third puzzles your head---I admire the first, I enjoy the second, I stare at the third. The first is Claret, the second Ginger beer, the third Cr eme de Bzrapqmdrag.  975 The first is inspired by Minerva, the second by Mercury, the third by Harlequin Epigram Esqre---The first is neat in his dress, the second slovenly, the third uncomfortable---The first speaks adagio, the second allegretto, the third both together. The first is swiftean, the second Tom cribean,  976 the third Shandean---and yet these three Eans are not three Eans but one Ean. Charles came on Saturday, but went early: he seems to have Schemes and plans and wants to get off. He is quite right, I am glad to see him employed at his years. You remember I wrote you a Story about a woman named Alice  977 being made young again---or some such stuff---In your next Letter tell me whether I gave it as my own or whether I gave it as a matter Brown was employed upon at the time. He read it over to George the other day, and George said he had heard it all before. So Brown suspects I have been giving You his Story as my own---I should like to set him right in it by your Evidence. George has not return'd from Town when he does I shall tax his memory. We had a young, long, raw, lean Scotchman with us yesterday called Thornton. Rice for fun or for mistake would persist in calling him Stevenson. I know three people of no wit at all, each distinct in his excellence. A. B, and C. A is the soolishest, B the sulkiest, C is a negative ---A makes you yawn, B makes you hate, as for C you never see him though he is six feet high. I bear the first, I forbear the second I am not certain that the third is. The first is gruel, the second Ditch water, the third is spilt ---he ought to be wip'd up A is inspired by Jack o' the Clock---B, has been drill'd by a russian Sargeant, C---they say is not his Mothers true Child but that she bought him of the Man who cries 'Young Lambs to sell." Twang dillo dee.. This you must know is the Amen to nonsense. I know many places where Amen should be scratched out, rubb'd over with pounce made of Momus's little finger bones, and in its place 'Twang-dillo-dee' written. This is the word I shall henceforth be tempted to write at the end of most modern Poems. Every American Book ought to have it. It would be a good distinction in Saciety. My Lords Wellington, Castlereagh and Canning and many more would do well to wear Twangdillo-dee written on their Backs instead of wearing ribbands in their Button holes. How many people would go sideways along walls and quickset hedges to keep their Twang dillo dee out of sight, or wear large pigtails to hide it. However there would be so many that the Twang dillo dees would keep one another in Countenance---which Brown cannot do for me. I have fallen away lately. Thieves and Murderers would gain rank in the world--- for would any one of them have the poorness of spirit to condescend to be a Twang dillo dee---"I have robb'd in many a dwelling house, I have kill'd many a fowl many a goose and many a Man," (would such a gentleman say) but thank heaven I was never yet a Twang dillo dee." Some philosophers in the Moon who spy at our Globe as we do at theirs say that Twang dillo dee is written in large Letters on our Globe of Earth---They say the beginning of the T is just on the spot where London stands. London being built within the Flourish--- w a n reach downward and slant as far a s Timbuctoo in africa, the tail of the G. goes slap across the Atlantic into the Rio della Plata---the remainder of the Letters wrap round new holland and the last e terminates on land we have not yet discovered. However I must be silent, these are dangerous times to libel a man in, much more a world. Friday 27th. 978 I wish you would call me names. I deserve them so much. I have only written two sheets for you, to carry by George and those I forgot to bring to town and have therefore to forward them to Liverpool. George went this morning at 6 o Clock by the Liverpool Coach---His being on his journey to you, prevents me regreeting his short stay. I have no news of any sort to tell you. Henry is wifebound in Cambden Town, there is no getting him out. I am sorry he has not a prettier wife: indeed 'tis a shame: she is not half a wife. I think I could find some of her relations in Buffon, or Captn Cook's voyages, or the hie rogue glyphics in Moors almanack,  979 or upon a chinese Clock door, the Shepherdesses on her own mantlepiece, or in a cruel sampler in which she may find herself worsted, or in a dutch toy shop windown, or one of the Daughters in the Ark, or in any picture shop window.  980 As I intend to retire into the Country where there will be no sort of news, I shall not be able to write you very long Letters---Besides I am affraid the Postage comes to too much; which till now I have not been aware of. We had a fine Packing up at   torn  other things I saw  torn . People in milatary Bands are generally seriously occupied---none may or can laugh at their work but the Kettle Drum---Long drum Do Triangle, and Cymbals---Thinking you might want a Ratcatcher I put your mother's old quaker-colour'd Cat into the top of your bonnet---she's wi' kitten, so you may expect to find a whole family---I hope the family will not grow too large for its Lodging. I shall send you a close written Sheet on the first of next Month but for fear of missing the Liverpool Post I must finish here. God bless you and your little Girl. Your affectionate Brother John Keats--- Address : Miss Brawne. No postmark. 981 Dearest Fanny, I shall send this the moment you return. They say I must remain confined to this room for some time. The consciousness that you love me will make a pleasant prison of the house next to yours. You must come and see me frequently: this evening, without fail---when you must not mind about my speaking in a low tone for I am ordered to do so though I can speak out. Yours ever sweetest love.--- J. Keats. turn over Perhaps your Mother is not at home and so you must wait till she comes. You must see me to-night and let me hear you promise to come to-morrow. Brown told me you were all out. I have been looking for the stage the whole afternoon. Had I known this I could not have remain'd so silent all day. Address : Miss Keats  Rd. Abbey Esqre  Pancras Lane Queen Street Cheapside Postmark : HAMPSTEAD 7 FE 1820. 982 Wentworth Place Sunday Morning. My dear Sister, I should not have sent those Letters without some notice if Mr Brown had not persuaded me against it on account of an illness with which I was attack'd on Thursday. After that I was resolved not to write till I should be on the mending hand: thank God, I am now so. From imprudently leaving off my great coat in the thaw I caught cold which flew to my Lungs. Every remedy that has been applied has taken the desired effect, and I have nothing now to do but stay within doors for some time. If I should be confined long I shall write to Mr Abbey to ask permission for you to visit me. George has been running great chance of a similar attack, but I hope the Sea air will be his Physician in case of illness---the air out at sea is always more temperate than on land. George mentiond, in his Letters to us, something of Mr Abbey's regret concerning the silence kept up in his house. It is entirely the fault of his Manner. You must be careful always to wear warm cloathing not only in frost but in a Thaw---I have no news to tell you. The half built houses opposite us stand just as they were and seem dying of old age before they are brought up. The grass looks very dingy, the Celery is all gone, and there is nothing to enliven one but a few Cabbage Stalks that seem fix'd on the superannuated List. Mrs Dilke has been ill but is better. Several of my friends have been to see me. Mrs Reynolds was here this morning and the two Mr Wylies. Brown has been very alert about me, though a little wheezy himself this weather. Every body is ill. Yesterday evening Mr Davenport,  983 a gentleman of hampstead sent me an invitation to supper, instead of his coming to see us, having so bad a cold he could not stir out---so you see tis the weather and I am among a thousand. Whenever you have an inflammatory fever never mind about eating. The day on which I was getting ill I felt this fever to a great height, and therefore almost entirely abstained from food the whole day. I have no doubt experienc'd a benefit from so doing---The Papers I see are full of anecdotes of the late King:  984 how he nodded to a Coal heaver and laugh'd with a Quaker and lik'd boil'd Leg of Mutton. Old Peter Pindar is just dead: what will the old King and he say to each other? Perhaps the King may confess that Peter was in the right, and Peter maintain himself to have been wrong. You shall hear from me again on tuesday. Your affectionate Brother John. Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbey Esqre  Pancras Lane  Queen Street Cheapside Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 7 o'clock FE 9 1820. Wentworth Place Tuesday morn. My dear Fanny--- I had a slight return of fever last night, which terminated favourably, and I am now tolerably well, though weak from small quantity of food to which I am obliged to confine myself: I am sure a mouse would starve upon it. Mrs Wylie came yesterday. I have a very pleasant room for a sick person. A Sopha bed is made up for me in the front Parlour which looks on to the grass plot as you remember Mrs Dilkes does. How much more comfortable than a dull room up stairs, where one gets tired of the pattern of the bed curtains. Besides I see all that passes---for instance now, this morning, if I had been in my own room I should not have seen the coals brought in. On sunday between the hours of twelve and one I descried a Pot boy. I conjectured it might be the one o'Clock beer---Old women with bobbins and red cloaks and unpresuming bonnets I see creeping about the heath. Gipseys after hare skins and silver spoons. Then goes by a fellow with a wooden clock under his arm that strikes a hundred and more. Then comes the old french emigrant, (who has been very well to do in france) whith his hands joined behind on his hips, and his face full of political schemes. Then passes Mr David Lewis  985 a very goodnatured, goodlooking old gentleman whas  for who  has been very kind to Tom and George and me. As for those fellows the Brickmakers they are always passing to and fro. I mus'n't forget the two old maiden Ladies in well walk who have a Lap dog between them that they are very anxious about. It is a corpulent Little Beast whom it is necessary to coax along with an ivory-tipp'd cane. Carlo  986 our Neighbour Mrs Brawne's dog and it meet sometimes. Lappy thinks Carlo a devil of a fellow and so do his Mistresses. Well they may---he would sweep 'em all down at a run; all for the Joke of it. I shall desire him to peruse the fable of the Boys and the frogs: though he prefers the tongues and the Bones.  987 You shall hear from me again the day after tomorrow--- Your affectionate Brother John Keats Address : Miss Brawne. No postmark. My dearest Girl, If illness makes such an agreeable variety in the manner of your eyes I should wish you sometimes to be ill. I wish I had read your note before you went last night that I might have assured you how far I was from suspecting any coldness. You had a just right to be a little silent to one who speaks so plainly to you. You must believe---you shall, you will---that I can do nothing, say nothing, think nothing of you but what has its spring in the Love which has so long been my pleasure and torment. On the night I was taken ill ---when so violent a rush of blood came to my Lungs that I felt nearly suffocated---I assure you I felt it possible I might not survive, and at that moment thought of nothing but you. When I said to Brown 'this is unfortunate'  988 I thought of you. 'Tis true that since the first two or three days other subjects have entered my head.  989 I shall be looking forward to Health and the Spring and a regular routine of our old Walks. Your affectionate J. K. Address : Miss Brawne. No postmark. My sweet love, I shall wait patiently till to-morrow before I see you, and in the mean time, if there is any need of such a thing, assure you by your Beauty, that whenever I have at any time written on a certain unpleasant subject, it has been with your welfare impress'd upon my mind. How hurt I should have been had you ever acceded to what is, notwithstanding, very reasonable! How much the more do I love you from the general result! In my present state of Health I feel too much separated from you and could almost speak to you in the words of Lorenzo's Ghost to Isabella Your Beauty grows upon me and I feel A greater love through all my essence steal.  990 My greatest torment since I have known you has been the fear of you being a little inclined to the Cressid;  991 but that suspicion I dismiss utterly and remain happy in the surety of your Love, which I assure you is as much a wonder to me as a delight. Send me the words 'Good night' to put under my pillow. Dearest Fanny, Your affectionate J. K. Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbey Esqre  Pancras Lane  Queen Street Cheapside Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 11 FE 1820 992 Wentworth Place My dear Fanny, I am much the same as when I last wrote. I hope a little more verging towards improvement. Yesterday morning being very fine, I took a walk for a quarter of an hour in the garden and was very much refresh'd by it. You must consider no news, good news---if you do not hear from me the day after tomorrow--- Your affectionate Brother John Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbey Esqre  Pancras Lane Queen St  Cheapside Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 14 FE 1820 Wentworth Place Monday Morn--- My dear Fanny, I am improving but very gradually and suspect it will be a long while before I shall be able to walk six miles---The Sun appears half inclined to shine; if he obliges us I shall take a turn in the garden this morning. No one from Town has visited me since my last. I have had so many presents of jam and jellies that they would reach side by side the length of the sideboard. I hope I shall be well before it is all consumed. I am vex'd that Mr Abbey will not allow you pocket money sufficient. He has not behaved well---By detaining money from me and George when we most wanted it he has increased our expences. In consequence of such delay George was obliged to take his voyage to england which will be £150 out of his Pocket. I enclose you a Note---You shall hear from me again the day after tomorrow. Your affectionate Brother John Address : Miss Brawne No postmark. My dearest Girl, According to all appearances I am to be separated from you as much as possible. How I shall be able to bear it, or whether it will not be worse than your presence now and then, I cannot tell. I must be patient, and in the mean time you must think of it as little as possible. Let me not longer detain you from going to Town---there may be no end to this imprisoning of you. Perhaps you had better not come before tomorrow evening: send me however without fail a good night. You know our situation---what hope is there if I should be recoverd ever so soon---my very health with  for will  not suffer me to make any great exertion. I am reccommended not even to read poetry, much less write it. I wish I had even a little hope. I cannot say forget me---but I would mention that there are impossibilities in the world. No more of this. I am not strong enough to be weaned--- take no notice of it in your good night. Happen what may I shall ever be my dearest Love Your affectionate J---K--- Address : Miss Brawne. No postmark. My dearest Girl, how could it ever have been my wish to forget you? how could I have said such a thing? The utmost stretch my mind has been capable of was to endeavour to forget you for your own sake seeing what a change   for chance  there was of my remaining in a precarious state of health. I would have borne it as I would bear death if fate was in that humour: but I should as soon think of choosing to die as to part from you. Believe too my Love that our friends think and speak for the best, and if their best is not our best it is not their fault. When I am better I will speak with you at large on these subjects, if there is any occasion---I think there is none. I am rather nervous today perhaps from being a little recovered and suffering my mind to take little excursions beyond the doors and windows. I take it for a good sign, but as it must not be encouraged you had better delay seeing me till tomorrow. Do not take the trouble of writing much: merely send me my good night. Remember me to your Mother and Margaret. Your affectionate J. K. Address : Miss Brawne No postmark. 993 My dearest Fanny, Then all we have to do is to be patient. Whatever violence I may sometimes do myself by hinting at what would appear to any one but ourselves a matter of necessity, I do not think I could bear any approach of a thought of losing you. I slept well last night, but cannot say that I improve very fast. I shall expect you tomorrow, for it is certainly better that I should see you seldom. Let me have your good night. Your affectionate J---K--- Address : Mr James Rice  50 Poland Street  Oxford Street Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 16 FE 1820 Wentworth Place Monday Morn. My dear Rice, I have not been well enough to make any tolerable rejoinder to your kind Letter. I will as you advise be very chary of my health and spirits. I am sorry to hear of your relapse and hypochondriac symptoms attending it. Let us hope for the best as you say. I shall follow your example in looking to the future good rather than brooding upon present ill. I have not been so worn with lengthen'd illnesses as you have therefore cannot answer you on your own ground with respect to those haunting and deformed thoughts and feelings you speak of. When I have been or supposed myself in health I have had my share of them, especially within this last year. I may say that for 6 Months before I was taken ill I had not passed a tranquil day. Either that gloom overspread me or I was suffering under some passionate feeling, or if I turn'd to versify that acerbated the poison of either sensation. The Beauties of Nature had lost their power over me. How astonishingly (here I must premise that illness as far as I can judge in so short a time has relieved my Mind of a load of deceptive thoughts and images and makes me perceive things in a truer light)---How astonishingly does the chance of leaving the world impress a sense of its natural beauties on us. Like poor Falstaff, though I do not babble, I think of green fields.  994 I muse with the greatest affection on every flower I have known from my infancy---their shapes and coulours are as  995 new to me as if I had just created them with a superhuman fancy. It is because they are connected with the most thoughtless and happiest moments of our Lives. I have seen foreign flowers in hothouses of the most beautiful nature, but I do not care a straw for them. The simple flowers of our spring are what I want to see again. Brown has left the inventive and taken to the imitative art---he is doing his forte which is copying Hogarth's heads. He has just made a purchace of the methodist meeting Picture,  996 which gave me a horrid dream a few nights ago. I hope I shall sit under the trees with you again in some such place as the isle of Wight. I do not mind a game at cards in a saw pit or waggon; but if ever you catch me on a stage coach in the winter full against the wind bring me down with a brace of bullets and I promise not to 'peach". Remember me to Reynolds and say how much I should like to hear from him: that Brown returned immediately after he went on Sunday, and that I was vex'd at forgetting to ask him to lunch for as he went towards the gate I saw he was fatigued and hungry. I am my dear Rice ever most sincer ely yours John Keats I have broken this open to let you know I was surprised at seeing it on the table this morning, thinking it had gone long ago  997 Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbey Esqre  Pancras Lane. Queen St  Cheapside. Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 19 FE 1820 My dear Fanny, Being confined almost entirely to vegetable food and the weather being at the same time so much against me, I cannot say I have much improved since I wrote last. The Doctor tells me there are no dangerous Symptoms about me and that quietness of mind and fine weather will restore me. Mind my advice to be very careful to wear warm cloathing in a thaw. I will write again on Tuesday when I hope to send you good news. Your affectionate Brother John--- Address : Miss Brawne. No postmark. My dearest Fanny, I read your note in bed last night, and that might be the reason of my sleeping so much better. I think Mr Brown is right in supposing you may stop too long with me, so very nervous as I am. Send me every evening a written Good night. If you come for a few minutes about six it may be the best time. Should you ever fancy me too low-spirited I must warn you to ascbribe it to the medicine I am at present taking which is of a nerve-shaking nature. I shall impute any depression I may experience to this cause. I have been writing with a vile old pen the whole week, which is excessively ungallant. The fault is in the Quill: I have mended it and still it is very much inclin'd to make blind es. However these last lines are in a much better style of penmanship thof a little disfigured by the smear of black currant jelly; which has made a little mark on one of the Pages of Brown's Ben Jonson, the very best book he has. I have lick'd it but it remains very purple  998 \---I did not know whether to say purple or blue so in the mixture of the thought wrote purplue which may be an excellent name for a colour made up of those two, and would suit well to start next spring. Be very careful of open doors and windows and going without your duffle grey---God bless you Love!--- J. Keats--- P.S. I am sitting in the back room. Remember me to your Mother--- Address : Miss Brawne. No postmark. My dear Fanny, Do not let your mother suppose that you hurt me by writing at night. For some reason or other your last night's note was not so treasureable as former ones. I would fain that you call me Love still. To see you happy and in high spirits  999 is a great consolation to me---still let me believe that you are not half so happy as my restoration would make you. I am nervous, I own, and may think myself worse than I really am; if so you must indulge me, and pamper with that sort of tenderness you have manifested towards me in different Letters. My sweet creature when I look back upon the pains and torments I have suffer'd for you from the day I left you to go to the isle of Wight; the extasies in which I have pass'd some days and the miseries in their turn, I wonder the more at the Beauty which has kept up the spell so fervently. When I send this round I shall be in the front parlour watching to see you show yourself for a minute in the garden. How illness stands as a barrier betwixt me and you! Even if I was well ---I must make myself as good a Philosopher as possible. Now I have had opportunities of passing nights anxious and awake I have found other thoughts intrude upon me. "If I should die," said I to myself, "I have left no immortal work behind me---nothing to make my friends proud of my memory---but I have lov'd the principle of beauty in all things, and if I had had time I would have made myself remember'd."  1000 Thoughts like these came very feebly whilst I was in health and every pulse beat for you---now you divide with this (may I say it?) "last infirmity of noble minds"  1001 all my reflection. God bless you, Love. J. Keats. Address : Mrs Brawne No postmark. My dearest Girl, You spoke of having been unwell in your last note: have you recover'd? That note has been a great delight to me. I am stronger than I was: the Doctors say there is very little the matter with me, but I cannot believe them till the weight and tightness of my Chest is mitigated. I will not indulge or pain myself by complaining of my long separation from you. God alone knows whether I am destined to taste of happiness with you: at all events I myself know thus much, that I consider it no mean Happiness to have lov'd you thus far---if it is to be no further I shall not be unthankful ---if I am to recover, the day of my recovery shall see me by your side from which nothing shall separate me. If well you are the only medicine that can keep me so. Perhaps, aye surely, I am writing in too depress'd a state of mind--- ask your Mother to come and see me---she will bring you a better account than mine. Ever your affectionate John Keats. Address : Miss Brawne. No postmark. My dearest Girl, Indeed I will not deceive you with respect to my Health. This is the fact as far as I know. I have been confined three weeks and am not yet well---this proves that there is something wrong about me which my constitution will either conquer or give way to. Let us hope for the best. Do you hear the Thrush singing over the field? I think it is a sign of mild weather---so much the better for me. Like all Sinners now I am ill I philosophise aye out of my attachment to every thing, Trees, flowers, Thrushes Spring, Summer, Claret &c &c---aye every thing but you--- ---my Sister would be glad of my company a little longer. That Thrush is a fine fellow I hope he was fortunate in his choice this year. Do not send any more of my Books home. I have a great pleasure in the thought of you looking on them. Ever yours my sweet Fanny J. K. Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbey's Esqre  Walthamstow--- Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 25 FE 1820 Wentworth Place Thursday My dear Fanny, I am sorry to hear you have been so unwell: now you are better, keep so. Remember to be very careful of your cloathing---this climate requires the utmost care. There has been very little alteration in me lately. I am much the same as when I wrote last. When I am well enough to return to my old diet I shall get stronger. If my recovery should be delay'd long I will ask Mr Abbey to let you visit me---Keep up your Spirits as well as you can. You shall hear soon again from me--- Your affectionate Brother John--- Address : John Keats Esqre No postmark. Friday 25 Store Street Bedford Square My dear Sir, I send you 'Marcian Colonna' which think as well of as you can. There is, I think, (at least in the 2nd and 3rd parts) a stronger infusion of poetry in it than in the Sicilian Story---but I may be mistaken. 1002 I am looking forward with some impatience to the publication of your book. Will you write my name in an early copy and send it to me? 1003 Is not this a 'prodigious bold request'? I hope that you are getting quite well. Believe me very sincerely yours B. W. Procter. Address : Mr J. H. Reynolds  18 Portland Street  Poland Street Postmarks : LOMBARD STREET and 28 FE 1820 My dear Reynolds, I have been improving since you saw me: my nights are better which I think is a very encouraging thing. You mention your cold in rather too slighting a manner ---if you travel outside have some flannel against the wind ---which I hope will not keep on at this rate when you are in the Packet boat. Should it rain do not stop upon deck though the Passengers should vomit themselves inside out. Keep under Hatches from all sort of wet. I am pretty well provided with Books at present, when you return I may give you a commission or two. Mr B. C.  1004 has sent me not only his Sicilian Story but yesterday his Dramatic Scenes--- this is very polite and I shall do what I can to make him sensible I think so. I confess they tease me---they are composed of Amiability---the Seasons, the Leaves, the Moon &c. upon which he rings (according to Hunt's expression) triple bob majors. However that is nothing---I think he likes poetry for its own sake, not his. I hope I shall soon be well enough to proceed with my faeries  1005 and set you about the notes on Sundays and Stray-days. If I had been well enough I should have liked to cross the water with you. Brown wishes you a pleasant voyage---Have fish for dinner at the sea ports, and dont forget a bottle of Claret. You will not meet with so much to hate at Brussels as at Paris. Remember me to all my friends. If I were well enough I would paraphrase an Ode of Horace's  1006 for you, on your embarking in the seventy years ago style---the Packet will bear a comparison with a roman galley at any rate. Ever yours affectionately J. Keats Address : Miss Brawne No postmark. My dearest Fanny, I had a better night last night than I have had since my attack, and this morning I am the same as when you saw me. I have been turning over two volumes of Letters written between Rousseau and two Ladies in the perplexed strain of mingled finesse and sentiment in which the Ladies and gentlemen of those days were so clever, and which is still prevalent among Ladies of this Country who live in a state of reasoning romance. The likeness however only extends to the mannerism, not to the dexterity. What would Rousseau have said at seeing our little correspondence!  1007 What would his Ladies have said! I don't care much---I would sooner have Shakspeare's opinion about the matter. The common gossiping of washerwomen must be less disgusting than the continual and eternal fence and attack of Rousseau and these sublime Petticoats. One calls herself Clara and her friend Julia, two of Rousseau's heroines---they all  for at  the same time christen poor Jean Jacques St. Preux---who is the pure cavalier of his famous novel. Thank God I am born in England with our own great Men before my eyes. Thank God that you are fair and can love me without being Letter-written and sentimentaliz'd into it.---Mr Barry Cornwall  1008 has sent me another Book, his first, with a polite note. I must do what I can to make him sensible of the esteem I have for his kindness. If this north east would take a turn it would be so much the better for me. Good bye, my love, my dear love, my beauty--- love me for ever. J. K. Address : Miss Brawne. No postmark. My dearest Girl, I continue much the same as usual, I think a little better. My Spirits are better also, and consequently I am more resign'd to my confinement. I dare not think of you much or write much to you. Remember me to all. Ever your affectionate John Keats. Address : Miss Brawne. No postmark. My dear Fanny, I think you had better not make any long stay with me when Mr Brown is at home ---whenever he goes out you may bring your work. You will have a pleasant walk to day. I shall see you pass. I shall follow you with my eyes over the Heath. Will you come towards evening instead of before dinner---when you are gone, 'tis past---if you do not come till the evening I have something to look forward to all day. Come round to my window for a moment when you have read this. Thank your Mother, for the preserves, for me. The raspberry will be too sweet not having any acid; therefore as you are so good a girl I shall make you a present of it. Good bye My sweet Love! J. Keats. Address : Miss Brawne. No postmark. My dearest Fanny, The power of your benediction is of not so weak a nature as to pass from the ring in four and twenty hours---it is like a sacred Chalice once consecrated and ever consecrate. I shall kiss your name and mine where your Lips have been ---Lips! why should a poor prisoner as I am talk about such things. Thank God, though I hold them the dearest pleasures in the universe, I have a consolation independent of them in the certainty of your affection. I could write a song in the style of Tom Moore's Pathetic about Memory  1009 if that would be any relief to me. No 'twould not. I will be as obdurate as a Robin. I will not sing in a cage. Health is my expected heaven and you are my Houri---this word I believe is both singular and plural---if only plural, never mind---you are a thousand of them. Ever yours affectionately my dearest--- J. K. You had better not come to-day. Address : Mrs Wylie  3 Romney Street  Westminster. Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and ... 4 1820 1010 Wentworth Place Friday Morn. My dear Mrs Wylie, I have been very negligent in not letting you hear from me for so long a time considering the anxiety I know you feel for me. Charles has been here this morning and will tell you that I am better. Just as he came in I was sitting down to write to you, and I shall not let his visit supersede these few lines. Charles enquired whether I had heard from George. It is impossible to guess whether he has landed yet, and if he has, it will take at least a month for any communication to reach us. I hope you keep your spirits a great height above the freezing point, and live in expectation of good news next summer. Louisville is not such a Monstrous distance: if Georgiana liv'd at York it would be just as far off. You see George will make nothing of the journey here and back. His absence will have been perhaps a fortunate event for Georgiana, for the pleasure of his return will be so great that it will wipe away the consciousness of many troubles felt before very deeply. She will see him return'd from us and be convinced that the separation is not so very formidable although the Atlantic is between. If George succeeds it will be better certainly that they should stop in America: if not why not return? It is better in ill luck to have at least the comfort of ones friends than to be shipwreck'd among Americans. But I have good hopes as far as I can judge from what I have heard from George. He should by this time be taught Alertness and Carefulness---If they should stop in America for five or six years let us hope they may have about three Children: then the eldest will be getting old enough to be society. The very crying will keep their ears employed, and their spirits from being melancholy. Mrs Millar I hear continues confined to her Chamber---if she would take my advice I should recommender to keep it till the middle of April and then go to some Sea-town in Devonshire which is sheltered from the east wind---which blows down the channel very briskly even in April.  1011 Give my Compliments to Miss Millar and Miss Waldegrave Your affectionate friend John Keats. torn me to Charles. Address : Miss Brawne No postmark. My dearest Love, You must not stop so long in the cold---I have been suspecting that window to be open.---Your Note halfcured me. When I want some more oranges I will tell you these are just a propos. I am kept from food so feel rather weak---otherwise very well. Pray do not stop so long up stairs---it makes me uneasy---come every now and then and stop a half minute. Remember me to your Mother Your ever affectionate J. Keats. Address : Miss Brawne No postmark. Sweetest Fanny, You fear, sometimes, I do not love you so much as you wish? My dear Girl I love you ever and ever and without reserve. The more I have known you the more have I lov'd. In every way---even my jealousies have been agonies of Love, in the hottest fit I ever had I would have died for you. I have vex'd you too much. But for Love! Can I help it? You are always new.  1012 The last of your kisses was ever the sweetest; the last smile the brightest; the last movement the gracefullest. When you pass'd my window home yesterday, I was fill'd with as much admiration as if I had then seen you for the first time. You uttered a half complaint once that I only lov'd your Beauty.  1013 Have I nothing else then to love in you but that? Do not I see a heart naturally furnish'd with wings imprison itself with me? No ill prospect has been able to turn your thoughts a moment from me. This perhaps should be as much a subject of sorrow as joy---but I will not talk of that. Even if you did not love me I could not help an entire devotion to you: how much more deeply then must I feel for you knowing you love me. My Mind has been the most discontented and restless one that ever was put into a body too small for it. I never felt my Mind repose upon anything with complete and undistracted enjoyment---upon no person but you. When you are in the room my thoughts never fly out of window: you always concentrate my whole senses. The anxiety shown about our Loves in your last note is an immense pleasure to me: however you must not suffer such speculations to molest you any more: nor will I any more believe you can have the least pique against me. Brown is gone out---but here is Mrs Wylie  1014 \---when she is gone I shall be awake for you.---Remembrances to your Mother. Your affectionate J. Keats. Address : Mr Chas. W. Dilke  3 Great Smith Street  Westminster. Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 4 MR 1820 My dear Dilke, Since I saw you I have been gradually, too gradually perhaps, improving; and though under an interdict with respect to animal food living upon pseudo victuals, Brown says I have pick'd up a little flesh, lately. If I can keep off inflammation for the next six weeks I trust I shall do very well. You certainly should have been at Martin's dinner for making an index is surely as dull work as engraving. Have you heard that the Bookseller is going to tie himself himself to the manger eat or not as he pleases? He says Rice shall have his foot on the fender notwithstanding. Reynolds is going to sail on the salt seas. Brown has been mightily progressing with his Hogarth.  1015 A damn'd melancholy picture it is, and during the first week of my illness it gave me a psalm singing nightmare, that made me almost faint away in my sleep. I know I am better, for I can bear the Picture. I have experienced a specimen of great politeness from Mr Barry Cornwall. He has sent me his books. Some time ago he had given his first publish'd book to Hunt for me; Hunt forgot to give it and Barry Cornwall thinking I had received it must have thought me a very neglectful fellow. Notwithstanding he sent me his second book  1016 and on my explaining that I had not received his first he sent me that also. I am sorry to see by Mrs D's note that she has been so unwell with the spasms. Does she continue the Medicines that benefited her so much? I am affraid not. Remember me to her and say I shall not expect her at Hampstead next week unless the Weather changes for the warmer. It is better to run no chance of a supernumerary cold in March. As for you you must come. You must improve in your penmanship; your writing is like the speaking of a child of three years old, very understandable to its father but to no one else. The worst is it looks well---no that is not the worst---the worst is, it is worse than Bailey's. Bailey's looks illegible and may perchance be read; your's looks very legible and may perchance not be read. I would endeavour to give you a fac simile of your word Thistlewood if I were not minded on the instant that Lord chesterfield has done some such thing to his Son.  1017 Now I would not bathe in the same River with lord C. though I had the upper hand of the stream. I am grieved that in writing and speaking it is necessary to make use of the same particles as he did. Cobbett is expected to come in. O that I had two double plumpers for him. The ministry are not so inimical to him but it would like to put him out of Coventry. Casting my eye on the other side I see a long word written in a most vile manner,  1018 unbecoming a Critic. You must recollect I have served no apprenticeship to old plays. If the only copies of the greek and Latin Authors had been made by you, Bailey and Haydon they were as good as lost. The It has been said that the Character of a Man may be known by his handwriting---if the Character of the age may be known by the average goodness of said, what a slovenly age we live in. Look at Queen Elizabeth's Latin exercises and blush. Look at Milton's hand. I cant say a word for shakespeare. Your sincere friend John Keats Address : Miss Brawne No postmark. My dear Fanny, I am much better this morning than I was a week ago: indeed I improve a little every day. I rely upon taking a walk with you upon the first of may: in the mean time undergoing a babylonish captivity I shall not be jew enough to hang up my harp upon a willow,  1019 . but rather endeavour to clear up my arrears in versifying and with returning health begin upon something new: pursuant to which resolution it will be necessary to have my or rather Taylor's manuscript,  1020 which you, if you please, will send by my Messenger either to day or tomorrow. Is Mr D.  1021 with you today? You appear'd very much fatigued last night: you must look a little brighter this morning. I shall not suffer my little girl ever to be obscured like glass breath'd upon, but always bright as it is her nature to. 1022 Feeding upon sham victuals and sitting by the fire will completely annul me. I have no need of an enchanted wax figure to duplicate me for I am melting in my proper person before the fire.  1023 If you meet with any thing better (worse) than common in your Magazines let me see it. Good bye my sweetest Girl J. K--- Address : Miss Brawne No postmark. My dearest Fanny, whe never you know me to be alone, come, no matter what day. Why will you go out this weather? I shall not fatigue myself with writing too much I promise you. Brown says I am getting stouter. I rest well and from last night do not remember any thing horrid in my dream, which is a capital symptom, for any organic derangement always occasions a Phantasmagoria. It will be a nice idle amusement to hunt after a motto for my Book which I will have if lucky enough to hit upon a fit one  1024 \---not intending to write a preface. I fear I am too late with my note---you are gone out---you will be as cold as a topsail in a north latitude---I advise you to furl yourself and come in a doors. Good bye Love. J. K. Address : Miss Brawne--- No postmark. My dearest Fanny, I slept well last night and am no worse this morning for it. Day by day if I am not deceived I get a more unrestrain'd use of my Chest. The nearer a racer gets to the Goal the more his anxiety becomes, so I lingering upon the borders of health feel my impatience increase. Perhaps on your account I have imagined my illness more serious than it is: how horrid was the chance of slipping into the ground instead of into your arms---the difference is amazing Love. Death must come at last; Man must die, as Shallow says;  1025 but before that is my fate I feign would try what more pleasures than you have given, so sweet a creature as you can give. Let me have another opportunity of years before me and I will not die without being remember'd.  1026 Take care of yourself dear that we may both be well in the Summer. I do not at all fatigue myself with writing, having merely to put a line or two here and there, a Task which would worry a stout state of the body and mind, but which just suits me as I can do no more. Your affectionate J. K.--- Address : Miss Brawne No postmark. My dearest Fanny, Though I shall see you in so short a time I cannot forbear sending you a few lines. You say I did not give you yesterday a minute account of my health. To- day I have left off the Medicine which I took to keep the pulse down and I find I can do very well without it, which is a very favourable sign, as it shows that there is no inflammation remaining. You think I may be wearied at night you say: it is my best time; I am at my best about eight o'Clock. I received a Note from Mr Proctor  1027 to-day. He says he cannot pay me a visit this weather as he is fearful of an inflammation in the Chest. What a horrid climate this is? or what careless inhabitants it has? You are one of them. My dear girl do not make a joke of it: do not expose yourself to the cold. There's the Thrush again---I can't afford it---he'll run me up a pretty Bill for Music---besides he ought to know I deal at Clementi's.  1028 How can you bear so long an imprisonment at Hampstead? I shall always remember it with all the gusto that a monopolizing carle should. I could build an Altar to you for it. Your affectionate J. K. Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbeys Esqre  Walthamstow. Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 20 MR 1820 My dear Fanny, According to your desire I write to day. It must be but a few lines for I have been attack'd several times with a palpitation at the heart and the Doctor says I must not make the slightest exertion. I am much the same to day as I have been for a week past. They say 'tis nothing but debility and will entirely cease on my recovery of my strength, which is the object of my present diet. As the Doctor will not suffer me to write I shall ask Mr Brown to let you hear news of me for the future if I should not get stronger soon. I hope I shall be well enough to come and see your flowers in bloom--- Ever your most affectionate Brother John--- Address : Miss Brawne No postmark. My dearest Girl, As, from the last part of my note you must see how gratified I have been by your remaining at home, you might perhaps conceive that I was equally bias'd the other way by your going to Town, I cannot be easy to-night without telling you you would be wrong to suppose so. Though I am pleased with the one, I am not displeased with the other. How do I dare to write in this manner about my pleasures and displeasures? I will tho' whilst I am an invalid, in spite of you. Good night, Love! J. K. Address : Miss Brawne No postmark. My dearest Girl, In consequence of our company---I suppose I shall not see you before tomorrow. I am much better today indeed all I have to complain of is want of strength and a little tightness in the Chest. I envied Sam's walk with you to day; which I will not do again as I may get very tired of envying. I imagine you now sitting in your new black dress which I like so much and if I were a little less selfish and more enthousiastic I should run round---and surprise you with a knock at the door. I fear I am too prudent for a dying kind of Lover. Yet, there is a great difference between going off in warm blood like Romeo, and making one's exit like a frog in a frost I had nothing particular to say to day, but not intending that there shall be any interruption to our correspondence (which at some future time I propose offering to Murray) I write something! God bless you my sweet Love! Illness is a long lane, but I see you at the end of it, and shall mend my pace as well as possible J. K. Address : Miss Brawne No postmark. Dear Girl, Yesterday you must have thought me worse than I really was. I assure you there was nothing but regret at being obliged to forego an embrace which has so many times been the highest gust  1029 of my Life. I would not care for health without it. Sam would not come in---I wanted merely to ask him how you were this morning. When one is not quite well we turn for relief to those we love: this is no weakness of spirit in me: you know when in health I thought of nothing but you; when I shall again be so it will be the same. Brown has been mentioning to me that some hint from Sam, last night, occasions him some uneasiness. He whispered something to you concerning Brown and old Mr Dilke which had the complexion of being something derogatory to the former. It was connected with an anxiety about Mr D. Sr's death and an anxiety to set out for Chichester. These sort of hints point out their own solution: one cannot pretend to a delicate ignorance on the subject: you understand the whole matter. If any one, my sweet Love, has misrepresented, to you, to your Mother or Sam, any circumstances which are at all likely, at a tenth remove, to create suspicions among people who from their own interested notions slander others, pray tell me: for I feel the least attaint on the disinterested character of Brown very deeply. Perhaps Reynolds or some other of my friends may come towards evening, therefore you may choose whether you will come to see me early to-day before or after dinner as you may think fit. Remember me to your Mother and tell her to drag you to me if you show the least reluctance--- [Signature missing.] Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbey Esqre  Walthamstow Postmark : HAMPSTEAD: date illegible. Wentworth Place April 1st My dear Fanny--- I am getting better every day and should think myself quite well were I not reminded every now and then by faintness and a tightness in the Chest. Send your Spaniel over to Hampstead for I think I know where to find a Master or Mistress for him. You may depend upon it if you were even to turn it loose in the common road it would soon find an owner. If I keep improving as I have done I shall be able to come over to you in the course of a few weeks. I should take the advantage of your being in Town but I cannot bear the City though I have already ventured as far as the west end for the purpose of seeing Mr Haydon's Picture which is just finished and has made its appearance.  1030 I have not heard from George yet since he left liverpool. Mr Brown wrote to him as from me the other day---Mr B. wrote two Letters to Mr Abbey concerning me---Mr A. took no notice and of course Mr B. must give up such a correspondence when as the man said all the Letters are on one side. I write with greater ease than I had thought, therefore you shall soon hear from me again. Your affectionate Brother John--- Address : Miss Keats---.

My dear Fanny--- Excuse these shabby scraps of paper I send you---and also from endeavouring to give you any consolation just at present for though my health is tolerably well I am too nervous to enter into any discussion in which my heart is concerned. Wait patiently and take care of your health being especially carefull to keep yourself from low spirits which are great enemies to health. You are young and have only need of a little patience. I am not yet able to bear the fatigue of coming to Walthamstow though I have been to Town once or twice. I have thought of taking a change of air. You shall hear from me immediately on my moving any where. I will ask Mrs Dilke to pay you a visit if the weather holds fine, the first time I see her. The Dog is being attended to like a Prince. Your affectionate Brother John Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbey Esqre  Walthamstow Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 21 AP 1820 My dear Fanny, I have been slowly improving since I wrote last. The Doctor assures me that there is nothing the matter with me except nervous irritability and a general weakness of the whole system which has proceeded from my anxiety of mind of late years and the too great excitement of poetry. Mr Brown is going to Scotland by the Smack, and I am advised for change of exercise and air to accompany him and give myself the chance of benefit from a Voyage. Mr H. Wylie call'd on me yesterday with a letter from George to his mother: George is safe on the other side of the water, perpaps by this time arrived at his home. I wish you were coming to town that I might see you; if you should be coming write to me, as it is quite a trouble to get by the coaches to Walthamstow. Should you not come to Town I must see you before I sail, at Walthamstow. They tell me I must study lines and tangents and squares and circles to put a little Ballast into my mind. We shall be going in a fortnight and therefore you will see me within that space. I expected sooner, but I have not been able to venture to walk across the Country. Now the fine Weather is come you will not fine  for find  your time so irksome. You must be sensible how much I regret not being able to alleviate the unpleasantness of your situation, but trust my dear Fanny that better times are in wait for you. Your affectionate Brother John--- Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbey Esqre  Walthamstow--- Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 4 MY 1820 Wentworth Place Thursday--- My dear Fanny, I went for the first time into the City the day before yesterday, for before I was very disinclined to encounter the Scuffle, more from nervousness than real illness; which notwithstanding I should not have suffered to conquer me if I had not made up my mind not to go to Scotland, but to remove to Kentish Town till Mr Brown returns. Kentish Town is a Mile nearer to you than Hampstead---I have been getting gradually better but am not so well as to trust myself to the casualties of rain and sleeping out which I am liable to in visiting you. Mr Brown goes on Saturday and by that time I shall have settled in my new Lodging when I will certainly venture to you. You will forgive me I hope when I confess that I endeavour to think of you as little as possible and to let George dwell upon my mind but slightly. The reason being that I am affraid to ruminate on any thing which has the shade of difficulty or melancholy in it, as that sort of cogitation is so pernicious to health, and it is only by health that I can be enabled to alleviate your situation in future. For some time you must do what you can of yourself for relief, and bear your mind up with the consciousness that your situation cannot last for ever, and that for the present you may console yourself against the reproaches of Mrs Abbey. Whatever obligations you may have had to her or her husband you have none now as she has reproach'd you. I do not know what property you have, but I will enquire into it: be sure however that beyond the obligations that a Lodger may have to a Landlord you have none to Mr Abbey. Let the surety of this make you laugh at Mrs A's foolish tattle. Mrs Dilke's Brother has got your Dog. She is now very well--- still liable to Illness. I will get her to come and see you if I can make up my mind on the propriety of introducing a stranger into Abbey's House.

It has lightened my time very much. I am much better. God bless you. Your affectionate J. Keats 1036 My dear Brown, You must not expect me to date my letter from such a place as this: you have heard the name; that is sufficient, except merely to tell you it is the 15th instant. You know I was very well in the smack; I have continued much the same, and am well enough to extract much more pleasure than pain out of the summer, even though I should get no better. I shall not say a word about the stanza you promised yourself through my medium, and will swear, at some future time, I promised. Let us hope I may send you more than one in my next. ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) No address or postmark. 1037 Tuesday Morn--- My dearest Girl, I wrote a Letter for you yesterday expecting to have seen your mother. I shall be selfish enough to send it though I know it may give you a little pain, because I wish you to see how unhappy I am for love of you, and endeavour as much as I can to entice you to give up your whole heart to me whose whole existence hangs upon you. You could not step or move an eyelid but it would shoot to my heart---I am greedy of you. Do not think of any thing but me. Do not live as if I was not existing---Do not forget me---But have I any right to say you forget me? Perhaps you think of me all day. Have I any right to wish you to be unhappy for me? You would forgive me for wishing it, if you knew the extreme passion I have that you should love me---and for you to love me as I do you, you must think of no one but me, much less write that sentence. Yesterday and this morning I have been haunted with a sweet vision---I have seen you the whole time in your shepherdess dress. How my senses have ached at it!  1038 How my heart has been devoted to it! How my eyes have been full of Tears at it! Indeed I think a real Love is enough to occupy the widest heart---Your going to town alone, when I heard of it was a shock to me---yet I expected it--- promise me you will not for some time, till I get better . Promise me this and fill the paper full of the most endearing names. If you cannot do so with good will, do my Love tell me---say what you think---confess if your heart is too much fasten'd on the world. Perhaps then I may see you at a greater distance, I may not be able to appropriate you so closely to myself. Were you to loose a favorite bird from the cage, how would your eyes ache after it as long as it was in sight; when out of sight you would recover a little. Perhaps if you would, if so it is, confess to me how many things are necessary to you besides me, I might be happier, by being less tantaliz'd. Well may you exclaim, how selfish, how cruel, not to let me enjoy my youth! to wish me to be unhappy! You must be so if you love me---upon my Soul I can be contented with nothing else. If you could really what is call'd enjoy yourself at a Party---if you can smile in peoples faces, and wish them to admire you now , you never have nor ever will love me. I see life in nothing but the certainty of your Love--- convince me of it my sweetest. If I am not somehow convinc'd I shall die of agony. If we love we must not live as other men and women do---I cannot brook the wolfsbane  1039 of fashion and foppery and tattle. You must be mine to die upon the rack if I want you. I do not pretend to say I have more feeling than my fellows--- but I wish you seriously to look over my letters kind and unkind and consider whether the Person who wrote them can be able to endure much longer the agonies and uncertainties which you are so peculiarly made to create---My recovery of bodily hea lth will be of no benefit to me if you are not all mine when I am well. For God's sake save me---or tell me my passion is of too awful a nature for you. Again God bless you J. K. No---my sweet Fanny---I am wrong. I do not want you to be unhappy---and yet I do, I must while there is so sweet a Beauty---my loveliest my darling! Good bye! I Kiss you---O the torments!

My dear Taylor, In reading over the proof of St. Agnes' Eve since I left Fleet street I was struck with what appears to me an alteration in the 7th Stanza very much for the worse the passage I mean stands thus "her maiden eyes incline Still on the floor, while many a sweeping train Pass by---" Twas originally written "her maiden eyes divine Fix'd on the floor saw many a sweeping train Pass by--- My meaning is quite destroyed in the alteration. I do not use train for concourse of passers by but for Skirts sweeping along the floor. In the first Stanza my copy read---2nd line "bitter chill it was" to avoid the echo cold in the next line. ever yours sincerely John Keats Address and postmark not recorded. 1040 My dear Brown, I have only been to---'s once since you left, when---could not find your letters. Now this is bad of me. I should, in this instance, conquer the great aversion to breaking up my regular habits, which grows upon me more and more. True, I have an excuse in the weather, which drives one from shelter to shelter in any little excursion. I have not heard from George. My book  1041 is coming out with very low hopes, though not spirits, on my part. This shall be my last trial; not succeeding, I shall try what I can do in the apothecary line. When you hear from or see---it is probable you will hear some complaints against me, which this notice is not intended to forestall. The fact is, I did behave badly; but it is to be attributed to my health, spirits, and the disadvantageous ground I stand on in society. I could go and accommodate matters if I were not too weary of the world. I know that they are more happy and comfortable than I am; therefore why should I trouble myself about it? I foresee I shall know very few people in the course of a year or two. Men get such different habits that they become as oil and vinegar to one another. Thus far I have a consciousness of having been pretty dull and heavy, both in subject and phrase; I might add, enigmatical. I am in the wrong, and the world is in the right, I have no doubt. Fact is, I have had so many kindnesses done me by so many people, that I am cheveaux-de-frised with benefits, which I must jump over or break down. I met---in town,  1042 a few days ago, who invited me to supper to meet Wordsworth, Southey, Lamb, Haydon, and some more; I was too careful of my health to risk being out at night. Talking of that, I continue to improve slowly, but, I think, surely. All the talk at present ... There is a famous exhibition in Pall-Mall  1043 of the old English portraits by Vandyck and Holbein, Sir Peter Lely, and the great Sir Godfrey. Pleasant countenances predominate; so I will mention two or three unpleasant ones. There is James the First, whose appearance would disgrace a "Society for the Suppression of Women"; so very squalid and subdued to nothing he looks. Then, there is old Lord Burleigh, the high-priest of economy, the political save-all, who has the appearance of a Pharisee just rebuffed by a Gospel bon-mot . Then, there is George the Second, very like an unintellectual Voltaire, troubled with the gout and a bad temper. Then, there is young Devereux, the favourite, with every appearance of as slang a boxer as any in the Court; his face is cast in the mould of blackguardism with jockey-plaster ... I shall soon begin upon "Lucy Vaughan Lloyd".  1044 I do not begin composition yet, being willing, in case of a relapse, to have nothing to reproach myself with. I hope the weather will give you the slip; let it show itself and steal out of your company.  1045 . ... When I have sent off this, I shall write another to some place about fifty miles in advance of you. Good morning to you. Yours ever sincerely John Keats No address or postmark. Louisville June 18th 1820 My dear John Where will our miseries end? so soon as the Thursday after I left London you were attacked with a dangerous illness, an hour after I left this for England my little Girl became so ill as to approach the Grave dragging our dear George after her. You are recovered (thank God I hear the bad and good news together) they are recovered, and yet I feel gloomy instead of grateful. Perhaps from the consideration that so short a time will serve to deprive me of every object that makes life pleasant. Brown says you are really recovered, that you eat, drink, sleep, and walk five miles without weariness, this is positive, and I beleive you nearly recovered but your perfect recovery depends on the future. You must go to a more favorable clime, must be easy in your mind, the former depends on me the latter on yourself. My prospect of being able to send you 200£ very soon is pretty good, I have an offer for the Boat which I have accepted, but the party who lives at Natchez (near New Orleans 300 miles only) will not receive information that I have accepted his offer for some weeks since the Gentleman who was commissioned to make it has gone up the Country and not yet returned, the only chance against us is that the purchasing party may change his mind; this is improbable since he has already purchased one fifth and to my knowledge is very anxious to obtain mine, but it is not impossible. I will direct my Agent at New Orleans to send you 200£ instantly on receiving the proceeds of the sale and should no unexpected delay occur it will arrive within 2 or 3 weeks of this letter. It shall be addressed to you at Abbey & Co's, the first of exchange directly from New Orleans, the second and third by way of New York and this place. I have no other means of raising anything like that Sum, scarcely a Man in the Town could borrow such a sum. I might suggest means of raising the money on this hope immediately but Brown being on the spot will advise what is best. Since your health requires it to Italy you must and shall go. Make your mind easy and place confidence in my success, I cannot ensure it, but I will deserve it. I have a consignment of goods to sell by commission, which helps me a little, if this parcell does well I shall have more. When I have received the price offered for the Boat I shall have been no loser by the purchase. This considering the alteration in times is doing wonders. George desires her love and thinks that if you were with us our nursing would soon bring you to rights, but I tell her you cannot be in better hands than Browns, she joins me in grateful thanks to him. I will write to him next post repeating what is important in this, lest one should miscarry. Our love to Fanny and Mrs W and Brothers. Yesterday's Post with Brown's letter brought us one from Henry Wylie acquainting us with the death of Mrs Miller, our love to Mary Miller if you should see her, George will write her in a few days. I will write again soon. I made up a packet to Haslam containing letters to Fanny, Mr Abbey and Mrs W. to go by private hand, the Gentleman has postponed his voyage. Take the utmost care of yourself my dear John for the sake of your most affectionate and alarmed Brother and Sister. I am Your very affectionate Brother George. Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbeys Esqre  Walthamstow Postmarks : KENTISH Tn and 26 JU 1820 1046 Friday Morn--- My dear Fanny, I had intended to delay seeing you till a Book which I am now publishing was out, expecting that to be the end of this week when I would have brought it to Walthamstow: on receiving your Letter of course I set myself to come to town, but was not able for just as I was setting out yesterday morning a slight spitting of blood came on which returned rather more copiously at night. I have slept well and they tell me there is nothing material to fear. I will send my Book soon with a Letter which I have had from George who is with his family quite well. Your affectionate Brother John--- No address or postmark. Wednesday Morng. My dearest Girl, I have been a walk this morning with a book in my hand, but as usual I have been occupied with nothing but you I wish I could say in an agreeable manner. I am tormented day and night. They talk of my going to Italy. 'Tis certain I shall never recover if I am to be so long separate from you yet with all this devotion to you I cannot persuade myself into any confidence of you. Past experience connected with the fact of my long separation from you gives me agonies which are scarcely to be talked of. When your mother comes I shall be very sudden and expert in asking her whether you have been to Mrs Dilke's, for she might say no to make me easy. I am literally worn to death, which seems my only recourse. I cannot forget what has pass'd. What? nothing with a man of the world, but to me deathful. I will get rid of this as much as possible. When you were in the habit of flirting with Brown you would have left off, could your own heart have felt one half of one pang mine did. Brown is a good sort of Man---he did not know he was doing me to death by inches. I feel the effect of every one of those hours in my side now; and for that cause, though he has done me many services, though I know his love and friendship for me, though at this moment I should be without pence were it not for his assistance, I will never see or speak to him  1047 until we are both old men, if we are to be. I will resent my heart having been made a football. You will call this madness. I have heard you say that it was not unpleasant to wait a few years ---you have amusements---your mind is away---you have not brooded over one idea as I have, and how should you? You are to me an object intensely desireable---the air I breathe in a room empty of you is unhealthy. I am not the same to you---no---you can wait---you have a thousand activities---you can be happy without me. Any party, any thing to fill up the day has been enough. How have you pass'd this month?  1048 Who have you smil'd with? All this may seem savage in me. You do not feel as I do---you do not know what it is to love---one day you may---your time is not come. Ask yourself how many unhappy hours Keats has caused you in Loneliness. For myself I have been a Martyr the whole time, and for this reason I speak; the confession is forc'd from me by the torture. I appeal to you by the blood of that Christ you believe in: Do not write to me if you have done anything this month which it would have pained me to have seen. You may have altered--- if you have not---if you still behave in dancing rooms and other societies as I have seen you---I do not want to live---if you have done so I wish this coming night may be my last. I cannot live without you, and not only you but chaste you; virtuous you . The Sun rises and sets, the day passes, and you follow the bent of your inclination to a certain extent---you have no conception of the quantity of miserable feeling that passes through me in a day.---Be serious! Love is not a plaything---and again do not write unless you can do it with a crystal conscience. I would sooner die for want of you than--- Yours for ever J. Keats. Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbey Esqre  Walthamstow Postmarks : KENTISH Tn and 6 JY 1820 1049 Mortimer Terrace Wednesday My dear Fanny, I have had no return of the spitting of blood, and for two or three days have been getting a little stronger. I have no hopes of an entire reestablishment of my health under some months of patience. My Physician tells me I must contrive to pass the Winter in Italy. This is all very unfortunate for us---we have no recourse but patience, which I am now practicing better than ever I thought it possible for me. I have this moment received a Letter from Mr Brown, dated Dunvegan Castle, Island of Skye. He is very well in health and Spirits. My new publication has been out for some days and I have directed a Copy to be bound for you, which you will receive shortly. No one can regret Mr Hodgkinson's ill fortune: I must own illness has not made such a Saint of me as to prevent my rejoicing at his reverse. Keep yourself in as good hopes as possible; in case my illness should continue an unreasonable time many of my friends would I trust for my Sake do all in their power to console and amuse you, at the least word from me---You may depend upon it that in case my strength returns I will do all in my power to extricate you from the Abbies. Be above all things careful of your health which is the corner stone of all pleasure. Your affectionate Brother John--- Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbey Esqre  Walthamstow Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 22 JY 1820 1050 My dear Fanny, I have been gaining Strength for some days: it would be well if I could at the same time say I am gaining hopes of a speedy recovery. My constitution has suffered very much for two or three years past, so as to be scarcely able to make head against illness, which the natural activity and impatience of my Mind renders more dangerous. It will at all events be a very tedious affair, and you must expect to hear very little alteration of any sort in me for some time. You ought to have received a copy of my Book ten days ago I shall send another message to the Booksellers. One of the Mr Wylies will be here to day or to morrow when I will ask him to send you George's Letter. Writing the smallest note is so annoying to me that I have waited till I shall see him. Mr Hunt does every thing in his power to make the time pass as agreeably with me as possible. I read the greatest part of the day, and generally take two half hour walks a day up and down the terrace which is very much pester'd with cries, ballad singers, and street music. We have been so unfortunate for so long a time, every event has been of so depressing a nature that I must persuade myself to think some change will take place in the aspect of our affairs. I shall be upon the look out for a trump card. Your affectionate Brother, John--- Address : Mrs Brawne--- No postmark. My dearest Fanny, My head is puzzled this morning, and I scarce know what I shall say though I am full of a hundred things. 'Tis certain I would rather be writing to you this morning, notwithstanding the alloy of grief in such an occupation, than enjoy any other pleasure, with health to boot, unconnected with you. Upon my soul I have loved you to the extreme. I wish you could know the Tenderness with which I continually brood over your different aspects of countenance, action and dress. I see you come down in the morning: I see you meet me at the Window---I see every thing over again eternally that I ever have seen. If I get on the pleasant clue I live in a sort of happy misery, if on the unpleasant 'tis miserable misery. You complain of my illtreating you in word thought and deed---I am sorry,---at times I feel bitterly sorry that I ever made you unhappy---my excuse is that those words have been wrung from me by the sharpness of my feelings. At all events and in any case I have been wrong; could I believe that I did it without any cause, I should be the most sincere of Penitents. I could give way to my repentant feelings now, I could recant all my suspicions, I could mingle with you heart and Soul though absent, were it not for some parts of your Letters. Do you suppose it possible I could ever leave you? You know what I think of myself and what of you. You know that I should feel how much it was my loss and how little yours. My friends laugh at you! I know some of them---when I know them all I shall never think of them again as friends or even acquaintance. My friends have behaved well to me in every instance but one, and there they have become tattlers, and inquisitors into my conduct: spying upon a secret I would rather die than share it with any body's confidence. For this I cannot wish them well, I care not to see any of them again. If I am the Theme, I will not be the Friend of idle Gossips. Good gods what a shame it is our Loves should be so put into the microscope of a Coterie. Their laughs should not affect you (I may perhaps give you reasons some day for these laughs, for I suspect a few people to hate me well enough, for reasons I know of , who have pretended a great friendship for me) when in competition with one, who if he never should see you again would make you the Saint of his memorry. These Laughers, who do not like you, who envy you for your Beauty, who would have Godbless'd me from you for ever: who were plying me with disencouragements with respect to you eternally. People are revengeful---do not mind them---do nothing but love me ---if I knew that for certain life and health will in such event be a heaven, and death itself will be less painful. I long to believe in immortality.  1051 I shall never be able to bid you an entire farewell. If I am destined to be happy with you here---how short is the longest Life. I wish to believe in immortality---I wish to live with you for ever. Do not let my name ever pass between you and those laughers, if I have no other merit than the great Love for you, that were sufficient to keep me sacred and unmentioned in such Society. If I have been cruel and unjust I swear my love has ever been greater than my cruelty which last s but a minute whereas my Love come what will shall last for ever. If concession to me has hurt your Pride, god knows I have had little pride in my heart when thinking of you. Your name never passes my Lips---do not let mine pass yours---Those People do not like me. After reading my Letter you even then wish to see me, I am strong enough to walk over---but I dare not. I shall feel so much pain in parting with you again. My dearest love, I am affraid to see you, I am strong but not strong enough to see you. Will my arm be ever round you again. And if so shall I be obliged to leave you again. My sweet Love! I am happy whilst I believe your first Letter. Let me be but certain that you are mine heart and soul, and I could die more happily than I could otherwise live. If you think me cruel---if you think I have sleighted you---do muse it over again and see into my heart. My Love to you is 'true as truth's simplicity and simpler than the infancy of truth'  1052 as I think I once said before How could I slight you? How threaten to leave you? not in the spirit of a Threat to you---no---but in the spirit of Wretchedness in myself. My fairest, my delicious, my angel Fanny! do not believe me such a vulgar fellow. I will be as patient in illness and as believing in Love as I am able. Yours for ever my dearest John Keats. No address or postmark. I do not write this till the last that no eye may catch it.  1053 My dearest Girl, I wish you could invent some means to make me at all happy without you. Every hour I am more and more concentrated in you; every thing else tastes like chaff in my Mouth. I feel it almost impossible to go to Italy---the fact is I cannot leave you, and shall never taste one minute's content until it pleases chance to let me live with you for good. But I will not go on at this rate. A person in health as you are can have no conception of the horrors that nerves and a temper like mine go through. What Island do your friends propose retiring to? I should be happy to go with you there alone, but in company I should object to it; the backbitings and jealousies of new colonists who have nothing else to amuse themselves, is unbearable. Mr Dilke came to see me yesterday, and gave me a very great deal more pain than pleasure. I shall never be able any more to endure the society of any of those who used to meet at Elm Cottage and Wentworth Place. The last two years taste like brass upon my Palate.  1054 If I cannot live with you I will live alone. I do not think my health will improve much while I am separated from you. For all this I am averse to seeing you---I cannot bear flashes of light and return into my glooms again. I am not so unhappy now as I should be if I had seen you yesterday. To be happy with you seems such an impossibility! it requires a luckier Star than mine! it will never be. I enclose a passage from one of your letters which I want you to alter a little---I want (if you will have it so) the matter express'd less coldly to me. If my health would bear it, I could write a Poem  1055 which I have in my head, which would be a consolation for people in such a situation as mine. I would show some one in Love as I am, with a person living in such Liberty as you do. Shakespeare always sums up matters in the most sovereign manner. Hamlet's heart was full of such Misery as mine is when he said to Ophelia "Go to a Nunnery, go, go!"  1056 Indeed I should like to give up the matter at once---I should like to die. I am sickened at the brute world which you are smiling with. I hate men and women more. I see nothing but thorns for the future---wherever I may be next winter in Italy or nowhere Brown will be living near you with his indecencies ---I see no prospect of any rest. Suppose me in Rome---well, I should there see you as in a magic glass going to and from town at all hours,---I wish you could infuse a little confidence in human nature into my heart. I cannot muster any---the world is too brutal for me---I am glad there is such a thing as the grave---I am sure I shall never have any rest till I get there. At any rate I will indulge myself by never seeing any more Dilke or Brown or any of their Friends. I wish I was either in your arms full of faith or that a Thunder bolt would strike me. God bless you. J. K--- No address or postmark. 1057 Mrs Brawne's Next door to Brown's Wentworth Place Hampstead My dear Haydon, I am much better this morning than I was when I wrote the note: that is my hopes and spirits are better which are generally at a very low ebb from such a protracted illness---I shall be here for a little time and at home all and every day. A Journey to Italy is recommended me, which I have resolved upon and am beginning to prepare for. Hoping to see you shortly I remain Your affectionate friend John Keats Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbey's Esqre  Walthamstow--- Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 14 AU 1820. 1058 Wentworth Place My dear Fanny, 'Tis a long time since I received your last. An accident of an unpleasant nature occurred at Mr Hunt's and prevented me from answering you, that is to say made me nervous. That you may not suppose it worse I will mention that some one of Mr Hunt's household opened a Letter of mine---upon which I immediately left Mortimer Terrace, with the intention of taking to Mrs Bentley's again; fortunately I am not in so lone a situation, but am staying a short time with Mrs Brawne who lives in the House which was Mrs Dilke's. I am excessively nervous: a person I am not quite used to entering the room half choaks me. 'Tis not yet Consumption I believe, but it would be were I to remain in this climate all the Winter: so I am thinking of either voyageing or travelling to Italy. Yesterday I received an invitation from Mr Shelley, a Gentleman residing at Pisa, to spend the Winter with him: if I go I must be away in a Month or even less. I am glad you like the Poems, you must hope with me that time and health will produce you some more. This is the first morning I have been able to sit to the paper and have many Letters to write if I can manage them. God bless you my dear Sister. Your affectionate Brother John--- Address : John Keats Esqr.  (to the care of Leigh Hunt Esqr.)  Examiner Office  Catharine Street  Strand  London  Angleterre Postmarks : LIVORNO and FPO 10 AU 1820 Pisa---July 27 1820. My dear Keats I hear with great pain the dangerous accident that you have undergone, & Mr Gisborne who gives me the account of it, adds that you continue to wear a consumptive appearance. This consumption is a disease particularly fond of people who write such good verses as you have done, and with the assistance of an English winter it can often indulge its selection;---I do not think that young & aimiable poets are at all bound to gratify its taste; they have entered into no bond with the Muses to that effect. But seriously (for I am joking on what I am very anxious about) I think you would do well to pass the winter after so tremendous an accident in Italy, & (if you think it as necessary as I do) so long as you could find Pisa or its neighbourhood agreeable to you, Mrs Shelley unites with myself in urging the request, that you would take up your residence with us.---You might come by sea to Leghorn, (France is not worth seeing, & the sea air is particularly good for weak lungs) which is within a few miles of us. You ought at all events to see Italy, & your health which I suggest as a motive, might be an excuse to you. ---I spare declamation about the statues & the paintings & the ruins---& what is a greater piece of forbearance---about the mountains the streams & the fields, the colours of the sky, & the sky itself--- I have lately read your Endymion again & ever with a new sense of the treasures of poetry it contains, though treasures poured forth with indistinct profusion. This, people in general will not endure, & that is the cause of the comparatively few copies which have been sold.---I feel persuaded that you are capable of the greatest things, so you but will. I always tell Ollier to send you copies of my books.---"Prometheus Unbound" I imagine you will receive nearly at the same time with this letter. The Cenci I hope you have already received---it was studiously composed in a different style "Below the good how far! but far above the great " In poetry I have sought to avoid system  & mannerism; I wish those who excel me in genius, would pursue the same plan--- Whether you remain in England, or journey to Italy,---believe that you carry with you my anxious wishes for your health happiness & success, wherever you are or whatever you undertake---& that I am Yours sincerely P. B. Shelley 1059 Address : P. B. Shelley Esqre. No postmark. 1060 Hampstead August 16th My dear Shelley, I am very much gratified that you, in a foreign country, and with a mind almost overoccupied, should write to me in the strain of the Letter beside me. If I do not take advantage of your invitation it will be prevented by a circumstance I have very much at heart to prophesy. There is no doubt that an english winter would put an end to me, and do so in a lingering hateful manner, therefore I must either voyage or journey to Italy as a soldier marches up to a battery. My nerves at present are the worst part of me, yet they feel soothed when I think that come what extreme may, I shall not be destined to remain in one spot long enough to take a hatred of any four particular bedposts. I am glad you take any pleasure in my poor Poem;---which I would willingly take the trouble to unwrite, if possible, did I care so much as I have done about Reputation. I received a copy of the Cenci, as from yourself from Hunt. There is only one part of it I am judge of; the Poetry, and dramatic effect, which by many spirits now a days is considered the mammon. A modern work it is said must have a purpose, which may be the God--- an artist must serve Mammon---he must have "self concentration" selfishness perhaps. You I am sure will forgive me for sincerely remarking that you might curb your magnanimity and be more of an artist, and 'load every rift' of your subject with ore.  1061 The thought of such discipline must fall like cold chains upon you, who perhaps never sat with your wings furl'd for six Months together. And is not this extraordinary talk for the writer of Endymion! whose mind was like a pack of scattered cards---I am pick'd up and sorted to a pip. My Imagination is a Monastry and I am its Monk---you must explain my metaprs to yourself. I am in expectation of Prometheus every day. Could I have my own wish for its interest effected you would have it still in manuscript---or be but now putting an end to the second act. I remember you advising me not to publish my first-blights, on Hampstead heath---I am returning advice upon your hands. Most of the Poems in the volume I send you  1062 have been written above two years, and would never have been publish'd but from a hope of gain; so you see I am inclined enough to take your advice now. I must express once more my deep sense of your Kindness, adding my sincere thanks and respects for Mrs Shelley.

My dear Taylor, My Chest is in so nervous a State, that any thing extra such as speaking to an unaccostomed Person or writing a Note half suffocates me. This Journey to Italy wakes me at daylight every morning and haunts me horribly. I shall endeavour to go though it be with the sensation of marching up against a Batterry.  1064 The first spep  for step  towards it is to know the expense of a Journey and a years residence: which if you will ascertain for me and let me know early you will greatly serve me. I have more to say but must desist for every line I write encreases the tightness of the Chest, and I have many more to do. I am convinced that this sort of thing does not continue for nothing---If you can come with any of our friends do.

My dear Keats, When I called the other morning, I did not know your Poems were out, or I should have read them before I came in order to tell you my opinion---I have done so since, and really cannot tell you how very highly I estimate them--- they justify the assertions of all your Friends regarding your poetical powers. I can assure you, whatever you may do, you will not exceed my opinion of them. Have you done with Chapman's Homer? I want it very badly at this moment; will you let the bearer have it, as well as let me know how you are? I am dear Keats ever yours B. R. Haydon July 14 1820. No address or postmark.

My best remes to Mrs Hunt. Your affectionate friend John Keats. Address : John Keats Esqre  Mrs Brawn's  Wentworth Place No postmark. 1068 Mortimer Terrace. Giovanni mio, I shall see you this afternoon, & most probably every day. You judge rightly when you think I shall be glad at your putting up awhile where you are, instead of that solitary place. There are humanities in the house; & if wisdom loves to live with children round her knees (the tax-gatherer apart), sick wisdom, I think, should love to live with arms about its waist. I need not say how you gratify me by the impulse which led you to write a particular sentence in your letter, for you must have seen by this time how much I am attached to yourself. I am indicating at as dull a rate as a battered finger-post in wet weather. Not that I am ill: for I am very well altogether. Your affectionate friend, Leigh Hunt. Address : John Taylor Esqre  Taylor  & Hessey  Booksellers  Fleet Street Postmark : 14 AU 1820 Wentworth Place. My dear Taylor--- I do not think I mentioned any thing of a Passage to Leghorn by Sea. Will you join that to your enquiries, and, if you can, give a peep at the Birth if the Vessel is in our river? Your sincere friend John Keats over P.S. Some how a Copy of Chapman's Homer, lent to me by Haydon, has disappeared from my Lodgings---it has quite flown I am affraid, and Haydon urges the return of it so that I must get one at Longman's and send it to Lisson grove ---or you must---or as I have given you a job on the River---ask Mistessey. 1069 I had written a Note to this effect to Hessey some time since but crumpled it up in hopes that the Book might come to Light. This morning Haydon has sent another messenger. The Copy was in good condition, with the head. Damn all thieves! Tell Woodhouse I have not lost his Blackwood. Taylor endorsed this letter as follows:--- 'Inclosed in this Letter I received a Testamentary Paper in John Keats's Handwriting without Date on which I have indorsed a Memorandum to this Effect for the purpose of identifying it, & for better Security it is hereunto annexed John Taylor.' 22 Sep 1820 ] In case of my death this scrap of Paper may be serviceable in your possession. All my estate real and personal consists in the hopes of the sale of books publish'd or unpublish'd. Now I wish Brown and you to be the first paid Creditors---the rest is in nubibus---but in case it should shower pay my Taylor the few pounds I owe him. My Chest of Books divide among my friends.  1071 The endorsement on the Testamentary Paper runs thus :--- 'N.B. On the 14th August or the 15th 1820 I received this paper which is in John Keats's Handwriting inclosed in the annexed letter which came by the 3dy Post 22 Sept 1820 John Taylor' Address : B. R. Haydon Esq No postmark. My dear Haydon; I think I am recovering a little, which you should have heard of before if it was not very irksome to me to write the shortest note. I am glad you like my book. At some future time I shall re borrow your Homer  1072 . Yours ever John Keats. Address and postmark not recorded. 1073 My dear Brown, You may not have heard from---, or---, or in any way, that an attack of spitting of blood, and all its weakening consequences, has prevented me from writing for so long a time. I have matter now for a very long letter, but not news: so I must cut everything short. I shall make some confession, which you will be the only person, for many reasons, I shall trust with. A winter in England would, I have not a doubt, kill me; so I have resolved to go to Italy, either by sea or land. Not that I have any great hopes of that, for, I think, there is a core of disease in me not easy to pull out. ... If I should die. ... I shall be obliged to set off in less than a month. Do not, my dear Brown, teaze yourself about me. You must fill up your time as well as you can, and as happily. You must think of my faults as lightly as you can. When I have health I will bring up the long arrears of letters I owe you. ... My book has had good success among the literary people, and I believe has a moderate sale. I have seen very few people we know.--- has visited me more than any one. I would go to---and make some inquiries after you, if I could with any bearable sensation; but a person I am not quite used to causes an oppression on my chest. Last week I received a letter from Shelley, at Pisa, of a very kind nature, asking me to pass the winter with him. Hunt has behaved very kindly to me. You shall hear from me again shortly. Your affectionate friend John Keats Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbey's Esqre  Walthamstow--- Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 23 AU 1820 Wentworth Place Wednesday Morning My dear Fanny, It will give me great Pleasure to see you here, if you can contrive it; though I confess I should have written instead of calling upon you before I set out on my journey, from the wish of avoiding unpleasant partings. Meantime I will just notice some parts of your Letter. The Sealbreaking business is overblown. I think no more of it. A few days ago I wrote to Mr Brown, asking him to befriend me with his company to Rome. His answer is not yet come, and I do not know when it will, not being certain how far he may be from the Post Office to which my communication is addressed. Let us hope he will go with me. George certainly ought to have written to you: his troubles, anxieties and fatigues are not quite a sufficient excuse. In the course of time you will be sure to find that this neglect, is not forgetfulness.  1074 I am sorry to hear you have been so ill and in such low spirits. Now you are better, keep so. Do not suffer your Mind to dwell on unpleasant reflections--- that sort of thing has been the destruction of my health. Nothing is so bad as want of health---it makes one envy Scavengers and Cinder-sifters. There are enough real distresses and evils in wait for every one to try the most vigorous health. Not that I would say yours are not real---but they are such as to tempt you to employ your imagination on them, rather than endeavour to dismiss them entirely. Do not diet your mind with grief, it destroys the constitution; but let your chief care be of your health, and with that you will meet with your share of Pleasure in the world---do not doubt it. If I return well from Italy I will turn over a new leaf for you. I have been improving lately, and have very good hopes of 'turning a Neuk'  1075 and cheating the Consumption. I am not well enough to write to George myself ---Mr Haslam will do it for me, to whom I shall write to day, desiring him to mention as gently as possible your complaint. I am my dear Fanny Your affectionate Brother John. Address and postmark not recorded. 1076 My dear Brown, ... I ought to be off at the end of this week, as the cold winds begin to blow towards evening;---but I will wait till I have your answer to this. I am to be introduced, before I set out, to a Dr Clark, a physician settled at Rome, who promises to befriend me in every way there. The sale of my book is very slow, though it has been very highly rated. One of the causes, I understand from different quarters, of the unpopularity of this new book, and the others also, is the offence the ladies take at me. On thinking that matter over, I am certain that I have said nothing in a spirit to displease any woman I would care to please; but still there is a tendency to class women in my books with roses and sweetmeats,---they never see themselves dominant  1077 . If ever I come to publish "Lucy Vaughan Lloyd,"  1078 there will be some delicate picking for squeamish stomachs. I will say no more, but, waiting in anxiety for your answer, doff my hat, and make a purse as long as I can. Your affectionate friend, John Keats. No address or postmark. Pancrass Lane Aug 23, 1820 Mr John Keats Dear Sir I have yours of Sunday and am exceedingly grieved at the contents---You know that it was very much against my will that you lent your money to George---In my settlement with him Mr Hodgkinson omitted a 50£ bill which he had drawn from America & not then due, so that he got this 50£ more than I knew of at the time--- Bad debts for the last two years have cut down the profits of our business to nothing, so that I can scarcely take out enough for my private expence---It is therefore not in my power to lend you any thing---I am Dear Sir Yrs--- Richd Abbey When you are able to call I shall be glad to see you, as I should not like to see you want "maintenance for the day" Address : Miss Keats  Rd Abbeys Esq  Walthamstow Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 12 o'clock SP 12 1820 Nn and 4 o'clock SP 12 1820 EV Monday Morn. 1079 My dear Fanny In the hope of entirely re-establishing my health I shall leave England for Italy this week and, of course I shall not be able to see you before my departure. It is not illness that prevents me from writing but as I am recommended to avoid every sort of fatigue I have accepted the assistance of a friend, who I have desired to write to you when I am gone and to communicate any intelligence she may hear of me. I am as well as I can expect and feel very impatient to get on board as the sea air is expected to be of great benefit to me. My present intention is to stay some time at Naples and then to proceed to Rome where I shall find several friends or at least several acquaintances. At any rate it will be a relief to quit this cold, wet, uncertain climate. I am not very fond of living in cities but there will be too much to amuse me, as soon as I am well enough to go out, to make me feel dull. I have received your parcel and intend to take it with me. You shall hear from me as often as possible, if I feel too tired to write myself I shall have some friend to do it for me. I have not yet heard from George nor can I expect to receive any letters from him before I leave Your affectionate brother John No address or postmark. My dear Keats, Upon subjects like those in this letter, it is to me always more pleasant to write than to speak.---It gave me much pleasure to learn from Taylor that you are leaving us tolerably easy as to Money matters:---the more so, as, from particular circumstances, my own finances have had, and for the next six months or so will have, considerable drains upon them; which would make it not very convenient to me just now to render you assistance in that way.---But when I am a little recruited, which will I hope be about the time I have above mentioned, if you should have any wants of that nature, it would give me the greatest satisfaction to answer your draft;  & you would of course, to prevent any disappointments, give me as much previous notice as you could,---I am sure you would not needlessly call upon me:---and, with that conviction, I should be despicable in my own eyes, if, with the means, I wanted the will to assist you.---What is the value of Pelf after the supply of one's own wants?---Of none to me. And there is no one who would be more welcome than yourself to share my little Superfluities.--- God bless you!---Take care of yourself,---if it be only for your friends' sake. Above all, keep your mind at ease. There are many who take more than a brotherly Interest in your welfare---There is certainly \---"one, whose hand will never scant From his poor store of fruits all thou canst want."---  1080 And he is, Yours very sincerely & affectionately, Richd Woodhouse. Kings Bench Walk Temple.     Saty. night. 16 Sepr 1820.--- 1081 The passport arrived before we started I dont think I shall be long ill. God bless you---farewell. John Keats Address : Mr Charles Brown  Wentworth Place  Hampstead  Middx. No postmark. Saturday Septr 28 1082 Maria Crowther off Yarmouth isle of wight. My dear Brown, The time has not yet come for a pleasant Letter from me. I have delayed writing to you from time to time because I felt how impossible it was to enliven you with one heartening hope of my recovery; this morning in bed the matter struck me in a different manner; I thought I would write 'while I was in some liking'  1083 or I might become too ill to write at all, and then if the desire to have written should become strong it would be a great affliction to me. I have many more Letters to write and I bless my stars that I have begun, for time seems to press,---this may be my best opportunity. We are in a calm and I am easy enough this morning. If my spirits seem too low you may in some degree impute it to our having been at sea a fortnight without making any way. I was very disappointed at not meeting you at bedhamption, and am very provoked at the thought of you being at Chichester to day.  1084 I should have delighted in setting off for London for the sensation merely--- for what should I do there? I could not leave my lungs or stomach or other worse things behind me. I wish to write on subjects that will not agitate me much---there is one I must mention and have done with it. Even if my body would recover of itself, this would prevent it. The very thing which I want to live most for will be a great occasion of my death. I cannot help it. Who can help it? Were I in health it would make me ill, and how can I bear it in my state? I dare say you will be able to guess on what subject I am harping---you know what was my greatest pain during the first part of my illness at your house. I wish for death every day and night to deliver me from these pains, and then I wish death away, for death would destroy even those pains which are better than nothing. Land and Sea, weakness and decline are great seperators, but death is the great divorcer for ever. When the pang of this thought has passed through my mind, I may say the bitterness of death is passed. I often wish for you that you might flatter me with the best. I think without my mentioning it for my sake you would be a friend to Miss Brawne when I am dead. You think she has many faults---but, for my sake, think she has not one--- ---if there is any thing you can do for her by word or deed I know you will do it. I am in a state at present in which woman merely as woman can have no more power over me than stocks and stones, and yet the difference of my sensations with respect to Miss Brawne and my Sister is amazing. The one seems to absorb the other to a degree incredible. I seldom think of my Brother and Sister---in america. The thought of leaving Miss Brawne is beyond every thing horrible--- the sense of darkness coming over me---I eternally see her figure eternally vanishing. Some of the phrases she was in the habit of using during my last nursing at Wentworth place ring in my ears. Is there another Life? Shall I awake and find all this a dream? There must be we cannot be created for this sort of suffering. The receiving this letter is to be one of yours. I will say nothing about our friendship or rather yours to me more than that as you deserve to escape you will never be so unhappy as I am. I should think of---you in my last moments. I shall endeavour to write to Miss Brawne if possible to day. A sudden stop to my life in the middle of one of these Letters would be no bad thing for it keeps one in a sort of fever awhile. Though fatigued with a Letter longer than any I have written for a long while it would be better to go on for ever than awake to a sense of contrary winds. We expect to put into Portland roads to night. The Captn the Crew and the Pasengers are all illtemper'd and weary. I shall write to dilke. I feel as if I was closing my last letter to you.  1085 . My dear Brown Your affectionate friend John Keats Address : Mrs Brawne  Wentworth Place  Hampstead Middx  England Postmark : F.P.O. 11 NO 1820 Octr 24 Naples Harbour--- care Giovanni My dear Mrs Brawne, A few words will tell you what sort of a Passage we had, and what situation we are in, and few they must be on account of the Quarantine, our Letters being liable to be opened for the purpose of fumigation at the Health Office.  1086 We have to remain in the vessel ten days and are, at present shut in a tier of ships. The sea air has been beneficial to me about to as great an extent as squally weather and bad accommodations and provisions has done harm---So I am about as I was---Give my Love to Fanny and tell her, if I were well there is enough in this Port of Naples to fill a quire of Paper---but it looks like a dream---every man who can row his boat and walk and talk seems a different being from myself. I do not feel in the world. It has been unfortunate for me that one of the Passengers is a young Lady in a Consumption---her imprudence has vexed me very much---the knowledge of her complaint---the flushings in her face, all her bad symptoms have preyed upon me---they would have done so had I been in good health.  1087 Severn now is a very good fellow but his nerves are too strong to be hurt by other peoples illnesses---I remember poor Rice wore me in the same way in the isle of Wight  1088 \---I shall feel a load off me when the Lady vanishes out of my sight. It is impossible to describe exactly in what state of health I am---at this moment I am suffering from indigestion very much, which makes such stuff of this Letter. I would always wish you to think me a little worse than I really am; not being of a sanguine disposition I am likely to succeed. If I do not recover your regret will be softened if I do your pleasure will be doubled---I dare not fix my Mind upon Fanny, I have not dared to think of her. The only comfort I have had that way has been in thinking for hours together of having the knife she gave me put in a silver-case---the hair in a Locket---and the Pocket Book in a gold net---Show her this. I dare say no more---Yet you must not believe I am so ill as this Letter may look, for if ever there was a person born without the faculty of hoping I am he. Severn is writing to Haslam, and I have just asked him to request Haslam to send you his account of my health. O what an account I could give you of the Bay of Naples if I could once more feel myself a Citizen of this world---I feel a spirit in my Brain would lay it forth pleasantly---O what a misery it is to have an intellect in splints! My Love again to Fanny---tell Tootts  1089 I wish I could pitch her a basket of grapes---and tell Sam the fellows catch here with a line a little fish much like an anchovy, pull them up fast. Remember me to Mrs and Mr Dilke---mention to Brown that I wrote him a letter at Portsmouth which I did not send and am in doubt if he ever will see it. my dear Mrs Brawne Yours sincerely and affectionate John Keats--- Good bye Fanny! God bless you Address and postmark not recorded. Naples, 1 November. My dear Brown, Yesterday we were let out of Quarantine, during which my health suffered more from bad air and the stifled cabin than it had done the whole voyage. The fresh air revived me a little, and I hope I am well enough this morning to write to you a short calm letter;---if that can be called one, in which I am afraid to speak of what I would fainest dwell upon. As I have gone thus far into it, I must go on a little;---perhaps it may relieve the load of WRETCHEDNESS which presses upon me. The persuasion that I shall see her no more will kill me. I cannot q---  1090 My dear Brown, I should have had her when I was in health, and I should have remained well. I can bear to die---I cannot bear to leave her. O, God! God! God! Everything I have in my trunks that reminds me of her goes through me like a spear. The silk lining she put in my travelling cap scalds my head. My imagination is horribly vivid about her---I see her---I hear her. There is nothing in the world of sufficient interest to divert me from her a moment. This was the case when I was in England; I cannot recollect, without shuddering, the time that I was a prisoner at Hunt's, and used to keep my eyes fixed on Hampstead all day. Then there was a good hope of seeing her again--- Now!---O that I could be buried near where she lives! I am afraid to write to her---to receive a letter from her---to see her handwriting would break my heart---even to hear of her anyhow, to see her name written, would be more than I can bear. My dear Brown, what am I to do? Where can I look for consolation or ease? If I had any chance of recovery, this passion would kill me. Indeed, through the whole of my illness, both at your house and at Kentish Town, this fever has never ceased wearing me out. When you write to me, which you will do immediately, write to Rome ( poste restante )---if she is well and happy, put a mark thus+; if--- Remember me to all. I will endeavour to bear my miseries patiently. A person in my state of health should not have such miseries to bear. Write a short note to my sister, saying you have heard from me. Severn is very well. If I were in better health I would urge your coming to Rome. I fear there is no one can give me any comfort. Is there any news of George? O, that something fortunate had ever happened to me or my brothers!---then I might hope,---but despair is forced upon me as a habit. My dear Brown, for my sake, be her advocate for ever. I cannot say a word about Naples; I do not feel at all concerned in the thousand novelties around me. I am afraid to write to her---I should like her to know that I do not forget her. Oh, Brown, I have coals of fire in my breast. It surprises me that the human heart is capable of containing and bearing so much misery. Was I born for this end? God bless her, and her mother, and my sister, and George, and his wife, and you, and all! Your ever affectionate friend, John Keats. Thursday 2 November.---I was a day too early for the Courier. He sets out now. I have been more calm to-day, though in a half dread of not continuing so. I said nothing of my health; I know nothing of it; you will hear Severn's account, from Haslam. I must leave off. You bring my thoughts too near to Fanny. God bless you!  1091 Address and postmark not recorded. 1092 Rome, 30 November 1820. My dear Brown, 'Tis the most difficult thing in the world to me to write a letter. My stomach continues so bad, that I feel it worse on opening any book,---yet I am much better than I was in quarantine. Then I am afraid to encounter the pro-ing and con-ing of anything interesting to me in England. I have an habitual feeling of my real life having passed, and that I am leading a posthumous existence. God knows how it would have been---but it appears to me---however, I will not speak of that subject. I must have been at Bedhampton nearly at the time you were writing to me from Chichester---how unfortunate---and to pass on the river too! There was my star predominant! 1093 I cannot answer anything in your letter, which followed me from Naples to Rome, because I am afraid to look it over again. I am so weak (in mind) that I cannot bear the sight of any handwriting of a friend I love so much as I do you. Yet I ride the little horse, and, at my worst, even in quarantine, summoned up more puns, in a sort of desperation, in one week than in any year of my life. There is one thought enough to kill me; I have been well, healthy, alert, &c., walking with her, and now---the knowledge of contrast, feeling for light and shade, all that information (primitive sense) necessary for a poem, are great enemies to the recovery of the stomach. There, you rogue, I put you to the torture; but you must bring your philosophy to bear, as I do mine, really, or how should I be able to live? Dr. Clark is very attentive to me; he says, there is very little the matter with my lungs, but my stomach, he says, is very bad. I am well disappointed in hearing good news from George, for it runs in my head we shall all die young. I have not written to Reynolds yet, which he must think very neglectful; being anxious to send him a good account of my health, I have delayed it from week to week. If I recover, I will do all in my power to correct the mistakes made during sickness; and if I should not, all my faults will be forgiven. Severn is very well, though he leads so dull a life with me. Remember me to all friends, and tell Haslam I should not have left London without taking leave of him, but from being so low in body and mind. Write to George as soon as you receive this, and tell him how I am, as far as you can guess; and also a note to my sister---who walks about my imagination like a ghost---she is so like Tom. I can scarcely bid you goodbye, even in a letter. I always made an awkward bow.  1094 God bless you! John Keats. Address : To  John Keats Esqr  Poste Restante   a Rome,  en Italie. Postmarks : CHAMBERY, ANGLETERRE, and an illegible dated one. Hampstead. 21st Decr 1820. My dear Keats, Not two hours since your letter from Rome 30th Novr came to me,---and as to- morrow is post night, you shall have the answer in due course. And so you still wish me to follow you to Rome? and truly I wish to go,---nothing detains me but prudence. Little could be gained, if any thing, by letting my house at this time of the year, and the consequence would be a heavy additional expence which I cannot possibly afford,---unless it were a matter of necessity, and I see none while you are in such good hands as Severn's. As for my appropriating any part of remittances from George, that is out of the question, while you continue disabled from writing. Thank God, you are getting better! Your last letter, which I so gravely answered about 4th Decr, showed how much you had suffered by the voyage & the cursed quarantine. Keep your mind easy, my dear fellow, & no fear of your body. Your sister I hear is in remarkably good health,---the last news from George (already given to you) was so far favorable that there were no complaints. Every body next door is quite well. Taylor has just returned to Town,---I saw him for a few minutes the other day, & had not time to put some questions which I wished,---but I understand your poems  1095 increase in sale. Hunt has been very ill, but is now recovered. All other friends are well. I know you don't like John Scott, but he is doing a thing that tickles me to the heart's core, and you will like to hear of it, if you have any revenge in your composition. By some means (crooked enough I dare say) he has got possession of one of Blackwood's gang, who has turned King's evidence, and month after month he belabours them with the most damning facts that can be conceived;---if they are indeed facts, I know not how the rogues can stand up against them. This virulent attack has made me like the London Magazine, & I sent the 1st chapter of my Tour for Scott to publish, if he would pay me 10 Gns per sheet, & print the whole chapters monthly, without my forfeiting the copyright in the end. This would have answered my purpose famously,---but he won't agree to my stipulations. He praises my writing wondrously,---will pay the 10 Gns & so on, ---but the fellow forsooth must have the chapters somewhat converted into the usual style of magazine articles, & so the treaty is at an end. O,---I must tell you Abby is living with me again, but not in the same capacity,---she keeps to her own bed, & I keep myself continent. Any more nonsense of the former kind would put me in an awkward predicament with her. One child is very well. She behaves extremely well, and, by what I hear from Sam, my arrangements prevent the affair from giving pain next door. The fact is I could not afford to allow her a separate establishment. Mrs Brown at first (I thought) behaved tolerably well,---I can't say so much for her now;---her husband knows nothing of the matter yet, as she says. In the mean time the child thrives gloriously,---but I'm not going to be fondly parental, for, between you & me, I think an infant is disagreeable,---it is all gut and squall. I dined with Richards on his wedding day,---he had just recovered from breaking his leg,---how could he be so brittle?---and it was done in a game at romps with his children!---Now I've something to make you 'spit fire, spout flame', the batch of Brag players asked me to town, hoping to fleece me,---it was at Reynolds' lodging,---& I carried off £2\. 10/-,---when will they be sick of these vain attempts? Mrs Dilke was next door yesterday,---she had a sad tumble in the mud,---(you must not laugh,)---her news was that Martin is to be married this year,---that Reynolds & Mrs Montague correspond sentimentally,---& that Barry Cornwall is to have Miss Montague,---there's some interesting small talk for you. Oh! Barry C: has a tragedy coming forth at the Theatre,---christened Mirandola,---Mire and O la!---What an odd being you are,---because you & I were so near meeting twice, yet missed each other both times, you cry out "there was my star predominant!"---why not mine (CB's) as well? But this is the way you argue yourself into fits of the spleen. If I were in Severn's place,  & you insisted on ever gnawing a bone, I'd lead you the life of a dog. What the devil should you grumble for? Do you recollect my anagram on your name?---how pat it comes now to Severn!---my love to him & the said anagram.---" Thanks Joe !" If I have a right guess, a certain person next door is a little disappointed at not receiving a letter from you, but not a word has dropped. She wrote to you lately,  & so did your sister. Your's most faithfully, Chas. Brown. Address : Monkhouse Esqre  Queen Street West Postmark illegible.

Address : Mr John Keats  Wentworth Place  Hampstead  near London Postmarks : LIVERPOOL 30 JA 1820 and 1 FE 1820 Liverpool---Sunday. Jany. 30th 1819 1099 My dear John I arrived last night after a cold ride and took a passage by the Courier before I went to bed, she will sail on Tuesday. I awoke at about two this morning and found myself nearly afloat in my bed, the cock of Cistern on the floor above was accidently left running and the water had dripped thro' the ceiling, I got up, called for lights and found it had found its way thro feather bed, and mattrass and made a great pool on the ground. At first I was alarmed having taken Calomel, but I am quite well this morning. This stride towards home has releived [ sic ] me considerably and the ship that is to carry me another portion of my journey came upon my sight with agreeable sensations notwithstanding my sufferings at Sea. Occupation will drive away the mumps untill I get on board, and I hope favorable gales will keep them away when on board; when arrived at New York and the remainder of my journey occupation and the near approach to George and our darling, the mumps will be to me antipodes. Tell Haslam of my arrival here and promise him a letter from Phila, shake hands with Dilke  & Spouse, Reynolds & Rice and say why I did'nt call. If unfavorable wind should detain me over Tuesday I'll write again. Rems to your neighbours and Brown. goodbye My dear John, Your very affectionate Friend and Brother George. Address : Mr Haslam  Frampton  & Co.  Leadenhall Street Postmarks : HAMPSTEAD and 23 AU 1820 Wentworth Place Wednesday--- My dear Haslam, I have been at Mrs Brawne's above a fortnight for a reason or by an accident I will explain when I am more fit for such things. The purport of the present note is to tell you that if I can manage it I certainly intend going speedily to Rome. I have written to Abbey  1100 for some Money which he promised to lend me in case George did not remit part of the loan from me. I have written to Brown to ask him to accompany me; and in fact am all but on the Road as the Physician tells me an english winter would do for me. Now will you let George and Mrs Wylie know all this, and there will be so much anxiety taken off my Mind. Mention in your Letter to George that Fanny complains sadly of not hearing from him. I could say much more than this half sheet would hold, but the oppression I have at the Chest will not suffer my Pen to be long-winded. My Compts to Mrs H. who I hope is well. Your sincere friend John Keats--- P.S. I have read this note over and think it goes rather snappish---you will believe I did not intend it. Goodbye
