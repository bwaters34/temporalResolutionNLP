[ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-236.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] We [s]aluted the ca[s]tle with [s]even guns, which was returned with three, and then entered within the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-237.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] immense pier, which forms the port. The pri[s]oners, thirty in number, were conveyed to the ca[s]tle, where we were received with great parade by the Dey's troops or cologlies, and guarded to a heavy [s]trong tower of the ca[s]tle. The Portugue[s]e pri[s]oners, to which nation the Algerines have the mo[s]t violent antipathy, were immediately, with every mark of contempt, [s]purned into a dark dungeon beneath the foundations of the tower, though there were [s]everal merchants of eminence, and one young nobleman, in the number. The Spaniards, whom the Dey's [s]ubjects equally dete[s]t, and fear more, were confined with me in a grated room, on the [s]econd [s]tory. We received, the [s]ame evening, rations similar to what, we under[s]tood, were i[s][s]ued to the garri[s]on. The next day, we were all led to a clean[s]ing hou[s]e, where we were cleared from vermin, our hair cut [s]hort, and our beards clo[s]e [s]haved; thence [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-238.jpg) \- external link  - Page 015. ] taken to a bath, and, after being well bathed, we were clothed in coar[s]e linen drawers, a [s]trait wai[s]tcoat of the [s]ame without [s]leeves, and a kind of tunic or loo[s]e coat over the whole, which, with a pair of leather [s]lippers, and a blue cotton cap, equipped us, as we were informed, to appear in the pre[s]ence of the Dey, who was to [s]elect the tenth pri[s]oner from us in per[s]on. The next morning, the dragomen or interpreters, were very busy in impre[s][s]ing upon us the mo[s]t profound re[s]pect for the Dey's per[s]on and power, and teaching us the obei[s]ance necessary to be made in our approaches to this augu[s]t potentate. Soon after, we were paraded; and Captain Hamed pre[s]ented each of us with a paper, written in a ba[s]e kind of Arabic, de[s]cribing, as I was informed, our per[s]ons, names, country, and conditions in life; [s]o far as our captors could collect from our [s]everal examinations. Upon the back of each paper was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-239.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] a mark or number. The [s]ame mark was painted upon a flat oval piece of wood, [s]omewhat like a painter's palette, and suspended by a [s]mall bra[s]s chain to our necks, hanging upon our brea[s]ts. The guards then formed a hollow [s]quare. We were blind folded until we pa[s][s]ed the fortifications, and then [s]uffered to view the city, and the immen[s]e rabble, which [s]urrounded us, until we came to the palace of the Dey. Here, after much military parade, the gates were thrown open, and we entered a [s]pacious court yard, at the upper end of which the Dey was [s]eated, upon an eminence, covered with the riche[s]t carpeting fringed with gold. A circular canopy of Per[s]ian [s]ilk was rai[s]ed over his head, from which were [s]u[s]pended curtains of the riche[s]t embroidery, drawn into fe[s]toons by [s]ilk cords and ta[s][s]els, enriched with pearls. Over the eminence, upon the right and left, were canopies, which almo[s]t vied in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-240.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] riches with the former, under which [s]tood the Mufri, his numerous Hadgi's, and his principal officers, civil and military; and on each [s]ide about [s]even hundred foot guards were drawn up in the form of a half moon. The pre[s]ent Dey, Vizier Ha[s][s]en Bashaw, is about forty years of age, five feet ten inches in height, inclining to corpulency, with a countenance rather comely than commanding; an eye which betrays [s]agacity, rather than in[s]pires awe: the latter is [s]ufficiently in[s]pired by the [s]ierce appearance of his guards, the splendour of his attendants, the grandeur of his court, and the magnificence of his attire. He was arrayed in a [s]umptuous Turki[s]h habit. His feet were [s]hod with bu[s]kins, bound upon his legs with diamond buttons in loops of pearl; round his wai[s]t was a broad [s]a[s]h, glittering with jewels, to which was [s]u[s]pened a broad scimitar, the hilt of which dazzled the eye [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-241.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] with brilliants of the fir[s]t water, and the [s]heath of which was of the fine[s]t velvet, [s]tudded with gems and the pure[s]t gold. In his [s]carf was [s]tuck a poignard and pair of pi[s]tols of exqui[s]ite workman[s]hip. The[s]e pi[s]tols and poignard were [s]aid to have been a pre[s]ent from the late unfortunate Louis the [s]ixteenth. The former was of pure gold, and the value of the work was [s]aid to exceed that of the precious mettle two hundred times. Upon the Dey's head was a turban with the point erect, which is peculiar to the royal family. A large diamond cre[s]cent [s]hone con[s]picuous in the front, on the back of which a [s]ocket received the quills of two large o[s]trich feathers, which waved in graceful maje[s]ty over his head. The pri[s]oners were directed by turns to approach the foot of the eminence. When within thirty paces, we were made to throw our[s]elves upon the earth and creep towards the Dey, licking the du[s]t as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-242.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] a token of reverence and [s]ubmi[s][s]ion. As each captive approached, he was commanded to ri[s]e, pull of his [s]lippers, and [s]tand with his face bowed to the ground, and his arms cro[s][s]ed over his brea[s]t. The chieux or [s]ecretary then took the paper he carried and read the [s]ame. To [s]ome the Dey put que[s]tions by his drogoman, others were di[s]mi[s][s]ed by a [s]light nod of his head. After [s]ome consultation among the chief men, an officer came to where the pri[s]oners were paraded, and called for three by the number, which was marked on their brea[s]ts. The Dey's prerogative gives him the right to [s]elect the tenth of all pri[s]oners; and, as the [s]ervice or ran[s]om of them con[s]titutes one part of his revenue, his policy is to choo[s]e tho[s]e, who[s]e friends or wealth would be mo[s]t likely to enrich his coffers. At this time, he selected two wealthy Portugue[s]e merchants, and a young nobleman of the [s]ame [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-243.jpg) \- external link  - Page 020. ] nation, called Don Juan Combri. Immediately after this [s]election, we were carried to a [s]trong hou[s]e, or rather pri[s]on, in the city, and there guarded by an officer and [s]ome of the crew of the Rover, that had taken us. The remainder of us being con[s]idered as private property, another [s]election was made by the captain and owners of the Rover; and all [s]uch, as could probably pay their ran[s]om in a [s]hort time, were removed into a place of [s]afety and [s]uffered only a clo[s]e con[s]inement. The remnant of my companions being only eleven, con[s]i[s]ted of the Negro [s]lave, five Portugue[s]e, two Spani[s]h [s]ailors, an Italian fiddler, a Dutchman from the Cape of Good Hope, and his Hottentot [s]ervant. As we could proffer no probability of ran[s]om we were reserved for another fate. De[s]poiled of all the honours of the free, The beaming dignities of man eclip[s]ed, Degraded to a bea[s]t, and ba[s]ely [s]old In open [s]hambles, like the [s]talled ox. Author's Manu[s]cript Poems . ARGUMENT. The Slave Market . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-244.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] On the next market day, we were [s]tripped of the dre[s]s, in which we appeared at court A napkin was wrapped round our loins, and a coar[s]e cloak thrown over our [s]houlders. We were then expo[s]ed for [s]ale in the market place, which was a [s]pacious [s]quare, inclosed by ranges of low [s]hops, in different [s]ections of which were expo[s]ed the various articles intended for [s]ale. One [s]ection was gay with flowers; another expo[s]ed all the fruits of the [s]ea[s]on. Grapes, dates, pomegranates, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-245.jpg) \- external link  - Page 022. ] oranges lay in tempting ba[s]kets. A third was devoted to [s]allads and pot herbs; a fourth to milk and cream. Between every [s]ection was a [s]mall room, where tho[s]e, who come to market, might occasionally refre[s]h them[s]elves with a pipe of tobacco, a cud of opium, a gla[s]s of sherbet, or other cooling liquors. Sherbet is compo[s]ed of lemons, oranges, [s]ugar, and water. It is what we, in New England, call beverage. In the centre of the market, an oblong [s]quare was railed in, where the dealers in bea[s]ts and [s]laves expo[s]ed their commodities for [s]ale. Here were camels, mules, a[s][s]es, goats, hares, dromedaries, women and men, and all other creatures, whether for appetite or u[s]e; and I ob[s]erved that the purcha[s]ers turned from one article to the other, with equal indifference. The women [s]laves were concealed in a latticed [s]hop, but the men were expo[s]ed in open view in a [s]tall, [s]ituated between tho[s]e appropriated [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-246.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] to the a[s][s]es and to the kumrah, a wretched looking, though [s]erviceable animal in that country, propagated by a jack upon a cow. I now di[s]covered the rea[s]on of the alternation in our dre[s]s; for, as the people here, no more than in New England, love to buy a pig in the poke, our loo[s]e coats were ea[s]ily thrown open, and the purcha[s]er had an opportunity of examining into the [s]tate of our bodies. It was a[s]toni[s]hing to ob[s]erve, how critically they examined my mu[s]cles, to [s]ee if I was naturally [s]trong; moved my limbs in various directions, to detect any latent lamene[s]s or injury in the parts; and [s]truck [s]uddenly before my eyes, to judge by my winking, if I was clear [s]ighted. Though I could not under[s]tand their language, I doubt not, they [s]poke of my activity, [s]trength, age, &c. in the [s]ame manner, as we at home talk in the [s]wop of a hor[s]e. One old man was very critical in his examination of me. He made [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-247.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] me walk, run, lie down, and lift a weight of about [s]ixty pounds. He went out, and [s]oon returned with another man. They conferred together, and the [s]econd was more critical in his examination than the fir[s]t. He obliged me to run a few rods, and then laid his hand [s]uddenly to my heart, to [s]ee, as I conjecture, if my wind was good. By the old man I was purchased. What the price given for me was, I cannot tell. An officer of the market atte[s]ted the contract, and I was obliged by the ma[s]ter of the [s]hop, who [s]old me upon commi[s][s]ions, for the benefit of the concerned in the Rover, to lie down in the [s]treet, take the foot of my new master, and place it upon my neck; making to him, what the lawyers call, attornment. I was then [s]eized by two [s]laves, and led to the hou[s]e of my new ma[s]ter. Perhaps the free citizen of the United States may, in the warmth of his patriotism, accu[s]e me of a tamene[s]s of [s]pirit, in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-248.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] [s]ubmitting to [s]uch gro[s]s di[s]grace. I will not ju[s]tify my[s]elf. Perhaps I ought to have a[s][s]erted the dignity of our nation, in de[s]pite of ba[s]tinadoes, chains, or even death it[s]elf. Charles the twelfth of Sweden has however been [s]tigmatized by the hi[s]torian, as a madman, for oppo[s]ing the in[s]ulting Turk, when a pri[s]oner, though a[s][s]i[s]ted by nearly two hundred brave men. If any of my dear countrymen cen[s]ure my want of due [s]pirit, I have only to wi[s]h him in my [s]ituation at Algiers, that he may avail him[s]elf of a noble opportunity of [s]uffering gloriou[s]ly for his country. True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fanta[s]y, Which is as thin of [s]ub[s]tance as the air, And more incon[s]tant than the wind; Who woos Even now the frozen bo[s]om of the north, And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew dropping [s]outh.

Grandeur draws a circle round the great, and often excludes from them the finer feelings of the heart. The wretched are all of one family; and ever regard each other as brethren. Among the [s]laves of my new ma[s]ter, I was received [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-250.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] with pity, and treated with tenderne[s]s, bordering upon fraternal affection. They could not indeed [s]peak my language, and I was ignorant of theirs; but, by dividing the [s]canty meal, compo[s]ing my couch of [s]traw, and alleviating my more rugged labours, they [s]pake that univer[s]al language of benevolence, which needs no lingui[s]t to interpret. It is true, I did not meet, among my fellow [s]laves, the rich and the noble, as the dramati[s]t and the noveli[s]t had taught me to expect. To betray a weakne[s]s I will confe[s]s that, [s]ometime after I was captured, I often [s]uffered fancy to cheat me of my "weary moments," by portraying tho[s]e [s]cenes, which had often amused me in my clo[s]et, and delighted me on the [s]tage. Sometimes, I even contemplated with plea[s]ure the company and conver[s]e of my fellow [s]laves. I expected to find them men of rank at lea[s]t, if not of learning. I fancied my ma[s]ter's cook [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-251.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] an Engli[s]h lord; his valet an Italian duke; his groom a knight of Malta; and even his foot boy [s]ome little lively French marquis. I fancied my future ma[s]ter's head gardener, taking me one [s]ide, professing the warme[s]t friend[s]hip, and telling me in confidence that he was a Spani[s]h Don with forty noble names; that he had fallen in love with my ma[s]ter's fair daughter, who[s]e mother was a chri[s]tian [s]lave; that the young lady was equally charmed with him; that [s]he was to rob her father of a rich ca[s]ket of jewels, there being no di[s]honour in [s]tealing from an infidel; jump into his arms in boy's clothes that very night, and e[s]cape by a ve[s][s]el, already provided, to his native country. I [s]aw in imagination all this accompli[s]hed. I [s]aw the lady de[s]cend the rope ladder; heard the old man and his [s]ervants pur[s]ue; [s]aw the lady carried off breathle[s]s in the arms of her knight; arrive [s]afe in Spain; was pre[s]ent at the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-252.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] lady's bapti[s]m into the catholic church, and at her marriage with her noble deliverer. I was my[s]elf almo[s]t [s]tifled with the care[s][s]es of the noble family, for the part I had borne in this perilous adventure; and in fine married to Donna [s]ome body, the Don's beautiful [s]i[s]ter; returned into my own country, loaded with beauty and riches; and perhaps was arou[s]ed from my reverie by a poor fellow [s]lave, who[s]e extreme ignorance had almo[s]t blunted the [s]en[s]ibility of his own wretchedne[s]s. Indeed, [s]o [s]weet were the delu[s]ions of my own fancy, I am loth to de[s]troy the innocent gratification, which the readers of novels and plays enjoy from the works of a Behn and a Colman; but the [s]ober character of the hi[s]torian compels me to a[s][s]ure my readers that, whatever may have happened in the [s]ixteenth century, I never [s]aw during my captivity, a man of any rank, family, or fortune among the menial [s]laves. The Dey, as I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-253.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] have already ob[s]erved, [s]electing his tenth pri[s]oner from tho[s]e, who would mo[s]t probably afford the riche[s]t ran[s]om, tho[s]e concerned in the captures are influenced by the [s]ame motive. All, who may be expected to be ran[s]omed, are deprived of their liberty, it is true; but fed, clothed, and never put to manual labour, except as a puni[s]hment for [s]ome actual crime, or attempting to recover their liberty. The menial [s]laves are generally compo[s]ed of the dregs of tho[s]e nations, with whom they are at war; but, though my fellow [s]laves were gro[s]sly illiterate, I mu[s]t do them the ju[s]tice to [s]ay, they had learned well the kinder virtues: tho[s]e virtues, which [s]chools and colleges often fail to teach, which, as Ari[s]totle well ob[s]erves, are like a flame of fire.

He had been formerly an officer in the Dey's troops, and, it was [s]aid, had rendered the Dey's-father [s]ome important [s]ervice in an in[s]urrection, and was therefore highly re[s]pected; though at that time he had no publick employment. He was an au[s]tere man; his natural [s]everity being probably encrea[s]ed by his employment as a military officer. I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-255.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] never [s]aw the face of any other per[s]on in his family, except the male [s]laves. The hou[s]es of the Algerines are nearly all upon the [s]ame model; con[s]i[s]ting of a building towards the [s]treet of one or two [s]tories, which is occupied by the ma[s]ter and male domestics, and which is connected by a gallery upon the ground, if the hou[s]e is of one [s]tory; if of two, the entrance is above [s]tairs, to a building of nearly the [s]ame [s]ize behind, which has no windows or lattices at the [s]ide, but only looking into a garden, which is always [s]urrounded by a high wall. In the[s]e back apartments the women are lodged, both wives and [s]laves. My master had a wife, the daughter of a principal officer in the Dey's court, and, to my [s]urpri[s]e, had only one. I found it to be a vulgar errour, that the Algerines had generally more. It is true they are allowed four by their law; but they generally find, as in our country, one lady [s]ufficient for all the comforts of connubial life; and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-256.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] never take another, except family alliance or barrenne[s]s renders it eligible or necessary. The more I became acquainted with their cu[s]toms, the more was I [s]truck with their great re[s]emblance to the patriarchical manners, de[s]cribed in holy writ. Concubinage is allowed; but few re[s]pectable people practi[s]e it, except for the [s]ake of heirs. With the Algerines the barrenne[s]s of a Rachel is [s]ometimes compen[s]ated to the hu[s]band, by the fertility of a Bilhah . After I had lived in this town hou[s]e about three weeks, during which time I was clothed after the fa[s]hion of the country, my ma[s]ter moved, with his whole family, to a country hou[s]e on the river Saffran. Our journey, which was about twelve miles, was performed in the evening. Two carriages, re[s]embling our travelling waggons, contained the women. Only the bodies of them were latticed, and furni[s]hed with curtains to cover them in the day time, which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-257.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] were rolled up in the evening. Two [s]laves preceded the carriages. Abdel Melic followed on hor[s]eback, and I accompanied a baggage waggon in the rear. When we arrived at the country hou[s]e, the garden gates were thrown open, and the carriages with the women entered. The men were introduced to the front apartments. I found here [s]everal more [s]laves, equally ignorant and equally attentive and kind towards me, as tho[s]e I had [s]een in the town. The next day, we were all [s]et to work in digging for the foundation of a new wall, which was to enlarge our ma[s]ter's gardens. The weather was [s]ultry. The [s]oil below the [s]urface was almo[s]t a quick[s]and. I, unused to hard labour, found my [s]trength [s]oon exhau[s]ted. My fellow [s]laves, compassionating my di[s]tre[s]s, were anxious, by changing places with me, to render my [s]hare of the labour le[s]s toil[s]ome. As we had our [s]tint for the whole party [s]taked [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-258.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] out to us every morning, it was in the power of my kind fellow labourers to favour me much. Often would they request me, by [s]igns, to repo[s]e my[s]elf in the [s]hade, while they encouraged each other to perform my [s]hare of the ta[s]k. After a while, our ma[s]ter came to in[s]pect the work; and, conceiving that it did not progre[s]s as fa[s]t as he wi[s]hed, he put an over[s]eer over us, who, finding me not [s]o active as the re[s]t, fir[s]t threatened and then [s]truck me with his whip. This was the fir[s]t di[s]graceful blow I had ever received. Judge you, my gallant, freeborn fellow citizens, you, who rejoice daily in our federal [s]trength and independence, what were my [s]en[s]ations. I threw down my [s]pade with di[s]dain, and retired from my work, lowering indignation upon my insulting oppre[s][s]or. Upon his lifting his whip to [s]trike me again, I flew at him, collared him, and threw him on his back. Then, [s]etting my foot on his brea[s]t, I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-259.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] called upon my fellow [s]laves to a[s][s]i[s]t me to bind the wretch, and to make one glorious effort for our freedom. But I called in vain. They could not comprehend my language; and, if they could, I [s]poke to [s]laves, a[s]toni[s]hed at my presumption, and dreading the con[s]equences for me and them[s]elves. After their fir[s]t a[s]toni[s]hment, they ran and took me gently off from the over[s]eer, and rai[s]ed him with the greate[s]t re[s]pect. No [s]ooner was he upon his feet than, mad with rage, he took up a mattoc; and, with a violent blow upon my head, levelled me to the ground. I lay [s]en[s]ele[s]s, and was awakened from my [s]tupor by the [s]evere la[s]hes of his whip, with which the da[s]tardly wretch continued to beat me, until his [s]trength failed. I was then left to the care of my fellow [s]laves, who could only wa[s]h my wounds with their tears. Complaint was immediately made to my master, and I was [s]ent to work in a [s]tone [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-260.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] quarry about two miles from the hou[s]e. At fir[s]t, I rejoiced in e[s]caping the malice of this mercile[s]s over[s]eer, but [s]oon found I had made no advantageous exchange. I was [s]urrounded by the mo[s]t mi[s]erable objects. My fellow labourers had been put to this place, as a puni[s]hment for domestic crimes, or for their [s]uperiour [s]trength, and all were obliged to labour equally hard. To break hard rocks with heavy mauls, to tran[s]port large [s]tones upon our backs up the craggy [s]ides of the quarry, were our common labours; and to drink water, which would have been delicious, if cold, and to eat black barley bread and onions, our daily fare; while the few hours, allotted to re[s]t upon our flinty beds, were di[s]turbed by the tormenting in[s]ects, or on my part by the more tormenting dreams of the dainties of my father's hou[s]e. There is a [s]pring under a rock upon my father's farm, which we called the cold [s]pring, from which we [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-261.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] used to [s]upply our family with water, and prided our[s]elves in pre[s]enting it as a refreshing beverage, in [s]ummer, to our visitors. How often, after working beyond my [s]trength, on a [s]ultry African day, in that horrid quarry, have I dreamed of dipping my cup in that cold [s]pring, and fancied the waters eluding my ta[s]te as I rai[s]ed it to my lips. Being pre[s]ented with a tumbler filled from this [s]pring, after my return, in a large circle of friends, the agonies I had [s]uffered came [s]o forcibly into my recollection, that I could not drink the water, but had the weakne[s]s to melt into tears. How naturally did the emaciated prodigal, in the [s]cripture, think upon the bread in his father's hou[s]e. Bountiful Father of the Univer[s]e, how are the common ble[s][s]ings of thy providence de[s]pi[s]ed. When I ate of the bread of my father's hou[s]e, and drank of his refre[s]hing [s]pring, no grateful return was made to him or [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-262.jpg) \- external link  - Page 039. ] thee. It was amid[s]t the parched [s]ands and flinty rocks of Africa that thou taughte[s]t me, that the bread was indeed plea[s]ant, and the water [s]weet.

He arre[s]ted my attention. For a moment I [s]u[s]pended my labour. At the [s]ame moment, an unmerciful la[s]h, from the whip of the [s]lave driver, recalled my attention to my work, and excited his, who was the cau[s]e of my neglect. At his approach, the [s]lave driver quitted me. The [s]tranger acco[s]ted me, and in good Engli[s]h commi[s][s]erated my di[s]tre[s][s]es, which, he [s]aid, he [s]hould deplore the more, if they were remedile[s]s.

For three years after my captivity, like you, I groaned under the la[s]h of the [s]lave driver; I ate the [s]canty mor[s]el of bitterne[s]s, moi[s]lened with my tears. Borne down by the complicated ills of hunger and [s]evere labour, I was carried to the infirmary for [s]laves, to breathe my la[s]t, where I was vi[s]ited by a Mollah or Mahometan prie[s]t. He pitied the misfortunes of a wretch, who, he [s]aid, had [s]uffered a cruel exi[s]tence, in this life, and had no rational hopes of exchanging it for a better, in the world to come. He opened the great truths of the mu[s][s]ulman faith. By his a[s][s]i[s]tance I recovered my health, and was received among the faithful. Embraced and protected by the rich and powerful, I have now a hou[s]e in the city, a country re[s]idence on the Saffran, two beautiful wives, a train of dome[s]tics; and a re[s]pectable place in the Dey's cu[s]toms de[s]rays the expen[s]e.

He will remove your [s]cruples, and, in a few days, you will be as free and happy as I am. I looked at him with a[s]toni[s]hment. I had ever viewed the character of an apostate as odious and dete[s]table. I turned from him with abhorrence, and for once embraced my burthen with plea[s]ure. Indeed I pity you, [s]aid he. I [s]orrow for your di[s]tre[s][s]es, and pity your prejudices. I pity you too, replied I, the tears [s]tanding in my eyes. My body is in slavery, but my mind is free. Your body is at liberty, but your [s]oul is in the mo[s]t abject [s]lavery, in the gall of bitterne[s]s and bond of iniquity.

No man is more [s]ubject to prejudice than an Engli[s]hman, and no sectary more ob[s]tinately attached to his tenets than the di[s][s]enter. But I have conver[s]ed with the Mollah, and I am convinced of the errours of my education. Conver[s]e with him likewi[s]e. If he does not convince you, you may glory in the chri[s]tian faith; as that faith will be then founded on rational preference, and not merely on your ignorance of any other religious [s]y[s]tem.

I was carried to the college, a large gloomy building, on the out[s]ide; but, within the walls, it was an earthly paradi[s]e.

Immediately upon my entering the[s]e sacred walls, I was carried to a warm bath, into which I was immediately plunged; while my attendants, as if emulous to clean[s]e me from all the filth of errour, rubbed me [s]o hard with their hands and fle[s]h bru[s]hes, that I verily thought they would have flayed me. While I was relaxed with the tepid, I was [s]uddenly plunged into a contiguous cold bath.

This application excited a very unea[s]y [s]en[s]ation, [s]imilar to the [s]troke of the water pepper, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-272.jpg) \- external link  - Page 049. ] to which "the liberal [s]hepherds give a gro[s][s]er name." In twenty four hours, the [s]un browned cuticle peeled off, and left my face, hands, legs, and neck as fair as a child's of [s]ix months old. This balm the Algerine ladies procure at a great expen[s]e, and u[s]e it as a co[s]metic to heighten their beauty. After I had been clothed in the drawers, [s]lippers, loo[s]e coat, and [s]hirt of the country, if [s]hirt it could be called, which neck had none; with a decoction of the herb henna, my hands and feet were tinged yellow: which colour, they [s]aid, denoted purity of intention. I was lodged and fed well, and [s]uffered to amu[s]e my[s]elf, and recover my [s]anity of body and mind. On the eleventh day, as I was reclining on the margin of a retired fountain, reflecting on my dear native country, I was joined by the Mollah. He was a man of about thirty years of age, of the mo[s]t plea[s]ing countenance and engaging [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-273.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] deportment. He was born at Antioch, and educated a chri[s]tian of the Greek church. He was de[s]igned by his parents for a preferment in that church, when he was captured by the Algerines, and almo[s]t immediately, conformed to the mu[s][s]ulman faith; and was in high e[s]teem in the sacred college of the prie[s]ts. As he [s]poke latin and [s]ome modern languages fluently, was well ver[s]ed in the bible and christian doctrines, he was often employed in pro[s]elyting the European [s]laves, and prided him[s]elf in his frequent success. He acco[s]ted me with the [s]weete[s]t modulation of voice; kindly inquired after my welfare; begged to know if my lodging, dre[s]s, and fare, were agreeable; assuring me that, if I wi[s]hed to alter either, in [s]uch a manner as to bring them nearer to the fare and modes of my native country, and would give my directions, they [s]hould be obeyed. He reque[s]ted me to appoint [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-274.jpg) \- external link  - Page 051. ] a time, when we might conver[s]e upon the great [s]ubject of religion. He ob[s]erved that he wi[s]hed me free from bodily indisposition, and that the powers of my mind would recover their activity. He [s]aid, the holy faith, he offered to my embraces, di[s]dained the u[s]e of other powers than rational argument; that he left to the church of Rome, and its mercile[s]s inqui[s]itors, all the honour and profit of conver[s]ion by faggots, dungeons, and racks. He made [s]ome further inquiry, as to my u[s]age in the college, and retired. I had been [s]o long accu[s]tomed to the in[s]olence of domestic tyranny; [s]o often groaned under the whip and burthen; [s]o often been buffetted, [s]purned and [s]pit upon, that I had [s]teeled my mind again[s]t the force and terrour, I anticipated from the Mollah; but was totally unprepared for [s]uch apparent candour and gentlene[s]s. Though I viewed his conduct as in[s]idious, yet he no [s]ooner retired than, overcome by his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-275.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] [s]uavity of manners, for the fir[s]t time I trembled for my faith, and bur[s]t into tears.

The patient, in the mo[s]t violent fever, was confined in a low hut, built of turf and flat [s]tones, which had been previou[s]ly heated by fire. When the profu[s]e[s]t per[s]piration was thus excited, the patient was carried, and often, with Indian fortitude, ran to the next [s]tream, and plunged frequently through the ice into the coldest water. This proce[s]s, which Boerhaave and Sydenham would have pronounced deletery, ever produced pri[s]tine health and vigour, when pre[s]cribed by the Indian phy[s]ician or Powwow.

Mollah . Born in New England, my friend, you are a chri[s]tian purified by Calvin. Born in the Campania of Rome, you had been a papi[s]t. Nur[s]ed by the Hindoos, you would have entered the pagoda with reverence, and wor[s]hipped the [s]oul of your ance[s]tor in a duck. Educated on the bank of the Wolga the Delai Lama had been your god. In China, you would have wor[s]hipped Tien, and perfumed Confucius, as you bowed in adoration before the tablets of your ancestors. Cradled with the Par[s]ees of Indostan, you had adored fire, and trembled with pious awe, as you pre[s]ented your rice and your ghee to the adorable cock and dog. A wi[s]e man adheres not to his religion, becau[s]e it was that of his ance[s]tors. He will examine the creeds of other nations, compare them with his own, and hold fa[s]t that, which is right.

To determine which of two revealed religions is be[s]t, two inquiries are alone nece[s][s]ary. Fir[s]t, which of them has the highe[s]t proof of its divine origin, and which inculcates the pure[s]t morals: that is, of which have we the greate[s]t certainty that it came from God, and which is calculated to do mo[s]t good to mankind. Author . True. As to the fir[s]t point, our bible was written by men divinely inspired. Mollah . Our alcoran was written by the finger of the Deity him[s]elf. But who told you, your bible was written by men divinely in[s]pired. Author . We have received it from our ance[s]tors, and we have as good evidence [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-279.jpg) \- external link  - Page 056. ] for the truths it contains, as we have in profane hi[s]tory for any hi[s]torical fact. Mollah . And [s]o have we for the alcoran. Our [s]acred and profane writers all prove the exi[s]tence of [s]uch a prophet as Mahomet, that he received the [s]acred volume from the hand of Gabriel, and the traditions of our ance[s]tors confirm our faith. Author . We know, the chri[s]tian religion is true, from its [s]mall beginnings and wonderful increa[s]e. None but Deity him[s]elf could have enabled a few illiterate fi[s]hermen to [s]pread a religion over the world, and perpetuate it to po[s]terity. Mollah . Your argument I allow to be forcible, but grant us al[s]o the u[s]e of it. Mahomet was an illiterate camel driver. Could he, who could not read nor write, have publi[s]hed a book, which for its excellence has a[s]toni[s]hed the world? Would the learned of Medina and Mecca have become his di[s]ciples? Could Omar and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-280.jpg) \- external link  - Page 057. ] Abubeker, his [s]ucce[s][s]ours, equally illiterate, have become the admiration of the world? If you argue from the a[s]toni[s]hing [s]pread of your faith, view our prophet, born five hundred and [s]ixty nine years, and dating the promulgation of his doctrine [s]ix hundred and twenty years after the birth of your prophet. See the exten[s]ive countries of Per[s]ia, Arabia, Syria, Egypt, all rejoicing in its benign influence. See our holy faith pouring its divine rays of light into Ru[s][s]ia, and Tartary. See it received by enlightened Greece, rai[s]ing its cre[s]cent through the va[s]t Turki[s]h empire, and the African [s]tates. See Palestine, and Jeru[s]alem the birth place of your prophet, filled with the di[s]ciples of ours.

My blood boiled to hear this infidel vaunt him[s]elf thus triumphantly again[s]t my faith; and, if it had not been for a prudence, which in hours of zeal I have [s]ince had cau[s]e to lament, I [s]hould have taken vengeance of him upon the [s]pot. I re[s]trained my anger, and ob[s]erved, our religion is [s]upported by miracles. Mollah . So is ours; which is the more remarkable, as our great prophet declared, he was not [s]ent into the world to work miracles, but to preach the unity of the fir[s]t cau[s]e, the re[s]urrection of the dead, the bli[s]s of paradi[s]e, and the torments of the damned. Yet his whole life was a miracle. He was no [s]ooner born than, with a voice, like the thundering of Hermon, he pronounced the adorable creed to his mother and nur[s]es:" I profe[s]s [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-282.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] that there is only one God, and that I am his apo[s]tle  ." He was circumci[s]ed from all eternity; and, at the [s]ame hour, a voice of four mighty angels was heard proclaiming from the four corners of the holy hou[s]e. The fir[s]t [s]aying,"proclaim the truth is ri[s]en, and all lies [s]hall return into hell." The [s]econd uttering, "now is born an apo[s]tle of your own nation, and the Omnipotent is with him." The words of the third were,"a book full of illu[s]trious light is [s]ent to you from God;" and the fourth voice was heard to [s]ay, "O Mahomet, we have [s]ent thee to be a prophet, apo[s]tle, and guide to the world." When the [s]ent of God was about three years old, the ble[s][s]ed child retired into a cave, at the ba[s]is of mount Uriel; when the archangel Gabriel, covering his face with his wings, in awful re[s]pect approached him [s]aying,"Bi[s]millahi Rrahmani Rrhahimi; in the name of the one Almighty, Compa[s][s]ionate, and Merciful, I am [s]ent to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-283.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] pluck from thy heart the root of evil; for thy prayers have [s]haken the pillars of eternal decree." The infant prophet [s]aid, "the will of thy Lord and mine be done." The archangel, then opened his bo[s]om with a lancet of adamant, and, taking out his heart, [s]queezed from it the black drop of original [s]in; and, having re[s]tored the heart, [s]unk gently into the bo[s]om of the Houri. Do you wi[s]h for more miracles? Hear how the prophet, in the dark night, passsed the [s]even heavens upon the [s]acred mule; of the mighty angel he [s]aw, of [s]uch a[s]toni[s]hing magnitude, that it was twelve thou[s]and days journey in the [s]pace between his eye brows; of the years he pent in peru[s]ing the book of de[s]tiny; and how he returned, [s]o [s]peedily that, the mattre[s]s was not cold, and he recovered the pitcher at his bed [s]ide, which he had over[s]et at his departure, [s]o that not one drop of water was lo[s]t.

He then vented a volume of reproach horrible to hear, and too bla[s]phemous to defile my paper. Author . Our religion was di[s][s]eminated in peace; yours was promulgated by the [s]word. Mollab . My friend, you [s]urely have not read the writings of your own historians. The hi[s]tory of the chri[s]tian church is a detail of bloody ma[s][s]acre: from the in[s]titution of the chri[s]tian thundering legion, under Con[s]tantine the great, to the expul[s]ion of the Moors out of Spain by the ferocious inqui[s]ition, or the dragooning of the Hugonots from France, under Louis the great. The mu[s][s]ulmen never yet forced a man to adopt their faith. When Abubeker, the caliph, took a christian city, he forbore to enter a principal church, as he [s]hould pray in the temple of God; and, where he prayed, the building would be e[s]tabli[s]hed as a mo[s]que by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-285.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] the piety of the faithful. The companions and [s]ucce[s][s]ours of the apo[s]tle conquered cities and kingdoms, like other nations. They gave civil laws to the conquered, according to the laws of nations; but they never forced the con[s]cience of any man. It is true, they then and we now, when a [s]lave pronounces the ineffable creed, immediately knock off his fetters and receive him as a brother; because we read in the book of Zuni that the [s]ouls of true believers are bound up in one fragrant bundle of eternal love. We leave it to the chri[s]tians of the We[s]t Indies, and chri[s]tians of your [s]outhern plantations, to baptize the unfortunate African into your faith, and then u[s]e your brother chri[s]tians as brutes of the desert.

So the doctors of your church tell you; but a [s]en[s]ual heaven is no more imputable to us than to you. When the Mo[s]t Holy conde[s]cends to reveal himself to man in human language, it mu[s]t be in terms commen[s]urate with our conception. The enjoyment of the Houri, tho[s]e immortal virgins, who will attend the beatified believer; the [s]plendid pavilions of the heavens, are all but types and [s]ignifications of holy joys too sublime for man in fle[s]h to conceive of. In your bible, I read, your prophet refers to the time, when he [s]hould drink new wine in his father's kingdom. Now would it be candid in me to ha[s]tily brand the heaven of your prophet as [s]en[s]ual, and to represent your faithful in blils as a club of wine bibbers? Author . But you will allow the preeminence of the morality of the [s]acied [s]criptures. Mollab .

You are there taught to be kindly affectionate one towards another; but they recommend the u[s]e of wine, and do not forbid gaming. The alcoran, by forbidding in expre[s]s terms the u[s]e of either, cuts from its follower the two principal [s]ources of disquiet and mi[s]ery. Read then this [s]potle[s]s book. There you will learn to love tho[s]e of our faith, and not hate tho[s]e of any other. You will learn the nece[s][s]ity of being virtuous here, that you may be happy and not mi[s]erable hereafter. You will learn refignation to the will of the Holy One; becau[s]e you will know, that all the events of your life were, in the embryo of time, forged on the anvils of Divine Wi[s]dom. In a word, you will learn the unity of God, which, notwith[s]tanding the cavil of your divines, your prophet, like ours, came into the world to e[s]tablish, and every man of rea[s]on mu[s]t believe. You need not renounce your prophet.

It is well known on the [s]ea coa[s]ts of the Mediterranean by the name of Lingua Franca . Probably it had its ri[s]e in the awkward endeavours of the natives to conver[s]e with [s]trangers from all parts of the world, and the vulgar people, calling all foreigners Franks , [s]upplied its name . I the more readily acquired this jargon, as it contained many Latin derivatives. If I have conjectured the principle, upon which the Lingua Franca was originally formed, it is applied through all [s]tages of its exi[s]tence: every per[s]on having good right to introduce words and phra[s]es from his vernacular tongue, and which, with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-291.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] [s]ome alteration in accent, are readily adopted.

The ea[s]e and comfort, with which I lived for [s]ome weeks pa[s]t, had vitiated my appetite, [s]oftened my hands, and relaxed my whole frame, [s]o that my coar[s]e fare and rugged labours [s]eemed more in[s]upportable. I nau[s]eated our homely food, and the [s]kin peeled from my hands and [s]houlders.

By the u[s]e of my Lingua Franca and a little Arabic, I hoped to obtain the assistance of the [s]laves and lower orders of the people, through whom I might journey. The only in[s]urmountable difficulty in my projects was to elude the vigilance of our over[s]eers. By a kind of roll call the [s]laves were numbered every night and morning, and at meal times: but, very fortunately, a probable opportunity of e[s]caping unnoticed [s]oon offered. It was announced to the [s]laves that in three days time there would be a day of re[s]t, a holiday, when they would be allowed to recreate themselves in the fields. This intelligence diffu[s]ed general joy. I received it with rapture. I doubled my diligence in my preparations; and, in the afternoon previous to this fortunate day, I contrived to place my little [s]tock of provi[s]ions under [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-295.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] a rock at a [s]mall di[s]tance from the quarry. At [s]un[s]et we were all admitted to bathe, and I retired to my repo[s]e with bright hopes of freedom in my heart, which were succeeded by the mo[s]t plea[s]ing dreams of my native land. That Beneficent Being, who brightens the [s]lumbers of the wretched with rays of bli[s]s, can alone expre[s]s my raptures, when, in the vi[s]ions of that night, I [s]tepped lightly over a father's threshhold; was [s]urrounded by congratulating friends and faithful dome[s]tics; was pressed by the embraces of a father; and with holy joy felt a mother's tears moi[s]ten my cheek. Early in the dawn of the morning, I was awakened by the congratulations of my fellows, who immediately collected in [s]mall groups, planning out the intended amu[s]ements of the day. Scarce had they portioned the little [s]pace alloted to ea[s]e, according their various inclinations, when an expre[s]s order came from our [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-296.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] ma[s]ter that we [s]hould go under the immediate direction of our over[s]eers, to a plain, about five miles di[s]tance, to be pre[s]ent at a publick [s]pectacle.

When we arrived at the plain, we found, [s]urrounding a [s]pot, fenced in with a [s]light railing, a large concour[s]e of people, among whom I could di[s]cern many groups of men, who[s]e habits and [s]orrow indented faces [s]hewed them to be of the [s]ame mi[s]erable order with us. In the mid[s]t of this [s]pot there was a frame [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-298.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] erected, [s]omewhat re[s]embling the [s]tage of our pillories; on the centre of which a pole or [s]trong [s]take was erected, [s]harpened at the end and pointed with [s]teel.

Suffice it to [s]ay that, after they had [s]tripped the [s]ufferer naked, except a cloth around the loins, they in[s]erted the iron pointed [s]take into the lower termination of the vertebrae, and thence forced it up near his back bone, until it appeared between his [s]houlders; with devili[s]h ingenuity contriving to avoid the vital parts. The [s]take was then rai[s]ed into the air, and the suffering wretch expo[s]ed to the view of the a[s][s]embly, writhing in all the contortions of in[s]upportable agony. How long he lived, I cannot tell, I never gave but one look at him: one was enough to appal a New England heart. I laid my head on the rails, until we retired.

My body had been enthralled, but the dignity of a free mind remained; and the [s]ame in[s]ulted pride, which had impelled me to [s]purn the villain [s]lave driver, who fir[s]t [s]truck me a di[s]graceful blow, had often excited a surly look of contempt upon my ma[s]ter, and the vile in[s]truments of his oppre[s][s]ion; but the terrour of the late execution, with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-302.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] the unabating fatigue of my body, had [s]o depre[s][s]ed my fortitude, that I trembled at the look of the over[s]eer, and was meanly anxious to conciliate his favour, by attempting per[s]onal exertions beyond my ability. The trite [s]tory of the in[s]urgent army of the [s]laves of ancient Rome, being routed by the mere menaces and whips of their ma[s]ters, which I ever sceptically received, I now credit.

Depre[s][s]ion of [s]pirits, con[s]equent upon my bla[s]ted hope of e[s]cape, coar[s]e fare, and con[s]tant fatigue reduced me to a mere [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-303.jpg) \- external link  - Page 080. ] [s]keleton: while over exertion brought on an haemopty[s]is or expectoration of blood, and menaced an approaching hectic; and [s]oon after, fainting under my burthen, I was taken up and conveyed in a hor[s]e litter to the infirmary for [s]laves, in the city of Algiers.

The former were men, who had made a vow of poverty, and who[s]e pro[s]e[s][s]ion was to attend the couches of the [s]ick; the latter were more ignorant than tho[s]e of my own country, who had amu[s]ed me in the gayer days of life. They had no theory nor any systematic practice; but it was immaterial to me. I had ca[s]t my la[s]t anxious thoughts upon [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-305.jpg) \- external link  - Page 082. ] my dear native land, had ble[s][s]ed my affectionate parents, and was re[s]igned to die. One day as I was [s]unk upon my bed, after a violent fit of coughing, I was awakened from a doze, by a familiar voice, which acco[s]ted me in Latin. I opened my eyes and [s]aw at my [s]ide, the Mollah, who attempted to de[s]troy my faith. It immediately [s]truck me that his purpo[s]e was to tempt me to apo[s]tatize in my la[s]t moments. The religion of my country was all I had left of the many ble[s][s]ings, I once enjoyed, in common with my fellow citizens. This rendered it doubly dear to me. Not that I was in[s]en[s]ible of the excellence and verity of my faith; no. If I had been expo[s]ed to [s]everer agonies than I [s]uffered, and had been flattered with all the riches and honours, the[s]e infidels could be[s]tow, I tru[s]t I [s]hould never have foregone that faith, which a[s][s]ured me for the miseries, I [s]u[s]tained in a cruel [s]eparation from [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-306.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] my parents, friends, and intolerable slavery, a rich compen[s]ation in that future world, where I [s]hould rejoin my beloved friends, and where [s]orrow, mi[s]ery, or [s]lavery, [s]hould never come. I judged uncandidly of the prie[s]t. He acco[s]ted me with the [s]ame gentlene[s]s, as when at the college, commi[s]erated my deplorable [s]ituation, and, upon my expre[s][s]ing an aversion to talk upon religion, he a[s][s]ured me that he di[s]dained taking any advantage of my weakne[s]s; nor would attempt to deprive me of the con[s]olation of my faith, when he feared I had no time left to ground me in a better. He recommended me to the particular care of the religious, who attended the [s]ick in the hospital; and, having learned in our former conferences that I was educated a physician, he influenced his friend the director of the infirmary to purcha[s]e me, if I regained my health, and told him I would be [s]erviceable, as a minor a[s][s]i[s]tant. If [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-307.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] any man could have effected a change of my religion, it was this prie[s]t. I was charmed with the man, though I abominated his faith. His very [s]mile exhilerated my [s]pirits and infu[s]ed health; and, when he repeated his vi[s]its, and communicated his plan of alleviating my di[s]tre[s][s]es, the very idea, of being freed from the oppressions of Abdel Melic, made an exchange of [s]lavery appear de[s]irable. I was again attached to life, and reque[s]ted him to procure a [s]mall quantity of the quinquina or je[s]uits bark. This excellent [s]pecific was unknown in the infirmary; but, as the Algerines are all fatali[s]ts, it is immaterial to the patient, who is his phy[s]ician, and what he pre[s]cribes. By his kindne[s]s the bark was procured, and I made a decoction, as near to Huxham's, as the ingredients I could procure would admit, which I infu[s]ed in wine; no brandy being allowed, even for the [s]ick. In a few weeks, the diagno[s]tics were [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-308.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] favourable, and I recovered my pri[s]tine health; and, [s]oon after, the director of the hospital purcha[s]ed me of my late ma[s]ter, and I was appointed to the care of the medicine room, with permi[s][s]ion to go into the city for fre[s]h [s]upplies.

To ob[s]erve the cu[s]toms, habits, and manners of a people, of whom [s]o much is [s]aid and [s]o little known at home; and e[s]pecially to notice the medical practice of a nation, who[s]e ance[s]tors have been [s]poken of with respect, in the annals of the healing art, was highly intere[s]ting. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-310.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] After a marked and a[s][s]iduous attention of [s]ome months to the duties of my office, I acquired the confidence of my [s]uperiours [s]o far, that I was [s]ometimes [s]ent abroad in the city to examine a patient, who had applied for admi[s][s]ion into the infirmary; and [s]ometimes the physicians them[s]elves would conde[s]cend to con[s]ult me. Though they affected to de[s]pi[s]e my [s]kill, I had often the gratification of ob[s]erving that they admini[s]tered my pre[s]criptions with [s]ucce[s]s. In [s]urgery they were arrant bunglers. Indeed, their preten[s]ions to knowledge in this branch were [s]o [s]mall that my [s]uperiour adroitne[s]s [s]carce occa[s]ioned envy. Applications, vulgarly common in the United States, were there viewed with admiration. The actual cautery was their only method of [s]taunching an external hemorrhage. The fir[s]t amputation, I operated, drew all the principal phy[s]icians around me. Nothing could equal their [s]urprize, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-311.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] at the application of the [s]pring tourniquet, which I had a[s][s]i[s]ted a workman to make for the occa[s]ion, except the taking up of the arteries. My friend the Mollah came to congratulate me on my [s]ucce[s]s, and [s]pread my reputation wherever he vi[s]ited. A poor creature was brought to the ho[s]pital with a depre[s][s]ed fracture upon the os frontis, [s]unk into a lethargy, and died. I propo[s]ed trepanning, but found tho[s]e u[s]eful in[s]truments unknown in this country. By the care of the director, I had a [s]et made under my direction; but, after having performed upon a dead, I never could per[s]uade the Algerine faculty to permit me to opperate upon a living [s]ubject. What was more amusing, they pretended to improve the aid of philo[s]ophy again[s]t me, and talked of the weight of a column of air pressing upon the dura mater, which, they [s]aid, would cau[s]e in[s]tant death. Of all follies the foppery of learning is the mo[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-312.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] in[s]upportable. Profe[s][s]ional ignorance and ob[s]tinacy were not all I had to contend with. Religious prejudice was a con[s]tant impediment to my [s]ucce[s]s. The bigotry of the Mahometan differs effentially from that of the Roman catholic. The former is a pa[s][s]ive, the latter an active principle. The papi[s]t will burn infidels and heretics; the Mu[s][s]ulman never torments the unbeliever, but is more tenaciou[s]ly attached to his own creed, makes his faith a principle in life, and never [s]uffers doubt to di[s]turb, or rea[s]on to overthrow it. I verily believe that, if the alcoran had declared, that the earth was an immen[s]e plain and [s]tood [s]till, while the [s]un performed its revolution round it, a whole ho[s]t of Gallileos, with a Newton at their head, could not have [s]haken their opinion, though aided by all the demon[s]trative powers of experimental philo[s]ophy. I was invited by one of the faculty to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-313.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] in[s]pect the eyes of a child, which had lo[s]t its [s]ight about three years; I propo[s]ed couching, and operated on the right eye with [s]ucce[s]s. This child was the only [s]on of an opulent Algerine, who, being informed that an infidel had re[s]tored his [s]on to [s]ight, refu[s]ed to let me operate on the other, prote[s]ting that, if he had known that the operator was an unbeliever, his [s]on [s]hould have remained blind, until he opened his eyes upon the Houri of paradise. He [s]ent me however a pre[s]ent of money, and offered to make my fortune, if I would abjure the chri[s]tian faith and embrace I[s]maeli[s]m, which, he [s]aid, he believed, I [s]hould one day do: as he thought that God never would have decreed that I [s]hould re[s]tore his [s]on to [s]ight, if he had not al[s]o decreed that I [s]hould be a true believer.

This was very agreeable to me; for, during my whole captivity, I had never yet [s]een the face of a woman; even the female children being carefully concealed, at lea[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-315.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] from the [s]ight of the vulgar. I now anticipated much [s]atisfaction from this vi[s]it, and hoped that, through the confidence, with which a tender and successful phy[s]ician [s]eldom fails to in[s]pire his patient, I [s]hould be able to acquire much u[s]eful information upon [s]ubjects of domestic concern, impervious to travellers. Preparatory to this vi[s]it, I had received a new and better [s]uit of clothes than I had worn, as a pre[s]ent from the father of the young lady. A gilt waggon came to the gate of the ho[s]pital, which I entered with our principal phy[s]ician, and was drawn by mules to a country hou[s]e, about five miles from the city, where I was received by Hadgi Mulladin, the father of my patient, with great civility. Real gentlemen are the [s]ame in all countries. He treated us with fruit and sherbet; and, [s]miling upon me, after he had pre[s]ented a bowl of [s]herbet to the principal phy[s]ician, he handed me another [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-316.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] bowl, which to my [s]urpri[s]e I found filled with an excellent Greek wine, and archly inquired of me how I liked the [s]herbet . Hadgi Mulladin had travelled in his youth, and was [s]uppo[s]ed to have imbibed the libertine principles of the chri[s]tian, as it re[s]pected wine. This was the only in[s]tance, which came to my knowledge, of any profe[s][s]ed Mu[s][s]ulman indulging him[s]elf with wine or any [s]trong liquor; and it was not unnoticed by the principal phy[s]ician, who afterwards gravely told me that Hadgi Mulladin would be undoubtedly damned for drinking wine; would be condemned to perpetual thir[s]t in the next world, while the black [s]pirit would pre[s]ent him with red hot cups of [s]calding wine. Exhilirated by the wine and the comparitively free manners of this Algerine, I was anxious to [s]ee my patient. I was [s]oon gratified. Being introduced into a large room, I was left alone nigh an hour. A [s]ide door was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-317.jpg) \- external link  - Page 094. ] then opened, and two eunuchs came forward with much [s]olemnity and made [s]igns for me to retire to the farthe[s]t part of the room, as if I had been infe[s]ted with [s]ome malignant di[s]order. They were, in about ten minutes, followed by four more of the [s]ame [s]ex, bearing a [s]pecies of couch, clo[s]e covered with double curtains of [s]ilk, which they [s]et down in the mid[s]t of the room; and every one drew a broad [s]cimitar from his belt, flouri[s]hing it in the air, inclined it over his [s]houlder, and [s]tood guard at every corner of the couch. While I was wondering at this parade, the two fir[s]t eunuchs retired and [s]oon returned; the one bearing an ewer or ba[s]on of water, the other a low marble [s]tand, and [s]ome napkins in a China di[s]h. I was then directed to wa[s]h my feet; and, another ba[s]on being produced, it was signified that I mu[s]t wa[s]h my hands, which I did three times. A large thick mu[s]lin veil was then thrown over my head, I was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-318.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] led towards the couch, and was presented with a pul[s]e gla[s]s, being a long gla[s]s tube graduated and terminated below with a hollow bulb, and filled with [s]ome liquid, which ro[s]e and fell like spirits in the thermometer. This in[s]trument was in[s]erted through the curtains, and the bulb applied to the pul[s]e of my patient, and the other extremity put under my veil. By this I was to form my opinion of her di[s]order, and pre[s]cribe a remedy; for I was not allowed to a[s]k any que[s]tions or even to [s]peak to, much more [s]ee the lady, who was [s]oon reconveyed to her apartment. The two fir[s]t eunuchs now marched in the rear, and clo[s]ed and fa[s]tened the doors carefully after them. After waiting alone two hours or more, I was called to give my advice; and never was I more puzzled. To confe[s]s ignorance would have ruined my reputation, and reputation was then life it[s]elf. The temptations to quackery were powerful [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-319.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] and overcame me. I boldly pronounced her di[s]ea[s]e to be an intermittent fever, pre[s]cribed vene[s]ection, and exhibited [s]ome common febrifuge, with directions to throw in the bark, when the fever cea[s]ed. My pre[s]criptions were attended with admirable [s]ucce[s]s; and, if I had conformed to their faith, beyond a doubt, I might have acquired immen[s]e riches. But I was a [s]lave, and all my gains were the property of my ma[s]ter. I mu[s]t do him the ju[s]tice to [s]ay that, he permitted me to keep any particular pre[s]ents, that were made to me. Frequent applications were made to the director for my advice and a[s][s]i[s]tance to the di[s]ea[s]ed; and, though he received generally my fee, yet it was [s]ufficiently gratifiying to me to be permitted to walk abroad, to amu[s]e my[s]elf, and obtain information of this extraordinary people, as much of which, as the prescribed limits of this little work will admit, I [s]hall now lay before my readers.

Suffice it then to [s]ay, that the mixed multitudes, which inhabited this country, were reduced to the [s]ubjection of the Greek emperours by the arms of the celebrated Beli[s]arius, and [s]o continued, until the clo[s]e of the [s]eventh century, when they were [s]ubdued by the invincible power, and converted to the creed of the ancient caliphs, the immediate successours of the prophet Mahomet, who parcelled the country into many subordinate governments, among which was that of Algiers; which is now bounded, on the north, by the Mediterranean; on the [s]outh, by mount Atlas, [s]o familiar to the cla[s][s]ic reader, and the chain of hills, which extends thence to the north ea[s]t; on the we[s]t, by the kingdom of Morocco; [4] and, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-323.jpg) \- external link  - Page 100. ] on the ea[s]t, by the [s]tate of Tunis.

It was nine hundred years after the conque[s]t of the caliphs, and at the beginning of the tenth century, that the Algerines, by becoming formidable to the Europeans, acquired the notice of the enlightened hi[s]torian. About this time, two enterprizing young men, [s]ons of a potter, of the i[s]land of Mytelene the ancient [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-324.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] Lesbos, called Horric and Hayraddin, collecting a number of de[s]peradoes, [s]eized upon a brigantine and commenced pirates, making indi[s]criminate depredations upon the ve[s][s]els of all nations. They [s]oon augmented their force to a fleet of twelve gallies, be[s]ide [s]mall craft, with which they infe[s]ted the [s]ea coa[s]t of Spain and Italy, and carried their booty into the ports of Barbary, [s]tyling them[s]elves the lords of the [s]ea, and the enemies of all tho[s]e, who failed upon it. European nations were not then po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of [s]uch e[s]tabli[s]hed and formidable navies, as at the pre[s]ent day: even the Engli[s]h, who [s]eem formed for the command of the [s]ea, had but few [s]hips of force. Henry the eighth built [s]ome vessels, which, from their unmanageable bulk, were rather [s]uited for home defence than foreign enterprize; and the fleet of Elizabeth, which, in fifteen hundred and eighty eight, de[s]troyed the Spani[s]h Armada, was principally formed of [s]hips, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-325.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] chartered by the merchants, who were the general re[s]ource of all the maratime powers. The fleet of the[s]e adventurers was therefore formidable; and, as Robert[s]on [s]ays, [s]oon became terrible from the [s]traits of the Dardanelles to tho[s]e of Gibralter.

His frequent intercour[s]e with the Barbary States induced an acquaintance with Eutimi, then king of Algiers, who was then at war with Spain, and had made [s]everal un[s]ucce[s]sful attacks upon a [s]mall fort, built by that nation on the Oran. In his di[s]tre[s]s, this king incon[s]iderately applied to Barbaro[s][s]a, for a[s][s]i[s]tance, who readily embraced the invitation, and conducted him[s]elf like more modern allies. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-326.jpg) \- external link  - Page 103. ] He fir[s]t a[s][s]i[s]ted this weak king again[s]t his enemy, and then [s]acrificed him to his own ambition; for, leaving his brother Hayraddin to command the fleet, he entered the city of Algiers, at the head of five thou[s]and men, was received by the inhabitants, as their deliverer, a[s][s]i[s]ted them against the Spaniards, and then arre[s]ted and di[s]armed the principal people, secretly murdered the un[s]u[s]pecting Eutimi, and cau[s]ed him[s]elf to be proclaimed king of Algiers. Lavi[s]h of his trea[s]ures to his adherents, and cruelly vindictive to tho[s]e, he di[s]tru[s]ted, he not only established his government, but dethroned the neighbouring king of Temecien, and annexed his dominions to his own. But the brave Marquis de Comeres, the Spanish governour of Oran, by the direction of the Emperour Charles the fifth, a[s][s]i[s]ted the dethroned king; and, after defeating Barbaro[s][s]a in [s]everal bloody battles, besieged him in Temecien, the capital of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-327.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] that kingdom, where this ferocious adventurer was [s]lain in attempting his escape, but fought his pur[s]uers with a brutal rage, becoming the ferocity of his life. Upon the death of Barbaro[s][s]a, his brother Hayraddin a[s][s]umed the [s]ame name, and the kingdom of Algiers. This Barbarossa is better known to the European annali[s]t for rendering his dominions tributary to the Grand Seignior. He enlarged his power with a body of the Turkish [s]oldiers; and, being promoted to the command of the Turki[s]h fleet, he [s]pread the fame of the Ottoman power through all Europe: for though obliged by the [s]uperiour power of the Emperour Charles fifth to relinqui[s]h his conque[s]t of Tunis, which he had effected by a [s]imilar treachery, with which his brother had po[s][s]e[s][s]ed him[s]elf of Algiers; yet his being the acknowledged rival of Andrew Doria, the fir[s]t [s]ea commander of his age, has laurelled his brow among tho[s]e, who [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-328.jpg) \- external link  - Page 105. ] esteem glory to con[s]i[s]t in carnage. This Barbaro[s][s]a built a mole for the protection of the harbour of Algiers, in which, it is [s]aid, he employed thirty thou[s]and christian [s]laves, and died a natural death, and was [s]ucceeded by Ha[s][s]an Aga, a renegado from Sardinia, elected by the [s]oldiers, but confirmed by the Grand Seignior, who, taking an advantage of a violent [s]trom, which wrecked the navy of the Emperour Charles fifth, who had invaded his territories, drove that proud emperour from the coa[s]t, defeated the rear of his army, and captured [s]o many of his soldiers, that the Algerines, it is reported, [s]old many of their pri[s]oners by way of contempt, at the price of an onion per head. Another Ha[s][s]an, [s]on to the second Barbaro[s][s]a, [s]ucceeded and defeated the Spaniards, who invaded his dominions under the command of the Count de Alcandara, killed that nobleman, and took above twelve thou[s]and pri[s]oners. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-329.jpg) \- external link  - Page 106. ] But his [s]ucce[s][s]our, Mahomet, merited the mo[s]t of his country, when, by ingratiating him[s]elf with the Turki[s]h [s]oldiers, by incorporating them with his own troops, he annihilated the conte[s]ts of the[s]e fierce rivals, formed a permanent body of brave, di[s]ciplined troops, and enabled his successour to renounce that dependence upon the Grand Seignior, to which the [s]econd Barbaro[s][s]a had [s]ubmitted. In [s]ixteen hundred and nine, the Algerines received a va[s]t acce[s][s]ion of [s]trength and numbers from the emigrant Moors, whom the weak policy of Spain had driven to their dominions. Embittered by chri[s]tian [s]everity, the Moors flocked on board the Algerine ve[s][s]els, and [s]ought a de[s]perate revenge upon all, who bore the chri[s]tian name. Their fleet was [s]aid to con[s]i[s]t, at this period, of upwards of forty [s]hips, from two to four hundred tons burthen. Though the French with that gallantry, which di[s]tingui[s]hed them [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-330.jpg) \- external link  - Page 107. ] under their monarchs, undertook to avenge the cau[s]e of Europe and christianity; and, in [s]ixteen hundred and seventeen, [s]ent a fleet of fifty [s]hips of war against them, who [s]unk the Algerine admiral and di[s]per[s]ed his fleet; yet this bold people were [s]o elated, by their accession of numbers and riches, that they committed wanton and indi[s]criminate outrage, on the per[s]on and property of all nations, violating the treaties made by the Grand Seignior, [s]eizing the [s]hips of tho[s]e powers, with which he was in alliance, even in his own ports; and, after plundering Scandaroon in Syria, an Ottoman city, they, in [s]ixteen hundred and twenty three, threw off their dependence on the [s]ublime Porte. In [s]ixteen hundred and thirty [s]even, the Algerine rovers entered the Briti[s]h channel, and made [s]o many captures that, it was conjectured, near five thou[s]and Engli[s]h were made pri[s]oners by them; and, in the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-331.jpg) \- external link  - Page 108. ] [s]ame year, they di[s]patched Hali Pinchinin with [s]ixteen gallies to rob the rich chapel of our lady of Loretto; which proving un[s]ucce[s]sful, they ravaged the [s]hores of the Adriatic, and [s]o enraged the Venetians, that they fitted out a fleet of twenty eight fail, under the command of Admiral Cappello, who, by a late treaty with the Porte, had liberty to enter any of its harbours, to de[s]troy the Algerine gallies. Cappello was ordered by the Venetians to [s]ink, burn, and de[s]troy, without mercy, all the  of the enemy, and he bravely and [s]ucce[s]sfully executed his commi[s][s]ion. He immediately overtook and defeated Pinchinin, di[s]abled five of his gallies; and, this Algerine retreating to Valona and landing his booty, where he erected batteries for its defence, the brave Cappello manned his boats and [s]mall craft, and captured his whole fleet. In the[s]e actions, about twelve hundred Algerines were [s]tain; and, what [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-332.jpg) \- external link  - Page 109. ] was more plea[s]ing, [s]ixteen hundred christian galley [s]laves [s]et at liberty. Hi[s]tory affords no in[s]tance of a people, [s]o repeatedly and [s]uddenly recovering their losses, as the Algerines. Within a few years, we find them fitting out [s]eventy [s]ail of armed ve[s][s]els, and making [s]uch daring and de[s]perate attacks upon the commerce of nations, that the mo[s]t haughty maritime powers of Europe were more anxious, to [s]helter them[s]elves under a treaty and pay an humiliating tribute, than to attempt nobly to reduce them to rea[s]on and humanity. But, after many ineffectual attempts had been made to unite the force of Europe again[s]t them, the gallant French, by the command of Louis fourteenth, again rou[s]ed them[s]elves to cha[s]ten this intractable race. In sixteen hundred and eighty two, the Marquis du Que[s]ne, with a large fleet and [s]everal bomb ketches, reached Algiers; and, with his [s]ea mortars, bombarded it [s]o [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-333.jpg) \- external link  - Page 110. ] violently that, he laid almo[s]t the whole city in ruins. Whether his orders went no further, or the vice admiral judged he had cha[s]ti[s]ed them [s]ufficiently, or whether a violent [s]torm drove his fleet from its moorings, does not appear. But it is certain, that he left the city abruptly; and the Algerines, to revenge this in[s]ult, immediately [s]ent their fleet to the coa[s]t of France, and took [s]ignal reparation. The next year, Du Que[s]ne ca[s]t anchor before Algiers with a larger fleet; and, for forty eight hours, made [s]uch deadly discharges with his cannon, and [s]howered [s]o many bombs over this devoted city, that the Dey [s]ued for peace. The French admiral with that generosity, which is peculiar to his nation, insisted, as an indi[s]pen[s]able preliminary, that all the chri[s]tian [s]laves [s]hould be [s]ent on board his [s]quadron, with Mezemorto the Dey's admiral, as a ho[s]tage for the performance of this preliminary article. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-334.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] The Dey a[s][s]embled his divan, or council of great officers, and communicated the French demands. Mezemorto immediately collected the [s]ailors, who had manned the ramparts, and with whom he was a favourite; and, accu[s]ing the Dey of cowardice, he [s]o inflamed them that, being joined by the [s]oldiers, they murdered the Dey, and elected Mezemorto in his [s]tead. This was a [s]ignal for renewed ho[s]tility, and never was there a [s]cene of greater carnage. The French [s]eemed to have re[s]erved their fire for this moment, when they poured [s]uch ince[s][s]ant vollies of red hot [s]hot, bombs, and carcasses into the city, that it was nearly all in flames. The [s]treets run blood, while the politic and furious Mezemorto, dreading a change in the public mind, and con[s]cious that another ce[s][s]ation of arms would be attended with his death or delivery to the French, ran furiou[s]ly round the ramparts and exhorted the military to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-335.jpg) \- external link  - Page 112. ] their duty; and, to make his new subjects de[s]perate, cau[s]ed all the French [s]laves to be murdered; and, [s]eizing the French con[s]ul, who had been a pri[s]oner among them, [s]ince the fir[s]t declaration of war, he ordered him to be tied hand and foot, and placed over a bomb mortar and [s]hot into the air towards the French fleet. The French were [s]o highly enraged, the [s]ailors could [s]carce be prevented from attempting to land, and de[s]troy this barbarous race. The vice admiral contented him[s]elf with levelling their fortifications, reducing the city to rubbi[s]h, and burning their whole fleet. A fair opportunity now presented of preventing the Algerines from again mole[s]ting commerce. If the European maritime powers had by treaty engaged them[s]elves to de[s]troy the fir[s]t armed galley of the Algerines, which appeared upon the [s]eas, and conjointly forbidden them to repair their fortifications; this people might ere this have from nece[s][s]ity [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-336.jpg) \- external link  - Page 113. ] turned their attention to commerce; the mi[s]creants and outca[s]ts of other nations would have no longer found refuge among them; and this people might at this time have been as celebrated for the peaceful arts, as they are odious for the constant violation of the laws of nations and humanity. This was [s]urely the common intere[s]t of the European powers; but to talk of their common intere[s]t is idle. The narrow politics of Europe [s]eek an individual not a common good; for no [s]ooner had France humbled the Algerines than England thought it more for her intere[s]t to enter into a treaty with the new Dey, and, by way of douceur, [s]ent to Algiers a [s]hip load of naval and military [s]tores, to help them to rebuild their navy and [s]trengthen their fortre[s][s]es; while France, jealous le[s]t the affections of the mon[s]ter Mezemorto, who barbarously murdered their fellow citizens, [s]hould be attached to their rival the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-337.jpg) \- external link  - Page 114. ] English, immediately patched up a peace with the Algerines upon the mo[s]t favourable terms to the latter; and, to conclude the farce, [s]ent them another [s]hip load of [s]imilar materials of [s]uperious value to tho[s]e, pre[s]ented by the Engli[s]h. This, my readers, is a [s]mall [s]pecimen of European policy. The late[s]t authentic account of any attack upon the Algerines was on the twenty third of June, one thou[s]and [s]even hundred and [s]eventy five; when the Spaniards [s]ent the Count O'Reilly with a respectable fleet, twenty four thou[s]and land forces, and a prodigious train of artillery, to de[s]troy the city. The count landed about two thirds of his troops, about a league and an half to the ea[s]tward of the city; but, upon marching into the country, they were oppo[s]ed by an immen[s]e army of natives. The Spaniards [s]ay, it con[s]i[s]ted of one hundred and fifty thousand, probably exaggerated by their [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-338.jpg) \- external link  - Page 115. ] apprehensions. This is certain, they had force [s]ufficient, or [s]uperiour [s]kill to defeat the Spaniards, who retreated to their [s]hips with the lo[s]s of thirteen cannon, [s]ome howitzers, and three thou[s]and killed, besides pri[s]oners; while they de[s]troyed [s]ix thou[s]and Algerines. No [s]ooner had the treaty of Paris, in one thou[s]and [s]even hundred and eighty two, completely liberated the United States from their dependence upon the Briti[s]h nation than that haughty, exa[s]perated power, anxious to [s]hew their late coloni[s]ts the value of that protection, under which their ve[s][s]els had heretofore navigated the Mediterranean, excited the Algerines to capture the [s]hipping of the United States, who, following from nece[s][s]ity the policy of European nations, concluded a treaty with this piratical [s]tate on the fifth of September, one thou[s]and [s]even hundred and ninety five. Thus I have delineated a [s]ketch of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-339.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] Algerine hi[s]tory from actual information, obtained upon the [s]pot, and the be[s]t European authorities. This dry detail of facts will probably be pa[s][s]ed over by tho[s]e, who read for mere amu[s]ement, but the intelligent reader will, in this conci[s]e memoir, trace the leading principles of this de[s]potic government; will account for the avarice and rapacity of a people, who live by plunder; perceive whence it is that they are thus [s]uffered to injure commerce and outrage humanity; and ju[s]tify our executive in concluding, what [s]ome uninformed men may e[s]teem, a humiliating, and too dearly purcha[s]ed peace with the[s]e free booters. [3] Bruce, an Engli[s]hman, who travelled to collect fairy tales for the amu[s]ement of London cits, ob[s]erves that this territory was called Barbaria by the Greeks and Romans from Beber , [s]ignifying a [s]hepherd; and even the accurate compiler of the American edition of Guthrie's Geography has quoted the ob[s]ervation in a marginal note. We cannot expect that geographers [s]hould be philologi[s]ts anymore than that every printer [s]hould be a Web[s]ter. How the Greeks or Romans came by the word Beber , I leave Mr. Bruce to elucidate. The former had the term barbaros , a barbarian, which they indi[s]criminately applied to all foreigners; and, when Greek literature became fa[s]hionable in Roman [s]chools, the latter adopted the term, and barbarus was applied by the Romans with the [s]ame [s]oppi[s]h contempt. [4] The common geography compilers add the kingdom of Tefilet, I conjecture, upon the authority of Dr. Shaw, though I could never hear of any [s]uch kingdom in Africa. The face of many a country, which that learned writer describes, differs as much from the truth, as his own phy[s]iognomy from the true line of beauty.

Perhaps no town contains [s]o many places impervious to [s]trangers. The interiour of the Dey's palace, and the female apartment of every hou[s]e are [s]ecluded even from the natives. No one approaches them but their respective ma[s]ters, while no [s]tranger is permitted to in[s]pect the fortifications; and the mo[s]ques, or churches, are [s]crupulou[s]ly guarded from the polluted [s]teps of the unbeliever. A poor [s]lave, branded as an [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-341.jpg) \- external link  - Page 118. ] infidel, would obtain only general information from a re[s]idence in the mid[s]t of them. Algiers is [s]ituated in the bay of that name, and built upon the [s]ea [s]hore, an eminence, which ri[s]es above it, and which naturally gave the di[s]tinction of the upper and lower city. Towards the [s]ea, it is [s]trengthened with va[s]t fortifications, which are continued upon the mole, which [s]ecures the port from [s]torms and a[s][s]aults. I never perambulated it, but [s]hould judge that, a line drawn from the we[s]t arm of the mole, and extended by land, until it terminated on the ea[s]t, comprehending the buildings, would mea[s]ure about two miles. It contains one hundred and twenty mo[s]ques, two hundred and twenty public baths, and innumerable coffee hou[s]es. The mo[s]ques are large [s]tone buildings, not lofty in proportion to their extent on the ground, and have u[s]ually erected, upon their corners, [s]mall [s]quare towers or minarets, whence [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-342.jpg) \- external link  - Page 119. ] the inferiour prie[s]ts call the people to prayers. The baths are convenient buildings, lighted on the top, provided with cold and warm waters, which you mingle at your plea[s]ure, in [s]mall marble ci[s]terns, by the a[s][s]i[s]tance of bra[s]s cocks. Every bather pays two rials at his entrance, for which he is accommodated with a dre[s][s]ing room, contiguous to the bathing ci[s]tern, towels, fle[s]h bru[s]hes, and other conveniences, a gla[s]s of [s]herbet, and an a[s][s]i[s]tant, if he choo[s]es. The coffee hou[s]es or rooms are generally piazzas, with an awning over them, projecting from the front of the hou[s]es into the [s]treets. Here the inhabitants delight to loll, to drink [s]herbet, [s]ip coffee, and chew opium, or [s]moak tobacco, [s]teeped in a decoction of this exhilarating drug. I have already [s]ketched a de[s]cription of the hou[s]es, and [s]hall only add, that the roofs are nearly flat with a [s]mall declivity to ca[s]t the rain water into [s]pouts. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-343.jpg) \- external link  - Page 120. ] Algiers is tolerably well [s]upplied with [s]pring water, conveyed in pipes from the back country; but the Algerines, who are immoderately attached to bathing, prefer rain water, as be[s]t adapted to that u[s]e, con[s]idering it a luxury in compari[s]on with that, obtained from the [s]prings or [s]ea. The inhabitants [s]ay, Algiers contains twenty thou[s]and hou[s]es, one hundred and forty thou[s]and believers, twenty two thou[s]and Jews, and [s]ix thou[s]and chri[s]tian [s]laves. I [s]u[s]pect, Algerine vanity has exaggerated the truth; but I cannot contradict it. Immediately before the cen[s]us of the inhabitants of the United States, I am told, per[s]ons, who possessed much better means of calculation, misrated the population of the principal towns mo[s]t egregiou[s]ly.

Since that time, the Turki[s]h court have made [s]everal attempts to reduce the Algerines to their [s]ubjection; and, by siding with the numerous pretenders to the regency, [s]o common in this un[s]table government, they have, at times, apparently effected their de[s]ign: while the Algerines, by a[s][s]a[s][s]inating or dethroning tho[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-345.jpg) \- external link  - Page 122. ] princes, who[s]e weakne[s]s or wants have induced them to [s]ubmit to extraneous power, have reduced their dependence on the sublime Porte to a mere name. At pre[s]ent, the Grand Seignior, fearful of lo[s]ing the very [s]hadow of authority, he has over them, contents him[s]elf with receiving a tribute almost nominal; con[s]i[s]ting chiefly of a pre[s]ent, towards defraying the expen[s]es of the annual canopy, which is [s]ent to adorn the prophet's tomb at Medina: while, on the other hand, the Algerines, dreading the Grand Seignior's interference in their popular commotions, allow the sublime Porte to confirm the election of their Dey, and to badge his name, by affixing and terminating it with tho[s]e of the principal officers of the Turki[s]h government. Hence the pre[s]ent Dey, who[s]e real name is Ha[s][s]an, is [s]tyled Vizier, which is al[s]o the appellation of the Grand Seignior's fir[s]t mini[s]ter. As Ba[s]haw, which terminates the Dey's name, is the Turki[s]h [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-346.jpg) \- external link  - Page 123. ] title of their viceroys and principal commanders, he makes war or peace, negotiates treaties, coins money, and performs every other act of ab[s]olute independence. Nor is the Dey le[s]s independent of his own [s]ubjects. Though he obtains his office frequently by the election of a furious [s]oldiery, and wades to the regency through the blood of his predece[s][s]or; yet he is no [s]ooner inve[s]ted with the in[s]ignia of office, than, an implicit reverence is paid to his commands, even by his serocious electors; and, though he often [s]ummons his divan or council of great officers, yet they are merely advi[s]ory. He conducts foreign affairs, at his own good plea[s]ure; and, as to internal, he knows no re[s]traint, except from certain local customs, opinions, and tenets, which he him[s]elf venerates, in common with his meane[s]t [s]ubjects. Ju[s]tice is admini[s]tered in his name.

If he inclines to interfere in the determination of a [s]uit, upon his approach, the authority of the cadis cea[s]e, and is merged in that of the Dey. Some cu[s]toms have been intimated, which re[s]train the Dey's de[s]poti[s]m. The[s]e relate principally to religion, property, and females. He will not condemn a prie[s]t to death; and, although upon the decea[s]e of a [s]ubject, his landed property immediately e[s]cheats to the reigning Dey, yet he never [s]eizes it, in the life of the po[s][s]e[s][s]or; and, when a man is executed for the highe[s]t crime, the females of his family are treated with re[s]pect: nay, even in an in[s]urrection of the soldiery, when they murdered their Dey, neither they nor his [s]ucce[s][s]our violated the female apartments of the [s]lain.

It ari[s]es from a [s]light tax upon his [s]ubjects, a tribute from [s]ome Moors and tribes of Arabs, in the interiour country; a capitation tax upon the Jews; prizes taken at [s]ea; pre[s]ents from foreign powers, as the price of peace; annual subsidies from tho[s]e nations, with whom he is in alliance; and cu[s]tomary pre[s]ents, made by his courtiers on his birth day.

With the[s]e [s]upplies he has to [s]upport the magnificence of his court, defray the expen[s]e of foreign emba[s][s]ies, pay his army, [s]upply his navy, and repair his fortifications; and, by frequent gratuities, if he is not very [s]ucce[s]sful and popular, [s]upport his interest among tho[s]e, who have the power to dethrone him. His proportion of the prizes, captured at [s]ea, and the conciliatory pre[s]ents, made by the commercial powers, are the principal [s]ources of his revenue. It is obviou[s]ly the policy of the Dey, by frequently enfringing his treaties, to augment his finances, by new captures or fre[s]h premiums for his friend[s]hip. A pacific Dey is [s]ure not to reign long; for, be[s]ide the di[s]gu[s]t of the formidable body of [s]ailors, who are emulous of employ, when the reigning Dey has once gone [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-351.jpg) \- external link  - Page 128. ] through the routine of [s]eizing the ve[s][s]els, receiving the pre[s]ents, and concluding treaties with the u[s]ual foreign powers, he finds that the annual payments, [s]ecured by treaties, are in[s]ufficient for the maintenance of his nece[s][s]ary expenditures; and is therefore con[s]trained frequently to declare war as a principle of [s]elf preservation. I have been told, the pre[s]ent Dey conde[s]cended to explain the[s]e principles to an American agent in Algiers, and grounded his capturing the American [s]hipping upon this nece[s][s]ity. I mu[s]t, [s]aid the Dey, be at war with [s]ome nation, and yours mu[s]t have its turn. When the Dey, from a pacific di[s]po[s]ition or dread of foreign power, is at peace with the world, the di[s]gu[s]ted [s]ailor and avaricious [s]oldier join to dethrone him; having e[s]tabli[s]hed it, as a maxim, that all treaties expire with the reigning Dey, and mu[s]t be renewed with his [s]ucce[s][s]our. This is undoubtedly the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-352.jpg) \- external link  - Page 129. ] true [s]ource whence [s]pring tho[s]e frequent and dreadful convul[s]ions, in the regency of Algiers.

Perhaps there are more of this [s]pecies in the provinces. The hor[s]e are cantoned in the country round the city, and do duty by detachments at the palace.

When the ladies walk the [s]treets, they are muffled with bandages or handkerchiefs of mu[s]lin or [s]ilk over their faces, which conceals all but their eyes; and, if toonearly in[s]pected, will let fall a large vail, which conceals them intirely.

I [s]hall therefore endeavour rather to improve the under[s]tanding of my reader, with what I really know, man amu[s]e him with [s]tories, of which my circum[s]cribed [s]ituation rendered me nece[s][s]arily ignorant. I never was at an Algerine marriage; but obtained [s]ome authentic information on the [s]ubject. That extreme caution, which [s]eparates the [s]exes in elder life, is al[s]o attached to the youth. In Algiers, the young people never collect to dance, conver[s]e, or amuse them[s]elves with the innocent gaities of their age. Here are no theatres, balls, or concerts; and, even in the public duties of religion, the [s]exes never assemble together. An Algerine court[s]hip would be as di[s]agreeable to the hale youth of New England, as a common bundling would be di[s]gu[s]ting to the Mu[s][s]ulman. No opportunity is a[s][s]orded to the young [s]uitor to [s]earch for tho[s]e namele[s]s [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-360.jpg) \- external link  - Page 137. ] bewitching qualities and attentions, which attach the American youth to his mi[s]tre[s]s, and form the ba[s]is of connubial bli[s]s; nor is the young Algerine permitted, by a thousand tender a[s][s]iduities, to win the affections of the future partner of his life. His choice can be only directed by the rank or re[s]pectability of the father of his intended bride. He never [s]ees her face, until after the nuptial ceremony is performed; and even [s]ome days after [s]he has been brought home to his own hou[s]e. The old people frequently make the match, or, if it originates with the youth, he confides his wi[s]hes to his father or [s]ome re[s]pectable relation, who communicates the propo[s]al to the lady's father. If he receives it favourably, the young couple are allowed to exchange [s]ome unmeaning me[s][s]ages, by an old nur[s]e of the family. The bride's father or her next male kin, with the bridegroom, go before the Cadi and [s]ign a contract of marriage, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-361.jpg) \- external link  - Page 138. ] which is atte[s]ted by the relatives on each [s]ide. The bridegroom then pays a stipulated [s]um to the bride's father; the nuptial ceremony is performed in private, and the bridegroom retires. After [s]ome days, the bride is richly arrayed, accompanied by females, and conveyed in a covered coach or waggon, gaudy with flowers, to her hu[s]band's hou[s]e. Here [s]he is immediately immured in the women's apartments, while the bridegroom and his friends [s]hare a convivial fea[s]t. After [s]ome ceremonies, the nature of which I could not di[s]cover, the bridegroom enters the women's apartment, and for the fir[s]t time di[s]covers whether his wife has a no[s]e or eyes. Among the higher ranks, it is [s]aid, the bride, after the expiration of a month, goes to the public bath for women, is there received with great parade, and loaded with pre[s]ents by her female relations, assembled on the occa[s]ion. The [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-362.jpg) \- external link  - Page 139. ] bridegroom al[s]o receives pre[s]ents from his friends. Within a limited time, the hu[s]band may break the contract, provided he will add another item to that already given, return his bride with all her paraphernalia; and, putting the holy alcoran to his brea[s]t, a[s][s]ert that he never benefited himself of the rights of an hu[s]band. Notwith[s]tanding the apparent re[s]traint, the women are under, they are [s]aid to be attached to their hu[s]bands, and enjoy greater liberty than is generally conceived. I certainly [s]aw many women in the [s]treets, [s]o muffled up, and [s]o [s]imilar from their outward garment, that their neare[s]t relatives could-not di[s]tingui[s]h one from another. The vulgar [s]laves conjecture that the women take great liberties in this general di[s]gui[s]e. Their funerals are decent but not ostentatious. I [s]aw many.

Wherever the proce[s][s]ion pa[s][s]es, the people join in this dirge. The relatives follow, with the folds of their turbans loo[s]ened. The bodies of the rich are depo[s]ited in vaults, tho[s]e of the poor, in graves. A pillar of marble is erected over them, with an unblown ro[s]e carved on the top for the unmarried. At certain [s]ea[s]ons, the women of the family join a proce[s][s]ion in clo[s]e habits, and proceed to the tomb or grave, and adorn it with garlands of flowers. When the[s]e proce[s][s]ions pa[s]s, the [s]laves are obliged to throw them[s]elves on the ground with their faces in the du[s]t, and all, of whatever rank, cover their faces.

This fortunate impo[s]tor, like all other great characters in the drama of life, has been indignantly vilified by his opponents, and as ardently prai[s]ed by his adherents. I [s]hall endeavour to [s]teer the middle cour[s]e of impartiality; neither influenced by the biggoted aver[s]ion of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-365.jpg) \- external link  - Page 142. ] Sales and Prideaux, or the [s]pecious prai[s]e of the philo[s]ophic Boulanvilleirs . Mahomet was born in the five hundred and [s]ixty ninth year of the chri[s]tian era. He was de[s]cended from the Coreis, one of the noble[s]t of the Arabian tribes. His father, Abdalla, was a man of moderate fortune, and be[s]towed upon his [s]on [s]uch an education as a parent in con[s]ined, if not impoveri[s]hed circum[s]tances, could confer. The Turks [s]ay, he could not write; becau[s]e they pride them[s]elves in decrying letters, and becau[s]e the pious among them [s]uppo[s]e his ignorance of letters a [s]ufficient evidence of the divine original of the book, he publi[s]hed, as received from and written by the finger of Deity. But when the Arabian authors record, that he was employed as a factor by his uncle Abutileb, there can little doubt remain but that he was po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of all the literary acquirements, nece[s][s]ary to accompli[s]h [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-366.jpg) \- external link  - Page 143. ] him for his bu[s]ine[s]s. He has been stigmatized as a mere camel driver. He had the direction of camels it is true. The merchandize of Arabia was transported to different regions by carrivans of the[s]e u[s]eful animals, of a troop of which he was conductor; but there was as much difference between his [s]tation and employment, and that of a common camel driver, as between the [s]upercargo of an India [s]hip in our days, and the [s]eaman before the ma[s]t. In his capacity of factor, he travelled into Syria, Pale[s]tine, and Egypt; and acquired the mo[s]t u[s]eful knowledge in each country. He is repre[s]ented as a man of a beautiful per[s]on, and commanding presence. By his engaging manners and remarkable attention to bu[s]ine[s]s, he became the factor of a rich Arabian merchant, after who[s]e death he married his widow, the beautiful Cadija, and came into the lawful po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of immen[s]e wealth, which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-367.jpg) \- external link  - Page 144. ] awakened in him the mo[s]t unbounded ambition. By the venerable cu[s]tom of his nation, his political career was confined to his own tribe; and, the patriarchal being the prominent feature of the Arabian government, he could not hope to [s]urmount the claims of elder families, even in his own tribe, the genealogies of which were accurately pre[s]erved. To be the founder and prophet of a new religion would [s]ecure a glorious preeminence, highly gratifying to his ambition, and not thwarting the preten[s]ions of the tribes. Mankind are apt to impute the mo[s]t profound abilities to founders of religious [s]y[s]tems, and other fortunate adventurers, when perhaps they owe their [s]ucce[s]s more to a fortunate coincidence of circumstances, and their only merit is the sagacity to avail them[s]elves of that tide in the affairs of men, which leads to wealth and honour. Perhaps there never was a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-368.jpg) \- external link  - Page 145. ] conjuncture more favourable for the introduction of a new religion than that, of which Mahomet availed him[s]elf. He was [s]urrounded by Arian chri[s]tians, who[s]e darling creed is the unity of the Deity, and who had been per[s]ecuted by the Athena[s]ians into an abhorrence of almo[s]t every other chri[s]tian tenet: by Jews, who had fled from the vindictive Emperour Adrian, and who, too willfully blind to [s]ee the accompli[s]hment of their prophecies in the per[s]on of our Saviour, in the mid[s]t of exile were ready to contemn tho[s]e prophecies, which had [s]o long deluded them with a Me[s][s]iah, who never came: and by Pagans, who[s]e belief in a plurality of gods made them the ready pro[s]elytes of any novel [s]y[s]tem; and the more wi[s]e of whom were di[s]gu[s]ted with the gro[s]s ad[s]urdities of their own mythology. The [s]y[s]tem of Mahomet is [s]aid to have been calculated to attach all the[s]e. To gratify the Arian and the Jew, he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-369.jpg) \- external link  - Page 146. ] maintained the unity of God; and, to plea[s]e the Pagans, he adopted many of their external rites as fa[s]tings, wa[s]hings, &c. Certain it is, he [s]poke of Mo[s]es and the patriarchs, as me[s][s]engers from heaven, and that he declared Je[s]us Chri[s]t to be the true Me[s][s]ias, and the exemplary pattern of a good life, a [s]entiment critically expre[s][s]ing the Arian opinion. The slories of Mahomet's having retired to a cave with a monk and a Jew to compile his book; and falling into fits of the epilepsy, per[s]uading his di[s]ciples that the[s]e fits were trances in order to propagate his [s]y[s]tem more effectually, [s]o often related by geography compilers, like the tales of Pope Joan and the nag's head consecration of the Engli[s]h bi[s]hops, are fit only to amu[s]e the vulgar. It is certain, he secluded him[s]elf from company and a[s][s]umed an au[s]terity of manners, becoming the reformer of a vicious world. In his retirement, he commenced writing the al [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-370.jpg) \- external link  - Page 147. ] coran. His fir[s]t pro[s]elytes were of his own family, the next, of his near relatives. But the tribe of Corei were [s]o familiar with the per[s]on and life of Mahomet that they de[s]pi[s]ed his preten[s]ions; and, fearful le[s]t what they [s]tyled his mad enthu[s]ia[s]m [s]hould bring a [s]tigma upon their tribe, they fir[s]t attempted to rea[s]on him out of his [s]uppo[s]ed delu[s]ion; and, this failing, they [s]ought to de[s]troy him. But a [s]pecial me[s][s]enger of heaven, who, Mahomet [s]ays, mea[s]ured ten million furlongs at every [s]tep, informed him of their de[s]ign, and he [s]led to Medina, the inhabitants of which, being already prepo[s][s]e[s][s]ed in favour of his doctrine, received him with great re[s]pect. [5] [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-371.jpg) \- external link  - Page 148. ] He [s]oon in[s]pired them with the mo[s]t implicit confidence in the divinity of his mi[s][s]ion, and confirmed their faith by daily portions of the alcoran, which he declared was written by the finger of God, and tran[s]mitted to him immediately from heaven by archangels, commi[s][s]ioned for that important purpo[s]e. He declared him[s]elf the Sent of God , the [s]word of his almighty power, commi[s][s]ioned to enforce the unity of the divine e[s][s]ence, the unchangeableness of his eternal decrees, the future bli[s]s of true believers, and the torment of the damned, among the nations. He boldly pronounced all tho[s]e, who died fighting in his cau[s]e, to be entitled to the glory of martyrs in the heavenly paradi[s]e; and, availing him[s]elf of [s]ome of the antient feuds among the neighbouring tribes, cau[s]ed his di[s]ciples in Medina to wage war upon their neighbours, and they invariably conquered, when he headed their troops. The tribe of Corei [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-372.jpg) \- external link  - Page 149. ] flattered by the honours, paid their kinsman, and confounded by the repeated reports of his victories, were [s]oon proselyted, and become afterwards the mo[s]t enthu[s]ia[s]tic [s]upporters of his power. In [s]ix hundred and twenty [s]even, he was crowned fovereign at Medina, like the divine Melchi[s]edec, uniting in his per[s]on the high titles of prophet and king. He [s]ubdued the greater part of Arabia, and obtained a re[s]pectable footing in Syria. He died at Medina in the year [s]ix hundred and thirty three, and in the [s]ixty fourth year of his age. European writers, who have de[s]troyed almo[s]t as many great per[s]onages by poi[s]on as the French have with the guillotine, have attributed his death to a do[s]e admini[s]tered by a monk. But when we con[s]ider his advanced age and public energies, we need not recur to any but natural means for the cau[s]e of his death. [5] This flight was in the [s]ix hundred and twenty [s]econd year of the chri[s]tian era, when Mahomet was fifty four years of age.

His more confidential friends gathered around the corp[s]e; and, being impre[s][s]ed with the policy of immediately announcing his [s]ucce[s][s]our, they held a fierce debate upon the [s]ubject. In the alcoran, they found no direction for the election, nor any successour to the caliphate pointed out.

The younge[s]t of his wives produced [s]ome writings, containing the precious [s]ayings of the prophet, which, [s]he [s]aid, [s]he had collected for her own edification. To the[s]e were afterwards added [s]uch ob[s]ervations of the prophet, as his more intimate associates could recollect, or the policy of tho[s]e in power invent. The[s]e were annexed to the alcoran, and e[s]teemed of equal authority. This compilation was called the book of the companions of the apostle. In the writings, produced by his favourite wife, the prophet had directed his great officers to elect his [s]ucce[s][s]our from among them, and a[s][s]ured them that a portion of his own power would re[s]t upon him. Abubeker, a friend and relative, and [s]ucce[s]sful leader of the forces of the prophet, by the per[s]ua[s]ions of tho[s]e around, immediately entered the public mo[s]que; and, [s]tanding on the [s]teps of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-375.jpg) \- external link  - Page 152. ] the de[s]k, from which the prophet u[s]ed to deliver his oracles, he informed the multitude that God had indeed called the prophet to paradi[s]e, and that his kingly authority and apo[s]tolic powers re[s]ted upon him. To him [s]ucceeded Omar and O[s]man: while the troops in Syria, conceiving that Ali, their leader, was better entitled to [s]ucceed than either, elevated him al[s]o to the caliphate, though he refused the dignity until he was called by the voice of the people to [s]ucceed O[s]man. Hence [s]prang that great [s]chi[s]m, which has divided the Mu[s][s]ulman world; but, though divided, as to the [s]ucce[s][s]our of the prophet, both parties were actuated by his principles and adhered to his creed. Omar and his [s]ucce[s][s]ours turned their arms towards Europe; and, under the name of Saracens or Moors, po[s][s]e[s][s]ed them[s]elves of the greater part of Spain and the Mediterranean i[s]les: while the friends of Ali, e[s]tabli[s]hing them[s]elves as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-376.jpg) \- external link  - Page 153. ] [s]overeigns, made equal ravages upon Per[s]ia, and even to the great penin[s]ula of India. The Algerines are of the [s]ect of Omar, which, like many other religious [s]chi[s]ms, differs more in name, than in any fundamental point of creed or practice from that of Ali. The propriety of the translation of the alcoran into the Per[s]ian language, and the [s]ucce[s][s]ion of the caliphate [s]eem the great [s]tandards of their respective creeds.

To this they candidly impute the mi[s]erable, vitiated tran[s]lations of the chri[s]tians, who they charge with having garbled the [s]acred book, and degraded its [s]ublime alegories and metaphors into ab[s]urd tales. This is certain, the portions, I have heard chanted at funerals and quoted in conversation, ever exhibited the pure[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-378.jpg) \- external link  - Page 155. ] morality and the [s]ublime[s]t conceptions of the Deity. The fundamental doctrine of the alcoran is the unity of God. The evil [s]pirit, [s]ays the koran, is [s]ubtly deluding men, into the belief that there are more gods than one, that in the confu[s]ion of deities he may obtain a [s]hare of devotion; while the Supreme Being, pitying the delu[s]ions of man, has [s]ent Abraham, Mo[s]es, Soliman, breathed forth the Messias of the chri[s]tian in a [s]igh of divine pity, and la[s]tly [s]ent Mahomet, the [s]eal of the prophets, to reclaim men to this essential truth. The next fundamental points in the Mu[s][s]ulman creed are a belief in the eternal decrees of God, in a re[s]urrection and final judgment to bli[s]s or mi[s]ery. Some hold with chri[s]tians that the future puni[s]hment will be infinite, while others [s]uppo[s]e that, when the [s]ouls of the wicked are purified by fire, they will be received into the favour of God. They adhere to many other points of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-379.jpg) \- external link  - Page 156. ] practical duty: [s]uch as daily prayers, frequent ablutions, acts of charity and [s]evere fa[s]tings; that of rhammadin, is the principal, which is [s]imilar to the catholic lent, in abstinence, for the penitent ab[s]tains only from a particular kind of food, while he gluts him[s]elf with others perhaps more luscious. The alcoran al[s]o forbids games of chance, and the u[s]e of [s]trong liquors; inculcates a tenderne[s]s for idiots, and a re[s]pect for age. The book of the companions of the apo[s]tle enjoins a pilgrimage to his tomb, to be made by the true believers once at lea[s]t in their lives: but though they view the authority, which enjoined this tedious journey divine, yet they have contrived to evade its rigour by allowing the believer to perform it by proxy or attorney. Upon the whole, there does not appear to be any articles in their faith, which incite them to immorality or can countenance the cruelties, they commit. Neither [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-380.jpg) \- external link  - Page 157. ] their alcoran nor their prie[s]ts excite them to plunder, in[s]lave or torment. The former expre[s]sly recommends charity, ju[s]tice, and mercy towards their fellow men. I would not bring the [s]acred volume of our faith in any comparative view with the alcoran of Mahomet; but I cannot help noticing it as extraordinary, that the Mahometan [s]hould abominate the chri[s]tian on account of his faith, and the chri[s]tian dete[s]t the Mu[s][s]ulman for his creed; when the koran of the former acknowledges the divinity of the chri[s]tian Me[s][s]ias, and the bible of the latter commands us to love our enemies. If each would follow the obvious dictates of his own [s]cripture, he would cea[s]e to hate, abominate, and de[s]troy the other.

A union of the European powers with the Grand Seignior mo[s]t probably would be attended with [s]ucce[s]s; but this is not to be expected; as it never can be the intere[s]t of the [s]ublime Porte to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-382.jpg) \- external link  - Page 159. ] [s]uppre[s]s them, and the common faith of the Mu[s][s]ulman has more influence in uniting its profe[s][s]ors than the creed of the chri[s]tian, to the di[s]grace of the latter : and, as the Grand Seignior's dominion over the Algerines is little more than nominal, he is anxious to conciliate their favour by affording them his protection; con[s]idering prudently, that though intractable, they are [s]till a branch of the Mu[s][s]ulman [s]tock. Provoked by their in[s]ults, he has [s]ometimes withdrawn his protection, as was the ca[s]e, when he by treaty with the Venetians permitted their fleet to enter the Ottoman ports, for the expre[s]s purpo[s]e of de[s]troying the Algerine gallies; but, it is obvious, the [s]ublime Porte meant merely to cha[s]ti[s]e not to ruin them. In the Grand Seignior's wars with the Europeans, the piratical [s]tates have rendered [s]ignal [s]ervices, and he him[s]elf not unfrequently receives valuable douceurs [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-383.jpg) \- external link  - Page 160. ] for exerting his [s]uppo[s]ed influence over them, in favour of one or another of the contending powers of Europe. In the [s]iege of Gibraltar by the Spaniards, during the late American war, that garri[s]on received frequent [s]upplies of provi[s]ion from the Barbary Shore; but, by the application of Louis XVI. to the [s]ublime Porte, the Grand Seignior influenced the Barbary [s]tates to prohibit tho[s]e [s]upplies; and the Engli[s]h con[s]ul was di[s]mi[s][s]ed from one of them with the mo[s]t pointed marks of contempt. While the Grand Seignior reaps [s]uch [s]olid advantages from them, it is ab[s]urd to predicate upon his cooperation again[s]t them; neither can a union of the European powers be more fully anticipated. Jealou[s]y as often actuates mighty nations, as weak individuals. Whoever turns the pages of hi[s]tory with profit, will perceive that [s]ordid pa[s][s]ion is the impul[s]e of action to the greate[s]t [s]tates. Commercial [s]tates are al[s]o [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-384.jpg) \- external link  - Page 161. ] actuated by avarice, a pa[s][s]ion [s]till more baneful in its effects. The[s]e excite war, and are the grand plenipotentiaries in the adjustment of the articles of peace. Hence it is, that, while every European power is [s]olicitous to enrich and aggrandize it[s]elf, it can never join in any common project, the re[s]ult of which, it is jealous, may advantage its neighbour; and is content to [s]uffer injury, rather than its rival [s]hould [s]hare in a common good. Hence it is, that chri[s]tian [s]tates, in[s]tead of uniting to vindicate their in[s]ulted faith, join the cro[s]s and the cre[s]cent in unholy alliance, and form degrading treaties with piratical powers; and, as the acme of political folly, pre[s]ent tho[s]e very powers, as the purcha[s]e of their friend[s]hip, weapons to annoy them[s]elves in the fir[s]t war, that their avarice or caprice [s]hall wage. But, if ever a confederacy of the European powers [s]hould be formed again[s]t the Algerines, experience affords us but [s]lender [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-385.jpg) \- external link  - Page 162. ] hopes of its [s]ucce[s]s; for, I will venture to a[s][s]ert, that from the confederacy of Ahab and Jeho[s]haphat, when they went up to battle to Ramoth Gilead, to the treaty of Philnitz, there never was a combination of princes or nations, who, by an actual union of their forces, attained the object of their coalition. If the political finger is pointed to the war of the allies of Queen Anne, and the conque[s]ts of the Duke of Marlborough, as an exception, I likewi[s]e point to the di[s]tracting period, when that conqueror was [s]uperceded by the Duke of Ormond, and the treaty of Utrecht will confirm the opinion I have advanced. The detail of the hi[s]tory of the Algerines evinces, that the arms of individual [s]tates can be attended with no deci[s]ive [s]ucce[s]s. Indeed, the expen[s]e of an efficacious armament would defray the price of the Dey's friend[s]hip for years; and the powers of Europe [s]ubmit to his insults and injuries from a principle of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-386.jpg) \- external link  - Page 163. ] economy. An ab[s]olute conque[s]t of the Algerine territory cannot be effected but by inva[s]ion from the interiour, through the cooperation of the Grand Seignior or the a[s][s]i[s]tance of the other Barbary [s]tates. The former I have [s]hewn cannot be predicated, and the latter, for obvious reasons, is as little to be expected. A permanent conque[s]t of the city and port of Algiers cannot be effected, without the [s]ubjection of the interiour country. Temporary though [s]pirited attacks, upon that city and port, have never an[s]wered any [s]alutary purpo[s]e. They may be compared to the de[s]truction of our [s]eaports, in our revolutionary war. The port attacked bore [s]o [s]mall a proportion to the whole, that its de[s]truction rather [s]erved to irritate, than to weaken or [s]ubjugate. It [s]hould be con[s]idered, likewi[s]e, that the hou[s]es of the Algerines are built of slight and cheap materials; that upon the approach of an enemy the rich effects of the inhabitants are ea[s]ily removed [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-387.jpg) \- external link  - Page 164. ] inland, while nothing remains but heavy fortifications to batter, and buildings, which can be readily re[s]tored, to de[s]troy. The following anecdote will [s]hew how [s]en[s]ible the Algerines them[s]elves are of the[s]e advantages. When the French vice admiral, the Marquis de Que[s]ne, made his fir[s]t attack on Algiers, he [s]ent an officer with a flag on [s]hore, who magnified the force of his commander, and threatened to lay the city in a[s]hes, if the demands of the marquis were not immediately complied with. The Dey, who had, upon the fir[s]t approach of the enemy, removed the aged, the females and his riche[s]t effects, coolly inquired of the officer how much the levelling his city to a[s]hes would co[s]t. The officer, thinking to encrea[s]e the Dey's admiration of the power of the Grand Monarque, answered, two millions of livres. Tell your commander, [s]aid the Dey, if he will [s]end me half the money I will burn the city to a[s]hes my[s]elf.

The proce[s]s of his court is entirely verbal. He examines into all breaches of the cu[s]toms, all frauds, e[s]pecially in weights and mea[s]ures, all [s]udden affrays, di[s]putes concerning personal property, and compels the performance of contracts. He determines cau[s]es on the [s]pot, and the delinquent is puni[s]hed in his pre[s]ence. The u[s]ual puni[s]hments, he inflicts, are fines, beating on the [s]oles of the feet, di[s]memberment [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-389.jpg) \- external link  - Page 166. ] of the right hand; and, it is [s]aid, he has a power of taking life; but, in [s]uch ca[s]e, an appeal lies to the Dey. If complaint is made to him of the military, the prie[s]ts or officers of the court, navy, or cu[s]toms, or again[s]t per[s]ons attached to the families of the con[s]uls, envoys, or other representatives of foreign powers, upon [s]ugge[s]tion, the cau[s]e is immediately reported to the Dey, who hears the [s]ame in per[s]on, or deputes [s]ome officer of rank to determine it, either from the civil, military, or religious orders, as the nature of the cau[s]e may require. In fact, this officer of police [s]eldom judges any cau[s]e of great importance. The object of his commi[s][s]ion [s]eems to be the detection and punishment of common cheats, and to [s]uppre[s]s broils among the vulgar; and, as he has the power to adapt the puni[s]hment to the enormity of the offence, he often exercises it capriciou[s]ly, and, [s]ometimes, ludicrously. I [s]aw a baker, who, for [s]elling [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-390.jpg) \- external link  - Page 167. ] bread under weight, was [s]entenced to walk the public market, three times each day, for three days in [s]ucce[s][s]ion, with a [s]mall loaf, attached by a ring to each of his ears; and to cry aloud at [s]hort di[s]tances " bread for the poor ." This excited the re[s]entment of the rabble, who followed him with abundance of coar[s]e ridicule. Be[s]ides this itinerant judge, there are many others, who never meddle with [s]uits, unle[s]s they are brought formally before them, which is done by mere verbal complaint; they [s]end for the parties and witne[s][s]es, and determine almo[s]t as [s]ummarily as the officer of police. I confe[s]s that, when I left the United States, the golden fee, the lengthy bill of co[s]t, the law's delay, and the writings of Honestus, had taught me to view the judicial proceedings of our country with a jaundiced eye; and, when I was made acquainted with the Algerine mode of distributive ju[s]tice, I yearned to [s]ee a cau[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-391.jpg) \- external link  - Page 168. ] determined in a court, where in[s]tant decision relieved the anxiety, and [s]aved the pur[s]es of the parties; and where no long winded attorney was [s]uffered to perplex the judge with [s]ubtle argument or mu[s]ty precedent. I was [s]oon delighted with an excellent di[s]play of [s]ummary ju[s]tice. Ob[s]erving a collection of people upon a piazza, I leaned over the rails, and discovered that an Algerine cadi or judge had ju[s]t opened his court. The cadi was [s]eated cro[s]s legged on a cu[s]hion with a [s]lave, with a whip and batten on one [s]ide; and another with a drawn [s]cimitar on the other. The plaintiff came forward and told his [s]tory. He charged a man, who was in cu[s]tody, with having [s]old him a mule, which he [s]aid was [s]ound, but which proved blind and lame. Several witne[s][s]es were then called, who proved the contract and the defects of the mule. The defendant was then called upon for his defence. He did not deny the fact, but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-392.jpg) \- external link  - Page 169. ] pleaded the law of retaliation. He [s]aid, he was a good Mu[s][s]ulman, performed all the rites of their holy religion, had [s]ent a proxy to the prophet's tomb at Medina, and maintained an idiot; that he never cheated any man before, but was ju[s]tified in what he had done, for, ten years before, the plaintiff had cheated him wor[s]e in the [s]ale of a dromedary, which proved broken winded. He proved this by several witne[s][s]es, and the plaintiff could not deny it. The judge immediately ordered the mule and the money paid for it to be produced. He then directed his attendants to [s]eize the defendant, and give him fifty blows on the [s]oles of his feet for this fraud. The plaintiff at every [s]troke applauded the cadi's ju[s]tice to the [s]kies; but, no [s]ooner was the puni[s]hment inflicted, than, by a nod from the judge, the exulting plaintiff was [s]eized and received the [s]ame number of blows with the batten for the old affair of the broken [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-393.jpg) \- external link  - Page 170. ] winded dromedary. The parties were then di[s]mi[s][s]ed, without co[s]ts, and the judge ordered an officer to take the mule, fell it at publick outcry, and di[s]tribute the product, with the money depo[s]ited, in alms to the poor. The officer proceeded a few [s]teps with the mule, and, I thought, the court had ri[s]en, when the cadi, supposing one of the witne[s][s]es had prevaricated in his te[s]timony, called back the officer, who had charge of the mule, ordered the witne[s]s to receive twenty five blows of the batten, and be mounted on the back of the mule, with his face towards the tail, and be thus carried through the city, directing the mule to be [s]topped at every corner, where the culprit [s]hould exclaim; "before the enlightened, excellent, ju[s]t, and merciful cadi Mir Karchan, in the trial of O[s]man Beker and Abu I[s]oul, I [s]pake as I ride." The people around magnified Mir Karchan for this exemplary ju[s]tice; and I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-394.jpg) \- external link  - Page 171. ] pre[s]ent it to my fellow citizens. If it is generally plea[s]ing, it may be ea[s]ily introduced among us. Some ob[s]tinate people may be [s]till attached to our cu[s]tomary modes of di[s]pen[s]ing ju[s]tice, and think that the advocates we fee, and the precedents they quote, are but guards and enclosures round our judges, to prevent them from capriciou[s]ly invading the rights of the citizens.

After the cu[s]tomary prayers, the prie[s]t pronounced the following di[s]cour[s]e with a dignified elocution. It was received by his audience with a reverence, better becoming chri[s]tians than infidels. It undoubtedly [s]uffers from tran[s]lation and the [s]icklene[s]s of my memory; but the manner, in which it was delivered, and the energy of many of the expre[s][s]ions made [s]o [s]trong an impression, that I think I have not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-396.jpg) \- external link  - Page 173. ] materially varied from the [s]entiment. I pre[s]ent it to the candid reader, as a curious specimen of their pulpit eloquence; and as, perhaps, conveying a more [s]atisfactory idea of their creed, than I have already attempted, in the account I have given of their religion. The attributes of Deity were the [s]ubject of the prie[s]t's di[s]cour[s]e; and, after [s]ome exordium, he elevated his voice and exclaimed: God alone is immortal .

By unremitted attention to the duties of my office, and [s]ome fortunate operations in [s]urgery, I had now [s]o far ingratiated my[s]elf with the director and phy[s]icians of the infirmary, that I was allowed to be ab[s]ent any hours of the day, when my bu[s]ine[s]s in the ho[s]pital permitted, without rendering any e[s]pecial rea[s]on [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-402.jpg) \- external link  - Page 179. ] for my ab[s]ence. I wandered into all parts of the city, where [s]trangers were permitted to walk, in[s]pected every object I could, without giving umbrage. I sometimes [s]trayed into that quarter of the city, principally inhabited by Jews. This cunning race, [s]ince their di[s]per[s]ion by Vespasian and Titus, have contrived to compen[s]ate them[s]elves for the lo[s]s of Palestine, "by engro[s][s]ing the wealth, and often the luxuries of every other land; and, wearied with the expectation of that heavenly king," who [s]hall repo[s][s]e[s]s them of the holy city, and put their enemies beneath their feet, now [s]olace them[s]elves with a Me[s][s]iah, who[s]e glory is en[s]hrined in their coffers.

The wealth, which would render a subject too powerful, the de[s]pot can tru[s]t with an unambitious Jew; and confide [s]ecrets, which involve his own [s]afety to a mi[s]erable I[s]raelite, whom he can annihilate with a nod. The Jews tran[s]act almost all the Dey's private bu[s]ine[s]s, besides that of the negotiations of merchants. Nay, if an envoy from a foreign power comes to treat with the Dey, he may have the parade of a public audience; but, if he wi[s]hes to accompli[s]h his emba[s][s]y, he mu[s]t employ a Jew: and, it is [s]aid, the Dey him[s]elf [s]hares with the Jew the very [s]ums paid him for his influence with this politic de[s]pot. The Jews are al[s]o the [s]pies of the Dey, upon his [s]ubjects at home, and the channels of intelligence from foreign powers. They are therefore allowed to a[s][s]emble in their [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-404.jpg) \- external link  - Page 181. ] synagogues; and have frequently an influence at the court of the Dey, with his great officers, and even before the civil judge, not to be accounted for from the morality of their conduct. Popular prejudice is generally again[s]t them; and the Dey often avails him[s]elf of it by heavy amercements for his protection. In the year one thou[s]and [s]ix hundred and ninety, he threatened to extirpate the whole race in his dominions, and was finally appea[s]ed by a large contribution they rai[s]ed and offered as an expiation of a [s]uppo[s]ed offence. It was commonly reported, that the Jews in Algiers, at that time, had procured a chri[s]tian child, which they privately purified with much ceremony, fattened and prepared for a sacrifice, at their fea[s]t of the pa[s][s]over, as a [s]ub[s]titute for the pa[s]chal lamb. This horrid tale, which [s]hould have been despised for its ab[s]urdity and inhumanity, the Dey affected to credit.

Two hou[s]es were demoli[s]hed, and [s]everal Jews a[s][s]a[s][s]inated before the arrival of the Dey's guards, who quickly di[s]per[s]ed this outrageous rabble. The Dey, who de[s]ired nothing le[s]s than the de[s]truction of [s]o u[s]eful a people, was [s]oon appea[s]ed by a large pre[s]ent, and declared them innocent: and, [s]uch is the power of de[s]potic governments, that the Jews were [s]oon received into general favour; and the very men, who, the day [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-406.jpg) \- external link  - Page 183. ] before, proceeded to de[s]troy the whole race, now [s]aw, with tame inaction, several of their fellows executed for the attempt.

The [s]tone quarry came to my imagination in all its horrours, and the frowns of Abdel Melic again pierced my [s]oul. I attempted in vain to obtain from the [s]lave, who brought me provi[s]ions, the cau[s]e of my confinement. He was probably ignorant; my solicitations were uniformly an[s]wered by a melancholy [s]hake of the head. The next day, the director of the ho[s]pital appeared. To him I applied with great earne[s]tne[s]s; but all the information he would give was, that it was by the Dey's order I was confined; and that he, with the phy[s]icians and my friend the Mollah, were u[s]ing all their influence to obtain my relea[s]e. He coun[s]elled me to amu[s]e my[s]elf in preparing and compounding drugs, and promi[s]ed to [s]ee me again, as [s]oon as he could bring any good news. About a week after, an officer of the court, with a city judge, entered my apartment, and informed me of the cau[s]e of my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-409.jpg) \- external link  - Page 186. ] imprisonment. From them I learned, that [s]everal American ve[s][s]els had been captured; and, it was [s]u[s]pected, I had been conver[s]ing with my countrymen; and, from my [s]uperiour knowledge of the country, I might advi[s]e them how to e[s]cape. If a man is de[s]irous to know how he loves his country, let him go far from home; if to know how he loves his countrymen, let him be with them in mi[s]ery in a [s]trange land.

We were [s]oon joined by the Mollah, who repeatedly a[s][s]ured my examiners, that, though an infidel, I might be believed. By his [s]olicitation, I was to be relea[s]ed; but not until I would bind my[s]elf by a [s]olemn oath, admini[s]tered after the christian manner, that I would never [s]peak to any of the American [s]laves. When this oath was propo[s]ed, I doubted whether to take it; but, recollecting that, if I did not, I [s]hould be equally debarred from [s]eeing them, and [s]uffer a grievous confinement, which could do them no service, I con[s]ented and bound my[s]elf never [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-411.jpg) \- external link  - Page 188. ] directly or indirectly to attempt to vi[s]it or conver[s]e with my fellow citizens in slavery.

I was now more cautious in my rambles, avoided the notice of the Mu[s][s]ulmen inhabitants, and made more frequent visits to that part of the city, inhabited by Jews and foreigners. Refre[s]hing my[s]elf with a gla[s]s of [s]herbet in an inferiour room, I was acco[s]ted by an old man, in mean attire, with a pack of handkerchiefs and [s]ome remnants of [s]ilk and mu[s]lins on his back. He a[s]ked me, if I was not the learned [s]lave, and reque[s]ted me to vi[s]it a [s]ick [s]on.

We traver[s]ed [s]everal [s]treets and [s]topped at the door of a hou[s]e, which, in appearance, well [s]uited my conductor. It had but two windows towards the [s]treet, and tho[s]e were clo[s]ed up with rough boards, the cracks of which were [s]tuffed with rags and [s]traw. My conductor looked very cautiou[s]ly about, and then, taking a key from his pocket, opened the door. We pa[s][s]ed a dark entry, and, I confe[s]s, I [s]huddered, as the door clo[s]ed upon me, reflecting that, perhaps, this man was employed to decoy me to [s]ome [s]ecret place, in order to assassinate me, by the direction of my superiours, who might wi[s]h to de[s]troy me in this [s]ecret manner. But I had but little time for the[s]e gloomy reflections; for, opening another door, I was [s]tartled with a blaze of light, let into apartments splendidly furni[s]hed. My conductor now [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-414.jpg) \- external link  - Page 191. ] assumed an air of importance, reque[s]ted me to repo[s]e my[s]elf on a [s]ilken couch, and retired. A young lady, who was veiled, of a graceful per[s]on and plea[s]ing addre[s]s, [s]oon brought a plate of sweetmeats and a bottle of excellent wine. The old man [s]oon reappeared; but, [s]o changed in his habit and appearance, I could [s]carce recognize him. He was now arrayed in drawers of the fine[s]t linen, an embroidered ve[s]t, and loo[s]e gown of the riche[s]t Per[s]ian [s]ilk. He [s]miled at my [s]urpri[s]e, [s]hook me by the hand, and told me that he was a Jew; a[s][s]uring me, that he was with his brethren under the protection of the Dey. The outward appearance of his hou[s]e, and the meanness of his attire abroad were, he [s]aid, necessary to avoid envy and [s]u[s]picion. But come, [s]aid he, I know all about you; I can confide in you. Come refre[s]h your[s]elf with a gla[s]s of this wine;---neither Mo[s]es nor your Me[s][s]iah forbid the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-415.jpg) \- external link  - Page 192. ] u[s]e of it. We ate of the collation, drank our wine liberally; and then he introduced me to his [s]on, whom I found labouring under a violent ague. I administered [s]ome [s]udorifics, and left direction for the future treatment of my patient. Upon my departure, the Jew put a zequin into my hand, and made me promi[s]e to vi[s]it his [s]on again; requesting me to [s]eat my[s]elf in the place, he had found me, at the [s]ame hour, the next day but one afterwards; and, in pa[s][s]ing through the dark entry, conjured me not to mention his dome[s]tic [s]tyle of living. The name of this Jew was Adonah Ben Benjamin. I vi[s]ited his [s]on, according to appointment, and found him nearly restored to health. The father and [s]on both expre[s][s]ed great gratitude; but the former told me he would not pay me for this vi[s]it in [s]ilver or gold, but with something more valuable, by his advice. Come and [s]ee me [s]ometimes; I know [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-416.jpg) \- external link  - Page 193. ] this people well, and may render you more [s]ervice than you expect. I afterwards vi[s]ited this Jew frequently, and from him obtained much information. He told me, in much confidence, that [s]oon after I was taken, a Jew and two Algerines made a tour of the United States, and [s]ent home an accurate account of the American commerce; and that the Dey was [s]o impre[s][s]ed with the idea of our wealth, that he would never permit the American [s]laves to be ran[s]omed under a large premium, which mu[s]t be accompanied with the u[s]ual pre[s]ents, as a purchase of peace, and an annual tribute. Expre[s][s]ing my anxiety to recover my freedom, he advi[s]ed me to write to [s]ome of the American agents in Europe. I accordingly addre[s][s]ed a letter to William Carmichael, E[s]q; charge des affairs from the United States, at the court of Madrid, repre[s]enting my deplorable circumstances, and the mi[s]erable e[s]tate of my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-417.jpg) \- external link  - Page 194. ] fellow pri[s]oners; praying the interference of our government, [s]tating the probable mode of acce[s]s to the Dey, and enclo[s]ing a letter to my parents. This my friend, the Jew, promi[s]ed to convey; but, as I never received any an[s]wer from Mr. Carmichael, and my letters never found the way to my friends; I conclude, from the known humanity of that gentleman, my letters mi[s]carried. Some time after, I heard that the United States had made application, through Mr. Lamb, for the redemption of their citizens, and I had hopes of liberty; intending, if that gentleman [s]ucceeded in his negotiations, to claim my right to be ran[s]omed, as an American citizen, but his propo[s]als were [s]couted with contempt. I have [s]ometimes heard this gentleman cen[s]ured for failing to accomplish the object of his mi[s][s]ion, but very unju[s]tly; as I well remember that I, who was much intere[s]ted in his [s]ucce[s]s, never [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-418.jpg) \- external link  - Page 195. ] blamed him at the time; and, I know, the ran[s]om, he offered the Dey, was ridiculed in the common coffee hou[s]es, as extremely pitiful. The few Algerines, I conver[s]ed with, affected to repre[s]ent it as in[s]ulting. It was reported, that he was empowered to offer only two hundred dollars per head for each pri[s]oner indi[s]criminately, when the common price was four thou[s]and dollars per head for a captain of a ve[s][s]el, and one thou[s]and four hundred for a common fore ma[s]t [s]ailor. When this un[s]ucce[s]sful attempt failed, the pri[s]oners were treated with greater [s]everity; doubtle[s]s with a de[s]ign to affright the Americans into terms, more advantageous to the Dey. Finding my hopes of relca[s]e from the applications of my country to [s]ade, I con[s]ulted the friendly Jew, who advi[s]ed me to endeavour to pay my own ran[s]om, which, he [s]aid, might be effected with my [s]avings from my practice by the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-419.jpg) \- external link  - Page 196. ] mediation of a rich Jew, his relation. I accordingly put all my [s]avings into Adonah Ben Benjamin's hands, which amounted to two hundred and eighty dollars, and re[s]olved to add to it all I could procure. To this intent I hoarded up all I could obtain; denying my[s]elf the [s]lender refreshments of bathing and cooling liquors, to which I had been for [s]ome time accu[s]tomed. The benevolent Hebrew, promi[s]ing that, when I had attained the [s]um requi[s]ite, within two or three hundred dollars, he him[s]elf would advance the remainder, no mi[s]er was ever more engaged than I to increa[s]e my [s]tore. After a tedious interval, my pro[s]pects brightened [s]urpri[s]ingly. Some fortunate operations, I performed, obtained me valuable pre[s]ents; one to the amount of fifty dollars. My [s]tock, in the Jew's hands, had increa[s]ed to nine hundred dollars; and, to add to my good fortune, the Jew told me, in great confidence, that, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-420.jpg) \- external link  - Page 197. ] from the plea[s]ing account of the United States, which I had given him, for I always [s]pake of the privileges of my native land with fervour, he was determined to remove with his family thither. He [s]aid he would make up the deficiency in my ran[s]om, and [s]end me home by the fir[s]t European ve[s][s]el, with letters to a Mr. Lopez, a Jew, who, he [s]aid, lived in Rhode I[s]land or Ma[s][s]achu[s]etts, to whom he had a recommendation from a relation, who had been in America. To Mr. Lopez he intended to confign his property. He accordingly procured his friend, who[s]e name I did not then learn, to agree about my ran[s]om. He concluded the contract at two thou[s]and dollars. My friends in the ho[s]pital expre[s][s]ed [s]orrow at parting with me; and making me [s]ome pecuniary pre[s]ents, I immediately added them to my [s]tock, in the hands of the Jew. In order to le[s][s]en the price of my ran[s]om, the contractor had told my ma[s]ter that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-421.jpg) \- external link  - Page 198. ] he was to advance the money, and take my word to remit it, upon my return to my friends. This [s]tory I confirmed. I went to the Jew's hou[s]e, who hone[s]tly produced all my [s]avings; we counted them together, and he added the remainder, tying the money up in two large bags. We [s]pent a happy hour, over a bottle of his be[s]t wine: I, in anticipating the pleasure my parents and friends would receive in recovering their [s]on, who was lo[s]t, and the Jew in framing plans of commerce in the United States, and in the enjoyment of his riches in a country, where no despot [s]hould force from him his hone[s]t gains; and, what added to my enjoyment, was the information that a ve[s][s]el was to [s]ail for Gibraltar in two days, in which, he a[s][s]ured me, he would procure me a pa[s][s]age. I returned to the ho[s]pital, exulting in my happy pro[s]pects. I was quite be[s]ide my[s]elf with joy. I capered and danced as merrily, as my youthful [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-422.jpg) \- external link  - Page 199. ] acquaintance at a hu[s]king. Sometimes I would be lo[s]t in thought, and then bur[s]t [s]uddenly into loud laughter. The next day towards evening, I ha[s]ted to the hou[s]e of my friend the Jew, to [s]ee if he had engaged my pa[s][s]age, and to gratify my[s]elf with conver[s]ing upon my native land. Being intimate in the family, I was entrusted with a key of the front door. I opened it ha[s]tily, and pa[s][s]ing the entry, knocked for admittance at the inner door, which was [s]oon opened. But, in[s]tead of the accu[s]tomed [s]plendour, all was gloomy; the windows darkened, and the family; in tears. Poor Adonah Ben Benjamin had, that morning, been [s]truck with an apoplexy, and [s]lept with his fathers. I [s]oon retired as [s]incere a mourner as the neare[s]t kindred. I had indeed more reason to mourn than I conceived; for, upon applying to his [s]on for his a[s][s]i[s]tance in perfecting my freedom, which his good father had [s]o happily begun, he pro[s]e[s][s]ed [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-423.jpg) \- external link  - Page 200. ] the utmo[s]t ignorance of the whole transaction; declared that he did not know the name of the agent, his father had employed, and gave no credit to my account of the monies I had lodged with his father. I de[s]cribed the bags. He cooly answered, that the God of his father Abraham had ble[s][s]ed his father Adonah with many [s]uch bags. I left him, di[s]tracted with my di[s]appointment. Sometimes I determined to relate the whole [s]tory to the director of the ho[s]pital, and apply for legal redre[s]s to a cadi; but the [s]pecimen I had of an Algerine law [s]uit deterred me. I had been [s]o inadvertent, as to countenance the [s]tory that a Jew was to advance the whole [s]um for me. If I had been a Mu[s][s]ulman, I might have atte[s]ted to my [s]tory; but a [s]lave is never admitted as an evidence in Algiers, the We[s]t Indies, or the Southern States. The disappointment of my hopes were [s]oon known in the ho[s]pital, though the hand Adonah [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-424.jpg) \- external link  - Page 201. ] Ben Benjamin had in the contract remained a [s]ecret. The artful Jew, who had contracted for my ran[s]om, fearing he [s]hould have to advance the money himself, [s]pread a report that I was immen[s]ely rich in my own country. This coming to the ears of my ma[s]ter, he rai[s]ed my ran[s]om to [s]ix thou[s]and dollars, which the wily I[s]raelite declining to pay, the contract was di[s][s]olved. From my ma[s]ter I learned his name, and waited upon him, hoping to obtain [s]ome evidence of Adonah's having received my money, at lea[s]t [s]o far as to induce his [s]on to re[s]tore it. But the Jew po[s]itively declared that Adonah never told him other, than that he was to advance the ca[s]h him[s]elf. Thus, from the brighte[s]t hopes of freedom, I was reduced to de[s]pair; my money lo[s]t; and my ran[s]om rai[s]ed. I ble[s]s a merciful God that I was pre[s]erved from the desperate folly of [s]uicide. I never attempted my life; but, when I lay down, I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-425.jpg) \- external link  - Page 202. ] often hoped that I might never awake again, in this world of mi[s]ery. I grew dejected and my fle[s]h wa[s]ted. The phy[s]icians recommended a journey into the country, which my ma[s]ter approved; for, [s]ince the report of my wealth in my native land, he viewed my life as valuable to him, as he doubted not my friends would one day ran[s]om me at an exorbitant premium.

I accepted this propo[s]al with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-427.jpg) \- external link  - Page 204. ] pleasure, and was [s]oon lea[s]ed to two Mussulman merchants, who gave a kind of bond for my [s]afe return to my ma[s]ter. I had ca[s]h advanced me to purcha[s]e medicines, and a ca[s]e of [s]urgeon's in[s]truments, which I was directed to [s]tow in a large leather wallet. I took a kind leave of my patrons in the ho[s]pital, who be[s]towed many little pre[s]ents of [s]weetmeats, dates, and oranges. I waited upon the good Mollah, who pre[s]ented me with fifty dollars. I have charity to believe that this man, though an apo[s]tate, was [s]incere in his faith in the Mahometan creed. He pre[s][s]ed my hand at parting, gave me many [s]alutary cautions, as to my conduct during the voyage; and [s]aid, while the tears [s]tarted in his eyes, my friend, you have [s]uffered much mis[s]ortune and misery in a [s]hort life; let me conjure you not to add the torments of the future to the mi[s]eries of the pre[s]ent world. But, added he, pau[s]ing, who [s]hall alter the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-428.jpg) \- external link  - Page 205. ] decrees of God? I flatter my[s]elf, that the [s]cales of natal prejudice will yet fall from your eyes, and that your name was numbered among the faithful from all eternity. Our company con[s]i[s]ted of two Algerine merchants, or factors, twenty pilgrims, nine Jews, among whom was the [s]on of my decea[s]ed friend Adonah, and two Greek traders from Chios, who carried with them [s]everal bales of [s]ilks and a quantity of ma[s]tic, to vend at Scandaroon, Grand Cairo and Medina. We took pa[s][s]age in a Xebec; and, coasting the African [s]hore, [s]oon pa[s][s]ed the ruins of antient Carthage, the Bay of Tunis; and, weathering cape Bona, and [s]teering [s]outh ea[s]terly, one morning hove in [s]ight of the I[s]land of Malta, inhabited by the knights of that name, who are [s]worn enemies of the Mahometan faith. I could perceive, that the [s]ight of this i[s]land gave a [s]en[s]ible alarm to the crew [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-429.jpg) \- external link  - Page 206. ] and pa[s][s]engers. But the captain, or rather [s]kipper, who was a blu[s]tering, rough renegado, affected great courage, and [s]wore that, if he had but one cannon on board, he would run down and give a broad [s]ide to the infidel dogs. His bravery was [s]oon put to the te[s]t; for, as the [s]on aro[s]e, we could di[s]cern plainly an armed ve[s][s]el bearing down upon us. She overhauled us fa[s]t, and our [s]kipper conjectured [s]he bore the Malte[s]e colours. All hands were now [s]ummoned to get out [s]ome light [s]ails, and [s]everal oars were put out, at which the brave [s]kipper tugged as lu[s]tily as the meane[s]t of us. When the wind lulled and we gained of the vessel, he would run upon the quarters of the Xebec, and hollow; "Come on, you chri[s]tian dogs, I am ready for you." I have [s]ome doubts, whether the ve[s][s]el ever noticed us. If [s]he did, [s]he de[s]pi[s]ed us; for [s]he tacked and [s]tood to the [s]outh we[s]t. This was no [s]ooner perceived by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-430.jpg) \- external link  - Page 207. ] our gallant commander, than he ordered the Xebec to lay too, and [s]wore, that he would pur[s]ue the uncircumci[s]ed dogs, and board them; but he fir[s]t would prudently a[s]k the approbation of the passengers, who in[s]tantly determined one and all that their bu[s]ine[s]s was [s]uch, that they mu[s]t in[s]i[s]t upon the captain's making his be[s]t way to port. The captain consented, but not without much  at his misfortune, in lo[s]ing [s]o fine a prize; and declared that, when he landed his pa[s][s]engers, he would directly quit the port and renew the cha[s]e. After a [s]mart run, we dropt anchor in the port of Alexandria, called by the Turks Scandarcon. This is the [s]ite of the antient Alexandria, founded by Alexander the great; though its pre[s]ent appearance would not induce an opinion of [s]o magnificent a founder. It lies not far from the westermost branch of the river Nile, by which, in ancient day, it was [s]upplied with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-431.jpg) \- external link  - Page 208. ] water. The antiquarian eye may po[s][s]ibly ob[s]erve, in the [s]cattered fragments of rocks, the ve[s]tiges of the ruins of its antient grandeur; but a vulgar traveller, from the appearance of the harbour, choked with [s]and, the mi[s]erable buildings, and more wretched inhabitants of the town, would not be led to conclude that this was the port, which ro[s]e triumphant on the ruins of Tyre and Carthage. We here hired camels; and, being joined by a number of pilgrims and traders, collected from various parts of the Levant, we proceeded towards Grand Cairo, the present capital of Egypt; and, after travelling three days, or rather three nights, for we generally repo[s]ed in the heat of the day, which is [s]evere from one hour after the [s]un's ri[s]ing until it [s]ets, we came to a pretty town on the we[s]t bank of the Nile, called Gize, and hence pa[s][s]ed over on rafts to the city of Grand Cairo, called by the Turks Almizer; the [s]uburbs of which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-432.jpg) \- external link  - Page 209. ] extend to the river, but the principal town commences its proper boundaries, at about three miles ea[s]t of the Nile. I was now within a comparatively [s]hort di[s]tance of two magnificent curio[s]ities, I had ever been de[s]irous of beholding. The city of Jeru[s]alem was only about five day's journey to the [s]outh ea[s]t, and I had even caught a glimp[s]e of the pyramids near Gize. I went with my masters and others to [s]ee a deep [s]toned pit, in the ca[s]tle, called Jo[s]eph's well; and [s]aid to have been dug by the direction of that patriarch. I am not antiquarian enough to know the particular [s]tyle of Jo[s]eph's well architecture; but the water was [s]weet and extremely cold. The Turks [s]ay that Potiphar's wife did not cea[s]e to per[s]ecute Jo[s]eph with her love, after he was relea[s]ed from pri[s]on, and advanced to power; but the patriarch, being warned by a dream to dig this well, and invite her to drink of the water, which [s]he had no [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-433.jpg) \- external link  - Page 210. ] [s]ooner done, but one cup of it [s]o effectually cooled her de[s]ires, that [s]he was ever afterwards an eminent example of the mo[s]t frigid cha[s]tity. In Grand Cairo, we were joined by many pilgrims from Pale[s]tine, and the adjacent countries. The third day, our carivan, which consisted of three hundred camels and dromedaries, [s]et out for Medina, under the convey of a troop of Mamaluke guards, a tawny, raw boned, ill clothed people. Some of the merchants, and even pilgrims made a hand[s]ome appearance in per[s]on, dre[s]s, and equipage. I was my[s]elf well mounted upon a camel, and carried with me only my leather wallet of drugs, which I di[s]pen[s]ed freely among the pilgrims; my ma[s]ters receiving the ordinary pay, while I collected many [s]mall [s]ums, which the gratitude of my patients added to the u[s]ual fee. We pa[s][s]ed near the north arm of the red [s]ea, and then pur[s]ued our journey [s]outh, until we [s]truck the [s]ame [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-434.jpg) \- external link  - Page 211. ] arm again, near the place where the learned Wortley Montague has concluded the I[s]raelites, under the conduct of Mo[s]es, effected their pa[s][s]age. The breadth of the [s]ea here is great, and the waters deep and turbulent. The infidel may [s]neer, if he choo[s]es; but, for my own part, I am convinced beyond a doubt, that, if the I[s]raelites pa[s][s]ed in this place, it mu[s]t have been by the miraculous interposition of a divine power. I could not refrain from reflecting upon the infatuated temerity, which impelled the Egygtian king to follow them. Well does the Latin poet exclaim; Quem Deus vult perdere, prius dementat . We then travelled ea[s]t, until we came to a [s]mall village, called Tadah. Here we filled many goat [s]kins with water, and laded our camels with them. In addition to my wallet, I received two goat [s]kins or bags of water upon my camel. The weight, this u[s]eful animal will carry, is [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-435.jpg) \- external link  - Page 212. ] a[s]toni[s]hing; and the facility and promptitude, with which he kneels to receive his rider and burthen, [s]urpri[s]ing. We now entered the confines of Arabia Petrea, very aptly denominated the rocky Arabia; for, journeying [s]outh ea[s]t, we pa[s][s]ed over many ridges of mountains, which appeared of [s]olid rocks, while the vallies and plains between them were almo[s]t a quick[s]and. Not a tree, [s]rub, or vegetable is to be [s]een. In the[s]e vallies, the [s]un poured intolerable day, and its reflections from the land were insupportable. No refre[s]hing breeze is here felt. The intelligent traveller often fears the ri[s]ing of the wind, which blows [s]uch [s]ultry gales, that man and bea[s]t often [s]ink beneath them, "never to ri[s]e again" or, when agitated into a tempe[s]t, drive the [s]and with [s]uch tumultuous violence, as to overwhelm whole caravans. Such indeed were the [s]tories told me, as I pa[s][s]ed the[s]e dreary plains. The only [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-436.jpg) \- external link  - Page 213. ] inconvenience, I [s]u[s]tained, aro[s]e from the inten[s]e heat of the [s]un, and the chills of the night, which our thin garments were not calculated to exclude. On the third day, after we left Tadah, the water, which we tran[s]ported on our camels, was nearly expended. The[s]e extraordinary animals had not drank but once, [s]ince our departure. Near the middle of the fourth day, I ob[s]erved our camels [s]nuff the air, and [s]oon [s]et off in a bri[s]k trot, and ju[s]t before night brought us to water. This was contained in only one deep well, dug, like a rever[s]ed pyramid, with [s]teps to de[s]cend on every [s]ide, to the depth of one hundred feet; yet the [s]agacity of the camel had di[s]covered this water at perhaps twenty miles di[s]tance. So my fellow travellers a[s][s]erted; but I have [s]ince thought, whether the[s]e camels, from frequently pa[s][s]ing this de[s]ert country, did not di[s]cover their approach to water, rather from the eye, noting familiar [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-437.jpg) \- external link  - Page 214. ] objects, than the actual [s]centing the water it[s]elf. A hor[s]e that has journeyed the whole day, will quicken his [s]tep at night, when, upon a familiar road, within [s]ome miles of an accu[s]tomed [s]table. Our escort delighted in the marvellous. Many a dreadful [s]tory did they tell of poisonous winds and overwhelming [s]ands; and of the [s]ierce wandering Arabs, who captured whole caravans, and eat their pri[s]oners. Many a bloody battle had they fought with this cruel banditti, in which, according to their narratives, they always came off conquerours. Frequently were we alarmed, to be in readiness to combat their [s]avage free booters; though I never [s]aw but two of the wild Arabs, in the whole of our journey. They joined us at a little village, ea[s]t of I[s]lamboul, and acco[s]ted us with great civility. They were dre[s][s]ed in blue frocks, girded round the wa[s]te with particoloured [s]a[s]hes, in which were [s]tuck a pi[s]tol [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-438.jpg) \- external link  - Page 215. ] and a long knife. Their legs were bare, and [s]heep[s]kin caps covered their heads. Their complexions were [s]allow, but their garments and per[s]ons were clean. Indeed, their dre[s]s and addre[s]s evinced them to be of a more civilized race than our guards, who affected to treat them with lofty hauteur; and, when they departed, a[s][s]ured us that they were [s]pies, and that an attack from their countrymen might now be apprehended with certainty; if, [s]aid the leader of our e[s]cort, they are not terrified by finding you under our protection.

As I had never [s]een a [s]aint, being bred, in a land, where even the relics of the[s]e holy men are not pre[s]erved, for I believe all New England cannot produce [s]o much as a [s]aint's rotten tooth or toe nail, I was [s]olicitous to [s]ee and conver[s]e with this ble[s][s]ed per[s]onage. I [s]oon di[s]covered him, in the mid[s]t of about fifty pilgrims, [s]ome of whom were devoutly touching their foreheads with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-440.jpg) \- external link  - Page 217. ] the hem of his garment, while others, [s]till more devout, pro[s]trated them[s]elves on the ground, and ki[s][s]ed the prints of his foot[s]teps in the [s]and. Though I was assured, that he was filled with divine love, and conferred felicity on all, who touched him; yet, to outward appearance, he was the mo[s]t di[s]gu[s]ting, contemptible object, I had ever [s]een. Figure to your[s]elves, my readers, a little decrepit, old man, made [s]horter by [s]tooping, with a countenance, which exhibited a vacant [s]tare, his head bald, his finger and toe nails as long as hawks' claws, his attire [s]qualid, his face, neck, arms, and legs begrimed with dirt and [s]warming with vermin, and you will have [s]ome [s]aint idea of this Mu[s][s]ulman [s]aint. As I was too rea[s]onable to expect that holine[s]s exi[s]ted in a man's exteriour, I waited to hear him [s]peak; anticipating, from his lips, the profounde[s]t wi[s]dom, delivered in the honied accents of the [s]aints in bli[s]s. At length he [s]pake; and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-441.jpg) \- external link  - Page 218. ] his [s]peech betrayed him, a mere idiot. While this a[s]toni[s]hed me, it rai[s]ed the re[s]pect of his admirers, who e[s]timated his fanctity in an inver[s]e ratio to the weakness of his intellects. If they could have a[s]certained, that he was born an idiot, verily believe, they would have adored him; for the Mahometans are taught by their alcoran, that the [s]ouls of [s]aints are often lodged in the bodies of idiots and the[s]e pious [s]ouls, being [s]o intent on the joys of paradi[s]e, is the true rea[s]on that the actions of their bodies are [s]o little [s]uited to the manners of this world. This [s]aint however did not a[s]pire to the [s]anctity of a genuine idiot; though, fancy, his mode[s]ty injured his prefement, for he certainly had very fair pretensions. It was re[s]olved, that the homan [s]hould go with us; and, to my gremortification and di[s]gu[s]t, he was mouned behind me on the [s]ame camel; Mahometan friends probably conceived [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-442.jpg) \- external link  - Page 219. ] that he would [s]o far communicate his [s]anctity by contact, as that it might affect my conver[s]ion to their faith. Whatever were their faith. Whatever were their motives, in the embraces of this nau[s]eous being, with the people prostrating them[s]elves in reverence on each [s]ide, I made my entry into the city of Medina.

To this place, as has been before related, the prophet fled, when driven from Mecca his birth place; and here he was buried, and his remains [s]till are pre[s]erved, in a [s]ilver coffin, ornamented with a golden cre[s]cent, enriched with jewels, covered with cloth of gold, [s]upported upon [s]ilver ta[s][s]els, and [s]hadowed by a canopy, embroidered with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-444.jpg) \- external link  - Page 221. ] [s]ilk and gold thread upon [s]ilver ti[s][s]ue. This canopy is renewed annually, by the ba[s]haw of Egypt; though other ba[s]haws, and great men among the Turks, often a[s][s]i[s]t in the expen[s]e, or augment the value of the yearly pre[s]ent, by [s]ilver lamps and other ornaments. The whole are contained in a magnificent mo[s]que, in which are [s]u[s]pended innumerable gold and silver lamps, [s]ome of which are kept continually burning, and all are lighted on certain public occa[s]ions; and even upon the approach of [s]ome dignified pilgrim. I had not acquired [s]ufficient holine[s]s, from my ble[s][s]ed companion, to be permitted to enter this [s]anctified building. The Arabians are profu[s]ely extravagant, in the titles they be[s]tow on the city of Medina; calling it the mo[s]t holy, mo[s]t renowned, mo[s]t excellent city; the [s]anctuary of the ble[s][s]ed fugitive; model of the refulgent city in the cele[s]tial paradi[s]e; and [s]ome of the great vulgar [s]uppo[s]e, that when [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-445.jpg) \- external link  - Page 222. ] the world [s]hall be de[s]troyed, this city, with the prophet's remains, will be transported by angels, with all its inhabitants, to paradi[s]e. We tarried there but a few hours, as the great object of the devotions of the pilgrims was Mecca. Pilgrimages are performed to both places; but tho[s]e to Medina are not indi[s]pen[s]ably nece[s][s]ary; being directed by the book of the companions of the apo[s]tles, while tho[s]e to Mecca are enjoined by the alcoran it[s]elf. The former are [s]uppo[s]ed meritorious, the latter nece[s][s]ary to salvation. I had the curio[s]ity to inquire respecting the prophet's coffin being suspended in the air by a load [s]tone, and was a[s][s]ured that this was a mere chri[s]tian obloquy, as no preten[s]ions of any [s]uch [s]u[s]pen[s]ion were ever made.

I [s]aw the great mo[s]que in the centre of Mecca, which it is [s]aid, far [s]urpa[s][s]es in grandeur that of Sancta Sophia in Con[s]tantinople. It certainly is a very augu[s]t building, the roof of which is refulgent; but even the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-447.jpg) \- external link  - Page 224. ] inhabitants [s]miled at my credulity, when I ob[s]erved that I had read it was covered with plated gold. This mo[s]que contains within its limits the grand object of the Mu[s][s]ulman's pilgrimage; the Al Kaaba , or hou[s]e of God, [s]aid to have been built by the hands of the patriarch Abraham; to confirm which the Arabian prie[s]ts [s]hew a black [s]tone, upon which they [s]ay Abraham laid his [s]on I[s]aac, when he had bound him in preparation for his intended [s]acrifice. This [s]tone and building were great objects of veneration, before the mi[s][s]ion of the prophet, and he artfully availed him[s]elf of this popular prejudice, in rendering the highe[s]t re[s]pect to the holy hou[s]e, in his life time, and enjoining upon his followers, without distinction among males, to vi[s]it it once in their lives. The advent of the prophet was [s]aid to be announced from the four corners of the hou[s]e, which exhibit the four cardinal points. Few pilgrims are [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-448.jpg) \- external link  - Page 225. ] permitted to enter this [s]acred, venerable building; but, after travelling, [s]ome of them perhaps a thou[s]and miles, they are content to pro[s]trate them[s]elves in the courts, which [s]urround it. Few Mahometans perform this pilgrimage in per[s]on; tho[s]e who do are highly re[s]pected. This pilgrimage was enjoined, by the prophet, to be performed in per[s]on; but, when he laid this injunction, it is not probable he anticipated the exten[s]ive [s]pread of his doctrines. So long as his di[s]ciples were limited by the boundaries of Arabia, or had only extended themselves over a part of Syria, this pious journey was practicable and ea[s]y; out, when the cre[s]cent ro[s]e triumphant on the [s]ea coa[s]t, and mo[s]t of the interiour of Africa, when it [s]hone with [s]plendour in Per[s]ia, Tartary, and Turkey, and even adorned the Moori[s]h minarit in Spain, actual pilgrimage was deemed impracticable; and the faithful were allowed to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-449.jpg) \- external link  - Page 226. ] vi[s]it the Kaaba by deputy. The ingenuity of more modern times has alleviated this religious burthen [s]till further, by allowing the deputy to [s]ub[s]titute other attornies under him. Thus for example: the pious Mu[s][s]ulman in Belgrade will employ a friend at Con[s]tantinople, who will empower another friend at Scandaroon to procure a confidential friend at Grand Cairo to go in the name of him at Belgrade, and perform his pilgrimage to Mecca.

Here we found the [s]on of Adonah Ben Benjamin, who had been detained in this place by [s]ickne[s]s, [s]o weakened from a tedious [s]low fever that his life was despaired of. He expre[s][s]ed great joy, at our [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-451.jpg) \- external link  - Page 228. ] return, and begged my profe[s][s]ional a[s][s]i[s]tance; a[s][s]uring me, that he e[s]teemed his pre[s]ent di[s]order a judicial puni[s]hment from the God of his fathers, for the injury he had done me; candidly confe[s][s]ing, that he knew of his father's having received my money, which he would re[s]tore upon our return to Algiers, if I would effect his recovery. He prevailed upon my ma[s]ters that I [s]hould abide in the hou[s]e with him, during their ab[s]ence, as they were engaged upon a trading tour to a place called Ginge, upon the river Nile. I exerted all my [s]kill, both as a physician and nur[s]e. Perhaps my attention in the latter capacity, a[s][s]i[s]ted by his youth, was of more [s]ervice than my prescriptions. Be that as it may, he recovered rapidly, and in ten days was able to walk the [s]treets; but I could not help noticing with [s]orrow, that as his [s]trength increa[s]ed, his gratitude and promi[s]es to refund my money decrea[s]ed.

You think, a Jew will always deceive in money matters. You are mistaken. You [s]hall not wait for your pay in Algiers; I will pay you here in Alexandria. I owe you one thou[s]and dollars on my father's account. Now, what do you demand for re[s]toring me to health? Nothing replied I, overjoyed at his probity; re[s]tore me my money, and you are welcome to my [s]ervices. This mu[s]t not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-453.jpg) \- external link  - Page 230. ] be, [s]aid the [s]on of Adonah, I have done wickedly, but mean not only to pay you, but [s]atisfy my own con[s]cience. I will allow you in addition to the one thou[s]and dollars, two thou[s]and more for your assistance, as a phy[s]ician; and then will advance three thou[s]and more, which I will take your word to repay me, when you are able. I was a[s]toni[s]hed. I [s]eized his hand and felt his pul[s]e, to di[s]cover if he was not delirious. His pul[s]e were regular, and I knew his ability to perform his promi[s]e. We will meet here on the morrow, and I will pay you. I met him the next day, and he was not ready to make payment. I now began to doubt his promi[s]es, and blame my[s]elf for the delusions of hope. By his appointment I met him the third day, on a retired part of the beach, we[s]tward from the port. We now [s]aw a man approaching us. That man, [s]aid the Jew, will pay you. You well under[s]tand, my friend, that your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-454.jpg) \- external link  - Page 231. ] ran[s]om is fixed at [s]ix thou[s]and dollars. Now, whoever gives you your liberty, really pays you that [s]um. I have engaged the per[s]on, who is approaching, and who is the ma[s]ter of a [s]mall ve[s][s]el, to tran[s]port you to Gibraltar, whence you may find your way home. The man now joined us and confirmed the words of the Jew, for whom he profe[s][s]ed a great friendship. It was concluded, that I [s]hould come to that [s]pot immediately after dark, where I [s]hould find a [s]mall boat waiting to carry me on board the ve[s][s]el. The ma[s]ter of the ve[s][s]el declaring, that he run a great ri[s]k, in a[s][s]i[s]ting in my e[s]cape; but was willing to do it out of commiseration for me, and friend[s]hip for the Jew; and reminded me, that I had better pack up all my property, and bring it with me. I ha[s]tened home with the Jew, and collected all the property I could with propriety call my own; which con[s]i[s]ted of a few clothes, and to the amount of three [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-455.jpg) \- external link  - Page 232. ] hundred and twenty dollars in ca[s]h. As [s]oon as it was dark, the Jew accompanied me to the beach, and then took an affectionate leave of me, pre[s]enting me with the value of ten dollars, as a loan, gravely remarking, that now I owed him three thousand and ten dollars, which he hoped I would tran[s]port to him as [s]oon as I arrived in America. The Jew quitted me, and I [s]oon di[s]covered the approach of the boat, which I [s]tept into with a light heart, congratulating my[s]elf, that I was again A FREE MAN. The boat [s]oon rowed along [s]ide of a ve[s][s]el, that was laying to for us. I jumped on board, and was directly [s]eized by two men, who bound me and hurried me below deck; and, after robbing me of all my property, left me in the dark to my own reflections. I had been [s]o long the [s]port of cruel fortune, that the[s]e were not [s]o [s]evere, as my sympathising readers may conjecture. Repeated misfortunes blunt [s]en[s]ibility. I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-456.jpg) \- external link  - Page 233. ] perceived that I had been played a villanous trick, and exchanged a tolerable [s]lavery, for one perhaps more insupportable; but [s]hould have been perfectly resigned to my fate, if the dread of being returned to Algiers and [s]uffering the dreadful puni[s]hment, already related, had not pre[s]ented it[s]elf. In the morning, I reque[s]ted to [s]ee the captain; and, by his orders, was brought upon deck; to my [s]urpri[s]e, it was not the [s]ame per[s]on who had decoyed me on board. I was confounded. I intended to have expostulated; but could I tell a [s]tranger, a man, who appeared a Mu[s][s]ulman by his garb, that I was a runaway [s]lave? While I was perplexing my[s]elf what to [s]ay, the man, who had decoyed me on board, appeared. He was a pa[s][s]enger, and claimed me as his [s]lave, having purcha[s]ed me, as he [s]aid, for four hundred zequins of a Jew, my former ma[s]ter, and meant to carry me with him to Tunis. I was now awakened to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-457.jpg) \- external link  - Page 234. ] all the horrours of my [s]ituation. I dared not irritate my new ma[s]ter by contradictions, and acquie[s]ced in his [s]tory in dumb de[s]pair. On the eighth day, after we departed from Scandaroon, the ve[s][s]el made cape Bona, and expected [s]oon to anchor in the port of Tunis. My ma[s]ter had a Portugue[s]e [s]lave on board, who [s]lept in the birth with me. He [s]poke a little broken Engli[s]h, having been formerly a [s]ailor on board a ve[s][s]el of that nation. He gave me the mo[s]t alarming apprehen[s]ions of the cruelty of our master, but flattered me by [s]aying that the Tuni[s]e in general were more mild with their [s]laves than the Algerines, and allowed a freer intercour[s]e with the European merchants; and, by their interference, we might obtain our liberty. While my fellow [s]lave [s]lept, I lay agonizing with the dread of entering the port of Tunis. Often did I wi[s]h that [s]ome friendly rock or kindly leak would [s]ink me, and my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-458.jpg) \- external link  - Page 235. ] misfortunes, in perpetual oblivion; and I was nigh being gratified in my desperate wi[s]hes; for, the [s]ame night, a tremendous [s]torm aro[s]e, and the gale [s]truck us with [s]uch violence, that our [s]ails were in[s]tantly flittered into rags. We could not [s]hew a yard of canva[s]s, and were obliged to [s]cud under bare poles. The night was exce[s][s]ively dark; and, to increase our di[s]tre[s]s, our balla[s]t [s]hifted and we were obliged to cut away our ma[s]ts by the board, to [s]ave us from foundering. The ve[s][s]el righted, but being [s]trong and light, and the hatchways being well secured, our captain was only fearful of being driven on [s]ome chri[s]tian coa[s]t. The next night, the wind lulled; and the morning after, the [s]un aro[s]e clear, and we found our[s]elves off the coa[s]t of Sardinia, and within gun [s]hot of an armed ve[s][s]el. She proved to be a Portugue[s]e frigate. To the confu[s]ion and di[s]may of our captain and pa[s][s]enger, and to the great [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-459.jpg) \- external link  - Page 236. ] joy of my[s]elf and fellow [s]lave. The frigate hoi[s]ted her colours, manned her boats, and boarded us. No [s]ooner was his national flag di[s]played, than the overjoyed Portugue[s]e ran below and liberated me from my fetters, hugged me in raptures, and hauling me upon deck, the fir[s]t man we met was our ma[s]ter, whom he [s]aluted with a kick, and then [s]pit in his face. I mu[s]t confe[s]s that this rever[s]e of fortune made me feel for the wretched Mussulman, who [s]tood quivering with apprehensions of in[s]tant death; nor could I refrain from preventing the Portugue[s]e from avenging him[s]elf for the cruelties, he had [s]uffered, under this barbarian. The boats [s]oon boarded us, and [s]ecured the captain and crew, whom they treated with as much bitter contempt, as my fellow had exerci[s]ed toward our late ma[s]ter. This poor fellow [s]oon introduced me to his countrymen, with a brief account of my country and misfortunes. How glorious now, how changed [s]ince ye[s]terday. Anon . ARGUMENT. Conclu[s]ion .

I was then [s]ent on board the frigate. The captain expre[s][s]ed much joy, at being the means of my deliverance, and told me, that the Portugue[s]e had a [s]incere regard for the Americans; and that he had received expre[s]s orders to protect our commerce from the Barbary cor[s]airs. The pri[s]oners were brought on board and confined below; and, after every thing valuable was taken from the prize, the [s]hip [s]tood for the [s]traits of Gibraltar, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-461.jpg) \- external link  - Page 238. ] leaving a boat to fire the Tuni[s]e ve[s][s]el. I never received more civility than from the officers of this frigate. In compliment to them, I was obliged to throw my Mahometan dre[s]s over the [s]hip's [s]ide; for they furni[s]hed me with every nece[s][s]ary, and many ornamental articles of European clothing. The [s]urgeon was particularly attentive. I lent him [s]ome a[s][s]i[s]tance among the [s]ick, his mate being unwell; and, among other pre[s]ents, he gave me a hand[s]ome pocket ca[s]e of [s]urgical instruments. After a plea[s]ant voyage, we anchored in port Logos, in the [s]outhern extremity of Portugal. Here I received the agreeable intelligence, that the United States were about commencing a treaty with the Dey of Algiers, by the agency of Jo[s]eph Donald[s]on, jun. E[s]q; which would liberate my unhappy fellow citizens, and [s]ecure the American commerce from future depredations. Without landing, I had the good fortune to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-462.jpg) \- external link  - Page 239. ] obtain a pa[s][s]age on board an Engli[s]h merchantman, bound for Bri[s]tol, Captain Jo[s]eph Joceline, commander. We had a pro[s]perous voyage to the land's end; and, very fortunately for me, ju[s]t off the little i[s]le of Lundy, [s]pake with a brigantine, bound to Che[s]apeak Bay, Captain John Harris, commander. In thirty two days, we made Cape Charles, the north chop of the Che[s]apeak, and I prevailed upon the captain to [s]et me on [s]hore; and, on the third day of May, one thou[s]and [s]even hundred and ninety five, I landed in my native country, after an ab[s]ence of [s]even years and one month; about [s]ix years of which I had been a [s]lave. I purcha[s]ed a hor[s]e, and ha[s]tened home to my parents, who received me as one ri[s]en from the dead. I [s]hall not attempt to de[s]cribe their emotions, or my own raptures. I had [s]uffered hunger, [s]ickne[s]s, fatigue, in[s]ult, [s]tripes, wounds, and every other cruel injury; and was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-463.jpg) \- external link  - Page 240. ] now under the roof of the kinde[s]t and tenderest of parents. I had been degraded to a [s]lave, and was now advanced to a citizen of the free[s]t country in the univer[s]e. I had been lo[s]t to my parents, friends, and country; and now found, in the embraces and congratulations of the former, and the rights and protection of the latter, a rich compen[s]ation for all pa[s]t mi[s]eries. From [s]ome minutes I pre[s]erved, I compiled the[s]e memoirs; and, by the solicitations of [s]ome re[s]pectable friends, have been induced to [s]ubmit them to the public. A long di[s]u[s]e of my native tongue, will apologize to the learned reader for any inaccuracies. I now mean to unite my[s]elf to [s]ome amiable woman, to pur[s]ue my practice, as a phy[s]ician; which, I hope, will be attended with more [s]ucce[s]s than when essayed with the inexperience and giddiness of youth. To contribute cheerfully to the [s]upport of our excellent [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf407v2&image=407-464.jpg) \- external link  - Page 241. ] government, which I have learnt to adore, in [s]chools of de[s]poti[s]m; and thus [s]ecure to my[s]elf the enviable character of an u[s]eful phy[s]ician, a good father and worthy FEDERAL citizen. My ardent wi[s]h is, that my fellow citizens may profit by my misfortunes. If they peru[s]e the[s]e pages with attention they will perceive the nece[s][s]ity of uniting our federal [s]trength to enforce a due re[s]pect among other nations.

Let no foreign emi[s][s]aries inflame us again[s]t one nation, by raking into the a[s]hes of long extingui[s]hed enmity or delude us into the extravagant [s]chemes of another, by recurring to fancied gratitude.
