The sun seemed to shine more brightly and the birds to sing more sweetly for her sake, that afternoon. For her the widow put on her handsomest white cap; for her the nicest tea-things were produced; and for her the widow's son, in the little workshop at the kitchen-end, made extravagant flower-boxes, and devotedly hammered his thumb. The shop itself was a mere box, filled with grotesque rubbish, --- dog-carts, dog-harnesses, and dog-churns; cog-wheels without number; a wooden horse without legs; a native hand-organ, and a hickory fiddle, with other extraordinary and unmentionable trumpery; in the midst of which toiled the genius of the place, with sweaty cheeks and rolled-up sleeves, at his work-bench by the window. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-013.jpg) \- external link  - Page 008. ] On the threshold of the shop-door sat Lucy, watching Archy at his work, or looking out upon the pleasant orchard; but always, whatever else she did, charming away the young man's heart with those tender hazel eyes and soft brown curls, on which the checkered sunshine flickered. The tea ready, Mrs. Brandle came smilingly to announce it. Lucy was lost in revery at the moment; her eyes, full of dreams, gazing farther away than Archy or the orchard: but she looked up quickly, and shook her sunny curls. "Why, Mrs. Brandle," she said, "you never told me what a genius our Archy is!" The simple widow regarded the awkward and blushing youth with a look full of fondness and maternal pride. "He takes arter his father, Miss Arlyn. His father was a master-hand to be always contrivin' somethin' or other no mortal ever thought on. Ever sence Archy was a baby, he has been jes' so famous for putterin'; and there's no end to the time he has spent and the property he has destroyed follerin' his bent." "Oh, pshaw!" said Archy modestly: "I ain't so bad as that!" "He has been telling me about his flying-machine," said Lucy; "and he has promised me a ride in it, if he can ever get it to go. Only think of flying, Mrs. Brandle!" Archy grinned, and turned over a flower-box to hide his blushes. "I consider it a good idee myself," remarked the widow. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-014.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] "Archy's idees are gener'ly good. The trouble is, he can't always make 'em work jest to suit him. There was his improved clo'es-dryer: it was a very good idee; and I thought a great deal on't, till it fell into the fire one day, and burnt up a hull week's washin'. His new lever pump was very ingenious; but then he never could make it pump arter he got it into the well. Then there was his Yankee cutting-box: he cut off two fingers in that" --- "Come, don't tell about that!" interposed Archy, putting one hand behind him. "While he was laid up with his hand," continued the widow, good-humoredly laughing in sympathy with their visitor, "he studied up a dog-churn to save labor." "Don't mention that thing!" pleaded Archy. "Oh, yes!" cried Lucy, delighted. "How did the dog-churn succeed?" "He worked long enough at it to churn all the butter in town one season!" said the good woman, glad to entertain her guest, even at the risk of annoying her beloved Archy. "Then it took him a month to train Carlo." "Wal, such a stupid dog as that!" "Finally he got him perty well larnt: but, when he was in the churn, somebody had to stand by and whip him all the time to make him go; and you know it wouldn't be my way to do that, when I could take hold and bring the butter enough sight quicker myself. One mess, Carlo was two days churnin'; the next he e't up when my back was turned; and, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-015.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] when Archy insisted on tryin' him agin, he tipped the churn over, and made the awfulest muss, --- got the cream all over him, and run with it all over the house!" --- Here Archy took to flight, and left Lucy suffocating with laughter. "I believe," said the widow, wiping away tears of merriment from her eyes with her apron, "I come to call you to tea; but you got me to talkin', and I never know when to stop. Poor boy! he can't bear to hear about that dog-churn!" She led the way to the kitchen, where the tea-table was set, and a detachment of sunbeams from the waving pear-branches by the window danced like a troop of fairies on the white cloth and cheery dishes of the little banquet, of which they had playfully taken possession in her absence. There was the little tea-tray in its place, where many and many a time, for years, it had graced the board at which she and her lamented husband sat down, until the sight of its worn japan and battered rim was dearer to the widow's eyes than the gayest salver would have been, all of silver or gold. Mrs. Brandle brought the little black tea-pot from the hearth, and placed it upon the tray. Beside it were three white cups and three white saucers, set into each other, and covered by a snowy napkin. There was an old-fashioned sugar-bowl standing by an old-fashioned milk-mug, both looking like an aged married couple that had lived together happily for a great while, and were quite contented. Then there were the brightest knives in the village, for Mrs. Brandle was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-016.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] a famous scourer; one by each plate, like a sword under the rim of a shield. One of the fairy sunbeams had the audacity to dance upon the very edge of one of these shining blades. Others of the merry troop were capering upon the slices of white bread, the golden butter, and the dishes of cookies and preserves. There was a great fluttering among the intruders when the company sat down; the pear-branches rustling to give them warning. About half of them ventured to remain on the table, while the rest flew to Archy's head, on which they played fantastically, as if leaping and clapping their hands with glee at his grinning bashfulness. With the beautiful and admired Lucy sitting opposite him, talking and laughing with the most graceful condescension, the village genius could only look at her and listen to her, and blush and stammer when she looked at him. It is not probable that he had any distinct consciousness of tasting food that night, or was even aware that he stirred his tea with his knife, ate sauce with his fingers, and bread and butter with a spoon. While the youth's cup of bliss was mixed half and half with painful diffidence, his mother's overflowed with unalloyed happiness. She knew how ardently Archy loved Lucy, and felt a warm hope that Lucy had become interested in him. The young girl's occasional fits of abstraction, pensiveness, and sighs, were undoubted symptoms of love; and who so likely to be the object of her affection as that paragon of excellence and prodigy of talent, the widow's darling son? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-017.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] Poor Mrs. Brandle did not consider that nobody else ever saw with a mother's eyes, but thought only of the joy of having so sweet a companion sitting there at every meal, rendering unspeakably happy Archy, who worshipped her so, and filling the house with the charm of her loveliness. The widow resolved to give her son some practical advice on the subject before he set out to escort Lucy home; and accordingly followed him to the workshop when he went to get the flower-boxes. "Now is your chance, my son!" she whispered. "My chance?" repeated Archy, with an earnest, hopeful look. "Yes, my son. Remember the old adage, --- `Happy's the wooing that's not long a-doing.'" "O ma! you don't mean" --- "Come, you musn't be bashful now," --- the widow smiled encouragingly. "Be bold as a lion. Tell her you love her!" "I dasn't!" said the agitated Archy. "Don't seem as though I ever could mention it to her! But I do!" --- and the tears came into his eyes. "You musn't cry and appear down-hearted. Chirk up, my son. Remember the old saying, --- `Be as merry as you can; for love ne'er delights in a sorrowful man.' You don't know the natur' o' these gals as well as I do." "But you don't re'lly think, though, she's any notion arter me, do ye?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-018.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] "I'm satisfied on't, child! I can tell! But she never'll have you in the world if you hang back in this way. Now, don't you leave her to-night till you've popped the question." "Oh, if I only das't to!" replied Archy. "Sposen anybody should hear?" "Watch your chance, my son. It'll be a good time when you're goin' over the bridge. If anybody happens along, you can kind o' throw a stun into the water, and make believe you see a mud-turtle or somethin', and so have an excuse to stop. She ain't a bit happy there to hum with her Aunt Pinworth's folks; and I hain't a doubt but she'll jump at the chance to come and live here. Now, promise you'll do as I say." Archy promised, although with fear and trembling; and the widow returned to the kitchen in order to speak a few words in praise of her son, and prepare Lucy's mind for what was coming. "He's got jest one of the best dispositions under the sun, Miss Lucy; and we're jest as happy as we can be here together, as you see. But I suppose we sha'n't always live alone. `Wives must be had, be they good or bad,' says the proverb. I hope Archy will git a good one; for he desarves one, if anybody does in this world!" "Indeed he does!" said the sympathizing Lucy, not suspecting the artful mother's design. "`Little farm well tilled, little house well filled, little wife well willed,' --- that's Archy's idee. He'll make jest the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-019.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] most indulgentest husband now, Lucy," continued the widow, growing familiar; when Archy, entering with the flower-boxes, put an end to the eulogy. Lucy praised the workmanship of the boxes, but regretted that he had put by his flying-machine to make them; assuring him that she could never repay his kindness. "Oh! mabby you can, some way." And Archy gave his mother an inquiring look, wondering if it would not be better to make his declaration then, when she was present to help it through. But Mrs. Brandle motioned him to go. Lucy was already at the door, appearing anxious to depart. Archy sidled up to her with an embarrassed air; his mother smiling encouragement, and putting out her elbow to imply that he ought to offer her his arm. It was a moment of extreme trial to the suffering genius. "Take my arm?" he faltered; at the same moment dropping one of the flower-boxes. Stooping to pick that up, he dropped the other; and, looking hastily to see if Lucy was laughing at him, he dropped them both. "Thank you, Archy," said Lucy with a smile: "you have your hands full, and I can take care of myself." And, bidding the widow good-by, she walked away gracefully beside the humiliated and red-faced youth. Mrs. Brandle watched them with eyes of fond solicitude until they disappeared from sight over the hill against the sunset sky; then returned to the kitchen and her work, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-020.jpg) \- external link  - Page 015. ] smiling at visions of her son's successful wooing and happy wedded life. The breezes sank to rest with the sun. The mill-pond was unruffled, reflecting in its dreamy bosom the cool green banks, motionless and drooping elms, the far-off purple hills, and fiery evening sky. Lucy, gay and sociable at starting, grew thoughtful and silent as she approached her home. Archy almost gasped for breath, coming in sight of the bridge below the dam, and remembering his mother's injunction. He did not have to resort to the device of throwing a stone at some imaginary reptile; for, reaching the bridge, Lucy stopped by the rail, and looked down at the swift-running water. A stream speaks many languages, and can discourse of mirth and sadness, of love and despair, equally well, --- flowing forth frolicsome and bubbling with laughter at morning; murmuring of liquid coolness and sweet rest under the noonday heats; hoarse and melancholy at nightfall; uttering solemn things and dread uncertainties at midnight with mysterious moan; the same unchanging and perpetual strain, interpreting to every season its sentiment, and to every heart its own joy or sorrow. Archy and Lucy stood together on the bridge, the waters rushing over shadowy shallows beneath them; and it talked of love and trouble to both: yet it spoke one thing to the simple youth, and to the maiden far other things, --- hopes and sufferings and yearnings which he could never understand. "Who was that for?" asked Archy as she sighed. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-021.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] "For you, Archy," she playfully answered, faintly smiling, and wondering to think how far the youth was from her, and how near another was, at that moment. "You don't say --- you don't mean that?" exclaimed the genius. "It was for Abner Roane, wasn't it?" Lucy smiled at his breathless earnestness, but shook her head. "Abner has red hair: I never could sigh for red hair, Archy!" Archy sifted sand through a crack of the bridge with his foot, not knowing what next to say. The sand spilled into the stream; and the stream talked on the same, wild and dark, and prophetic of griefs, yet far different griefs, to both. Archy had to think of all his mother had said to him before he could gain courage to add, --- "If I re'lly thought that was for me, I --- I should feel I was the luckiest feller: the flyin'-machine wouldn't be a circumstance!" "Nonsense, Archy!" laughed his companion; but his face was full of emotion that surprised and touched her. "Ah, Archy!" she said, laying her hand kindly upon his shoulder, "you are an honest boy, and you have a good heart, if you are not very smart! We will always be good friends!" The serious shades of evening closing around, together with what the water said to her, had softened her eyes and voice to a strange tenderness, which Archy hoped was tenderness for him. "I do love you!" he burst forth, his eyes glistening [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-022.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] with honest tears. "I can't help it, and I may as well mention it; though I know I ain't any thing that you should care for me!" And down went the flower-boxes on the bridge, and down got Archy to pick them up; where, finding himself on his knees in a convenient posture, he remained to plead his cause. "There, there, Archy! get up quick!" cried Lucy; and as he scrambled to his feet, thinking somebody was coming, she once more laid her gentle and consoling hand upon his shoulder. "Never do such a thing, nor think of such a thing, again, Archy!" "I knowed you wouldn't have me, or I might have knowed!" said the wretched genius, hanging his head. "Don't be put out 'cause I mentioned it: I won't agin. I know I'm a fool!" "And so you are, dear, good Archy!" said Lucy, in a tone so full of sympathy and pity, that the poor fellow, quite overcome, burst into tears. "Come, now, cheer up, Archy: let us be friends as before." "I'll always be your friend, if you'll let me!" exclaimed Archy. "I'll do any thing for you; only let me know if ever you wa-want me" --- chokingly over his sleeve. She waited for him to dry his tears, talking to him cheeringly; then said she would see how much he was willing to do for her. "I've a letter I want you to carry," --- taking one from her bosom. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-023.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] "O, I'll --- I'll carry it!" said the eager Archy. "I don't want anybody to know about it: for that reason, I trust you with it," Lucy added, placing it in his hand. "Carry it" --- in a faint voice --- "to Guy Bannington!" Archy recoiled, holding the letter from him. "Why, Archy, won't you take it?" "O Lucy!" he murmured, with a look of astonishment and distress. "Guy Bannington! --- that bad young man!" "What do you know about Guy Bannington?" cried Lucy, irritated. "Give me back the letter!" "I'll carry it, if you say so: only, you know, he's the wust young man in the county, everybody says." "And what everybody says you believe, simpleton!" said Lucy impatiently. "Give it to me!" "No; I'll take it: I said I would. But why didn't you tell us what you come over to our house for?" "Why, Archy, what do you mean?" "'Cause, I know now, you don't care no more for ma or me than noth'n; and you never would have come if 't hadn't been for gittin' me to carry this letter." Lucy blushed crimson; for the simple genius, out of the anguish of his soul, as geniuses are said to do, had spoken the living truth. "Very well!" said Lucy coldly; "if you think so, you will never wish to see me again: and I cannot keep the boxes, nor let you carry the letter." "Now, don't be put out!" implored the widow's son, quite [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-024.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] crushed by her resentment. "I didn't mean it. 'Tain't none of my business who you write to. You know better'n I do 'bout Guy; for you're enough sight smarter'n I be, I know!" And he entreated so earnestly to be permitted to show his devotion by conveying the missive, that Lucy could not well refuse him had she wished to. "Good-night, then, Archy. I can go alone the rest of the way, and carry the boxes." And, dismissing him with a kind word he never forgot, she lingered there in the shadows on the bridge, listening to the prophetic waters; while Archy hurried away, clasping tight the letter, and blistering it with his tears. ARCHY'S ADVENTURES. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-025.jpg) \- external link  - Page 020. ] BACK through the village went the discarded lover on his miserable errand. Up a long, lonesome road he turned, over the hills. A clear moon shone in the heavens; the village below him lay deep down in the dewy valley; while, before him, solemn mountains lifted their silent crags in the misty distance. A group of Lombardy poplars, away on the left, reared their gloomy tops above the surrounding foliage, and guided Archy to the house he was to visit. The poplars fronted a cross-road, and bordered an avenue leading up to a large brown mansion-house in the midst of shady grounds. Over sleeping fruit-trees and still garden-walks lay the white mantle of the moonshine: a fountain trickled musically somewhere, not far off; and, all around, the air was fragrant with the breath of flowers. Poor Archy's heart swelled with a tumult of conflicting emotions as he walked in among the great gloomy poplars, bearing Lucy's letter. There in that fine house lived her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-026.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] lover, heir to all this magnificent estate: what was he, then, a poor widow's son, ever to think of loving her? But Guy was a wild youth, and her intercourse with him was secret; and maybe he would break her heart, as it was said he had broken more than one poor heart before: thinking of which, Archy's soul was filled with bitterness and burning jealousy; and he felt, in his hatred of Guy, that he could bind him to his flying-machine (if it was only finished), and send him up into eternal clouds, without mercy. As he approached, however, his hate was changed to fear. He had always felt an instinctive dread of grand folks generally, and of the Banningtons in particular. The colonel was a terrible man, with frightful paralytic limbs; and Guy was a reckless fellow, who kept a number of large fierce dogs, which Archy looked and hearkened for now, pausing among the poplars with thrills of terror. But the dogs were chained in their kennels that summer night. No savage growl or sudden onset of wolfish brutes leaping out from shadowy places threatened the timorous letter-bearer. He hastened to a side-door, where he saw a light, and was admitted by the housekeeper. He had escaped the dogs; but now Guy, scarcely less formidable, was to be confronted. In a small library-room, furnished with richly carved bookcases, the walls hung with pictures, and fantastically adorned with implements and insignia of war and sport, --- horse-pistols, foils, rifles, spurs, a short sword, a long sword, a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-027.jpg) \- external link  - Page 022. ] military sash and plume, --- in a great arm-chair luxuriantly reposing, a cigar in his mouth, wreaths of smoke about his head, and a book lying open in the lamplight beside him, Archy found his dreaded rival. A well-proportioned youth, with a broad, shapely head covered by a mass of carelessly tossed, wavy brown hair; eyebrows strong, and beautifully arched; blue eyes; imperious mouth; decidedly a sanguine and impetuous temperament, but by no means so wicked-looking as Archy's imagination had pictured him, --- such was the proud and ill-reputed Guy. Archy, who had expected to be met by haughtiness and scorn, was almost charmed into admiration by the youth's easy politeness and radiant manner; but, when he saw the expression of triumphant joy that shone in his handsome face as he ran his eye over the letter, his bitterness and burning jealousy returned, and he glared at him darkly from a corner. "Archibald is your name?" cried the pleasant Guy. "Yessir," muttered Archy. "Archibald, I thank you ever so much: give me your hand." Archy would have put out his hand; but he saw that Guy's had money in it, and he shrank back. "I didn't come over here for pay. I come to please Miss Arlyn." "I like you the better for that. But you won't refuse a little present." And, returning the money to his pocket, Guy [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-028.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] took from the desk a splendid pocket-knife, with a diversity of blades, which fascinated the eye of the genius, and proved too great a temptation to be resisted. Archy accepted the gift, therefore, and departed: but, all the way back, the memory of Guy's radiant face tortured his soul; and the knife weighed heavier and heavier in his conscientious pocket, until, arrived in sight of his mother's cottage, he plucked it forth, and angrily threw it into a clump of sumachs by the fence. The sound of a foot on the iron scraper aroused the widow as she sat knitting and waiting; and, with tears of hope and fondness beaming in her eyes, she sprang to meet her son. His prolonged absence had been to her convincing evidence of the success of his suit. She saw Lucy smile sweetly as she accepted him; and for the last two hours she had imagined the happy lovers seated familiarly side by side on the sofa in Mrs. Pinworth's parlor, exchanging tender confidences, and laying plans for the future. What else could keep him so long? And now, candle in hand, she smilingly opened the door to welcome and congratulate him. "Well, my son! what's the good news?" she fondly asked as Archy staggered in. The genius made no answer; but his hat was pitched in an attitude of despair over his brow, and great weights of grief hung upon the corners of his mouth. "Why, Archy! what's the matter?" "Nothin'!" muttered Archy in a cracked, uncertain voice. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-029.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] "Why, yes there is!" cried the alarmed and sympathizing widow. "Say! she hasn't mittened ye, has she?" Whereupon Archy's feelings burst forth in loud weeping and lamentation; in the midst of which, he sobbed out the story of his woe. "I thought, of course, you was talkin' over the weddin' with her all this time! Well, Archy, she ain't wuth breakin' your heart about. She's an unfeelin' coquette; and that's the long and short on't!" "Don't blame her," said Archy, saturating his sleeve. "She never thought I'd be sich a silly fool as to --- to want to marry her!" "But why didn't you come right home and tell me? What kep' ye so?" "I --- I --- didn't feel like comin' any sooner." "Poor boy!" murmured the widow. She did not question him further on that point. Archy was glad of that; for he felt that Lucy's secret was sacred; and, moreover, it would have given him too much pain to relate what he knew of her indiscretion. Mrs Brandle was already sufficiently severe, heaping reproaches and proverbs upon the offending girl. "`A woman's mind, the wintry wind!'" said she. "If you'd been a little more offish, she'd have thought more on ye; and maybe she'll come round yet, Archy. `Foller love, and it will flee; flee love, and it will foller thee.'" "No, she won't! she'll foller somebody else," replied the genius dolefully. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-030.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] "Some rich man, I s'pose she thinks, because she's perty! `Many a one, for land, takes a fool by the hand.' But don't you care, my son. `He that's poor when he's married shall be rich before he's buried;' and there's enough other gals that'll have ye, good as she." "No, no, not as good as she! and I don't ever want to be rich now!" "Come, you mustn't give up so. I'll tell ye what, Archy," said the widow, trying to think of something to cheer him, "you'll make a fortin' yet out of that ten-mile-an-hour horse-propellin' carriage. The idee of havin' a horse turnin' a treadmill and ride is the cutest thing, arter all!" "The horse-propeller may go to grass, for all I care. I sha'n't tech it agin!" "Oh, yes, you will! don't talk so, Archy. And there's the dog-churn: I've been thinkin' we can use that the way you said, --- tie a piece of meat jest out of reach of Carlo's nose, so's't when he tries to git it he'll haf to turn the wheel. Come, we'll git out the churn to-morrow, and try it." "Cant't now," said Archy. "Can't? Why not?" "'Cause I used the wheels." "What for?" "To make that darned" --- "Don't swear, my son," interposed Mrs. Brandle. "That double - motioned punkin - parin' machine," said Archy. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-031.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] "And why don't you finish that?" "'Cause I can't till punkins git ripe, so I can try one." "There was your labor-savin' corn-husker you had last year --- what ever become o' that?" "'Twouldn't work." "Wouldn't work! Why not?" "Cause all ears o' corn don't happen to be of a bigness; which I didn't think on at fust." "But your flyin'-machine, my son" --- "I don't care for the flyin'-machine! It never'll go. I shall take that, and the horse-propeller, and the punkin-parer, and every thing else, and burn 'em all up together!" said the disconsolate Archy. "Well, well, my son," --- the widow took his head in her lap to comfort him, --- "no wonder you feel kind o' down in the mouth to-night. But you'll be in better sperits to-morrow. You'd better go to bed now perty soon, and git a good night's rest. `Airly to bed, and airly to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.' You'll be bright as a dollar in the mornin', I'll prophesy!" Archy went to his room, sat by the window, and looked across the moonlit silent fields towards Lucy's home. His heart was very heavy still. He could not think of sleep; he could not get breath enough to sigh with in the little chamber. But the night was dewy and cool, and it invited him forth. Stealing from the house, he crossed the orchard, and wandered down the road, past the mill-pond, and through the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-032.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] quiet village to the bridge. The river glimmered cold in the moonshine, dashing over dark rocks; and the voice of the waters sounded mournful and lonesome to his soul. He wondered if they had ever sounded so to anybody before, and thought of himself as the only miserable being in the universe. Lucy, he thought, was happy: Lucy was sleeping there in the still cottage, which he had come all this distance with his aching heart just to look at once more, and sigh hopelessly for her. The moon shone brightly upon the white gable, and silvered the lilacs and quinces that screened the lower windows of the house. Archy knew her room: and, climbing the garden fence, he entered softly among the shrubbery, and laid himself down upon the earth, beneath the starry heavens, where he could watch her windows; wishing he might lie there and watch there until his soul sank into the oblivion of that blessed sleep from which there is no awaking. Foolish, foolish Archy, not to know that in a few days his flying-machine would once more have an interest for him, and that even Guy's pocket-knife would give life a flavor! While he lay there, the dull tramp of hoofs and the muffled grinding of light wheels through the sand caught his ear. A vehicle stopped by the fence. A man alighted, tied his horse, and, climbing into the garden, passed within three yards of Archy lying darkly on the ground. The genius crouched and trembled, and listened for dogs; for, as the form moved by him in the moonlight, he recognized the proud, confident, dangerous Guy. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-033.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] But no dogs came snuffing after; and, stilling his wild heart-beats, Archy watched. And now he almost cried out with agony, so bitter was his woe, so sharp his jealous pangs; for, when the wild youth shook the boughs of the rustling lilac under Lucy's window, a beautiful head with curls stole out of the shadows of the chamber, and appeared in the moonlight, looking down into the gloom. The genius crept away, but hid again by the fence, as two forms, issuing together from the garden, passed into the street, and silently mounted the vehicle. Then again was heard the dull tramp of hoofs, with the muffled grinding of wheels along the sandy street; and Archy was alone under the stars. "O Lucy, Lucy! you give your love to that bad man, who don't know the vally on't; and he'll break your heart wus'n you have broke mine!" Having uttered this prophecy as he recrossed the bridge, Archy returned home, and went to bed. He fell asleep almost immediately, and dreamed that a flock of wild flying-machines alighted on his mother's door-yard, where Lucy fed them out of her new flower-boxes; and that Guy Bannington was changed into a dog-churn, but still insisted on smoking his cigar while Carlo was turning him. It was late the next morning when he awoke. The birds were singing before his window, and the sun was shining upon his bed. "Well, my son!" said Mrs. Brandle, greeting him with a cheerful smile as he made his appearance: "you have had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-034.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] a nice sleep, haven't ye? You look bright as can be! I have milked the cow and fed the pig, so's't you can go to work on your horse-propeller right arter breakfast." Archy was touched by his mother's kindness, but lugubriously shook his uncombed head at the horse-propeller and breakfast. He went to the shop in a little while; and Mrs. Brandle, hearing the noise of hammering and sawing, peeped softly in to see what he was doing. He was finishing some flower-boxes commenced the day before. "Oh!" said the widow, in a kind, half-reproachful tone, "are ye to work on them? What's your notion, my son?" "I told her I would finish 'em and take 'em over to-day," said Archy. Firm in his resolution to keep his promise, he put the boxes carefully together, and set off with them that forenoon. Reaching Mrs. Pinworth's house, he placed the boxes on the piazza, and was hurrying away, when a voice spoke to him; and, looking round, he saw Lucy's face at a window. She beckoned him back, met him on the piazza, and gave him her hand. "Ye want me to put dirt in the boxes for ye?" asked the genius. "No, Archy, but to thank you. Perhaps I shall not see you many times more," she said in a low voice. "O Lucy! Be you goin'?" "Hush, Archy! They mustn't hear. I shall always [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-035.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] remember you kindly. Be good, be kind to your mother, and you will be happy." While Archy was choking, and trying to say something, she disappeared. It was all like a dream to him, --- her pale face, her anxious and distressed look, her sweet, gentle voice. Reluctantly he left the piazza, and returned home. "My son!" cried Mrs. Brandle with a beaming countenance, "you can't guess who has been here?" "Who has?" asked Archy. "Guy Bannington," smiled the widow. "What did he want?" asked the genius with darkening countenance. "What do you think? Sich a nice chance it is for you, my son! Col. Bannington, you know, --- he can't walk; and Aaron Burble, that takes care on him and sees to things, has too much to do; and they jest want to git you to wheel him about in his chair. They keep the dogs chained up; and you can be to hum mor'n half the time, Guy says, and git good pay; and the work won't be nothin' but fun!" The widow was all smiles; but Archy's face did not brighten. "'Sfer suthin' 'sides that Guy wants me!" he muttered, but refused to state the nature of the diabolical business in which he suspected that he was to be employed. "Don't you go to gittin' any sich notions into your head," said Mrs. Brandle. "`An easy fool is a knave's tool,' as the old sayin' is; but you're smart enough to look out for yourself; and I don't imagine Guy is half so bad as some folks [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-036.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] say. For my part, I don't see how anybody can help likin' him; for he's jest as perlite as he can be." That was gall to Archy, who scowlingly knocked in the crown of his straw hat over his forehead, and looked glum. After dinner, however, he was persuaded to go and call on Colonel Bannington. The colonel's wheeled chair decided him. He came home quite cheerful, having accepted the situation; reclaimed the discarded pocket-knife from the sumachs; and immediately set to work to construct a new and improved patent hand-carriage for invalids. COLONEL BANNINGTON. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-037.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] ARCHY entered upon his new duties the next morning. He was at first dreadfully afraid of the colonel, and the sight of Guy reminded him sharply of his woe: nevertheless, his occupation was little else than sport. The next day it had ceased to be a novelty, and he did not like it quite so well. On the third day it became a very serious business; and, on the fourth, drudgery. Geniuses do not like drudgery. Up and down the gravelled avenue, and round and round among the garden-walks, all that fourth day afternoon, Archy wheeled the colonel. "Fast!" and he gave speed to the little vehicle. "Slow now!" and they moved round more leisurely. "Halt!" and at the word Archy stayed his hand, always gladly. The colonel was flying from a hungry phantom which pursued him ever, and whether he travelled or delayed, rode [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-038.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] fast or slow, came always close behind him, closer than Archy who pushed, and preyed upon his soul. A restless, middle-aged man, with silvered hair; sharp, attenuated features; cold, keen eyes as gray as steel; an active walker and bold rider once, energetic in business or sport, but now a cripple, with his stricken limbs laid out helplessly before him on his chair, --- the colonel hated worse than death that phantom of Ennui. "It's a good thing to have legs, Archy!" "Yes, sir! " said the genius emphatically, wiping his features. "Run with 'em, and bring my shot-gun!" Archy ran, and returned puffing. "Forward!" said the colonel, cocking the piece, with his eye on a woodpecker in one of the fruit-trees. "Halt!" It started to fly. Bang ! and the bird dropped with scarce a flutter, falling aslant into a bed of verbenas, where its brilliant cap and blood-stained plumage vied with the tints of the flowers. "Pick it up, and call the cat," said the colonel bitterly. He had shot the woodpecker; but he had not killed the phantom, which was, after all, the object to be destroyed. The cat devoured the bird, and the phantom devoured him. "Come, come!" he cried impatiently, as Archy returned from feeding puss and replacing the gun. "Stir your legs while you can! Maybe you'll wake up some morning, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-039.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] find, instead of legs, a couple of logs in bed with you, as I did, --- dang 'em!" And the colonel struck his useless members with his cane. "I was running fast as I could!" said Archy. "I'm some tired, though!" And he recommenced pushing. "A hard way to earn three dollars a week, ain't it?" "Yes, sir! " emphasized Archy. "Well, you do so much better than I expected, I am going to give you four." Archy's face beamed, so happy that it was a pity the colonel could not see it. "Four dollars! --- won't ma be glad!" What he felt was audible in his tones, however; and for a minute the colonel lost sight of the phantom. "The sun is almost down. We'll feed the fish, Archy: then you may go." The invalid guided his chair by a handle commanding the front wheels, and so approached a fountain in the midst of the garden. It was a marble-rimmed basin, with a brazen swan in the centre, holding its neck upstretched, and spurting from its bill a perpendicular jet, which kept a golden ball whirling and dancing in the sunshine. "Now bring some worms." This was the best sport of the day to Archy, who ran to dig the bait. The jet being shut off, the surface of the water, lately dashed into glittering ripples, had by this time become tranquil; and the colonel could see in the clear gravelled depths of the fountain his favorite fish. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-040.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] Archy soon came running with both fists closed; but tripped, and, tumbling headlong, ruined a fine dahlia by his awkward downfall. The colonel's eye glittered, and he uttered an exclamation. "I --- I hung on to the worms!" stammered the genius, glancing, with a ludicrous expression of mingled seriousness and fright, from the dahlia to the colonel. "You are a blundering fellow! How did you lose those fingers?" asked Bannington. "Oh! cut 'em off," said Archy, not inclined to enter into particulars. The colonel held a worm near the surface of the water, till a large trout below began to stir himself, then rose, and with a quick splash took it from his fingers. "Drop one, Archy." A worm fell on the water; and instantly up flashed a smaller trout, showing his bright sides clear above the surface. Archy now got permission to feed one from his hand as the colonel had done. But by this time the agreeable titillation of the previously swallowed worm under the speckled waistcoat of the great trout had rendered him bold and voracious; and, leaping from the water, he not only took the offered bait, but also Archy's unlucky finger, which he raked severely with his fine sharp teeth. This was unexpected sport to the colonel; but it lasted but a moment. "Who's that girl passing?" Archy forgot his finger, and gazed. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-041.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] "A sweetheart of yours? She can't help casting an eye at my flowers. Run and tell her to come in: I've something for her." Archy gasped, and rubbed his hands on his trousers, and turned white and red in streaks, as he went to execute this order. The girl was hurrying away, and appeared to stop reluctantly. "Ah, Archy! how do you do?" she said with a faint smile under her hood. "Mr. Bannington, he wants to see ye," said the genius through the fence. "Guy does?" in a startled whisper, with a flashing look out of her surprised hazel-eyes. "No: the cunnel. There he is!" The surprise changed to consternation. "Archy, I can't see him! What does he want, what can he want, of me?" "Oh! come in. He said so. He'll be mad if you don't!" Archy gave an anxious glance over his shoulder. "Say, Lucy: you know him, don't ye?" "Too well! Go back: he calls you. I will come in." More agitated now than Archy himself, she returned to the gate, and entered. "Forward!" The colonel took a pair of scissors from his pocket, and commenced cutting a bouquet from the flower-beds. "Walk this way," --- to Lucy, who had paused by a brilliant plot of pansies, and was waiting tremblingly. "Are you fond of flowers?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-042.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] Then she saw, and Archy, collecting his wits, also discovered, that he had not yet recognized her; and even the genius experienced a qualm of apprehension, confusedly remembering what cause she had to dread an encounter with the crippled colonel. "Sir --- yes --- I am very fond of them," she managed to utter, looking how to escape. "Do you live in the village?" "Yes, sir." She bent over a heliotrope, and her hood hid her face. "Forward!" The colonel guided his chair round a curved path, and came up before her. Lucy, perceiving that a recognition was inevitable, strove to be calm. "Halt!" He clipped a rose. "Help yourself to any thing I can't reach. Call, when you pass this way again, and Archy --- forward! --- shall give you some." "Thank you," said Lucy. The colonel started. He now observed a grace in her attitudes, and a sweetness and refinement in her accents, which could not belong to the sort of person he had supposed her; and it may be, that, at the sight of those brown curls peeping from the hood, old recollections began to rush upon him. "Where do you live?" he inquired. "Colonel Bannington," said Lucy, "I thought you knew me when you sent to call me in, else I should not have come,"--- turning full upon him her gentle face, full of timidity, pity, and pleading. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-043.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] "Arlyn's daughter!" almost shrieked the invalid, his countenance fading white. "What are you here for?" "Don't forget; you sent Archibald," began Lucy: but he did not hear. "You have come to look at me; to see me with these legs; to write to him how I go wheeled in a chair!" "God knows," cried Lucy, --- "God knows, I am very sorry for you!" clasping her hands with earnestness and anguish. "And my father --- my father would be sorry too, if he should see you so!" "Sorry!" hissed back the sick man, scattering the flowers in his rage. "It's a lie! He crippled me; he put me in this chair; and, if he was here, I'd have none of his sorrow, but his own legs, by Heaven! I've a loaded gun for 'em when he comes: tell him so, --- tell him so! --- Forward!" Archy, beside himself with horror, mechanically held his hand to the chair, but did not push. "Colonel Bannington!" said Lucy, rising above all fear, "my good friend once!" --- and, advancing close to his chair, she stood before him, and looked upon him, all love and tears. "I remember, and you remember too, how I used to play in this garden, and you were good to me" --- "Forward, I say!" --- and the invalid twisted his arms violently. But Lucy did not step aside, and Archy did not push. "You knew me then, --- that I never lied to you; and you must believe me now!" she went on with strange energy, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-044.jpg) \- external link  - Page 039. ] her hood flying back, her color heightened, her whole soul flashing out. "Believe me, my father never intended you any injury, and is not the cause of this!" --- with a glance at the paralyzed limbs. "How could he be?" "You'd better not, --- better not!" threatened the cripple. "Go!" "I will; for, hate me as you may, I can't in return wish you so much pain as the sight of me gives you," with a handkerchief striking the drops quickly from her eyes. "You shall never see me again! Good-by!" And she was gone. Archy began to push. "Stop!" There lay upon the walk a rose the colonel had plucked for her; and he must needs thrust his cane into it, and pierce and tear it, as he had already pierced and torn her heart. "Forward!" Dumb with dismay, Archy obeyed. "And next time I say go on, do you go on, no matter who stands in the way, if it's the Almighty!" "Yes, sir," assented the horrified Archy. Clatter of hoofs was heard; and galloping up the avenue came Guy, gayly mounted, and accompanied by three powerful dogs. Passing the house-corner, he sprang off lightly, dropping the reins on the horse's neck, and sending him to the stables; then advanced to meet the invalid. "Well, colonel, how have you got through the day?" "Curse those animals! They come snuffing around me as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-045.jpg) \- external link  - Page 040. ] if" --- the colonel made a cut at one of the dogs with his cane--- "as if they wanted to see how much of me has died since morning!' "Ranger! Blackfoot! Bruce!" Guy pointed the way the horse had gone before; and the dogs dropped their tails, and followed, wonderfully to the relief of Archy. Angry with himself at having been angry, the colonel gnawed his nervous lips. "I'm just like those diseased poplars, --- dying limb by limb: only with me the life and fire all crowds into the upper parts as the lower parts die; that's what makes me so devilish irritable! You must bear with me, boys!" His voice began to break. "Help me into the house now: I feel the dew. Guy, don't you look so sober: I hate to see you! What's the matter?" sharply. "I don't like to have you whip my dogs." "But do you really care if I strike the whelps?" "No, nor if you strike me," said Guy. Brief, cold words, apparently, yet tender. Guy, aware how it annoyed the colonel to see any one seem sorrowful on his account, had feigned concern for his dogs; but his father understood him, and they exchanged silent looks. Guy motioned to Archy; and, lifting the carriage at the door, they carried it up the steps, and set it down in the hall. "There, Archy, you may go." And Guy wheeled the chair into the library; while the genius ran away, rejoicing at his freedom, but looking back excitedly to see if the dogs were after him. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-046.jpg) \- external link  - Page 041. ] Having secured the animals in the kennels, Guy returned to the library. The colonel was sitting with his back towards the door. A salver spread with tea-things was in his lap, untouched. Before him on the wall hung a pair of paintings, aglow in the soft red twilight: one, a picture of a lady and child; the other, of a military personage on horseback. He seemed gazing at the portrait of the lady as Guy entered; then his head sank shaking on his breast; and Guy, advancing, had a side glimpse of the sick man's face, writhing with inward torment. "Waiting to have me at supper with you?" said the son carelessly, as if he had observed nothing. "I've had my tea." The colonel grasped his knife and fork, his hands trembling impotently over his toast. "Is it you, Guy? Dang it!" --- dropping his knife, --- "how a little excitement tears me to pieces now-days!" And, attempting to sip his tea, he spilled it. Guy pretended to be interested in a cactus that hung in a basket before the window. "How like a great crawling crab that thing looks, with its awkward, jointed, long-reaching claws!" "Guy, can you guess what'll happen next time that cactus flowers?" asked the colonel. "It has blossomed twice: each time there has been a change in our family. The first time, I was married; the second time, my father died, --- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-047.jpg) \- external link  - Page 042. ] fourteen years ago. It will flower again soon: what is to be then, --- a wedding or a funeral?" "I did not know you were a superstitious man, colonel." The colonel again tried to eat his toast, but looked up at his son standing by the window. "You are a tolerably good-looking fellow, Guy." "And I am tolerably well aware of it." "No doubt! Why don't you get married?" "I, colonel?" Guy shrugged his shoulders. "You have sowed enough wild oats; but you have been behaving a good deal better lately, and I didn't know but there might be a reason for it." Guy turned away his face. "I should like to see you bring a beautiful young woman into the house, Guy. I could preach you a sermon on that subject; but" --- The colonel stopped. Spiked and bristling as the exterior of his life was, there were green spots within that iron paling, sacred as the graves of loved ones. Guy turned, and looked at the portrait of himself on his mother's knee, till his tears rushed up and blurred all. "The house has been a barn since she went; and it will be, Guy, until your wife comes. When she comes, --- let me give you a word of warning, --- never," said the colonel solemnly, --- "never, if you love her, give her an unkind look or word!" "If I love her, I surely shall not!" "Don't we kill the things we love?" retorted the colonel [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-048.jpg) \- external link  - Page 043. ] quickly, with a spasm of pain in his face. "But you'll learn that soon enough!" --- a prophecy which Guy had afterwards bitter cause to remember. "Isn't that a woman's picture you carry in your breast-pocket?" Guy started like one who has a fatal secret on the point of exposure. He took a chair, but, instead of sitting down, leaned on the back of it, and twirled it under his hand. "Don't be alarmed. I've seen you looking at it when you thought I was asleep. No man looks at any but a woman's picture the way you have looked at that." Guy began to pace the room excitedly. "What's the matter? Won't she have you? By Jove, boy! if you think of her as I guess you do by your looks, you are no son of mine if you don't get her. Dang the obstacles, rivals or parents or" --- "Parents?" eagerly asked Guy. "Of course, parents are secondary." "But if you were a parent in the case?" "I?" said the colonel impatiently. "Don't I know how much we both need a woman in the house? And I've that faith in your good sense and taste, that the girl that would suit you would please me: any way, I'd risk it. I don't care if she's poor; you've money enough: and I know you wouldn't fall in love with one that wasn't beautiful; though I might object if she wasn't." And he glanced at the lady's picture on the wall. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-049.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] Guy fingered the miniature in his pocket nervously. "Beautiful!" he said to himself, as if half tempted to produce it, and show his father how beautiful. "Then what or who is in the way? Is she already married?" "No!" Guy bent his strong brows and clear blue eyes upon the colonel, facing him boldly. "You are in the way!" "I?" The sick man flashed. "She objects to me, then? She knows what a sharp-tempered old cripple I am!" "No, no, no!" cried Guy, his features charged with emotion. "You shouldn't have made me talk on this subject: we'll drop it." "No!" cried the colonel, with a sharp suspicion of the truth. "Show me that picture." Deliberately Guy removed the tea-tray, wheeled the chair to the window, and placed the daguerrotype open in the colonel's hand. For a long time, Colonel Bannington regarded it without a word; and Guy, watching his features, saw them settle and harden, implacable as stone. "Guy!" --- he raised his steel-gray eyes to the flushed face of his son, --- "the day and the hour I hear of your marrying that girl, I put every dollar of my property beyond your reach forever. That's all. You know me well." "Alas, I do!" said Guy bitterly, with resolute, proudcurving lips: "you are the most vindictive of men!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-050.jpg) \- external link  - Page 045. ] "I am vindictive as Cain," answered the colonel. "Here is your daguerrotype. Do with it and do with me as you please." "Thank you: I shall. Good-night!" And Guy walked away quietly enough, but inwardly furious with himself for having suffered other eyes to desecrate Lucy's picture. A LOVE-CHASE. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-051.jpg) \- external link  - Page 046. ] THE next day, Archy's situation was a sinecure. The colonel was too ill to leave his bed. The birds were singing, the dew was on the flowers, the fountain lisped and laughed, the golden ball danced in the sun; and Archy sat on the marble curb, whistling. The approach of Guy reminded him that he was miserable; and, slipping out of sight a certain pocket-knife he was playing with, he put on a gloomy countenance, and waited. Guy had not yet employed him in any diabolical affair; but now, the genius thought, his temptation was coming. But the young man only wished to inquire what had happened to his father just before he rode up the previous evening; and, having obtained the unpleasant information, he walked hastily to the kennel, released Ranger, and departed, with his canine companion leaping and capering around him in high glee. Down towards the little village nestled in the misty valley, with its few chimney-smokes rising soft and thin in the morning air; through the cool elm-shaded streets, past the mill, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-052.jpg) \- external link  - Page 047. ] and across the bridge, to Mrs. Pinworth's piazza, --- went Ranger and his master. The approach of a caller created a fluttering among the inmates; one running to peep through the blinds, another hastening to the glass, and both whispering hurriedly. "It's Guy Bannington's dog!" "Dear me! how we do look!" "I can't see him in this dress, mother! You must go to the door." "Mercy on me, Sophy! I must fix my hair! Run and put on your" --- Rat-tat! went the knocker. Then all was hushed. Guy waited. Ranger wagged his tail on the piazza floor. After a delay of a few minutes, a tall, spare, prim female, with an air of faded gentility, opened the door. "Mr. Bannington!" she said with polite surprise. "I thought I heard a knock! Will you walk in?" --- retreating backwards with smiling, precise dignity. "Thank you, Mrs. Pinworth. I wish to see Miss Arlyn." The lady's expression changed instantly. "Come in!" She led the way to a small gloomy parlor. "Be seated, Mr. Bannington." Instead of going to call Lucy, she placed herself stiff and stately in a chair facing the visitor. "Mr. Bannington, I am grieved and astonished!" Guy raised his eyebrows. "Can I afford you any consolation, madam?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-053.jpg) \- external link  - Page 048. ] "When I need consolation, I shall apply to the proper source for it," --- Mrs. Pinworth cast a holy look at the ceiling. "I can now no longer doubt your designs upon my niece, Mr. Bannington." "My design at this time is to speak with her a few minutes, I beg to remind you," observed Guy. "Ours is one of the oldest and most respectable families in the State, you are aware, sir!" said the lady. "If disgrace comes into it now, it will be through my niece. She is a vain, headstrong, wilful girl; and ever since her father left her in my charge" --- "Madam," Guy interrupted her, "I'd much rather just now see Miss Arlyn than hear your remarks about her." There was something in his manner, civil as it was, which cut. The lady quivered and gasped a little; then said, --- "I've never objected to your seeing Lucy in my daughter's presence, sir. But she is not a fit person to be your wife, --- you never had any intention of making her your wife, --- and I will not let her be trifled with." Wrath and scorn flashed up in the young man's face; but he calmly measured his words. "Whatever my intentions are, I know that Lucy Arlyn is worthy to be the wife of a much better man than I pretend to be. I repeat, I wish to speak with her; and, for once, not in the presence of your estimable daughter." Mrs. Pinworth rose with a spiteful air. "Lucy is not at home, sir." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-054.jpg) \- external link  - Page 049. ] "Then I assure you, madam, there is nothing to detain me under your hospitable roof," said Guy, rising also. "Will you be so kind as to inform me where she is?" "There's no telling any thing about her since you turned her head. She acts unaccountably. Religious counsel has no influence. I've labored with her in vain!" "It is just possible, Mrs. Pinworth, that your style of labor is not quite the thing. Good-morning!" And Guy bowed himself from the door. "Is he gone?" called Sophy, rushing to the stairs above in elegant dishabille. "Strange you couldn't entertain him just a minute till I came!" "It was Lucy he wanted! So you can just take off that dress again, and go and wash the dishes!" Guy stood upon the bridge, irritated and irresolute. The day was perfectly beautiful. Around the alder-tops, and over the stream, a pair of king-birds were catching flies, --- darting hither and thither, or skimming close to the foam and bubbles; and now, alit, watching with mild eyes from the dead boughs of a bald old birch-tree by the water. Not far above, the mill-dam poured its snowy and reverberating cascade. The air was tingling with sweet life. The pure blue of the sky was set off by dazzling white clouds. Beyond the valley swelled the green mountain-slopes, with forests of billowy foliage, undulating far away to the purple and violet peaks which seemed melting into ether. Not long could he look and listen, and breathe the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-055.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] delicious air, without getting into sympathy with so much joy and peace and beauty. He was considering what he should do, when he observed Ranger snuffing the planks, and moving off upon the sand, with his long ears sweeping almost to the ground. Following to the end of the bridge, he discovered the prints of shoes, slender, lightly impressed; shoes, possibly (he thrilled to think), worn by the dearest feet in the world. Ranger, as if in sympathy with his master, scented the delicate lingering aroma of those prints, and gladly, at a word and gesture, bounded off on the track. Guy followed up into the main street of the village, to an open staircase, at the entrance of which there was what is termed a "shingle," with a cocked thumb and a knowing finger directing the way to the office of "Elphaz Pelt, attorney and counsellor-at-law, up stairs." Then Ranger appeared puzzled; snuffed in and out; bounded up stairs, and returned; until Guy determined to call on the squire. "Where's Elphaz?" he inquired of a red-haired law-student writing at a desk, who with cringing politeness informed him that Squire Pelt had gone out. "I'll wager," said Guy, "it's some young woman that takes him from his office at this time of day." "Shouldn't wonder!" chuckled the red-haired youth; "for there was one here, --- the prettiest girl there is in this town too!" "I should like to know whom you call the prettiest girl, Abner." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-056.jpg) \- external link  - Page 051. ] Flattered by this familiar appeal to his taste from the son of his master's wealthiest client, Abner fawned up to him, rubbing his hands, and said, "I mean Lucy Arlyn!" Guy turned on his heel. "Ranger, you're worth a million dollars!" And, leaving Abner to scratch his wondering red head, he hurried down stairs. Going out of the doorway, he was met by Squire Pelt coming in; a lean-looking, angular man, with a clean-shaven, gristly countenance, barren of flesh, but unctuous with suavity; a thin, metallic voice, disagreeable to the ear; and a pair of grayish twinkling eyes, with a cast which gave them the appearance of winking shrewdly at each other across the bridge of his nose. "What can I do for my friend Guy?" asked the lawyer with overflowing affability. With a hasty excuse, Guy shook him off. "Always at your command," --- Elphaz bowed and flourished, and with one eye (the other seemed looking across the way for a client) followed Guy, while Guy followed Ranger. Down from a gorge in the eastern hills comes a mountain brook, falling into the river just above the mill-pond; along the course of which runs a road, winding between the torrent and the cliffs which shut in the ravine. This road Ranger took, leading his master by waysides still shaded and glistening with dew; under wild banks overgrown with briers, and crowned by dark hemlocks, high up and solitary; amid [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-057.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] scattered growths of ash-trees, swamp-maples, and spotted beeches; and through cool sweet depths of shade, odorous with pines, and musical with the noise of the water-course. In these wild scenes, Guy shook off his troubles. He felt free and glad as the crows clamoring in the tree-tops. Gleams of hope and peace smiled to him through gloomy ways, like the soft, barred sunshine falling aslant, far off in the woods, upon silent trunks and boughs. The course of true love never did run smooth; but his was gushing and joyous as that mountain stream, --- all opposition no more to it then than the rocks that broke the torrent into music and silver. On the wet grass and moist soil of the road he finds Lucy's foot-prints: they lose themselves to sight in the woods; but the hound follows them still. Here she has descended to the bed of the brook; and again appears a footprint in the washed sand. There are marks upon a decaying log, where moss has been gathered --- by her hands. On this broad ledge, that slopes from under the roots of leaning twin-beeches and dips into the shimmering water, she has surely sat down, and perhaps dabbled her bare feet. Ranger snuffs from the rippling rim up to the naked roots which the great freshets wash; then hurries on. At length, he reaches a spot where he appears baffled for a minute; starts on; returns, and starts again, snuffing to the water's edge; then leaps to the dry backs of bowlders between which the current gushes; finds there the scent; and bounds to the farther bank, followed by his master. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-058.jpg) \- external link  - Page 053. ] The way grew difficult now, obstructed by thickets, in which the dog disappeared. Suddenly were heard cries of terror, then a great splashing; and Guy ran forward in time to see Ranger recrossing the brook on a log, and a human being struggling in the water. He rushed in great trepidation down the bank, but felt suddenly relieved when he saw that it was not Lucy. A man in black clothes got up in the channel, slipping on the slimy stones until he obtained a footing. "Brother," he said, standing knee-deep, bareheaded, and drenched in the brook, "are you a friend to humanity?" His plight was so ludicrous, and the question so comical under the circumstances, that Guy could hardly have helped laughing had the man been in serious danger. "If you are, perform the charitable act of catching my hat, which is going down stream." Guy fished out the beaver with some trouble, and carried it across the tree-trunk to the stranger, who stood by this time on the other bank, letting himself drip, and looking melancholy. "What were you in there for?" "The question I was just asking." He shook the water from his nose, poked the wet hair out of his eyes, and put on his hat. "No doubt, it was for a wise purpose. Perhaps I needed the bath. Or --- the meaning of it comes to me --- I ought not to have crossed the stream." "I was afraid my dog had something to do with the accident." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-059.jpg) \- external link  - Page 054. ] "I acknowledge no such thing as accident. The dog was simply an instrument to bring about what was necessary. I was crossing on the log one way, when the dog went to cross the other way. I lost my faith for a moment, and cried out; but he was true to his mission, and tumbled me into the water." And the stranger with perfect gravity proceeded to wring out his wet garments. Guy had not time to laugh; for now the cry of the hound was heard musical in the woods. Under a wild cherry-tree, at the base of a rock, through a cleft of which the brook poured down, her elbow on her knee, her bonnet on the ground, her lap full of mosses, --- seeing visionary things in the bubbling and beaded water, --- sat Lucy; when Ranger dashed out of the undergrowth, and came bounding and barking towards her. She did not move from her place; and there Guy found her, a picture ravishing to a lover's soul, with the sunlight on the boughs above her, the cascade tumbling its foam at her feet, and the hound licking her hands. LOVE, FISH, AND PHILOSOPHY. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-060.jpg) \- external link  - Page 055. ] MY wood-nymph, my Undine!" exclaimed Guy. "Ranger has no such romantic fancies," said Lucy, caressing the dog's sleek brown ears: "he knows it is only poor me, --- no cold water-sprite, but oh! so human! How did you find me?" with a resolute smile concealing traces of sadness. "Ranger brought me: there was never such a hunt. Did he frighten you?" And, kicking away the hound, Guy took his place at her side. "He gave me a start; but I knew you were near." "Were you glad?" "Guy!" The look she gave him was enough, --- full of melting love, and also full of suffering. He clasped her with impetuous fervor. "My child, my darling, you shall suffer no more! I swear it!" She cried sobbingly for a few moments, the pent-up anguish of her heart breaking forth. "It is so comforting to have any one kind to me, after [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-061.jpg) \- external link  - Page 056. ] what I endure at home! But, Guy, --- don't be angry, --- this is the last time we shall meet!" "Yes, Lucy; for we shall not part again!" She nestled close to him, and there was a long silence, --- only the brook filling the woods with its voices. "Let me be happy in that thought a little while." "Be happy in it forever!" "Guy, I saw your father last night, if it was not a dream: I wish it was a dream! What possessed me to go that way, I can't tell: I am always doing such foolish things. I suppose it was a desire to see the old place for the last time." "I know all about it," said Guy. "Don't you care: it is all for the best. It has decided me. The whole world seemed so wild and joyous as I was coming up here, it reproached me for my mean concessions. Lucy, we will be as free as the birds and brooks!" She started from him, fearing his dangerous arguments, and knowing his power. "Don't talk to me now: I am too weak. I have eaten nothing since yesterday!" "What, Lucy! you have had no breakfast?" "I was too miserable to think of it. I heard California news had arrived; and I went to Mr. Pelt's office, in hopes to get a letter from father. It is strange he doesn't write: but I know he has written, if he is alive; and sometimes I am wicked enough to suspect Mr. Pelt of keeping back the letters." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-062.jpg) \- external link  - Page 057. ] "If he had any motive for keeping them back, he would do it!" exclaimed Guy. "A man that was first your father's lawyer against my father, and is now my father's lawyer too" --- "He has eyes that can see two opposite interests at the same time," said Lucy; "but he couldn't be so cruel as to keep back my letters, I know." "You have never received any money from your father yet?" "No; and that's one thing my aunt torments me about. She does every thing she can to make me feel dependent on her charity. I so dreaded to go home and tell her no money had come, and I felt so wretched and lonesome, that I wandered off up here." "I was in that viper's nest this morning. How did you ever live there, my poor dove?" And Guy related his adventure, at which Lucy could not help laughing. "Didn't she want to pray with you? It's a wonder! Usually, when she quarrels with folks, she goes and prays with them, and tells God, in their presence, what awful sinners they are. She is waiting for a chance now to hold me up in that way." "If, like Luther, she can pray best when she is angry, she would have been fervent over me!" said Guy. "How I hate to come in contact with such people! But forget them, to-day at least. You must be hungry: let me provide you a luncheon, --- show you how we will do when we live in that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-063.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] little cottage, and are very poor in every thing but happiness." This allusion to what might be, if she would permit him to sacrifice his future for her sake, gave her less pleasure than pain, as when we have glimpses of a heaven we cannot enter. She sat pondering what he had said, and nursing her resolution in her bosom, --- too tender for a thing so harsh, --- while love was pleading to be folded there alone. Guy left her, to cut from a clump of young maples a slender and flexible rod. He trimmed off the twigs, and proceeded to attach to it a line which he unrolled from his pocket; then opened a paper of many-colored artificial insects, from which he selected one for his purpose. "Here is something," he said, "that will look more like a fly in the water than a fly itself. Are you fond of trout?" "Yes; but I don't really think I could manage to eat one raw." "We'll catch one first, then see about the eating." He stood where the stream fell into a bright basin of rock and gravel. Here he flung his fly, skipped it in the foam, trailed it over the eddies, let it toss and swim on the ripples, drew it up, and let it fall again as lightly and naturally as possible on the shimmering surface; then sent it like a drowned insect down the falls: but to no purpose. "My breakfast seems very shy," said Lucy. "Who comes there?" "It is my drenched philosopher!" Guy answered, looking up from his fishing. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-064.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] The stranger came forward slowly into the small opening by the stream, carrying a forked twig before him above his head. His water-streaked hat was thrown back like a toppling ruin, his mouth was open, and his nose --- a monstrous one --- was borne high in air; while his eyes were fixed too intently on the twig to observe that he was observed. He walked straight up to Guy, as if it had been his intention to march over him. "I seem to stand in your way," said Guy. The man halted, lowering the twig, and, with no more expression in his features than if they had been made of putty (which they somewhat resembled), stood looking at him like a wet automaton. "That fact has a significance, brother! You have something to do with my mission. What are you doing with a rod and line here?" asked the philosopher, without a trace of resentment in his stolid features. "That, too, is significant! The disciples of old were fishermen: greater things than they saw you shall see!" "They probably never saw so great a nose as I see," Guy whispered to Lucy. "The nose," said the stranger, whose sense of hearing seemed miraculous, --- and he coolly hooked the forked twig into a button-hole of his coat, --- "is a feature of great meaning: it is the magnet of destiny. When you rise above the plane of mirthfulness, you will be taught these truths." "Excuse my levity," said Guy; and he gravely took a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-065.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] handkerchief from his pocket. "There is a mosquito on your magnet of destiny." "Stop!" The stranger stayed his hand, and regarded him with solemn, fishy eyes. "What are you going to do?" "As a friend of humanity, I am going to kill it." "Brother!" --- with an awful emphasis, --- "what right have you to kill a mosquito? Persons on the plane of selfishness may begrudge the little drop of blood which makes an insect happy: I do not." "He can afford to be so magnanimous," whispered Guy; "for no mosquito can extract any thing moist from the dry mortar his magnet of destiny is composed of. That one plucks up its baffled proboscis, and flies away empty." And, having changed his fly for one of a different color, he returned to his fishing. Lucy was laughing; when the stranger said to her, grimly, that she ought rather to weep at seeing a brother engaged in such inhuman sport. "He who called the fishermen you alluded to," said Guy, "rather sanctioned their occupation on one or two occasions;" and he played his fly. "He who called the fishermen was a progressive man for his age; but a higher development is possible now." The astounding coolness with which the stranger uttered this sentiment gave Lucy an unpleasant shiver, and she turned from him shocked and disgusted. As for Guy, he was at that moment occupied in landing a fine trout. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-066.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] "Can you witness the agonies of that fish, without emotion?" sternly said the man, without, however, exhibiting any particular evidence of emotion in his own coarse features. "The emotion I experience is a very pleasing excitement, only known, I think, to the trout-fisher;" and Guy unhooked his prize. "What you consider its agonies, are, no doubt, ecstasies of pleasure, occasioned by the oxygen in an atmosphere which acts upon it like laughing-gas. Besides, you must understand that it is out of pure benevolence to the fish that I catch the big ones, which have the cruel habit of eating the little ones." The putty features softened a little. "What do you do with those you catch?" "The destiny of this one is to be cooked and eaten on the spot." "Retribution truly!" and the man stood a long time contemplating the beautifully tinted prize with the unmistakable interest of appetite. Guy gathered dry sticks, and broke them: then, kindling a fire on the ground, he left Lucy to feed it with fagots, and went to the brookside with the trout, which he presently brought to her ready for cooking. "Wait till there is a fine bed of coals," he said, spitting it with a split stick; "then lay it on them. Maybe I can catch another in the mean time." The new fly was successful: the moment it touched the water, a trout leaped, but did not strike the hook. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-067.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] "Ah! you lost him!" said the stranger, eagerly watching the sport. Guy laughed at the regretful tone with which the hungry philosopher uttered these words. Again the fly fell, and whirled in the eddies, --- a silver flash, and it disappeared, the twine running away in the water after it. "You've got one: why don't you pull him out?" cried the philosopher anxiously. But Guy, having with a quick movement hooked the trout the instant it snatched the fly, drew gently and steadily upon the yielding rod; till, seeing the fish was not too heavy for his tackle, he lifted it adroitly from the water. "Ah! you've saved him!" said the spectator with a long breath. The first fish was by this time on the coals; and the odor of the cooking, wafted to his nostrils, invited him to the fire, which he approached, watching Lucy's work with longing looks. "This is a beautiful primitive method of preparing food," he observed, as Guy brought the second trout to be roasted; "and I am impressed" --- snuff, snuff --- "that you will invite me to breakfast." "What! a breakfast of fish?" cried Guy. "Though it is sinful to catch them," said Lucy, radiant over the fire, "he doesn't consider them so objectionable when cooked!" "When I arrived this morning" (the stranger, unmoved, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-068.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] kept his eyes on the fish with a very steady regard), "I was going to a hotel for breakfast; but the spirit said, `Breakfast will be provided.' I now understand that I am directed to partake of trout." "Your philosophy is so accommodating, perhaps it will allow you to catch your own fish. Here's the rod." The stranger looked at Guy, then took up the tackle: he examined the fine hook on which the fly was fashioned, and admitted the benevolence of the invention which substituted for a living insect a dead semblance, but questioned the morality of thus deceiving the fish. A fragrant breath of incense from the roasting, however, dissipated his remaining scruples. "I am impressed," said he, "to catch a trout;" and, adding something about the experience being necessary to him, he went to the brook. At the first fling of the line, he caught the fly in his coat-sleeve; then he threw it into a tree, where it became entangled. With much trouble he got it again, and, after several laughably awkward attempts, succeeded in casting the fly upon a rock in mid-channel. The lovers, glad to be alone, sat down on the ground to breakfast. The fish were placed before them on maple leaves, which served in lieu of plates. They had no seasoning of any kind. Fingers were used in the absence of forks; Guy picking out the bones for Lucy, who, charmed by the novelty of the repast, and assisted by a good appetite, found the rich roasted flesh of the trout delicious. "Ho, ho!" roared the philosopher: "I've got him!" and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-069.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] to the surprise of Guy, who had loaned him the rod to get rid of him, he pointed to a wriggling fish, which, by a violent jerk, he had flung high into a beach bough. The time required for him again to disentangle the line was so much gain to the lovers. At last, he came with his trout dressed for the coals: but it was a small fish for a large appetite; and, by Guy's advice, he went to catch another. In a little while, his "Ho, ho!" was heard again. "The rascal has got another," said Guy. "Isn't it a good joke to see a philosopher, who scrupled just now to kill a mosquito, open his jack-knife, and disembowel a live trout in that cool, scientific manner? --- The fire is down, sir: I'll put on some sticks, if you want to be catching another. --- Any way to keep him at a distance!" "I find the exercise necessary after my bath," observed the philosopher; who might have added, that he found the sport fascinating. He soon brought his third fish, and commenced the process of cooking. Two were soon done, and placed upon leaves; and, with a countenance full of hungry anticipation, he gave his attention to the remaining trout. When it was done, he took it up, and turned to place it with the others: but the leaves were empty; the fish were gone. How could they have disappeared? Neither Guy nor Lucy had moved from their places, as the philosopher himself could testify; and he had been careful to put his breakfast out of their reach. They looked to see him puzzled and chagrined; but he smiled. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-070.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] "The ignorant wonder," --- he gave them a mystical squint; "but these things are not strange: invisible guests are with me!" and he struck a solemn attitude. His imperturbable manner, and the ready simplicity with which he accepted the miracle of the disappearance of his breakfast, hungry as he was, astonished the spectators, who suppressed their mirth to see what he would do next. "Swedenborg," said he, "is it you?" He brought his right arm against his breast with a loud thwack. "Yes, that is Swedenborg! Is Socrates with you?" He struck his breast with his left hand. "That is Socrates! My two guardian spirits!" "A fish apiece," said Lucy; "but your guests must have forgotten their manners, or they wouldn't have begun on the breakfast till you were ready." The philosopher made no answer to this, but appeared to be conversing in whispers with the distinguished guests, who kept his two fists wagging in a rather vivacious manner. The conference ended, he smiled with satisfaction, and looked for his share of the breakfast. During his discourse with Messrs. Swedenborg and Socrates, the third fish had also vanished. Lucy could no longer restrain her merriment, but pointed, with tears flashing in her eyes, at Ranger, who stood a little way off, innocently licking his chaps. "I have watched your three fish," said Guy, "going miraculously down that dog's throat. I didn't prevent the process, thinking it might have some mystical meaning." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-071.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] "It has so! Even this: when I prepare spiritual food for the soul of man, dogs snatch at it! --- and lick their chaps!" added the stranger, with a stern look at the laughers. "If you would cure us of our incredulity," said Guy, "you ought to explain to us these mysteries. I think I understand about the fishes; but what is the meaning of that forked switch?" "This wand," --- the philosopher unhooked it from his button-hole, and instantly dog and breakfast, and the derision of the sceptics, appeared to be forgotten, --- "this wand I cut by the direction of the spirits, who have revealed to me that there is a great treasure concealed somewhere in this region. I have been led up this stream; and, as near as I can judge, the treasure lies somewhere in that direction," --- pointing to a crag of the eastern mountain visible through the opening of the trees. "You indicate pretty exactly," said Guy, "the spot where the money-diggers have been at work." The stranger expressed profound surprise, asserting that he had never heard of the hidden treasure except through his invisible guardians, and desiring information respecting it. "If you will follow the mountain-road," said Guy, "you will come to a large, desolate-looking, wood-colored house, where lives a little old doctor, who has lost his practice, his property, the best years of his life; and his wits to boot, hunting for those fabulous coffers. If you believe in them, he will believe in you, and be infinitely delighted to see you." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-072.jpg) \- external link  - Page 067. ] The philosopher did not stop to appease his hunger by catching more trout, but hurried off at once to find the little old doctor. Guy and Lucy sat by the stream, and talked. They had countless things to say to each other; questions of happiness and duty to decide. Both were tired of acting Pyramus and Thisbe, --- stealing glimpses of each other through a wall which the quarrels of their parents had reared between them, and which her relatives had driven full of the spikes of spite and jealousy. Guy, fiery and impatient, was for snatching Lucy at once from the Pinworth purgatory, and marrying her in open defiance of his father's threats of disinheritance; a generous resolution, and perhaps the wisest. But Lucy said no. "I remember how Colonel Bannington looked at me, --- such hatred! He shall never think of me as his daughter. Besides," she added quickly, as Guy was about to urge his vehement objection, "I know you better than you know yourself. You have no profession; you don't know any thing about getting a living; and you might regret, --- in the struggles, the annoyances, which would come, --- I know you would some time regret, the sacrifice. You are used to a life of ease and pleasure. And do you know, Guy, you are irritable, impulsive, and too sensitive and headstrong to endure privation and care?" "I need the discipline," said Guy. "I am ashamed of what I have been. You have cured me of the wildness [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-073.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] which has given me, I believe, a worse reputation than I deserve. But, if I lose you now, what will become of me? I tremble to think of it!" "You will not lose me. We will simply separate for a time. I will go away, and get my living somewhere; and we will wait, and be patient." "Lucy, I can't! Talk of waiting and patience, when it is heaven with you, and perdition away from you! Oh, this hand!" --- he covered it with kisses: "I will never let it go, --- never!" Thrilled as she was by his passion and his rapture, still something in Lucy's soul would not suffer her to consent to his wishes. She felt equal to any sacrifice for his sake; but she could not permit him to make sacrifices for her. She told him this; and with her words there entered into his heart a great temptation. No way seemed so easy and pleasant to decide the question of their happiness as by one of those compromises of the absolute right which sometimes ruin both happiness and character. Could he not enjoy the blessedness of her love, and yet not forfeit his father's good will? She heard him in silence. She did not attempt to reason against his proposal, but only begged time for consideration; dreading her own weakness and his passionate persuasion, and knowing well that safety lay, not in argument, but in flight. THE LOVES OF ELPHAZ PELT AND ABNER ROANE. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-074.jpg) \- external link  - Page 069. ] IN the law-office of Squire Elphaz Pelt sits the young man Abner, leaning on his elbows, and running his freckled fingers through his red hair, as if to warm them. There are letters on the desk before him, which have come by the afternoon's mail; in one of which --- a heavy package covered with stamps, and looking as if it contained gold-dust--- he manifests a grinning interest. "That's from Californy, sure! Ben Arlyn's writing, I bet! I wish" --- He glances at the door, and listens; then turns the letter over, shakes it at his ear, and tries to peep. "If I was only one of them mediums that can see into letters without opening 'em! Hang so many wafers!" He pushes the package aside, so as not to be tempted by it; and, to divert his mind, takes up a thin straw-colored envelope, bearing the imprint of a well-known express-company. Here is something, now, that might possibly be penetrated by an ingenious young man like Abner Roane. That little [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-075.jpg) \- external link  - Page 070. ] streak of gluten doesn't stick like the absurd wafers that defend the Californian document. Just the moist edge of a paper-folder pressed in there carefully, and --- "Bless my soul!" says Abner; and with a start, as if his fingers were agued, he thrusts them back into his warm top-knot. The envelope has actually shown a tendency to come open. Its lips, curling a little with the strain he has given it, grins at him. Abner grins at it. Nobody is coming. He takes up the letter again, just touches the adhesive part, and lo! --- "What a way to seal a letter that was!" says Abner nervously; and he listens with a wild expression, holding his tongue out, and the gluten ready to be licked and stuck again in case of footsteps. "I may as well just take a peep!" he concludes. But how the freckled fingers shake! and how pale the sandy visage suddenly grows, forgetting for the moment to grin! The letter is hurriedly read, and restored to the envelope; and Abner sits trembling with the excitement of what he has done, and with fear lest Elphaz may come in before the freshly licked gluten is dry. One would imagine it none of Abner's business that the express-company writes to say that a large sum of money has been forwarded from California by Mr. Benjamin Arlyn, consigned to his agent, Mr. Elphaz Pelt. "Seven thousand dollars!" murmurs Abner. An [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-076.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] independent fortune, in his eyes. It will, of course, be Lucy's; with whom he would have fallen in love long ago, could he have seen that such a step was for his interest. But who would ever have supposed that old Ben Arlyn, ruined by his lawsuits with Colonel Bannington, and flying in disgrace after his last fatal collision with that ireful man, would in two years turn up a millionnaire? From a plodding law-student, Abner is suddenly transformed into the most agitated of lovers. To offer himself, and get accepted, before Lucy learns that she is an heiress, is of the utmost importance. He takes a pen, and commences a letter, which he dates yesterday, --- the sagacious Abner! Then in prolix and verbose diction, as if he were drawing up a legal document, he declares his passion. The letter is scarcely sealed and pocketed, when Elphaz enters. Abner's red head is suddenly plunged into a law-book, which fascinates him like a romance. "Go to the post-office?" inquires Elphaz, his face all gristle and no smiles, which he can't afford to lavish on his apprentice. Abner jumps. "Oh, yes!" He gives the letters with servile alacrity, and returns to his romance. Elphaz glances at the letters with one eye, while he seems to be suspiciously watching the absorbed youth with the other; breaks a seal or two; and laughs a hard, metallic laugh. "Ha, ha! got a letter from --- thought he was dead --- didn't we hear Joe Prince was dead, Abner?" "He died in San Francisco last winter, didn't he?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-077.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] "I thought so. But here's a big letter from him. Can't stop to read it now. I was in hopes 'twas from Arlyn: strange we don't hear from him! Keep shop, Abner, till I come back." And Elphaz, full of business, departs with the letters. The red head emerges from the law-book, and is scratched assiduously for a wondering minute or two. "Joe Prince? Well, maybe 'tis; but I don't believe it." Honest Abner grows suspicious of his senior's integrity. "He won't dare to steal that seven thousand dollars, though! Any way, I'll give Lucy my letter, and resk it." Impatient to leave the office for that purpose, he sits waiting for Pelt's return. At length, somebody comes. Luck favors him. Instead of the lawyer, it is Lucy herself. Pale and anxious, she inquires for Elphaz, and sinks upon a seat. "You have no letters for me yet?" Red-head struggles with embarrassment, simpering sweetly. "There is a letter for you, Miss Arlyn." "O Abner!" cries Lucy eagerly, hope and joy flashing up in her weary face; and, with both hands extended, she starts forward. Abner draws his declaration from his pocket, like a dagger, and stabs her to the heart. "You can write your answer if you'd ruther," he simpers; hastily pushes some paper towards her on the table; then goes and looks out of the window, rubbing his hands excitedly, while she is considering the delicate subject. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-078.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] Having waited a proper length of time, he peeps over his shoulder to see what the prospects are. There she sits, not yet recovered from her cruel disappointment; regarding the letter with a countenance in which he sees written disgust, heart-sickness, and his own unhappy fate. "May I hope for a favorable response?" is the elegant speech he has been studying up; but it sticks in his throat as he crawls obsequiously towards her. She throws the letter on the table with a contempt she cannot conceal, but forbears to speak, feeling that the addresses of the most loathed suitor should not be met with scorn. "My prospects are good," whines Abner. "You'll be able to live a lady: you never'll need to sile this delicate white hand," --- which he attempts to squeeze. "Abner Roane!" cries Lucy, "burn that foolish letter!" And she snatches back the unsqueezed hand. "No hopes?" murmured the wretch. "Not a hope!" says Lucy. "O Miss Arlyn!" --- he is getting down on his knees: but fortunately there are footsteps on the stairs; and he has barely time to crumple the rejected addresses into his pocket, and get seated, when Elphaz enters. "Ah, Miss Lucy again!" cries the affable lawyer. "Sorry I can't do any thing for you yet. But don't be discouraged. California letters don't always get along as soon as they should." "And you have no news whatever from my father?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-079.jpg) \- external link  - Page 074. ] Lucy asks in a low voice, but with a certain distinctness, and a steady, inquiring look. The twinkling grayish eyes glance sharply at Abner, then appear to consult each other across the nasal bridge. "Nothing yet, Miss Lucy. But there's time enough. Perhaps to-morrow. --- Abner!" --- Red-head looks up from his law-book, --- "I want you to carry a copy of that deed over to the colonel right away." Abner puts on his extinguisher, and goes. "Sit still, Miss Lucy," --- the gristly face shining with suavity. "You look tired. Any thing I can do for you?" Yes; she wishes to have a few words with him: and Elphaz, listening with polite attention opposite her, and Abner with unpolite curiosity at the key-hole, hear how, sick of her present mode of life, she has resolved to go to a noted manufacturing town, and find employment in the cotton-mills. What she desires of Elphaz is to forward letters to her if any are received from her father. "But you must never think of taking any such step, my dear young lady!" remonstrates the lawyer, leaning affectionately towards her. Lucy shakes her sorrowful head. "'Tis impossible for me to live where I do any longer; and, if I am to go out to work, I prefer to be among strangers." "My dearest young lady!" expostulates Elphaz with increasing affectionateness of manner, "you need never leave this town; you need never soil those beautiful hands with vulgar toil!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-080.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] Abner, sweating at the key-hole, thinks Elphaz must have listened before, and stolen some of his thunder. Pelt proceeds: --- "I have a hand, a fortune, and a" --- he seems to hesitate about making the unimportant addition --- "a heart, dearest Lucy, which I humbly offer you!" Abner groans dreadfully in spirit; for, when Pelt wooes, what chance is there for Roane? But what does he hear? She rejects even the great lawyer! She declines to become Mrs. Elphaz! What balm to Abner's wounds! He has heard enough. He slips away. Chuckle, red-head! and run also; for danger cometh. Pelt, hearing a noise, opens the door, and glances down the stairs in time to see a vanishing trousers-leg; insufficient evidence, however, to convict of eaves-dropping. Closing the door again, he locks it. "Let me go, Mr. Pelt!" commands Lucy. "My dearest young lady!" says Elphaz, who has great confidence in his power to plead a cause, only give him a chance, "don't be alarmed, but hear me!" And with one hand under his coat-tail, gesticulating with the other, and bending persuasively forward, he proceeds with a speech, as if he were addressing gentlemen of the jury, and looking at several of them at once. He makes an elaborate statement of the advantages she will reap by marrying him, and having servants to bring her water to wash her hands; and of the folly she will commit, and misery she will incur, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-081.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] by persisting in her refusal. Irresistible logic; but Lucy is a woman, and logic never convinced a woman yet. "You have forced me to listen to you," she replies, as the advocate folds his gesticulating hand with its fellow under his coat-tails, and smilingly waits for a triumphant verdict in his favor. "My answer is the same as before. Now let me go; for I am tired and sick!" The legal countenance changes, and grows grim with the thought of starving the jury into rendering a different verdict. But he thinks better of it, and concludes to give a specimen of the indulgent husband Nature designed him to be; offers to advance her money, which she refuses; and finally, with theatrical fondness of manner, opens the door to her. Almost weeping with vexation at these insults, Lucy hurries away. Thank Heaven, she has heard the last of them. But no: there stands Abner on the bridge; who, as she approaches, removes his extinguisher, and relumes himself redly in the sun. "Don't stop me!" she entreats. "I am so sick of it all, Abner!" But Abner has a grand diplomatic stroke to try; having resolved to sell Pelt for a villain, and himself for a traitor, if any bid will be made. "Miss Arlyn," --- painfully plaiting up his face, --- "I know something that will be greatly to your advantage to hear" --- "I have already heard too many things greatly to my advantage!" observes Lucy. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-082.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] "But this is positive, --- an immense advantage, pecuniarily speaking. But I cant't afford to let you into the secret without some consideration in my favor: that is," says Abner, "if you'll reverse your decision, and become" --- with an embarrassed giggle --- "Mrs. Roane, I can put a fortune into your hands." "And into yours?" retorts Lucy, sarcastic and incredulous. "I don't deny but I may have been interested," Abner confesses; "but" --- "Not for fifty fortunes would I become Mrs. Roane!" interrupts Lucy. "Now, if you know any secret that I ought to be made acquainted with, tell it like a man, and I'll thank you." "I --- re'lly" --- Abner puts on his hat, and two flames appear to be extinguished --- "I ain't so green as to give you my secret on any such terms, Miss Arlyn. It's cost me something, and it'll cost me a good deal more, to come out for you against --- no matter who, since you're so offish;" and Abner is "offish" too. At this critical moment in Lucy's fortunes, a third person, coming to the bridge, puts an end to the conference. It is Archy. Abner retreats: Lucy remains. The genius has not come to urge his suit in opposition to Elphaz and Abner, but to bring her a letter. "From Guy!" cries Lucy, surprised. After the long talk in the woods, and their many last words [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-083.jpg) \- external link  - Page 078. ] at parting, scarcely two hours ago, he has still something to say to her. For love is infinite; and, pour it out as we may in the channels of language, the fountain is always full and running over. The letter seems to glow in Lucy's hand. She hides it, and addresses the genius; so kindly, and yet so sadly, that tears come into the eyes that worship her. "Archy, I am going away, to-morrow morning, in the early train. I want you to help me. Come to the house at five: nobody will be up then. I am going alone, --- all alone, Archy." She attempts to say more, but her tears rush up; and, giving the genius her hand, she hurries away, and leaves him, dumb with distress, standing on the bridge. Little cares she now for the cross looks of Sophy and her mother. A greater trial overshadows the less. She lifts her eyes above the petty briers that annoy her, to the drearily sighing tree of desolation which seems to fill the sky of her future. In the bleakness and gloom, with tremor and heart-ache, she reads Guy's letter. Such love! --- and she must put it from her! Such happiness reaching to embrace her! --- and she must fly from it! Such tender entreaties, passionate appeals! --- and her heart must seem cruel and deaf! "I know," he writes, "that your deep woman's heart will keep you true to me;" and, when next he hears from her, she will be gone! Oh! has she not deceived him wickedly? What despair will be his! What utter loneliness will be hers! [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-084.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] "Guy, Guy, I cannot leave you! God help me, I cannot!" And she covers his letter with kisses. But, after the wild outburst, her resolution and calm thoughts come back to her like guardian angels, soothing and counselling. The certainty of his disinheritance if they are openly united; his habits and temper, that unfit him for a life of labor and privation; the prophecy of her heart that he will some day regret the sacrifice, if she permits him to make it; the instinctive repugnance to a secret intercourse and a life of deception felt by all true souls; the faith she has that time will untie the knot of difficulty that entangles them, if they will but wait, --- all this comes up again: but, more than all this, something within or above impels her, --- a magnet, as it were, in the very core of her will; and, stronger than the confused counsels of reason and desire, a still small voice whispers continually, "Fly, fly, from this temptation!" Lost in this whirl of thoughts, she quite forgets Abner, and the fortune she has missed; Pelt and his proposals; but not her father. Oh, could she but go now to his bosom, --- large and rugged and strong, but tender as a mother's, --- cling to his neck, put her cheek against his dear rough beard, and cry out her troubles in his infolding arms! Or, since that cannot be, if she only had to console her that big, badly spelled, tumultuously fond letter that came this day, enclosed to Elphaz, the ashes of which are, at this moment, crumbling in the draught of the lawyer's office stove! FLIGHT. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-085.jpg) \- external link  - Page 080. ] BUT, motherless and fatherless as Lucy feels, her aunt is still left her. That strait-laced Pharisee comes to her room at dusk. "Well, miss! this is pretty conduct! Traipsing round all day, and now coming off here to mope! Where have you been?" No response from Lucy: her heart is ice. "Answer me, then!" And Mrs. Pinworth grasps her arm with a vigor of clutch which leaves black rings imprinted. Aroused by the pain, "I will answer you!" cries Lucy, "once for all," --- flashing back her indignation through the dusk, --- "you wicked, cruel woman!" "What? you call me" --- A violent shake of the grasped arm rounds the sentence. Lucy feels a momentary impulse to stick her scissors into the Pinworth wrist. She restrains it, however: she will speak scissors, but use none. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-086.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] "I call you what you are! You know it is true: you know you have been wicked and cruel to me!" "This," gasps the astonished lady, "after all I have done for you!" "What have you done? Have you kept your promise to my father? --- my poor father, who is so good himself, he thinks every one is a saint that seems so! You were to be a mother to me; but what a mother!" "Lucy! --- Lucy! --- how dare you" --- "If anybody needed kindness, or longed to repay it with love, I did," --- and, at the recollection, Lucy bursts into tears. "Oh! why did you make me hate you? I would have been your slave, if you would only have been kind to me. But oh! you have been so harsh, so cruel, so unjust!" "Ungrateful!" Mrs. Pinworth articulates, between fury and alarm. "Haven't I worked for you?" answers Lucy. "And didn't my father give you more money than I have ever cost you? Do I owe you for any thing but injuries? Oh! and you might have made me love you!" she adds in a voice that has less anger in it than sharp pain and regret. At that, down goes the Pinworth relict on her knees to chastise her niece before the Lord in prayer. Lucy can't stand that. "You are not a Christian, Aunt Pinworth. You don't do as you would be done by. You don't love anybody but yourself. You are without charity. Your prayers are wicked [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-087.jpg) \- external link  - Page 082. ] prayers, and I won't hear them!" She thrusts her fingers in her ears: a needless precaution, however; for Mrs. Pinworth, unaccustomed to having the truth dashed into her teeth so defiantly, is too strongly agitated, and perhaps selfconvicted, to go through with the intended mockery. She begins to weep. Lucy is touched. "Yes, yes, you may pray, I will hear you," she adds, relenting. "Oh! if you would only pray with me as my mother used to pray! I need such prayers, I am so weak, so unhappy!" Within the nut of the hardest heart some human juices may be found, if you can only crack it. Lucy, without knowing it, has pierced the Pinworth shell. The rude truth she has spoken could not alone have done it; but LOVE, which gives truth its greatest power, --- LOVE, which burns and yearns deep down in Lucy's soul, and struggles up through every thing, --- LOVE has done the work. "You have misunderstood me, we have misunderstood each other," the widow falters. "Perhaps I am not a Christian; but God knows I mean to be!" with a burst of sincerity in her tones, which gives Lucy a new insight into human character, and teaches her charity. It flashes upon her in an instant, that the worst hypocrite is not all hypocrisy, nor the worst villain all villany; but self-deception, fancied necessity, the entanglement of circumstances, betray them into wrong when they wish to do right. In order to judge them, we must learn to see them as they see themselves, which only God can do, and such generous [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-088.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] and sympathetic souls as have the spirit of God. Lucy repents of having judged her aunt; and there, humbly, tearfully, by the light of the rising moon that shines into the chamber, she asks forgiveness for that fault, unintentionally dropping fresh coals upon Mrs. Pinworth's head. In order truly to humble others, we must be humble ourselves; to conquer, we must be self-conquered; to melt stony hearts, ours must be full of melting fire. The aunt stands trembling and pale in the moonlight. "Forgive me, Lucy! I know I have done wrong: we can't always do right. When I can pray with you, I will; not now. Don't you want some supper?" she asks with unwonted kindness. "I don't care for any: I can't go down now," answers the niece, looking out upon the moonlit world. Mrs. Pinworth is gone; and there, by the window, Lucy musing sits, until, to her utter astonishment, the door is again opened, and her aunt returns, bringing a lamp, with cake and pie on a plate. "You'd better eat something, Lucy." And, setting down the things, Mrs. Pinworth retires again, silently, and with something of her old dignity. Lucy's impulse is to call her back, and tell her all; but she hears Sophy's voice. "I never saw such a fool as you are, mother! --- carrying supper up to that selfish, lazy thing! She don't deserve any supper!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-089.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] Which decides her to keep her own counsel, and perform in silence and secrecy what she has resolved. The long night; the preparation for the journey; the sighs, the thoughts of love, the prayers; the stars setting, the day rising, the suffering soul still watching, --- why dwell upon all this? Joyously as ever sang the first bird under Lucy's window. Clear and sweet and silvery was the dawn; and, at the coming of the sun, all the angels of light and color flew before to curtain and carpet his way. Lucy's resolution was not like the sun, but resembled more the wan and crumbled disk of the old moon, fading to a sickly film over the way she was to go. Yet that way lay her destiny. She had ceased to reason or resist: follow she must that sad and pallid face; though love pursued her like the greater orb, all life and fire. Looking from the window, she saw Archy waiting for orders by the garden fence. At a sign from her, he came upon the piazza. There she met him, dressed for her journey, and bringing out her travelling effects, all contained in a band-box and bag. The genius took them from her. They departed in silence. Farewell to the Pinworth household --- forever! "O Archy!" said Lucy, --- something like a throb of joy thrilling her when the irretrievable step was taken, and she walked free under the morning sky, --- "if our flying-machine was only ready! Wouldn't we dash up into the delicious ether; bathe our heads in the sunshine, like eagles; float off [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-090.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] on that silver sea, Archy, among those fiery islands; and, if we should ever wish to come down, look out for some country where it is always morning!" Although his invention had never been made to appear so poetical before, Archy did not smile. "But," said Lucy, "I suppose cars and carriages must answer till you get out your patent. What makes you so sober, Archy?" "I hate to have you go, the wust kind!" said the genius, brimful of grief. "I'd ruther give any thing!" "O Archy! I believe you are the best boy in the world! I'd stay if I could, if only to please you. What are you stopping for? We've no time to spare. Let me take the band-box." "Oh, no!" The genius held it between his feet. "I can carry 'em." "Then don't stop. Oh, you mean to make me lose the cars, Archy!" "No, I don't; not if you're bent on goin'. I --- I wish" He was feeling in his pocket, --- for his handkerchief, Lucy thought; but he brought out instead an old leather purse. "I got a little money, --- not much. I don't want it; and I'll be much obleeged to you if you'll take it off my hands." "O Archy! don't make me cry! God bless you, Archy! but I have saved a little money for this very journey." "Maybe you won't have enough: you've got to take it!" And he tried to hang the purse on her wrist. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-091.jpg) \- external link  - Page 086. ] "No, no: I can't, Archy. You will want it more than I shall: there, put it up." Lucy insisted; and reluctantly the genius returned the leathern receptacle with its small cash contents to his pocket. He snuffled a little, used his sleeve, and took up the luggage. They walked on in silence. Suddenly he stopped again, with a startled look, his mouth open, as if he had forgotten something. "I'm afraid I done wrong!" "You, Archy? You couldn't do wrong." "Guy wanted to see me arter I brought you the letter last night. I didn't think but that he knowed; and I'm afraid I told him" --- "That I was going this morning?" cried Lucy. "Not exactly that; but you see, when he got hold of me, he wanted to know jest how you looked, and what you said, and every thing; and wouldn't let me go nohow till I had told him sumpthin'. I couldn't help it: I'm real sorry," said the genius regretfully, observing Lucy's alarm. "I hope 'twon't be no harm." "I hope not. Come!" She caught up the bandbox, and hurried him away, looking eagerly before and behind, thrilling at the thought of Guy, fearing he might appear to intercept her, and yet, despite her soul, almost hoping he would. "That's the whistle!" said Archy. "His whistle?" was her first thought, remembering his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-092.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] well-known signal to his dogs. But no: it was the approaching train, uttering its wild scream of warning from afar. "I am glad! Oh, you must help me now!" She almost ran. The railroad station was near. They bustled in: a ticket was bought; the bag was checked; the train arrived. In a whirl of excitement, Lucy stepped aboard. Archy handed her the band-box, and they shook hands. How breathlessly it all happened! "Good-by, Archy!" and she disappeared in the car. The train started, and Archy stood staring mournfully after her; when sudden bounding footsteps were heard, and a form rushed swiftly past, chasing the cars, catching an iron hand-rail, and, with a vigorous leap and swing, alighting safely upon the platform. It was Guy Bannington. THE HOUSEKEEPER'S STORY. --- DOCTOR BIDDIKIN. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-093.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] AT nine o'clock that morning, Aaron Burble was dressing Colonel Bannington; Aaron's wife was shelling green pease in the kitchen; and Archy, sitting in the door, was watching her, with his pocket-knife open, his mouth ditto, and his mind vaguely oscillating between Lucy and a patent pea-sheller. "If the colonel don't want ye, Archy," observed Mrs. Burble in a confidential whisper, "I'll tell ye what we'll do. Soon as Ann Mari' comes back, and Aaron gits away (for Aaron is dead set against her being a medium), we'll have another little circle. Jest help me shell these pease, and we'll be all ready." "Ma says she's afraid to have me set in circles; thinks it'll hurt me. I told her how we sot" --- "Oh!" said the housekeeper, "there's Aaron!" at sight of whom the subject was judiciously dropped, and the two sat silently intent upon opening the innocent pea-pods. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-094.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] "I've got him into his chair: if he want's you, he'll ring," Aaron said to Archy, and disappeared. "He hates wus'n pizon to hear a word about sperits," whispered Mrs. Buble, looking up slyly. "He won't be back much 'fore noon, I guess; and we'll have a re'l comfortable time on't. Here comes Ann Mari'!" A red-cheeked girl of thirteen came running in, bringing a bag of groceries and a budget of news. "Only think, mother!" she cried breathlessly: "Lucy Arlyn has run away!" "Why, Ann Mari', how you talk!" "Yes; and Mrs. Pinworth feels dreadfully! She went to her room this morning, and found her gone: she took with her lots of things, and left nothing but a letter to say good-by. And, don't you think! Jenkins at the depot says he see Guy jump on to the same cars she took, jest as they had started; and it's all over the village how they've gone off together!" "Massy sakes!" said Mrs. Burble, "won't this be a nice mess for Colonel Bannington to hear! He hates the Arlyns so like --- You're spillin' the pease, Archy!" Arousing from his stupor, the genius righted his dish. "I don't see what makes him: I don't see how anybody can hate her," he murmured. "Her father and the colonel was great friends once, you know," said the housekeeper; "and I believe it always happens, that, when friends quarrel, they spite each other wus'n as if they'd always been enemies." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-095.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] "What made 'em ever quarrel?" "That I don't know; and I guess they never knowed themselves. Bannington got Arlyn to come and take charge of his farming business; and for a long time they was jest like a couple o' brothers. But" --- in a cautious whisper --- "the colonel's got an awful temper: I guess you've found that out! Arlyn was quick too, and high-sperited: he couldn't stand nobody's domineerin' ways. So you see 'twan't in natur' 't them two should git along together; and, when they did fall out, 'twas like flint and steel, and the fire flew. Arlyn took a miff, and quit short off in the middle of summer: that madded the colonel. They couldn't agree about a settlement; and so they went to law. Most folks thought Arlyn was in the right on't; but Bannington had the most money, and he kep' the law-suits goin', carryin' on 'em up from one court to another, till bime-by there was a final judgment. It went against Arlyn, and it jest broke him all to pieces. He's a great, strong, big-hearted man; but I once see him cry like a child, talkin' about it. He wouldn't mind the loss of his property, he said, only for Lucy's sake; and he couldn't speak her name without chokin' right up, as if his very heart was broke. It'll be the dreadfulest blow of all when he hears of this." "Of course, Guy'll marry her," said the simple-hearted genius. But Mrs. Burble shook her sagacious head. "A young man that thinks as much of dogs and hosses [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-096.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] and good times as he does won't be apt to give 'em up for any girl: though I believe Lucy is good enough for him, any day; and they've always been partial to each other. But the colonel" --- "He thinks Mr. Arlyn give him them bad legs," suggested Archy. "I know something about that. You remember, all Arlyn's property was seized; and, with the rest, a colt he sot every thing by. Jest to spite him, the colonel bid in the colt, and used to ride it. One day, Arlyn was in the village, and went to cross the street. It was wet and muddy; and, jest as he got half-way acrost, who should come along but the colonel on that very colt, dancing and prancing in fine style, and spatterin' Arlyn all over from head to foot. "`You better take care!' says Arlyn, says he; for he wouldn't stir out of his way for any thing under heavens. He stood with his fists doubled. `Prince!' says he to the colt, `don't ye know me?' "But the colt kep' kind o' backin' around, and caperin' sideways, as you know some hosses will; till bime-by the colonel's boot hit Arlyn's arm. The colonel always said he didn't mean to; but, whether he did or not, that was enough for Ben Arlyn. My husband he was the fust to run and dick up the colonel: he says it happened jest like a flash. The colt was gallopin' away with the empty saddle; the colonel was a-lyin' on the ground, jest where he had been flung; and Arlyn he was walkin' away like a king o' the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-097.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] 'arth. He's a large, tall man, ye know; and with his blood up, and fists doubled, you can imagine nobody das' to touch him. "Aaron helped git the colonel home. He didn't seem to be much hurt, though he was stunted at fust; but he was the excitedest man! And the consequence was, he had that stroke of paralysis; and waked up the next morning, as he says, with a couple of sticks o' wood in bed with him 'stid of legs. But come now, we're all ready, and le's have that settin' 'fore Aaron comes." Mrs. Burble made haste to dispose of the pease, and prepare for the comfortable time she anticipated. Just then, the colonel's bell jingled. Archy was wanted; and, to the grievous disappointment of the spiritual-minded housekeeper, it became necessary to postpone intercourse with the higher spheres till a more convenient season. "I feel as though we should have a setting yet this forenoon," said Ann Maria; "and that somebody is going to come." "Is it an impression?" her mother asked. Ann Maria "guessed so;" and, whatever it was, it received a remarkable fulfilment about half an hour afterwards. A rickety old chaise, with a torn and faded top, drawn by a raw-boned white horse, drew up at the foot of the avenue. There it stopped, and two persons got out. One of them, a shrivelled and seedy little old man, advanced briskly into the garden. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-098.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] "Colonel Bannington, how do you do?" he cried with an air of great vivacity, grasping the invalid's hand. "Why didn't you drive in, doctor?" asked the colonel with icy sarcasm. The seedy little man smiled a droll smile, screwed up his face, and put his hands together with the air of one accustomed to keeping up an appearance of gayety and fine manners on a very small capital. "The truth is, I've a borrowed horse; and my vehicle isn't quite so elegant as it might be: but I've seen better times, --- you can say that for me, colonel." The paralytic, glancing up cynically at the chattering little old man, looked like a modern Diogenes in a wheeled tub. "What!" he said, "haven't you dug up your money yet?" "Well, no, not yet," pleasantly replied the doctor: "I'm very near it, though, --- very near it. Here's a gentleman that can tell you something about it. Colonel Bannington, my friend Mr. Murk, the philanthropist." Mr. Murk, the philanthropist, offered to shake hands; a civility which Diogenes did not notice, or did not choose to reciprocate. "Ha! a suffering brother!" observed Mr. Murk, not in the least disconcerted; and he proceeded to manipulate the colonel's legs, while the colonel's eyes blazed. "Hem!" coughed the little doctor, with his thumbs joined, rising upon his toes: "we have come on what you will call a very singular errand, Colonel Bannington. This [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-099.jpg) \- external link  - Page 094. ] gentleman has been told all about that treasure of mine by invisible intelligences, --- you know what I mean, --- the spirits!" Diogenes gave a snort of contempt. Mr. Murk, the philanthropist, not at all discouraged, then began to thwack his breast with his fists, and make solemn grimaces; whereat Archy, looking on, suddenly exploded with a sense of the grotesque. "It is very singular: don't you think so, colonel? The spirits have told him that there are two mediums in the neighborhood which we must consult. I said I believed there were one in your kitchen: were I right?" And the doctor, with his puny arms folded primly across his epitome of an abdomen, bent over genteelly, with a twist of his long, lean neck, which brought that eager, skinny, smirking face of his into disagreeable proximity with the colonel's. "Doctor Biddikin!" exclaimed the latter with immense disgust, "do you believe that stuff?" "Ah! I --- I'm not wholly prepared to believe it!" cried Biddikin, catching his cue from the colonel. "They can't blame us for being sceptical, --- old settlers like you and me, Colonel Bannington! But there can't be much harm in investigating, can there, do you think? Accordingly, I consented to come and see if Maria --- I think that's her name--- can tell us any thing; with your permission, of course, colonel!" --- deferentially, and with a tendency to rise upon the toes. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-100.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] "I won't hinder you," snarled the colonel; "but you are hindering me. Take away that wind-mill!" meaning Mr. Murk, the philanthropist. Doctor Biddikin, disguising his chagrin, if he felt any, under an airy exterior, rubbed his hands, and smiled his droll smile. "Ah, ha! well said! --- Come, Mr. Murk!" Mr. Murk stood before the chair, imperturbable, with his right arm extended, and his eyes closed. "This individual," he said, indicating Diogenes, "can be made to arise and walk; but he has not sufficient faith: therefore we shall not be able to do any thing for him at this time." And, like one suddenly awaking, he winked his fishy eyes, looked round with a dry smile, and walked off with Doctor Biddikin to find Ann Maria. Archy had to work hard during the next quarter of an hour to wheel the colonel into good-humor. This task was hardly accomplished when Dr. Biddikin re-appeared, bareheaded, bowing and smirking. "Beg a thousand pardons, Colonel Bannington! But could you spare us this young man a few minutes?" "Halt!" said Diogenes sharply. The tub stood still; and, turning his grim white face, he measured the doctor's meagre anatomy with jeering and sparkling malice. "What was your cool remark, Doctor Cucumber?" "I'm not responsible," that seedy vegetable hastened to say: "it were rapped out by the alphabet, ` Have Archy present: he is a medium.  '" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-101.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] "Are you a medium, Archy?" "No, not as I know on!" said Archy sheepishly. "Only I sot with Miss Burble and Ann Mari' twice, and sumpthin' jerked my arms like sixty: I d'n' know what 'twas!" "Couldn't you stop the jerking?" "No! no more'n nothin'!" exclaimed Archy, with a face honest enough even for the supicious eyes of the colonel. "That were certainly very singular!" said Doctor Biddikin. "I'm very anxious to investigate! Shall Archy come?" "Yes," answered the colonel, showing his teeth; "and I'll come too!" he added, to the great surprise and consternation of Doctor Biddikin. And, to the still greater consternation of Mrs. Burble, he was wheeled to the dining-room, and placed in the midst of the circle around the table. "I don't hear any thing yet from my son," the doctor said aside to the colonel. "I should think you'd be damned glad you don't," the colonel said aside to the doctor. "It's a great trial to me to have him gone," remarked Biddikin sympathetically. "It was a still greater trial to have him at home, I should think," answered Bannington cynically. "I swear, I believe I never saw you yet but you had something to say about your troubles with that precious rascal!" "His conduct has well-nigh broken my heart!" sighed the doctor. "This continued anxiety --- I'm in hopes, if there [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-102.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] be any thing in spiritualism, that I may hear something about him." "All please to set up near, and put your hands on the table," said Mrs. Burble, recovering her equanimity. Archy giggled. Mr. Murk thwacked his breast, and informed the company that Swedenborg was present. Ann Maria, bending over the table, inquired if Swedenborg would rap. No response. "Are there any sperits here that will rap?" asked Mrs. Burble, spreading her large arms on the table, and turning her ear to listen. Hearing nothing, she naturally placed her mouth near the surface, on which the raps were expected to come, and called in a louder key, "Any sperits here?" "Are they deaf? or are they supposed to be somewhere in the cellar?" said the colonel aside to Doctor Biddikin. "I don't know, I'm sure!" replied the doctor, embarrassed between his desire to appear affable and the fear of seeming irreverent. Mrs. Burble, intent on calling the spirits, and quite unconscious of the ludicrous inconsistency of shouting down to them, put her mouth close to the table, and in a louder voice exclaimed, --- "Swedenborg!" Mr. Murk's arm jerked; but there was no rap. "Swedenborg!" cried Mrs. Burble: "be you here?" "He is in the refrigerator, or covered up in the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-103.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] potatobin," said the colonel. "Scream louder, Rhody, and you'll fetch him!" A playful suggestion, which threw the good woman into confusion. "There ain't harmony in the circle," observed Ann Maria. Mr. Murk, the philanthropist, whose fist kept wagging in the air, then remarked that Swedenborg was in his arm, but that he would soon leave it, and go to the table. "We had very distinct raps before you came, colonel," said Doctor Biddikin. "Suppose you take the alphabet." A SPIRITUAL CIRCLE. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-104.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] A SOILED spelling-book was placed before the colonel, who took a pencil, and commenced pointing at the A B C's like a schoolmaster. He went over them twice without success; but the occupation fixed his mind for the moment, and it favored silence. "There's more harmony now," said Ann Maria; "a better influence. Don't you feel it, mother?" "Oh, yes! I guess I do! There was a rap!" Colonel Bannington held his pencil on the letter F, and the rap was distinctly repeated, --- a small, soft, concussive sound, on or under the mahogany, apparently very near the colonel's hand. Startled by what he evidently did not expect, he looked up keenly at Ann Maria; whose face, to his disappointment, betrayed no guile, but was full of lively, girlish interest. "Is F right?" asked Mrs. Burble. A little pattering of the same small, soft, concussive sounds, like a dry rain, all around the colonel's hand, was considered [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-105.jpg) \- external link  - Page 100. ] a very decided affirmative response. F was accordingly taken down on a sheet of foolscap by Doctor Biddikin, who acted as scribe. The invalid, slightly agitated, but far from losing his shrewd sense, called for a sheet of paper, which he placed over the alphabet in a manner to conceal it from all mortal eyes but his own; then recommenced pointing. Rap! "E," said he a moment after to Doctor Biddikin. Immediately there was another rap, --- at A. But, instead of repeating the letter, he went through the alphabet, and, coming back, began again at B. No rap. C --- D --- E: still no sound. But, the instant his pencil touched A, the rap was repeated. The intelligence and persistence thus shown in the rap-producing power damped his marble forehead with perspiration. "Ann!" said he, once more flashing his steel-gray eyes upon the medium, "can you see the letters I point at?" "No, sir," replied the girl with simple earnestness. "If you think I do, you needn't pint at 'em at all, but go over 'em in your mind. They'll rap jest the same that way for some folks." Bannington accordingly discarded the pencil, and fixed his eyes on the alphabet, which he still kept concealed from the company. A rap; and, after some hesitation, T was announced. H, E, and R were afterwards given in the same manner. Then the sounds ceased. The colonel, who had lost the run of the letters, called on Doctor Biddikin for the result. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-106.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] "The word feather, " said the doctor, showing his scrawl. " Feather! " echoed the colonel, seeming greatly relieved. "Not a very ghostly communication, doctor. Feather --- in whose cap?" And he flung the paper contemptuously on the table. "Is feather right?" quietly inquired Ann Maria. Two raps, --- a negative response. "Which letter is wrong? The first?" --- No. "Second?" --- Yes. "Try again for the second letter?" --- Yes. The colonel consented to make another trial, and got A. "Are there two A's?" asked Ann Maria. --- No. "Then the word is father! " cried Doctor Biddikin excitedly. "Yes, yes, yes!" came the decided affirmative raps. The colonel snatched the record, and studied it; astounded by the ingenious amendment of a word, which, a moment since, he felt certain had been spelled out by the merest chance. "I were quite sure," cried Doctor Biddikin, "that the knock came before you got to E; and you pointed very fast, you remember." The invalid made no answer, but regarded intently the sheet of foolscap, his forehead damp again. "Is it Mr. Bannington's father?" asked Ann Maria. Rap, rap, rap! "Were your father in your mind, colonel?" asked Doctor Biddikin, who had picked up somewhere a theory that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-107.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] communications of that kind were reflections from somebody's brain. The colonel compressed his narrow lips. "I wasn't thinking of my father at all," he said; "and I no more believe it's my father than I believe Swedenborg is in Mr. Murk's arm. If the spirit --- if 'tis a spirit --- will tell me a few things, maybe I'll begin to think there's something in it. I want first the spirit's name in full." Jubilant affirmative raps promised loudly to grant this reasonable request. They ceased; and no more sounds could be obtained, although the colonel sat for several minutes with his eyes on the spelling-book. The truth was, that he neglected to put his mind upon the alphabet, thinking the raps might come the same. "Look out, Archy!" whispered Ann Maria. "Keep still, Archy!" commanded the colonel. "I can't!" cried Archy, jerking his arms violently. "Sumpthin's got hold of me!" and he began to pound the table in a fearful manner. "There's a very powerful battery in the circle," said Mr. Murk, the philanthropist, with a phlegmatic drawl; "very powerful." "I never sor any thing so extraordinary!" ejaculated Biddikin. "You will see stranger things than this," dryly prophesied Mr. Murk. "The other one, there, will begin next," --- fixing his steady eyes, with a dull fire in them, on Ann Maria, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-108.jpg) \- external link  - Page 103. ] and slowly waving his hands, as if throwing over her some spell. Presently she began to jerk, and pound the table, in company with Archy. "Now you'll see manifestations!" and Mr. Murk calmly folded his arms, looking on with a stolid smile. "There are our two mediums, doctor." "Very singular!" aspirated Biddikin. "Is there no danger? --- Don't it hurt your hands?" to the mediums. "No; but, by gosh!" broke forth Archy in a shaken voice, "I wish I could stop!" There was now observable a striking uniformity between the movements of the two mediums. Archy's arms would jerk, then Ann Maria's would jerk similarly. Archy's head would toss up and down, and Ann Maria's would toss up and down. Then they beat a tattoo on the table, so exactly together, that a listener would have supposed that only one pair of hands was in motion. "Bandage their eyes, and see if they'll do that as well!" commanded the colonel. "'Twill make no difference," observed Mr. Murk; while Mrs. Burble blindfolded Ann Maria; and Doctor Biddikin, Archy. "This thing has its use. There is perfect harmony between them now. You can have almost any manifestation you want." Archy at that moment clapped his hands, and shouted; at which Ann Maria also clapped, and, jumping up, ran, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-109.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] blindfold as she was, out of the dining-room, and through two other rooms, returning immediately with the great family Bible in her hands. "That girl never knowed where that Bible was in this world!" exclaimed the amazed mother. Ann Maria flung it upon the table with a heavy jar; and Archy, seizing it, turned over the leaves like lightning, ran his hand up a page, and stopped, with his finger fixed. "It's the family record!" said the awe-struck doctor. "See where his finger is!" uttered the colonel, his face pallid and wet, and his voice husky. Biddikin adjusted his glasses with trembling hands; but, before he could speak, both the mediums cried out with one breath, --- " Lucius Bannington! " The doctor got his finger on the spot where Archy's was, and, drawing the book towards him, read, --- " Lucius Bannington, born Sept. 2, 1770; died Oct. 5" --- Here he was interrupted by a shout from Archy. "The record lies! Lucius Bannington didn't die: I'm alive now, and hearty! Don't you believe it?" with which words the obsessed youth made a lunge at the colonel, swung him round in his chair, and fell to slapping and rubbing his legs with demoniac fury. "Take him away!" gasped the terrified invalid. "Let him work," coolly countermanded Mr. Murk. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-110.jpg) \- external link  - Page 105. ] "He'll cure that paralysis: I've seen hundreds of such cases," he added, stoical as stone in the midst of the general consternation. "He's fainting!" shrieked little Doctor Biddikin, springing to support the colonel; who, overcome by superstitious terrors, sank down insensible in his chair. Archy desisted from operating on the legs, and, walking gravely aside, sat down upon a lounge; while Mrs. Burble brought a camphor-bottle, and assisted Doctor Biddikin to restore the invalid to consciousness. "There! Take away that stuff! I'm all right!" "Will you go to your room?" asked the frightened housekeeper. "No: I'll see it through. Sit down!" said the colonel. "Shall I dror you to the table again?" asked Doctor Biddikin; and, without waiting for an answer, he wheeled up the chair. "That were your father, Colonel Bannington! Don't you think so?" Bannington wiped his forehead, and sat silent. The circle was formed again, omitting Archy. Ann Maria, having taken the handkerchief from her eyes and come out of her abnormal condition, answered with surprising calmness and innocence of manner, that, if all would be passive, the raps would presently be heard again. "Shall I take the alphabet?" said the little doctor, eagerly seizing it as he spoke; his shrivelled and starved features lighting up with an unwholesome flush.

Instantly there came a loud thump, as if some one had struck the table. The doctor, wildly excited, looked round, suspicious that somebody was playing him a trick. "Colonel --- Colonel Bannington!" he spluttered, "that were a boot: you kicked the table!" forgetting, in the heat of the moment, the colonel's paralysis. "Beg pardon! I --- were it a rap?" "'Twas the loudest rap I ever heard!" said Ann Maria: "wa'n't it mother?" "I guess it was!" exclaimed Mrs. Burble emphatically. "Ask any thing you want to, doctor." "I --- I want them to tell me about that money." Thump, thump, thump! came three loud knocks, which made the table shake. "I --- I confess --- I'm too excited to --- I wish you'd ask questions for me," said the doctor to Ann Maria, --- like a weak, frightened, old-faced child of sixty appealing for help to a grave little woman of thirteen. With quiet self-reliance, Ann Maria said, --- "Sperits please to give their names?" Knock, knock, knock! "Take a pencil, and pint, if you please." With a shaky hand, the doctor went over the alphabet. There was a knock at M; then at A; then at D; the doctor growing more and more agitated, and at length, as the next letter --- I --- was given, crying out prematurely, --- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-112.jpg) \- external link  - Page 107. ] "Madison! --- is the name Madison?" Thump, thump, thump! "My son! --- it is my son Madison!" exclaimed the doctor, jumping up from the table. "Colonel, it is my son, --- my Madison!" clasping his skinny hands, and bursting into tears. His passion soon spent itself, and he was prevailed upon to be seated again. "I don't believe Madison is dead," said Ann Maria in a consolatory tone. "What! not if he is here and says so?" said the little doctor. "Madison, my son, are you present?" If Madison made the resounding affirmative knocks that followed, he was present most certainly. "Will you tell us where you died?" asked Ann Maria, inclined to refute him. "At sea," was spelled out. "What were the cause of your death?" inquired the bereaved parent. "Drownded," said the raps. "Are you happy, my son?" "Jolly!" "That sounds jest like him for all the world!" said Mrs. Burble. "In what sphere are you, my son?" "Seventh sphere!" exclaimed Mrs. Burble, counting the knocks. "How he has progressed! That's the highest sphere there is!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-113.jpg) \- external link  - Page 108. ] "He were a wonderful spiri'chal-minded boy, though bad influences here kept him down. You have better companions now, my son, haven't you?" "Perfect bricks!" spelled out the spiritual-minded boy. "I --- I were never pleased with his slang phrases," said the doctor, chagrined. "Mr. Murk, do you think a spirit in the seventh sphere would make use of that low expression, --- `perfect bricks'?" "These things have their uses," replied Mr. Murk. "The spirit resumes its former character in order to give you tests of its identity." "Very philosophical!" said the doctor; and, with returning enthusiasm, he proceeded with the communications. Colonel Bannington, in the mean while, had his attention occupied by other things. On the lounge sat Archy, still acted upon by mysterious influences; now appearing to take snuff, bent over like a feeble old man; wiping his eyes with Doctor Biddikin's handkerchief, while his hand seemed shaking with the palsy of age; and lastly imitating, in movement and attitude, an octogenarian carefully feeling his chin, and plucking out his beard, a hair at a time, with forceps. "Jest look!" whispered Mrs. Burble. "Ann Mari', do see Archy! It's old Mr. Bannington, over and over again! He used to set hour after hour jest like that, pullin' out his baird with pinchers; for he wouldn't let anybody shave him, and his hand had got too unstiddy to shave himself." The colonel breathed short and fast, his face beaded again with cold sweat. Archy uttered a senile, cackling cough. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-114.jpg) \- external link  - Page 109. ] "Why! I'd have thought 'twas old Mr. Bannington himself, if I didn't know!" murmured the housekeeper. "Keep still!" cried Doctor Biddikin. "I must get this communication! ` Dear father! ' He were a very affectionate son: colonel, he has rapped out ` dear father! '" "I am with you always," said the raps. "O Mr. Murk!" exclaimed the afflicted parent, "that is my son, --- that is my son! He were a very dutiful boy. O Mr. Murk, if you could only have known my son Madison!" "I think I see him now," said Mr. Murk, staring at the blank air. "Was he a tall, strong young man?" "That is my son! You describe him better than I could myself. Colonel --- Colonel Bannington, Mr. Murk can see the spirit of my boy!" "He puts his arms around your neck," said Mr. Murk. "I think I can feel them! --- I feel his arms distinctly!" And the ardent father opened his own to clasp the filial shade. "He wears a pea-jacket and sailor's trousers," remarked the matter-of-fact Mr. Murk. "He kisses you on your right cheek." "He were always such an affectionate boy! I feel his kiss!" and, weeping, the parent kissed back. "He were wild, you know, colonel, but so affectionate at heart! Can't you speak to me, my son?" "There he is! --- in the door!" faintly screamed Mrs. Burble. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-115.jpg) \- external link  - Page 110. ] And, starting up, she pointed at the apparition of a tall, sunburnt, swaggering young man, entering, not in ghostly pea-jacket and spiritual trousers, but in clothes of unmistakable mundane fabric, coarse and ragged and soiled, and covering stout limbs of actual flesh and blood. "Madison!" gasped out the little doctor, uncertain at first whether he saw his son in the flesh or in the spirit. "Hello, dad!" the dutiful youth responded, entering with a reckless air. "What's the row?" "Madison!" ejaculated the parent, "what does this mean? Where have you been?" "Lying around loose, here and there," answered the affectionate boy. "I saw the old chaise and Pitman's white crow-bait as I was going by, and thought I'd get a lift up the hill. Le' go my collar!" And he put his father from him as a giant would a pygmy. "I'll have none of your insolence! Come along with me!" And Biddikin flew round to find his hat. "Oh, don't you splutter, you little old burnt-out tallowcandle!" said the youth, his chin on one side, and one eye half-closed with a malign expression. "How are you, Colonel Bannington?" The colonel was himself again. "We've had the cursedest hocus-pocus! --- been getting communications from your ghost for the last half-hour," said the colonel. "The devil you have!" said Madison. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-116.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] "You came from the seventh sphere, and rapped; and Mr. Murk, here, saw you; and your father felt your arms on his neck!" "Oh, gas!" laughed the youth, with his tongue in his cheek. "It is easily explained," observed Mr. Murk, stoical and dry as ever. "A mischievous spirit has been deceiving us. He has gone to Archy: I think he will give his name." The words had scarcely parted from his lips, when Archy rushed to the table, and, seizing a pencil, struck it across a sheet of paper with a sort of zig-zag jerk. Ann Maria, taking the paper, held it up, and read, --- "` Joe Prince! '" written in a bold, rapid hand. "Jest like Joe Prince to come and fool us so!" "Precisely!" said the colonel: "only Joe Prince happens to be alive. Squire Pelt had a letter from him yesterday. Let me tell you, all this is humbug! What isn't trickery is mesmerism, and what isn't mesmerism is imagination. Rhody Burble, you'd better attend to your housekeeping in future. Doctor Biddikin, you've got your buried treasure to look after; that's enough for one cracked brain: you'd better let the spirits alone. As for you, Mr. Murk, philanthropist!" --- lashing himself into a fury as he proceeded, --- "I believe you are a villain, with your bobbing fist and your Swedenborg! --- and, if ever I see you coming to my house again after mediums, I'll make a target of that big nose of yours, --- I swear by the Almighty! Madison, carry your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-117.jpg) \- external link  - Page 112. ] father home, and keep him: he's in his dotage. Aaron, come in, and put a stop to this deviltry!" Burly, bearded, black, Aaron Burble darkened the doorway, frowning at the evidences of a circle. His wife flew to the kitchen for refuge, followed by Ann Maria. Archy came out of his trance, and shrunk sheepishly away. Biddikin found his hat, and thrust his head into it; while Madison stood with his cocked on one side, insolently laughing. "It will, perhaps, be expedient for us to withdraw for the present," Mr. Murk observed philosophically. "It has been a rather edifying season; and when our brother, here, has risen above the sphere of passion" --- "Aaron, kill that scoundrel!" hissed the colonel. "If Aaron wishes for an opportunity to do so, I will remain," drawled Mr. Murk: "otherwise I shall depart." And, as Aaron manifested no disposition to commit manslaughter, the philanthropist considered himself justified in retiring. Doctor Biddikin was, by this time, half-way down the avenue, calling violently to Madison to "Come along!" Mr. Murk followed; and the three, getting into the rickety old chaise, rode away. ARCHY LOSES HIS SITUATION. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-118.jpg) \- external link  - Page 113. ] THE colonel was carried back to his room, his nerves all unstrung; the raising of other spirits having caused a depression of his own, from which it took him three days to recover. The fourth morning was fine. He resolved to enjoy it; and, Aaron having got him into the garden, Archy was summoned. Archy, sheepish and afraid, meeting his employer for the first time since the occurrences of the circle, approached with qualms of soul, which were by no means diminished when he felt the inclination to jerk coming on again. There was something about the colonel's legs that "put the deuse into him." He felt an awful impulse to make a lunge at them, which grew stronger and stronger; while his power of resistance grew weaker and weaker. As Sinbad's ship was wrecked by the mountain of loadstone that drew all the iron nails out of it, so Archy was imperilled by those legs; in proximity with which, all the faculties that bound together [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-119.jpg) \- external link  - Page 114. ] his moral timbers, and made him a free agent, were fast loosening. "What if I should jerk!" he exclaimed within himself. "Oh, my gracious! I shall jerk!" "What are you stopping for?" demanded the fierce colonel. "I --- I --- nothin'!" gasped Archy with twitching shoulders, and an increasing tendency to pitch into the colonel. Luckily a diversion appeared, in the shape of Squire Elphaz, who was riding by. Seeing the invalid, he dismounted, and entered the garden. Archy was glad to retreat, and give him place. But what ailed Elphaz? His step was unusually nervous. His eyes kept up a singularly sharp cross-fire of crafty glances: terribly gristly his face was. But, accosting the colonel, he simmered over, as his manner was, with frothy affability. "Ha! glad to see you look so well and cheerful, colonel, after your little annoyances." "What annoyances?" asked Bannington chillingly. "Ha! well, your son Guy --- eloping with --- Bless my soul! haven't you heard?" "Guy eloping!" The colonel's astonishment showed plainly enough that nobody had hitherto ventured to broach the subject in his presence. "What in" --- something very profane --- "do you mean?" "I mean what everybody knows, it seems, except you. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-120.jpg) \- external link  - Page 115. ] Guy has gone off with Ben Arlyn's daughter. Pretty girl, Lucy Arlyn! Can't blame a young fellow like Guy; hey, colonel?" "Pelt!" said the pale invalid, "you're joking!" "Haven't you really heard, though?" cried Elphaz. "I thought you was joking! You've been as much out of this delightful little world of gossip we live in as I have. I've been off on business, and didn't hear of the elopement till I got back yesterday. But I saw the happy couple in Albany, walking the streets arm in arm; loving as possible! Thought you'd be pleased to know." "Yes, you thought I'd be pleased to know!" said the colonel grimly. "What else?" "Some furniture came up by yesterday's express," replied Pelt, --- "sofa, chairs, bureau, carpet, and so forth, addressed to Jehiel. I met him this morning. `Ha!' says I, `Jehiel, seems we're going to branch out a little: got some new furniture, have we?' You should have seen him stare! for, I vow, 'twas the first he had heard of the new furniture. `That must be some of Guy's doings!' says he; and off he went to look after it." "Archy!" cried the colonel, "is Jehiel Hedge at the barn?" "Yes, sir: he's come for the hoss 'n' wagon." "Tell him I want him. --- Are they married? --- do you know, Pelt?" "Ha, ha! if they are, it's a pretty match! Lucy [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-121.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] without a cent in the world; and she never will have any thing, probably; Arlyn won't do much off there in the mines: and Guy --- you know best about Guy!" said Elphaz, highly nervous, pulling to pieces a rosebud. "By the Maker of heaven and earth!" began the colonel violently; but he checked himself. "Guy ain't a fool: he knows what he's about. --- Good morning, Jehiel!" --- to a stout, honest-faced young farmer, whom Archy brought into the garden. "What are you doing with the wagon?" "There are some things at the depot I want to take home," replied Jehiel. "What things?" "Well, it looks like furniture." "Where did it come from?" Jehiel appeared embarrassed, like one afraid of betraying a secret, but finally spoke out, --- "I suppose Guy sent it." "Suppose!" snarled the colonel: "don't you know? Hain't he told you any thing about it?" "Not much," said Jehiel, galled, but patient. "When I found the things had come, I thought he must have written: so I went to the post-office, and got a letter I ought to've got yesterday." "Let me see it!" Jehiel hesitated, as if in doubt whether to choke the colonel or obey him. On reflection, he gave the letter. "Jehiel," it said, "you'll find some stuff at the depot, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-122.jpg) \- external link  - Page 117. ] which I want you to take home and keep till I come. Confidentially, Guy." "It seems it's a confidential note," remarked the colonel icily, handing it back. "Seems so," said Jehiel. "Then what did you show it to me for?" "Because --- you asked for it." "And because you are a blockhead. Learn to do business better than that. Take the wagon, and get the furniture: it's none of my business." The colonel turned coldly to Elphaz; while Jehiel looked as if he certainly would have throttled him if he hadn't been a sick man. "He's a faithful fellow," said the colonel, after he was gone, "and as devoted to Guy as a puppy. I guess I aggravated him a little." "You made me laugh!" chuckled the lawyer. "Yes, you enjoyed it!" retorted Bannington, regarding him with utter contempt. "There's one mean trait in human nature, Pelt. I've got it, and you're chock-full of it." "I? --- ha! --- what trait?" grimaced Elphaz. "That which makes an ill-natured man like to vent his spite on any one he can, --- as you have come to throw a little of your venom on me!" The lawyer's metallic voice chinked with a hard, forced laugh. "You're awful sharp, colonel! But why should I feel venom?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-123.jpg) \- external link  - Page 118. ] "How do I know? Maybe you wanted Lucy yourself." "Ha, ha!" said Pelt, resolutely merry, though you could see that he writhed inwardly; while impish little glances darted hurriedly from eye to eye, as if afraid of being detected on the nasal transit. "I marry Lucy? That's a good joke!" "You'll be sorry it wasn't something besides a joke, if Arlyn happens to make a fortune in California," said Bannington; "unless you can manage to get the fortune without the daughter," he added sarcastically. A flash of pallor streaked up the gristly face, rendering the persistent grin that was there curious to behold. "Deused sharp you are, colonel, I vow! Folks say you've got to be a medium; and that accounts for it!" "Folks say --- I --- a medium?" Pelt, perceiving that, in the mutual exercise of the "trait in human nature" alluded to, he had got a momentary advantage, made the most of it; then fled, making the restlessness of his horse an excuse for running to him, and so avoiding the colonel's vengeance. "Archy!" Archy came. "Forward!" Archy obeyed; but he felt himself drawn in by the magnetism of the legs once more, and the power to push was leaving him. "What are you shaking the chair for? If ever I hear of your being a medium again" --- The colonel's tongue was stopped by a sudden resounding [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-124.jpg) \- external link  - Page 119. ] blow. It took him on his left ear like a missile; displacing his hat, and ruffling his hair and his temper. "What was that?" he cried, looking around with fiery rage. "I don't know!" articulated Archy, with jerks that betrayed him. "It was you, you villain!" "No, 'twan't! I couldn't help it! Oh, gosh! they've got hold of me agin!" Quick as lightning came a sharp cuff on the other ear. The colonel was stunned for an instant. Archy did not stay for him to recover, but fled from the wrath to come. When the colonel, struggling up again, turned to hurl his cane at the offender, he saw him already at a distance, making disastrous leaps across the flower-beds. "What's the trouble here?" cried a third voice, clear and stern; and Guy appeared, hurriedly entering the garden. Bannington took no heed of the new-comer, but, leaning over his chair, shook his fist frantically at the widow's son. "I couldn't help it! I swanny, I couldn't!" protested Archy, staying his flight with a sense of reliance on Guy. "It's the sperits!" Guy stood between astonishment and laughter, and demanded an explanation. "He thinks he's a medium!" said the colonel, panting with passion. "If I was a well man, I'd horsewhip the notion out of him mighty quick! Did you see him knock my head?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-125.jpg) \- external link  - Page 120. ] "Come here, Archy!" said Guy. The genius drew near. "What ails you?" "Nothin', now!" "Pick up the colonel's hat, and ask his forgiveness." Archy made a movement, but suddenly drew back. "I dasn't! Jest as sure's I come near him, the sperits are at me agin, --- jerk, jerk!" "Then you'd better take your hat, and go home," said Guy. "Do you owe him any thing, colonel?" "Yes: pay him off! And, if he ever sets foot here again, let the dogs have him!" The genius, beginning to cry, went back to search for his hat among the pansies, where it had dropped in his flight. "Stay till I come and settle with you, Archy." And Guy wheeled the colonel into the house. But Archy, fearing that the menace of the dogs was to be presently executed, seized his hat, and, without waiting for the adjustment of his accounts, ran away like a deer. "Now, colonel," said Guy, "drink this," --- handing a glass of wine, --- "and tell me what has been going on." The colonel drank, and smacked his thin lips. "Is that according to Scripture?" he asked, glancing up keenly at his son. "Did the prodigal, when he came back, instead of confessing his sins, call on the old man to give an account of what had happened in his absence?" Guy kept his countenance well. "If you've nothing better to tell than I have, our conversation won't be very lively; and I'll go and pay Archy." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-126.jpg) \- external link  - Page 121. ] "Stay!" said the colonel. Distasteful as the topic was, he wished to forestall, in the mind of his son, all other reports by giving his own version of what had occurred at the "sitting." He instinctively aimed also to inspire Guy with his own prejudices. Guy listened with profound interest; but the effect on him was not quite what was anticipated. As it often happens that the reluctant admissions of those who denounce a cause do it better service than the bold claims of its friends; so the marvels, which, had they been related by a credulous person, would merely have elicited Guy's contempt, impressed him powerfully, coming from the lips of so violent a sceptic. He was eager to learn every minute particular, and wearied his father with questions. "And you can find," he said, "no satisfactory explanation for these wonders!" "Do you expect," retorted his father, "that a man will see through every trick a juggler performs?" "What!" exclaimed Guy, "are we to set down little Ann Maria, and poor, simple Archy Bramble, as such consummate jugglers?" "Set 'em down for what you please!" was the colonel's easy solution of the difficulty. "Jugglery or mesmerism, or even spirits, --- or all three together, --- I don't care what it is! I've seen enough of it. Don't mention the subject again. Send Archy off, and find somebody to take his place. If you get a medium, I'll kill him!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-127.jpg) \- external link  - Page 122. ] Afraid of being questioned in his turn, Guy hastened away, his countenance all alive with late experiences, --- whether of love and joy, or of love and grief, one could hardly have discovered. Not seeing Archy in the garden, he walked about, plucking a few flowers, gazing at the shimmering waters of the fountain, and listening to its plashy music; then went to consult Mrs. Burble in the kitchen. "What do you say, colonel, to young Biddikin?" he asked, returning to the library. "That rascal?" "Yes. Rhoda thinks he would do: only she's afraid you couldn't manage him very well." That touched the Bannington pride. "I couldn't manage him? I'd like to see the fellow I couldn't manage! provided" --- scowling at the reminiscence of Archy --- "'tain't a thundering medium!" "I don't think Mad has any infirmity of that kind. If you say so, I'll go and see him this afternoon." The colonel assented; and accordingly, after dinner, Guy loosed his dogs, mounted his horse, and rode away. THE SEERESS. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-128.jpg) \- external link  - Page 123. ] AT the door of a desolate-looking wood-colored house, under the brow of the mountain, Guy drew rein, and asked a small boy in rags, sitting on the grass, if the Biddikins were at home. The boy jumped up, while a tame crow he was playing with flew to the low eaves of the dilapidated porch. "Y-a-a-s," he drawled with a scared and starved expression. At that the crow began to hop along the eaves, and chatter, "Mad's come home! Laugh, Jack! --- ha, ha, ha!" Guy dismounted, and was met at the door by Doctor Biddikin. "Sh!" said the little man with an air of mystery. "We've great doings here, --- great doings! Don't speak, but come in!" "Is Madison" --- began Guy. But the doctor checked him: his skinny fore-finger was on his lips. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-129.jpg) \- external link  - Page 124. ] "Not a word!" --- drawing him into the entry. "I've five ladies and gentlemen here to see me," --- he reached to close the door: "you make the sixth." And in darted the crow after them, as if to make the seventh. "Good luck for Jack! Laugh, Jack! --- ha, ha!" screamed the bird. "I declare! I didn't mean to let that creature in! He plagues us dreadfully!" He opened the door again, and put his head out. "Job!" --- in a fierce mutter, not designed for the visitor's ears, --- "why didn't you take care of Jack?" "Couldn't; got away from me," answered the boy outside, in feeble, frightened accents. The doctor left the door open, and tried to drive Jack out. But Jack was not at all inclined to go. He flew up the staircase, and down again over Biddikin's head as he went up after him. Then he perched on a half-open door at the farther end of the entry, and, with balancing wings and bobbing head, looked down saucily at the little bald pate that came up stealthily beneath him. "Biddikin! --- can't come in! --- ha, ha!" And he flew to the banisters. As the doctor went there for him, he returned to his perch on the door, chattering all the while impishly. "Do catch that creature for me!" whispered the doctor, giving up in despair. "Ha, ha, ha!" said the crow as Guy stepped towards [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-130.jpg) \- external link  - Page 125. ] him. "Mad's come home! --- ha, ha!" And, as Guy reached up to catch him, he made a dash at his face with his glossy black wings, darted between his hands, and flew into the room beyond. "Shut the door!" cried Biddikin eagerly. Jack was in prison. "He shall stay there a while. He has been unusually saucy since Madison came home, --- actually blasphemous. How do you account for that?" "Cats and dogs often catch the spirit of the human beings around them," said Guy; "and the same must be true of other pets." "There is some subtle sympathy; don't you think there is? That crow is an entirely different creature when Madison is around! --- But come!" said the doctor, having by this time tucked up again under his cuffs the soiled shirtwristbands which had become disarranged in his chase after Jack. And feeling to assure himself that his threadbare coat was buttoned well across his throat, to conceal any appearance of unpresentable linen, he tripped quickly, and closed the front-door; then cautiously opened another that led into a side room. "I sha'n't introduce you," he whispered as they went in. The gloom of the apartment, the silence, and the sight of a dim, solemn company seated around a table, made Guy feel as if he was interrupting a funeral. He attempted to retreat; but Biddikin pulled him in, and gave him a seat on a bench in a corner. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-131.jpg) \- external link  - Page 126. ] It was a large, naked, carpetless room, as Guy could see, although the blinds were closed, possibly to shut out the crow, but more probably to exclude the daylight, and at the same time to disguise the broken windows and the penury they ventilated. His eyes soon grew familiar with the obscurity; and he discerned, looming up in the dimness opposite, a sturdy nose, which could belong to no other person than the philosopher he had encountered in the woods. Next him appeared the ghost --- not yet disembodied --- of the doctor's dutiful and affectionate son. On the other side of the prominent nasal feature sat a young woman with a large forehead that gleamed pale in the dusk. Next her was a tall, well-dressed, highly respectable-looking gentleman, with a bland white forehead. Biddikin took his seat with a corpulent middle-aged man (whom Guy recognized as a neighbor and a deacon) between himself and his son; thus nearly completing the circle. There were still two chairs between the doctor and the tall gentleman, --- one vacant, the other occupied by a young lady whose face Guy could not see. She was petit in stature, elegantly dressed, with a small, fine head, auburn hair, and a delicate jewelled hand, that played restlessly with a pencil over a sheet of paper. The company seemed waiting for her to speak; when the silence was broken by a loud outcry on the part of Jack in his prison. "Jack's mad now, --- hear him!" said the junior Biddikin in a laughing whisper.

"I cannot proceed as long as there is any disturbance," remarked the young lady in low, quiet, decided tones. "I'll fix him!" said Madison, starting for the door. "Don't you hurt him! --- don't you hurt Jack!" cried the doctor, hurrying after him. Guy also rose to go out, thinking he might form a part of the disturbance of which the young lady complained. "The gentleman will please remain," she said in the same low, decided tone, without looking round. "Do you mean me?" asked Doctor Biddikin. "I said the gentleman, " was the significant response. "I --- I suppose she means you," said the doctor, taking hold of Guy with both hands, and pushing him back. "This seat is for him," --- and the young lady indicated the vacant chair at her side. "That is very remarkable!" said Biddikin. "When the circle were formed, she said another were to come, and reserved that chair." Guy, surprised at all this, and interested to see what would be done, seated himself between the young lady and Doctor Biddikin. "You remember," dryly remarked the individual with the nose opposite, "I predicted that you had something to do with this matter," --- fixing his eyes with a mystical squint and a sapient grimace on Guy. "See there!" --- his fist began to wag, --- "Swedenborg recognizes you!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-133.jpg) \- external link  - Page 128. ] "What!" whispered Biddikin, "do you know Mr. Murk, the philanthropist?" "We have been a-fishing together," answered Guy. After a wild clamor in the kitchen, proclaiming that the bird had come to grief, a door was suddenly slammed, shutting out the sound; and Madison, with a black quill stuck recklessly in his hair, returned to his place in the circle. Guy, almost from the moment of his entrance, had felt stealing over him an indescribable magnetic influence, which impressed him still more powerfully in his new position. It seemed to surround him like a fine, invisible, soothing, almost stupefying mist. Soon a tingling sensation ran electrically down his arm, and he felt a strong inclination to place his hand on the young lady's. It was not until after this that he turned his face, and saw hers, or perhaps the impulse might have been easily accounted for. She was not more than twenty years of age, --- a pale blonde, with very singular features, irregular, and certainly not handsome, but full of refinement and fascination. When Guy first observed her, she wore a decided air of disdain and impatience, as if she did not sit willingly in the company which was manifestly disagreeable to her. Her eyes were downcast, and Guy could not perceive that she once glanced at him. For some time, her hand continued to play with the pencil it held; but at length it was drawn towards her, and folded with its fellow near her bosom: her eyes closed gradually; while the expression of hauteur softened, and finally [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-134.jpg) \- external link  - Page 129. ] gave place to a cold, pallid fixedness of feature, so beautiful, yet so marble-like, that Guy, as he looked at her, shivered from head to foot. "The first shall be last, and the last shall be first," she said at length with a sublime elevation of manner blending with a certain childlike simplicity. Then, breathing deeply, her head drooping, while blissful smiles softly irradiated her countenance, she sat silent as before. "I'm anxious to know what that means," said Doctor Biddikin after a long pause. The seeress gave a light start; while, at the instant, Guy felt a thrill shoot down his arm. "The circle was formed," she then said, "lacking one. "It is now complete. The first shall be last," she repeated, clearly, solemnly, deliberately, "and the last shall be first." From that moment, Guy saw only her: ignoring Biddikin, forgetting Murk, oblivious of all the ridiculous circumstances attending the occasion, he watched her changing and illuminated features, and listened to her silvery voice. "I am still more anxious than before," the doctor took advantage of another pause to observe. "It is evident Mr. Bannington came last into the circle: I were the first" --- The seeress started to her feet, stood erect, her eyelids half closed, and the orbs upturned under them with a wonderful expression; and raising her right hand, as if beckoning down an invisible choir, laid the other upon Guy's head. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-135.jpg) \- external link  - Page 130. ] "Behold," she uttered softly, "your lord and your king!" Never in his life had Guy experienced any thing like the deep, devotional, melting emotion which these words and the touch of that light hand awakened within him. Something descended upon him like a cloud, as of the breath of angels. Pure, passionless, delicious, dewy thoughts distilled out of it, suffusing his whole being. He bowed his head involuntarily. It seemed like a consecration. Strangely enough, he was not at all surprised by it, but accepted it as something for which his soul had waited long. "He is the head," the seeress added after a pause of profound silence; brief, if measured by moments, but deeper than time to the soul within which eternity seemed then to open. She laid both hands upon him as she spoke, then spread them towards the circle. "Ye are the members: follow him." She sat down. The little doctor, in great excitement, sprang to his feet. "He the head? And I --- I want to know what is to become of me!" The seeress, with a mere movement of her hand, waved him down. "He who enters upon this work for the sake of riches or reward shall be confounded!" were the words of her response, prophetic, impressive, to be remembered long after, in days of tribulation. "Self-seeking has no place here. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-136.jpg) \- external link  - Page 131. ] To possess yourselves of the treasure that awaits you in its coffers of rock is not the end, but a step towards the end. A great work for humanity is to be accomplished. For this the treasure has been long provided and preserved; and to this purpose it must be sacredly applied." Mr. Murk gave a slow, solemn, sleepy, satisfied nod; but Doctor Biddikin rubbed his husky hands with irrepressible nervousness. "I don't know about that, Mr. Murk! The treasure is mine yet: I've signed no papers. I may have something to say! After all the toil and anxiety it has cost me, --- years of suffering, --- I can't see others step in and reap the benefits, while I am left to starve: do you think I can, Deacon Pitman?" "I see no other way but to follow the directions of the spirits," said the earnest deacon. "We are all instruments," Mr. Murk added: "I myself am only an instrument," --- great as I am, his manner seemed to say; while Swedenborg corroborated his remark by the usual manifestation. Guy was annoyed: but he felt no inclination to laugh; having determined, from the first, to suffer no exhibition of folly or fanaticism to divert his mind from whatever truth might be masked beneath it. "He who calls himself the owner of the treasure," the seeress resumed, "has claims which shall not be overlooked. But this is the cause of humanity, of social redemption; and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-137.jpg) \- external link  - Page 132. ] personal interest must not be allowed for an instant to stand in its way. Six individuals, of ample means, must unite to set the stone rolling, which, once put in motion, will of itself possess an impetus sufficient to carry an institution along with it, and to crush in its progress the gigantic evils of the world. Two of the six are here present, --- you and you," --- the jewelled hand indicating the tall gentleman and the flushed deacon. "You'll be bled, old coveys!" chuckled Madison. "What is to be expected of us?" asked the deacon in quick pecuniary alarm. "Each shall subscribe one thousand dollars to assist in the work," answered the oracle. "What!" --- and all the solid mass of the deacon's flesh appeared agitated, --- "is it going to be so expensive as that?" "A fund of six thousand dollars," the seeress answered, "can be easily secured. Whatever portion of it is necessary to defray the expenses of the work will be returned with interest to the subscribers, when the large treasure, to which this is but the key, shall be rendered available." "An excellent plan! very rational indeed!" cried the little doctor, quickly consoled by the prospect of such golden rain in the empty cistern, where his hopes, surviving stagnation and drought, began to sing like frogs before a shower. "What do you say, gentlemen?" Mr. Murk nodded, and thwacked his breast, to show that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-138.jpg) \- external link  - Page 133. ] both he and Swedenborg approved; the tall gentleman looked intelligent and bland, but discreetly said nothing; while the deacon's sweaty visage betrayed that the spirit had to wrestle hard with him for the lucre. "The six subscribers," continued the seeress, "shall constitute a board of directors. The chosen spiritual head" --- designating Guy --- "shall be the chief of the association. The energy and executive ability which he will devote to it are necessary to insure early success. But what is chiefly important in this, to him and to the world, is the experience of government which he must gain in small things in order to fit himself for the more glorious sphere of power to which he is destined." Guy could not repress an incredulous smile. She proceeded to answer the thoughts that prompted it, though he did not speak, and though she, as from the first, did not raise her eyes to his face. "Let him not despise the manger in which Truth is born. Let his clear eye see deeper than the mean swaddling-clothes in which it is wrapped. And as for himself, let not his scepticism smile at the contrast between what his life has been and what it is henceforth ordained to be. The freedom and wildness of his youth have been needful to give power and inspiration to his prime. He is a child of nature, not a creature of conventionality. The uses of many things, the meaning of many things, which have strangely shaped his life and agitated his soul, he will now understand." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-139.jpg) \- external link  - Page 134. ] She paused. During the previous practical discussion, the influences which had overshadowed Guy were partially dissipated; but now they thickened upon him again, and suddenly thoughts of his mother fell like a warm rain upon his heart. The seeress breathed deeply at intervals, and her brow grew radiant. "As the treasure which is to be sought lies buried in the heart of the mountain, so in his bosom are hidden divine instincts, of which he is himself but vaguely conscious. The rocks of circumstance have fallen upon them; the briers and brambles of youth have grown over them. But those heavenly riches have been guarded by angels." Her voice grew wonderfully soft and winning. "Angel-whispers have often, in his deep moments, been breathed into his spirit. Blind yearnings after an unknown good, vast and undefined aspirations, have alternated with emotions of despair at what he has deemed his purposeless life. But now clear voices shall be heard comforting and directing him; the rocks shall be removed, and the precious instincts they conceal shall be brought forth from darkness into light, blessing him, and benefiting the world." The inspired manner and tones of voice; the sweet conviction of reality with which she spoke of spiritual beings watching over him; and, more than all this, the words that described to himself the inward struggles which he supposed were known only to himself and his God, --- every thing must be considered, if we attempt to account for the effect [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-140.jpg) \- external link  - Page 135. ] produced on Guy; and yet all will seem inadequate if we forget the magnetic influences which surrounded him. He yearned then and there to sink upon his knees, and pray as he had not often prayed in his undevout career. But quickly the question arose in his mind, "How do I know but it is all delusion?" Instantly the seeress responded to his thought. "Let him neither accept nor deny his mission until what he has this day seen and heard has sunk deep into his heart. In the mean time, he requires some tangible, undoubted proof that there is reality in these things." Indescribably tender and beautiful smiles flashed up the Pythian features as she added, "Proof shall be given." She took the pencil, and, with eyes still closed, traced rapidly a bold wavy line on a sheet of paper. The pencil flew from her hand, and the paper was pushed towards Guy. He took it, and, holding it in the usual position for reading a line of writing, saw only an irregular scrawl. But, instantly perceiving that it was not writing, --- that it was the outline of a human face, --- he held it upright, and gazed at it long; gradually drawing the paper closer, to hide the emotions of his features. And this was Guy, the proud, the gay, the reckless, --- sportsman, sceptic, scoffer! --- overpowered to tears--- by what? ARCHY'S SUBSTITUTE. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-141.jpg) \- external link  - Page 136. ] WHEN he recovered himself, the seeress had come out of her trance, and the circle was dissolved. The men crowded around him to see what wonderful "test" he had received. But he folded the paper carefully; it was for no eyes but his own: and, making his way through the group, he approached the seeress. She had thrown open a blind, and stood tying her bonnet at the end of the room. Something had seemed to vanish magically as the daylight streamed in. The walls and floor, and the faces of the people present, wore no longer any hue of illusion, but looked bare and gray in the unromantic light. Mr. Murk's nose resembled more than ever a great lump of putty. The fat deacon's features appeared in all their native grossness. The large white-gleaming forehead of the silent female showed now an unwholesome bluish tinge, where the hair had been shaved from its summit to make it look bold and intellectual. A sort of mystery still hung about the tall gentleman, who appeared like some splendid personage in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-142.jpg) \- external link  - Page 137. ] disguise; his mild eyes and cautious lips smiling the intelligence which he did not care to speak. But Guy watched the countenance of the seeress. It was still a fine and striking face, which could well brave the test of daylight. But the spiritual radiance had left the brow; the sweet, ecstatic expression of the mouth, the almost saintly aspect of the eyes, had vanished. A pale, cold, nervous little woman stood before him, tying her bonnet. Doctor Biddikin introduced him. "Did we never meet before?" Guy asked, feeling that she must be well acquainted with his history. She regarded him with provoking indifference. "I never saw you till this moment, sir, nor heard your name till just now." "And you knew nothing of me until I entered this room?" "Absolutely nothing, sir," --- busy with her gloves. "And you never met any member of my family?" he continued with a graciousness of manner which no coldness on her part could disturb. "Never to my knowledge, sir. Any thing else?" Guy was piqued, not being accustomed to such treatment from young ladies of any susceptibility. "I suppose," said he, "I ought to be satisfied with the statements you have kindly condescended to make; but I have been so much astonished by what I have witnessed, that I should go on and ask a great many more questions, if I did not see that I have annoyed you sufficiently already." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-143.jpg) \- external link  - Page 138. ] "You have not annoyed me at all, sir." And, for the first time, the lady's eyes, clear and bright blue, flashed up frankly, almost laughingly, at Guy. She appeared to him at that moment the most artful, uncivil, capricious, tantalizing woman he ever saw. But he was encouraged, and questioned her with regard to her trance. "I don't know much more about it," said she, "than you do. An influence comes over me; and all I have to do is to give myself up to it. What I say is given me, sentence by sentence, and word by word; so that I never know, when I begin, what is to follow. The influence is sometimes very pleasant: it was especially so to-day, after you came into the circle. But" --- she shuddered, and her brow contracted into a frown --- "the atmosphere of this house --- don't you feel it?" "What about the atmosphere of this house?" cried Doctor Biddikin, pressing forward, smirking politely, thumbs and little fingers together. "The magnetisms of the people who have lived here are insufferable," she answered with the previous air of impatient disdain. "There have been some very singular people in this house, very singular," said the doctor in some confusion. "Did any one ever die a strange, unnatural death in this room?" she asked. "Did any one --- in this room --- an unnatural" ---articulated Biddikin, his features changing to a ghastly sallow hue, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-144.jpg) \- external link  - Page 139. ] but still smirking. "That were a very remarkable question!" he hurriedly added, his matched fingers shaking themselves asunder. "There's been strange deaths in this house,--- you know that, Deacon Pitman! --- Madison!" turning sharply on the junior, "what do you mean?" "Ah!" aspirated Madison, his suspicious forefinger pointing at his father with a wicked leer in his eye, "there's been deaths, Deacon Pitman and I know; only we don't!" he added between his teeth. "What! are you going?" cried Biddikin. "I --- I nearly forgot myself. When shall we have another meeting? The sooner we begin operations, the better, I suppose." "Brother Murk and Sister Lingham are going home with me," said the deacon. "We shall be ready most any time for another setting." "I am impressed," said Mr. Murk, wagging the Swedenborgian arm, "that the medium will appoint a time" --- thwack, thwack! "What does the sister say?" "I can make no appointment for myself," replied the seeress. "If necessary, we shall be brought together again. Come!" And she took the arm of the mysterious gentleman, turning impatiently to go. "Madison!" cried the bustling little doctor, "go and untie the horse for them! Quick!" The carriage was in the rear of the house. The seeress and her companion got into it: she gave not even a parting look to Guy, who stood watching her with interest as they rode away. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-145.jpg) \- external link  - Page 140. ] "That little woman," said Madison, re-entering, "has got a devil in her as big as a woodchuck." "You've got one in you as big as your skin!" snapped his father. "Yes: none of the little dried-up devils such as your mummy-skin holds, but as live a devil as ever you see!" "`Ever you see '! Can't you use better grammar than that?" "What should I say?" "`Ever you sor,' of course." "Ever you sor, then! --- if that makes any difference. I tell ye, I like that little woman. But t'other one, with her shaved forehead, --- bah! And the cutwater that Murk craft carries!" --- a figure of speech applied to the philanthropist's nose, which was just then dividing the air between Miss Lingham and the deacon, as the three walked down the road. "I shall run afoul of that some time! I shall get it in my fist, and twist it hard, I know I shall!" And Madison laughed maliciously. "Did you ever hear such talk from any sane being?" the senior Biddikin appealed to Guy. "He don't know half the time what he is saying, --- not half!" "Look a here!" returned the junior, "you half-pint of cider, --- sour at that! --- ye'll get spilt over if ye don't take ca-a-re!" "Hear that?" said the senior. "He abuses me! He shows no respect to his venerable father!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-146.jpg) \- external link  - Page 141. ] "Respect! I've no more respect for you than for a griddlecake the cat has left!" spitting contemptuous tobacco-juice, and sprawling on the bench. "See that! --- on my floor!" ejaculated the doctor. "He chews tobacco!" --- with immense disgust. "His dander is up at what I said of deaths in this house," sneered the son. "But I could tell a thing or two!" menacingly. "That gal made one good hit, if she never did another." "I --- ah! --- don't you think," stammered the doctor, "there's a great deal of imposture --- guess-work, to say the least --- with these mediums?" "What she said was law and gospel, though, till she made that last hit," said Madison. "Don't mind a word he says," whispered the doctor. "I think he's a little insane: don't he seem so to you? --- Madison, I want to converse with Mr. Bannington alone a few minutes." "Think I'm going to be turned out of doors so easy as that, you last year's puff-ball!" replied the dutiful Madison. "Insolent!" Biddikin rushed upon him, shaking his fist. "Quit this house im-MEDIATELY!" --- these final syllables being capitalized by Madison's boot, which was suddenly projected against the paternal diaphragm. "For shame, for shame!" cried Guy, receiving the reeling doctor in his arms. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-147.jpg) \- external link  - Page 142. ] "You sor it, didn't you?" gasped Biddikin. "He shall rue that kick, he shall rue that kick!" he exclaimed furiously; then began to groan. "Oh, my abdomen, my abdomen!" --- nursing the afflicted part with both hands piteously. "He has done me some internal injury!" --- faintly. "I am dying!" --- more faintly. "I --- I" --- Guy eased him down upon a chair: by which time rage had got the better of pain; and, springing up, he flew at his dear son with renewed fury. Guy held them asunder, while Madison jeeringly invited his progenitor to come on. "Shame, shame!" repeated Guy. "Father and son at blows!" "Dreadful, isn't it?" said the doctor. "He provokes my life out of me! What do you advise me to do?" "I advise you two to live as far apart as possible." "Just my opinion! But I can't get rid of him." "Can't? You won't let me go!" said Madison; "or, if I do, you're crazy as a loon till you coax me back again." "Try it, and see!" "I will; and you won't catch me in this house again." "I don't wish to, if you can't behave yourself," said Biddikin, softening a little as his son grew earnest. "Why don't you go to work somewhere, Mad, and earn your living?" asked Guy. "You're a man in bone and muscle: it's time you were beginning to show yourself a man in character. I'd do any thing, if I were you, rather than live this miserable cat-and-dog life." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-148.jpg) \- external link  - Page 143. ] "I will: I'll find a place somewhere." "Will you promise to behave yourself if I will get you one?" "I can behave myself well enough, only take me away from that dressed-up mouldly doughnut! that pine-knot on pegs! that pair of scissors in a rag!" --- rhetorical flourishes with which the fanciful junior adorned the elder's meagre anatomy. "Jest gi' me something to do, and see if I won't be something besides the loafer you think I am." "That's precisely what I intend." And Guy proposed the situation behind the colonel's chair. It was at once accepted. "I object!" said the doctor, short and sharp. Guy looked at him in amazement. "Yes, emphatically! Don't you go to getting away my son! He sha'n't go! he sha'n't go!" --- very decidedly, shaking his head, and compressing his lips. "What did I tell you?" roared out Madison with savage scorn. "Pray, doctor, what objection can you have?" "It's a menial occupation. My son sha'n't disgrace himself by engaging in it. Just think of him, heir to the largest property, probably, in the State, wheeling a sick man's chair! It's preposterous! I forbid it! Madison, don't you sign any papers with regard to that treasure. There'll be half a dozen men at work digging again, within a week, under the direction of the spirits; but I shall retain the control of it. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-149.jpg) \- external link  - Page 144. ] Remember what I charge you, --- be careful how you write your name! --- Mr. Bannington, can you accommodate me with the loan of thirty-seven cents for a few days? I shall be in a way to repay it very soon." "He'll pay ye when they find the money, --- the day after doomsday!" jeered Madison. "I'd sell all my right and title to it for a pack of jack-straws. I'll see ye," --- significantly to Guy; and he swaggered out of the house. "What I wanted to say to you," whispered the doctor, pocketing Guy's loan, --- "don't you think you and I can take hold now, and find that money just as well as a large company can? There's a fortune to be made; and the fewer to share it, the better. We can get a medium somewhere: I think Archy would make a good one. I --- I don't like these impudent young women!" But Guy declined the tempting proposition. He was in haste to depart. "There's Madison waiting for you at the gate," said the doctor. "Don't you hire him. I've my reasons. Don't try to shake me: I'm firm as a rock." "I've no wish to shake you, doctor," --- Guy smiled; "but I tell you frankly, if you don't give your consent, I shall venture to hire him without it," --- going. "You do it at your peril! I've the lor on my side, I warn ye!" Biddikin called after him. Guy said a few words to Madison as he mounted his horse; and, whistling to his dogs, rode down the mountain-side. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-150.jpg) \- external link  - Page 145. ] The open air of the peaceful summer afternoon was refreshing to him, coming from that house. Superb scenery spread around him. Far to the north and west stretched the vales and slopes of the sun-spotted mountain region. Close on his left arose the gray and shattered crags among which Doctor Biddikin's treasure was concealed. Still nearer, on his right, opened an immense ravine; through which, far down, visible from the ridge-side where he rode, wound a tortuous highway, and a still more tortuous brook, descending from a woody notch in the eastern hills, and disappearing again in woods a mile farther on. Those were the woods in which he had hunted Lucy with his hound. That was the brook, which, joined by another from beyond the crags, filled the woods with its noises. And Guy, with tremulous sweet memories, was soon riding where the roads united, and the streams flowed into one, and the sun-flushed foliage overbowered him with solitude and shadow. Amongst rocks and trees, through picturesque leafy vistas, by the wild watercourse, he passed pensively. His dogs ran before and behind him noiselessly. His horse's tread fell muffled in the powdery bed of the road. One or two birds chirped to him at intervals in the green umbrage, with long-drawn plaintive notes. Fresh to his nostrils came the peculiar smell of the woods, breathing of moss-banks, cool and damp recesses, roots and lichens and old leaves. Now and then the pervading sylvan odor was crossed by a faint streak of pine-fragrance astray in the forest; and all the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-151.jpg) \- external link  - Page 146. ] while, now near, now farther off, poured and plashed and gurgled the torrent. Poured and plashed and gurgled, too, the waters of Guy's soul. Full of music, sweetly, strongly, onward hasting, impetuous, bubbling, whirling, in light and gloom, rushed the emotions and thoughts of that wilder stream. Now he takes from his bosom a miniature, which he gazes at and kisses with fond eyes and lips. Then the profile the seeress drew for him he unfolds, and regards long with wondering, yearning, awed, and misty eyes. What new fire is this kindling his nerves, burning him with sweet raptures, sighs, hopes, visions of the future? what vast ambition vaguely taking form in his swelling breast? Emerging from the woods, he stopped at a plain little brown house in a sequestered nook, a little removed from the wayside. The approach to it was across a large grassy door-yard shaded by butternuts and elms. He alighted at the door, where he was met by the honest-faced young farmer, Jehiel Hedge. "Well, Jehiel, how do you get on?" "Just you come in and see! I tell ye, that wife of mine is a treasure. She's got the carpet made; and hark! that's the hammer! --- she's putting it down." The two ascended to a pleasant chamber, half sunny, half shaded by the boughs of trees, where a young woman knelt, and drove tacks. She lifted her face, --- a plain, rather large, but somehow tender and luminous face, --- which blushed quite charmingly at sight of Guy. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-152.jpg) \- external link  - Page 147. ] "It's all her doings," said Jehiel, pointing out the progress that had been made in new-furnishing the room. "Only he has done the hardest part of it. He would work his hands off for you, Mr. Bannington," added Mrs. Hedge. "That reminds me: when I told her we was to get a room ready to-day for a new boarder, she wouldn't hear to it, she couldn't think of it, till I mentioned your name. `Oh, yes!' says she: `any thing for him! I'll go right to cleaning!' And here you see evidence of zeal!" Guy smiled with heartfelt pleasure, observing the gratitude of these kind hearts, and remembering that they owed their happiness to him. As he went out with Jehiel, he saw a child, just large enough to run about, boldly playing with Ranger. "Why, Teddy! you'll get eaten up!" "No, me won't!" said Teddy earnestly. "His mother can't have him in the room; for he gets the tacks, and swallows them." "Puts down the nails, while she puts down the carpet, --- eh, Teddy? See if you will swallow this." And Guy gave the child a half-dollar. "By tell ye!" said Teddy proudly. "Papa! see!" "That name comes natural to him," suggested Guy. "I'm all the papa he ever had," answered Jehiel with a grave, pitying expression. "I loved him for her sake at first: I love him for Teddy's sake now!" And he folded the child in his arms. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-153.jpg) \- external link  - Page 148. ] There was something in the scene, and in the history which the scene recalled, which made Guy's breath come quick and somewhat chokingly for a moment: then, silently kissing the rosy-cheeked child, he sprang upon his horse. He galloped home, saw the colonel, drank a cup of Mrs. Burble's tea, and, exchanging his saddle for a light-wheeled vehicle, departed again at sunset, driving south. LUCY'S NEW HOME. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-154.jpg) \- external link  - Page 149. ] NINE miles southward along the valley, by river and grove and farm, went Guy with humming wheels. Before him, in the blue distance, rising from the valley at its narrow outlet, old Mount Solomon reared his kingly head. Huge and lone and grand that mountain was: in the sunset light, it seemed "one entire and perfect chrysolite;" and, as Guy drove by the glassy pond, he beheld all that prismatic mass wondrously doubled, set in the severed ring of the world, and suspended midway in a duplicated evening sky. It typified the happiness he was going to meet; so beautiful, so warm, suffused with blissful light; so magnified also, sundered from the common world, and set in a ring of ideal life by the mirror of his imagination. The pond crossed, the valley once more intervened, embedding (so it seemed) the fairer moiety of the enormous brilliant. And now the veins of color that dissolved and trickled down its crags flowed into a gulf of purple shadow, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-155.jpg) \- external link  - Page 150. ] which rose like the flood around Ararat, drinking the golden rivers, and slowly submerging all beneath its dusky wave. And, as Guy advanced, the mountain appeared to recede before him, farther and farther, into a vast background of shadow, that thickened and lay upon it like a pall. Would it be thus with his happiness? Was it half illusion? Would the glory fade from it, and the night ingulf it? A chill foreboding crept over him, which he could neither account for nor dispel. Enthroned above the understanding sits the wise spirit, that perceives the shadows before us, and hints of them. In the mean time, out from the silver chambers of space came Antares to keep watch above the mountain. Guy looked up, and beheld that serene ray. "So," he said, "if dark hours are to come, may some heavenly power keep starry watch over us till the morning dawns!" With quickening thrills he entered the outskirts of a town at the mountain's base. Through dark streets, by many a glimmering cottage light, he passed, till the village hotel was reached. He springs to the piazza, hurries up the hall stairs, and raps in a dim passage at a door. A flutter, a light, quick step, within; eager hands open for him, light and beauty beam upon him; and love welcomes him with soft arms, "And a voice less loud through its hopes and fears Than the two hearts beating each to each." "Guy!" "Lucy!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-156.jpg) \- external link  - Page 151. ] As if the few hours of their separation had been years. And their lips are glued together with a kiss which seals the spring of words, but floods the silence with communion sweeter than speech. "All mine, --- all mine!" And Guy placed her on the sofa, still clinging to him; her curls all alive, and quivering on his shoulder and breast. "O Guy!" --- as soon as she could speak, --- "we must never be separated so again!" "Darling, we never will! Your little home is prepared." Mine --- not yours?" "Ours, dearest! I shall see you every day, --- every night" --- "See me? That is such a cold word!" "Till the time comes when you can be mine before the world; which time will come soon." "Oh, I hope we are not building our house on the sand! But we won't think of it!" Lucy quickly adds, as if afraid of her own misgivings. "I have you now: that is enough." "Is it real? is it not a dream?" says the intoxicated Guy. "And am I the poor little thing that ran away from you--- or tried to --- four, five, how many days ago? I can't reckon by days: they have all been melted up in the furnace" --- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-157.jpg) \- external link  - Page 152. ] Into which furnace had gone fear, resolution, pride; trial, struggle, prayer; a journey and a return, with a whirl of emotions and events, all fused into one fiery experience, needless now to recall. "Do you know what an awful thing it is to have such power?" says Lucy with dewy eyes. "It is a most glorious thing since it gives me you!" answers the remorseless lover. "Always think so! You are all I have. You stand between me and the world: you are my world." At which he clasps her with impetuous passion, and vows in his soul always to guard her tenderly, and love her well. "Shall we go soon? or wait till the moon rises?" "The moon rises late," said Lucy; "and I am impatient to quit this house." "I can imagine you have had a long and lonesome day in it; but it is over now." "It seems that I have lived a lifetime in myself since you left me this morning. But that's not it: there's a woman here who haunts me. I have heard of the evil eye; but I never knew what it was before." "What is it? who is she?" "I don't know; only she is a spiritualist," --- Lucy could not disguise her scorn, --- "and a medium, I should think." "Ah!" --- Guy was interested. "How did you find that out?" "I overheard her talking with the landlord and his wife: [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-158.jpg) \- external link  - Page 153. ] such nonsense! It reminded me of the fishing fanatic in the woods. Come, let's go: I am growing a little superstitious myself. I can feel that woman's spirit following me around. She'll do me a mischief some time; I'm sure she will!" "How does she act? Describe her." "I can't. You should have seen how she stared at me at the tea-table! You would have thought she meant to have my soul: I'm afraid she'll get it if we stay!" And Lucy hurried on her things, whilst Guy sent her trunk --- a new one, large and well filled --- down to the carriage. Then she bade farewell to that ever-memorable room, and, leaning on his arm, passed through the passage to the hall stairs. Suddenly she recoiled. "There she is!" she whispered, drawing him back. "Wait here." Guy, who expected to behold a sinister-eyed sorceress, started with surprise. An elegantly attired lady, quite young, with a nervous, pale, peculiar face, was ascending the stairs, followed by a gentleman. Lucy tried not to look at her, but could not resist the fascination. The lady, however, scarcely regarded Lucy, --- merely giving her one penetrating, almost disdainful glance; then bent those expressive eyes of hers full on Guy, with a slight bow of graceful recognition as she swept past. Guy touched his hat to her, and again to the gentleman. Lucy felt suffocated. "Do you know that woman?" she asked when they were once in the carriage. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-159.jpg) \- external link  - Page 154. ] "I have met her." "When? --- where?" "To-day, --- at Doctor Biddikin's, --- when I went to hire Madison." "Ah! then that is the place she told about!" "What did she tell?" "How she was sent there by spirits, --- something about a great organization which she wouldn't explain; and a mysterious story of a dead body she saw in a sort of vision: did you hear any thing about it?" Guy felt the time had not come for relating all he had heard: he accordingly answered evasively, and changed the subject. Far different themes absorbed them soon, making the way seem short. The stars were misty when they set out: a veil of haze covered the sky, and thickened to a cloud; so that it was quite dark before their destination was reached. The carriage struck a gate-post at the entrance to Jehiel's yard. The restless horse alternately started and backed. Guy grew vexed at trying to manage him; Lucy was alarmed; and, to add to the impressiveness of the scene, it began to rain. Jehiel brought a lantern to their aid. The wheels were soon disembarrassed, and Guy whipped on to the house. No serious accident had occurred. At another time, the little adventure would have served only to raise his spirits. But Guy was vexed that he had suffered himself to get vexed. And Lucy, keenly sensitive, entering her new home with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-160.jpg) \- external link  - Page 155. ] misgivings she vainly endeavored to stifle, felt that the rain and the collision were ominous; and experienced a secret shame and misery at seeing only a man and a lantern, when she should have received a far different welcome. The warm pressure of Mrs. Hedge's hand partly re-assured her. And the aspect of the room that awaited her; the neat little bed-chamber adjoining; the pictures; the books; the flowers that perfumed the air; the darkness and the rain shut out, comfort and happiness shut in; and Guy, her sole companion now in the wide world, her guide, her consolation, smiling fondly beside her, --- touched her with surprise and gratitude. "This is home!" the mellowest of all voices breathed in her ear. "It will be home when you are with me; but when you are away" --- "My heart will never be away. I must live one life in my father's eyes: he needs me. I shall do my duty; but here is home. No Aunt Pinworth here, Lucy!" "Poor Aunt Pinworth! What will she say?" "Who cares what anybody says?" cried Guy, exultant. "That is easy for you to ask: you are a man. But I," said Lucy, --- not sadly or reproachfully, --- "how am I going to live through what I know must come? Here among the very people I have always known, who can't understand me,--- to be wondered at, talked about, --- oh, what a buzzing there will be!" And still Lucy, who foresaw much, did [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-161.jpg) \- external link  - Page 156. ] not foresee all, else she could hardly have looked up at Guy with that charming smile which relieved her words of all shadow of complaint. "But Mrs. Hedge, she will not buzz. Who else, Guy, could we trust? who else could I make my home with now?" "She will have charity when she comes to understand, --- thanks to her rich experience," answered Guy. "I wish I knew what her experience has been! Tell me every thing you know about her." And Lucy composed herself seriously to listen. "Well, let me remember. It was just about this season of the year that I was driving home one evening by the road which we just came. But such a time it was! It had been raining for three days: the river had risen, and the flats were covered. The water was in places knee-deep to my horse in the centre of the road. And there I overtook a woman, alone, on foot, --- just at dark. She had acres of water still to cross; and, naturally, I offered to carry her over. She got into the wagon with her bundle; and, as I drove along, I inquired where she wished to go. `Anywhere, to get work,' she said. And I saw at once what manner of woman I had picked up, --- an afflicted woman; a woman of heart, crushed by some terrible sorrow, and broken by severe physical suffering. Well, I took her home: and it was time; for she was nearly dead with exposure and exhaustion when I put her into Rhoda's hands." "Oh, dreadful! But it was good in you, Guy!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-162.jpg) \- external link  - Page 157. ] "This is all I know of her history; except that, three weeks later, a child was born in our house, --- our little Teddy. Jehiel, who came to work for us, and believed her a widow, fell in love with her, and she with him. He offered himself; and she, true woman, thanking him with tears for the blessing his love was to her, declined it, however, and told him the reason, as a true woman should. Either the refusal, or the reason of it, smote poor Jehiel a stunning blow. I had befriended him in many things; and he consulted me in this. I took him with me to see her, and sat down between them, and put her hand in his, with a few words of serious truth, and left them; and the next spring they were married. I got him this house, gave him land to work; and here they have lived ever since, and been extremely happy. So they are naturally grateful to me; though, of course, I have done nothing for them, to speak of." "You showed them the way to happiness, when perhaps they would never have been brave enough to do their simple duty to each other without regard to the past or to prejudice. No wonder they bless you! O Guy! you are good!" "And, do you know, the kind and sagacious world has repaid me by giving me the credit of little Teddy's paternity? What will be said now, I wonder? But we must make up our minds never to care." "I have made up my mind, you know!" exclaimed Lucy; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-163.jpg) \- external link  - Page 158. ] "and you shall see if I am not strong! I love this little home already. Dear Aunt Pinworth, sweet Cousin Sophy, adieu, adieu! --- What a beautiful carpet!" She fluttered and cooed over it like a dove. "And what a wonderful picture!" --- holding the lamp to a large and remarkable photograph of Thorwaldsen's "Night," which, with its companion "Morning," hung by the entrance to the bed-chamber. "Those wings, with that light on them, so majestic and so calm, --- they make me shiver! And those darling little babies, --- it seems as if I could take them from her arms! It doesn't look like a picture: it is marble itself; only no marble was ever so soft and pure." They sat down by the window. "What noise is that? The brook? the mountain-brook? Oh, how grand! Is it near?" "Within a stone's toss of the house." She leaned upon the casement, and looked out into the darkness, and listened to the roar of the stream. The wind had risen, and the rain pattered on the leaves. She was silent with awe; her enthusiastic and ever-changing features fixed for a minute with sublime emotion. "Such nights will make you melancholy when I am away," said Guy. "Not if I can feel that you are coming again, and that you love me when you are away," answered Lucy. "Then you shall never be lonely!" "Oh! I may be lonely; and I love loneliness. How I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-164.jpg) \- external link  - Page 159. ] shall enjoy the noise of the brook night and day! But it sounds wild and disconsolate to-night, --- almost savage in its woe, --- wailing out there in the dark! Shut the window: the rain will spoil our new carpet. And your horse --- is he taken care of?" "Thoughtful child, yes! He is in Jehiel's barn." "Then let it rain! Won't it be fine, if there's a freshet, to sit here and watch it, and hear the stones bump together as the water carries them down? People call it Thunder Brook, then; and this --- we will name Thunder-Brook Place." Lucy was in high spirits, --- more radiant with loveliness and exaltation than Guy had ever seen her. The very sight of her was wine to his soul. But he grew pensive at times, thinking how he should tell her what he most desired to tell. "How does Archy get along?" she inquired. And that led the way. "Archy has lost his situation." "Lost it! how?" she exclaimed with the disappointment of a patroness; for, though Archy and the colonel were not aware, it was by her recommendation that Guy had engaged the genius. "He is a medium," Guy explained. "A medium! What kind of a medium?" "A boxing medium, --- very well developed, I should say. I caught him boxing the colonel, --- cuffing my respected [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-165.jpg) \- external link  - Page 160. ] parent; knocking off the Bannington hat;" and he proceeded to describe the ludicrous scene. Lucy was amazed. If Archy did thus, --- kind, honest, timorous Archy, --- she declared that he must be insane; secretly suspecting, perhaps, that disappointed affection was the cause. Guy then related the previous occurrences which had already made a stir in the village, and was almost vexed at her incredulity and ridicule. She considered Madison's bodily appearance in the room where his father was getting communications from his spirit as a jocose circumstance, more effective than any argument to prove the absurdity of it all. "Perhaps," said Guy, as if wishing to drop the subject. He produced a sheet of paper, which he unfolded. "I have a little drawing here: see if you recognize that profile." Lucy regarded it with a start of surprise, exclaiming instantly, --- "Why! it is your mother!" "Consider it well," said Guy, --- very grave, his features flushed. "The nose and forehead are perfect, and the mouth and the chin! There can be no mistake. But what a peculiar sketch! Where did you get it?" Then Guy told his story; Lucy listening with astonishment and concern. There was a long pause when he had concluded. "Do you believe," faltered Lucy, "that she --- your mother --- was there?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-166.jpg) \- external link  - Page 161. ] She knew his love and reverence for that mother, and put her question tremulously and hesitatingly. He studied the profile with silent emotion. "If I could believe that the spirit exists after the body dies; if I could feel assured that she lives, a spirit, in the invisible world," --- he began slowly and seriously. "But you believe that!" Lucy eagerly interposed. "Not clearly and fully," Guy unwillingly admitted. Lucy was shocked; as every true woman who loves is shocked, when she learns that her lover holds a colder and shallower faith than her own. "No," he added: "God help me, I never could say I believed in the immortality of the soul. It is a beautiful theory; but it `lacks confirmation.' I wait for proof." "Do not reason and intuition prove it, to say nothing of the inspired Book?" "Plato fails, with all his power of reason; and, when I read the `Phaedo,' I wish I were Cebes or Simmias, that I might put to Socrates some pertinent questions. And intuition? We feel that the soul is immortal, --- I certainly do; but may not that be because we desire it should be so?" "But the Scriptures?" said Lucy, pained and agitated. "The promise there, --- the resurrection, --- the angels that rolled away the stone!" Guy smiled. "You wouldn't believe some things I told you just now; though we have my father, Mr. Burble, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-167.jpg) \- external link  - Page 162. ] others whom we know, as witnesses to the facts. How, then, can you expect me to believe what occurred hundreds of years ago on the evidence of persons I never knew?" Lucy looked frightened. "What proof can there be, then?" "None!" answered Guy; "unless some imprudent, sociable angel let fall --- as Emerson declares none ever did --- a syllable, or many syllables, to answer the longings of saints, the fears of mortals." "O Guy!" pleaded Lucy, "don't talk of Emerson, or of Plato, or of proof, but believe! Believe as I do; because I know in my heart that God is, that Christ is, that my mother who died lives still!" "If I believed the same of my mother, then I should know what I think of that! " --- laying his hand earnestly on the profile. "That she was there?" Lucy inquired fearfully. "What else so probable as that she was there? And, to tell you the truth, I felt her there before the profile was drawn. How that was done, even supposing she was present, I don't pretend to say: but I can conceive that it might be; while I can't conceive how by any chance or possibility it could have been done, had there been no intelligence present superior to the minds of us who were present bodily." "What! not if the medium had seen your mother?" "If she had seen her a thousand times, it would be difficult to credit that she could draw instantly from memory so [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-168.jpg) \- external link  - Page 163. ] accurate a likeness. She would be a genius. And what object could she have in denying that she is a genius?" "I am sure of only one thing," said Lucy, all her feminine antipathy raised again, --- "that she is an artful, designing woman!" "I hope you intend that simply as a pun," Guy responded somewhat bitterly. "No pun at all, but downright earnest!" He deliberately folded the paper, and replaced it in his pocket with a hurt expression. She lost no time, but flung her arms round his neck. "I don't care what she draws, if she don't draw you!" she cried with the charming playfulness with which she knew how to embroider the most sombre scenes. He did not smile. "I think we may use reason in speaking of things we do not understand, and charity in speaking of persons we don't know," he said with a seriousness of mien that went to her heart. Thus the evening, which, of all evenings, should have been warm and vibrant with harmonious love, was marred by discord. But the moody Guy could not long resist her sweet and winning influence. The first silver tears that slid from those beloved eyes transported him with tenderness; and soon all differences were forgotten in the deliciousness of reconciliation. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-169.jpg) \- external link  - Page 164. ] It was raining still when he departed; and Lucy, watching him from a window till he disappeared in the darkness which no lantern could illume, listening to the slow grating of the wheels along the gravel till all sounds were lost in the universal pouring and pattering, felt a sense of loneliness and dread come over her, solemn as death. But she was weary. Guy had left her that she might sleep; and nestling down in her cool white bed, with folded palms and silent prayer, she, for the first time in many days, felt herself at rest; and soon sank to sleep, breathing the faint perfume of flowers that re-appeared in dreams, and hearing all night long, --- like the Fairy Knight of Spenser, --- "To lull her to her slumber soft, A trickling stream from high rock tumbling down, And ever drizzling rain upon the loft, Mixt with a murmuring wind." THE SITUATION. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-170.jpg) \- external link  - Page 165. ] THE hive of village gossip began about this time to buzz with unusual excitement. There was a great deal of noise, and much stinging; while a little honey was dispensed, --- to those persons, of course, who least deserved it. One of these was young Biddikin. He had gone to work at Colonel Bannington's; had put off recklessness with his rags, and adopted good moral habits with those which Guy gave him out of his wardrobe; while just enough of the old aroma of wickedness remained to give a pleasant pungency to his character. Society delights in change, in contrast and surprise. It gets tired of hearing Aristides called the Just; and is always eager to pick up and patronize the scamp with a thousand crimes, and one virtue to make them interesting. Another who got honey was Lawyer Pelt. As soon as it was ascertained that he had purchased village lots on which he purposed erecting a mansion of superior elegance, the mothers of unwedded daughters began to pronounce his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-171.jpg) \- external link  - Page 166. ] euphonious name with respectful interest; and the daughters themselves looked at him as the Thessalian maidens might have looked at King Admetus's shepherd, when, from his mean disguise, they saw Apollo emerging. The fathers nodded and smiled, and said Apollo --- we mean Pelt --- was a good deal more of a chap than had been supposed: and everybody wondered at his hitherto unsuspected prosperity; while only one head was dubiously shaken, and that was a red one. Another who got honey was Lucy; but it was the honey of cyphonism, --- a little thin sweetening of praise spread over her to attract swarming insects with their bites and stings. Fearful to a young girl, however innocent, however brave, she may be, is the first vile darkening and devastating swarm that alights upon her character. And think you Lucy, though buried in her solitude, did not hear and feel? Not blindly, not without knowing well what to expect, had she done a thing to be greatly wondered at: she had treasured patience and faith against this inevitable hour; but, when one after another officious friendly-seeming foe hastened to report to her confidentially the world's sarcasms and harsh judgments, it seemed more than heart could bear. Still Guy believed her happy; nor was he altogether deceived. Delicious was the consolation of his coming. It was warm and perfumed spring after the winter of discontent. The rosy glowing hours drifted by like dreams. They lived [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-172.jpg) \- external link  - Page 167. ] imparadised in one another's arms, like the first mortal pair that loved and sinned. Nepenthe brimmed their cup, --- "A drink of sovereign grace, Devised by the gods for to assuage Heart's grief;... whereby all cares forepast Are washed away quite from the memory." And yet scarce the true nepenthe was it; whereof "such as drink, eternal happiness do find." It blessed their lips and hearts, but did not infuse its divine quality forever into their souls. What, then, was amiss with them? Alas! what men are always trying to do, yet none ever succeeded in doing, they had also attempted. O lovers! wherefore is this crimson morning of passion granted you, but that you may awake from the delirium of the sleep-walking world, and look upon realities? The ladder of worldliness was never the way to heaven. But despise the earthly rounds, and, lo! what wings are given you! The pure ether upbears you on its crystal bosom; the world with its nothingness recedes; the blissful doors fly open. Guy and Lucy aspired to heaven, but clung to the ladder. Had they been as ready to brave the colonel's wrath and all its consequences as they were to risk the world's opinion; had they, for love's sake, given themselves openly and truly to each other, fearing nothing, concealing nothing, accepting cheerfully all penalties, --- what blessedness might have been [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-173.jpg) \- external link  - Page 168. ] theirs! But Guy feared for Lucy; Lucy trembled for Guy: and so, not altogether selfish, but each for the other's sake, they sinned. To say that they were waiting for the colonel to die, and were fast accumulating causes to hope he would die soon, gives a rather ugly face to the matter, which the blushing Muse would gladly veil in tropes. Indirectness, deception, --- these are the fatal byways in which many a secret serpent crawls; and therein walked the lovers towards the tragedy of their lives. Breathe warm upon them, perfumed spring of love! Drift, rosy and glowing hours, --- drift over them like dreams! Flow, sweet nepenthe, yet a little while! In the mean time had arisen a topic which was speedily absorbing all others. The table of spiritualism --- like the old broom with which the magician's apprentice, in Goethe's poem, tries his hand at his master's trade --- had let loose a flood which swelled beyond all bounds. Over the threshold of conventionality, over the stairs of class, over the walls of creed, rushed the uncontrollable waters, threatening to overwhelm the entire structure, and frightening those who did not believe that the Master was at hand, and that the house would be improved by the washing. A great perturbation ensued in the little village. Four classes at once arose, --- believers, who received the revelations [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-174.jpg) \- external link  - Page 169. ] of spirits as a new gospel of glad tidings; opponents, who as promptly denounced them as imposture, and the work of the Devil; and earnest investigators, who meant to be impartial, avoid the fanaticism of both sides, and come to just conclusions. The fourth class were those who didn't care whether the thing was true or not: they had other matters to attend to, --- buying, selling, eating, drinking, begetting, --- and desired to postpone acquaintance with the higher spheres as long as possible. In a short time, it was estimated that every other member of every other household was a convert to the new doctrines. Again children were divided against parents, and parents against each other, as only the sword of belief can divide them. To superstition was opposed persecution: and it was fortunate for some that the world has grown wiser than when it hanged witches and burnt heretics; that no inquisition exists but Mrs. Grundy's, and no stake but public opinion, which are yet sufficiently cruel. Such simple-hearted people as the Brandles accepted the new faith with scarce a question. To the believing widow there was nothing in life so real and sweet as the visits of her once lamented husband, now sensibly present with her again, communing with her through the mouth of their son, bringing daily joy and nightly consolation. Lucy represented a rarer class of minds, whose conception of spiritual existence is so exalted, that they revolt from the least admixture of the earthy or the absurd in what claims [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-175.jpg) \- external link  - Page 170. ] for its origin the pure realms in which their sainted ones dwell. Guy was not one of these. No dove-like opinions had built their nests in his mind, to fill him with fluttering and alarm at the least disturbance. In that open belfry were large spaces, inviting all the birds of heaven. Long his soul had been famishing; and in his unrest he had resorted to dissipation and wild sport, seeking he knew not what. But love had changed him, and prepared him for a still greater change. Those who have been rocked in the cradle of some creed can with difficulty conceive of the whirlwind-like stress with which the first realizations of God and immortality seize a nature like his, deep with depths which have never yet been sounded, restless with powers which wait for development and direction, and endowed with impetuous energy potent for good or ill. With a stern logic capable of receiving truth in spite of its ridiculous or coarse disguises, he became an investigator of the most grasping and indefatigable sort. He regarded with amazement and contempt those who were indifferent to a subject of such momentous importance; and was often impatient with Lucy, whose first impressions and unreasoning prejudices would not yield to any arguments. His investigations kept him much from her; and thus between them also the point of the dividing sword showed itself, to the terror of one at least, who saw the inexorable edge advancing. Doctor Biddikin's treasure had risen in repute. Good [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-176.jpg) \- external link  - Page 171. ] spiritualists, receiving as infallible truths the utterances of mediums, began to credit the existence of what had hitherto been regarded as a chimera of the Biddikin brain. In connection therewith had been predicted in divers places, by many seers and seeresses, a new social organization, involving reforms of Church and State, and influencing the destinies of the world; in several of which prophecies, even by persons to whom Guy was unknown, he was distinctly named or unmistakably described as the leader of the new order of things. To Lucy it was all fanaticism: and, seeing the effect which accumulating marvels and predictions were having upon her lover, she exacted from him a promise that he would avoid the mediums of the money-digging spirits, as she termed them; and especially the seeress whose image she remembered, and whose fascinations she dreaded, with an almost superstitious fear. When, out of the tenderness of his love for her, Guy gave that promise, little did he guess how it was destined to be broken. THE BEAR-HUNT. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-177.jpg) \- external link  - Page 172. ] IT was a morning in the month of September. Some young girls went up to a hill south of the village for blackberries. They were picking busily, and chatting merrily, when it was discovered that they were not alone in that desert of rocks and bushes They heard a rustling, and saw a black coat through the briers, --- a very mysterious - looking black coat, the wearer of which appeared to be advancing towards them on hands and knees. They retreated a short distance, and held a whispered consultation; when the stranger, approaching behind a low clump of foliage, stopped, and, slowly raising himself on his feet, looked over. It was a figure, a countenance, to stamp itself in the memory. With simultaneous screams they ran wildly away, tearing through briers, stumbling over stones, dashing like a waterfall down the rocks, and not venturing once to look back till they were off the hill. The said black coat was not a coat merely, but a complete suit, --- trousers and waistcoat all in one, --- which doubtless [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-178.jpg) \- external link  - Page 173. ] the wearer would have been very sorry to lose, on account of the extreme difficulty of getting another. Nevertheless, within half an hour from the time when he winked over the bushes at the girls, a dozen men had resolved to have that sable garment off his back before sundown. Foremost of all went Guy, clad in a gray hunting-jacket, buttoned well about his compact form; a gray hunting-cap, from beneath which flowed his wavy brown hair; in his hand a short rifle; in his belt a pistol and a knife; at his side his dogs. He stopped for Jehiel on his way; and, while Jehiel was loading his musket and pulling on his boots, what more natural than that Guy should spring up stairs, and spend a precious moment with Lucy? She knew his step, --- for nobody else ever mounted those stairs at three bounds, --- and was almost in his arms before she noticed his piratical appearance. "What!" she cried, admiring him in that strange costume, "have you turned bandit?" "Yes: I'm going to waylay a traveller over here, and rifle his trunk." "A bear?" And Lucy was astonished to learn that she had rightly guessed; for, though individuals of the ursine species were known still to exist in the mountain wildernesses, their appearance within the range of civilization was of rare occurrence. "He has had the presumption to go blackberrying with the girls; for which he must die." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-179.jpg) \- external link  - Page 174. ] "But, Guy! --- you will get hurt!" She was pale with fear; but he laughed gayly at the danger. "Only cowards get hurt. Never fear for me! Good-by!" He clasped and kissed her, and was off before she could speak. From her window she saw him dash with his dogs across the brook, climb the bank, swing his cap at her from the summit in the attitude of a Mercury "new-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill," and then disappear. She sat down with fainting soul, and thought, "What if he should die? God keep him! --- God keep him!" she prayed with the wild fervor of love and fear, demanding only that he might live; forgetting that there are evils worse than death. Joined at the foot of the hill by Jehiel, Madison, and Aaron Burble, --- who had brought Ann Maria with him as a guide to the spot where she and her mates had seen the bear, --- Guy swiftly stated the plan he had decided upon for the hunt. Madison, who had no gun, was to stay behind, and keep back the dogs until they were needed. Jehiel, and others who arrived, hastened around the eastern side of the hill, to station themselves by a field which the bear must cross if he attempted a direct escape to the mountains. Then Guy and Aaron, receiving their directions from Ann Maria, who was left behind for safety, advanced cautiously into the undergrowth, hoping to get within sight and gun-shot of Bruin before he took the alarm. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-180.jpg) \- external link  - Page 175. ] With great difficulty, Madison restrained the dogs and his own impatience after the others departed. He entered the bushes, brandishing a pitchfork, which he felt confident no discreet bear would fancy the looks of in his valiant hands. Suddenly the report of a gun on the hill filled the listeners with anxious expectation. Who fired? Was the bear shot? Aaron rushed up to Guy in the thickets. "Did you fire?" "No. Somebody has got the start of us. Hark! --- that crashing!" Some object was hurrying through the thickets. Both sprang forward to intercept it; but it passed unseen, swiftly descending the hill on the side they had come up. They remembered with dismay Ann Maria, left below there, and doubtless joined by this time by others too timid to engage in the hunt. Guy shouted to Madison to look out for what was coming. Rallying around him the alert and excited dogs, Madison stood with levelled pitchfork to receive the enemy. But presently hearing a formidable crackling and thrashing in the thickets, as of a monster plunging directly towards him, his courage failed, and he sprang backwards. To increase his consternation, a wild vine caught his heel, and threw him. Through the bushes, straight down upon him, before he could rise, came the cause of the commotion. "Seek! bite 'em!" he said to the dogs, and, sticking up [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-181.jpg) \- external link  - Page 176. ] his pitchfork to defend himself, came within an inch or two of perforating the waistbands of Archy Brandle, who emerged, leaping in terror down the declivity. Luckily the dogs knew Archy, and looked beyond him for their game. Madison's courage rose at once, and he rose with it. "What ye running so like a scar't devil for?" Hatless, hair erect, staring, Archy gasped out as soon as he could articulate, --- "I shot a bear!" "You have? Where's yer gun?" "I --- I d'n' know: lost it." There was another clashing of the bushes. "He's coming! He's arter me!" shrieked Archy. "Don't ye run!" cried Mad. "I'll fork him! the dogs'll take him!" And, valiant as if he had slain one monster already, and was good for several more, he stood holding his fork while Guy and Aaron came hurriedly out of the thickets; the latter, with his face and figure and black beard, resembling so much an ursus Americanus, that Mad afterwards swore that he should have stuck him if he had come first. "Where was the bear?" was the eager inquiry of the hunters. "'Twas Archy! and I come perty nigh fixing him," said Mad, with a wicked expression about the eyes. "He has shot your bear for ye." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-182.jpg) \- external link  - Page 177. ] This was the way of it: --- Archy had been up on the hill for berries, taking the old shot-gun along in hopes he might see a partridge. Having filled his basket, he was walking over a barren ridge, his basket in one hand, and his gun in the other, when he came to a steep place which it was necessary to descend. Hearing a noise, he set down his basket, and, advancing with careful steps and levelled piece, met Bruin exactly face to face. He looked at Bruin; Bruin looked at him. He seemed benumbed by the sight; and it was a moment before the reality of the thing, with all its terrors, came over him. Then, raising his gun, he took aim (he thinks), and fired. An awful growl followed the report, to be dreamed of with starts of horror many a night afterwards. But Archy had no thought of waiting to witness the effect of his shot. Flinging down his gun, he took to his legs. Thus much, though rather less coherently, he related to the hunters; volunteering to return with them to the spot, where he hoped to find his hat and his berries, with perhaps a slaughtered wild beast. He knew the hill so well, that with little difficulty he took them to the ridge. Here was his hat in one place; there was his basket of berries. There lay his gun on the ground. But no Bruin. "I don't believe you fired within a mile of that bear!" said Mad. "I'll try it next time!" possessing himself of the gun. "You may keep the fork." But Archy, who was anxious to follow up the game, which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-183.jpg) \- external link  - Page 178. ] he was sure he must have wounded, would not consent to the exchange. A scuffle ensued; Mad looking as if he would about as willingly do Archy a mischief as the bear. Guy made him give Archy the gun; and, to satisfy him, let him have his pistol. The dogs had by this time scented the game; and no time was to be lost in following them. Bruin had evidently been not much less frightened than Archy; the progress he made showing that he had fled in one direction as fast as the youth in the other. Crack! bang! went a rifle and a musket, almost simultaneously, beyond the hill. Jehiel and a companion, stationed in the field, had fired at him as he passed. The dogs appeared soon. The hunters followed from the hill. The game plunged into a swamp, which echoed presently with the cry of hounds, the crack of guns, and the shouts of men. It was a small swamp of balsams, hackmatacks, cedars, and fallen trunks; gray, mossy, tangled, pathless. Here the bear paused, perhaps considering himself safe in that gloomy fastness. But through the low spiked branches blazed a couple of guns, and over logs and hollows dashed the dogs. Yelps of pain, and growls of rage, succeeded the onset; and straightway out of the swamp, through an undergrowth beyond, swept a huge, polypous, many-headed, terrific monster,--- one indistinguishable mass of dogs and bear. It left an open path behind it. The hunters sped after, and came upon [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-184.jpg) \- external link  - Page 179. ] an animal kicking on his back, as if in the last spasm. It was Ranger, out of whose body the breath had been beaten by the stroke of a paw. Guy spoke to him: he got up, limping, and carrying his tail dejectedly; but soon recovered his spirit, and joined again in the chase. They approached the mountain's side, near which the clamor of the dogs proclaimed that the bear was at bay. Guy hurried forward. The thickets opened upon a scene of awful grandeur. Stern and tremendous rose the cliffs before him. Vast cataracts of stones, high-piled enormous blocks, like stairs for Titans to mount, covered the mountain's front, and deluged its base. High over all soared the gray, eternal crags, like shattered columns towering above the ruins of overthrown pyramids. In the cavernous recesses of these rocks the bear had sought refuge; and the hunters, rushing up, found the dogs barking at the mouth of an extemporized den. It was a dismal cavity, running between and beneath the irregularly tumbled masses. An ice-cold stream flowed out of it. From dark chambers, where the winter's accumulated frosts never failed, an atmosphere of arctic death breathed chill in the face of the warm and living day. At the entrance the dogs voiced their fury and fear, not daring to penetrate the horrid hole. Madison, with pitchfork and pistol, was on the spot almost as soon as Guy. But Aaron ploughed his way more slowly, with Archy in his wake. Jehiel and two or three others came [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-185.jpg) \- external link  - Page 180. ] by a more circuitous route, frequented by visitors who flocked thither to find ice in midsummer, climb the Titanic stairs, and scratch their names among the leathery lichens that incrust their ancient surfaces. Guy drove back the dogs, and asked the hunters what was to be done. "I believe I can see the cus," was Mad's profane remark, peering into the den, with his hands and feet in the water. "Go in and ketch him by the legs, and I'll take you by the legs and haul you both out," said Aaron. "Or, if anybody'll lift the eend of that rock, I'll jump in and ketch your bear myself;" and he mopped his forehead with his big brown hand. "That rock is just about the size of my kitchen," remarked Jehiel. "Which you expect you'll be cooking some of that bearsteak in to-morrow morning; but you won't," said Aaron. "I move that we give up the brute, and go and find Biddikin's money at the top of the rocks. They say you can see it, provided you're a medium; and it only needs a little digging to get it." "I imagine," said Guy, "it will be easier and more profitable to get the bear than the money. He is in a corner at the end of this rock, --- just where a bullet won't reach him." "Give me five dollars," said Mad with an oath, "and I'll go in and shoot him!" "He would hug you to death before you could pull a trigger." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-186.jpg) \- external link  - Page 181. ] "Five dollars would more than pay the damage, though," was Aaron's suggestion; which elicited from Mad one of his very disagreeable, murderous looks. "You better dry up," said he, "or there'll be damages five dollars won't pay." "Keep your temper, boy!" said Guy, "and give me the pitchfork." "You better take the pistol; he'll be shooting somebody with it," said Aaron, delighting to exasperate the Biddikin youth, the two having been together enough to hate each other cordially. Guy explored the den, and verified his conjecture regarding Bruin's position by eliciting a fierce growl, and having the fork nearly knocked from his grasp as he thrust it towards the hidden corner. "What did you come out for?" laughed Aaron. "I wouldn't come out without the bear." "No: you would come out with the bear a good deal faster than you went in!" The dogs in the mean time were climbing about the rocks to find another entrance to Bruin's retreat. Guy followed them. "What a place this would be for a fellow to hide when officers was after him!" said Mad, with a gloating grin at the piled acres of rocks. "Look out you don't ever have to try it," said Aaron. "There's holes up there he could slip down in, where no [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-187.jpg) \- external link  - Page 182. ] beef-fed constable could get at him," young Biddikin added, with a fire in his eyes that betokened a vivid imagination of some such scene. Now, Aaron, with his burly proportions, happened also to be a constable. "You may wish that beef-fed constables was skurcer than they be, some day!" he retorted. "I'd be a tougher customer than the bear to deal with!" Mad answered. And so they continued to jest, rather earnestly; little guessing what realities, in the not far future, their blind words were blundering upon. "Pass me my rifle," said Guy, standing waist-deep between rocks, beneath which he had found a crevice that would admit a gun-barrel. He took his piece, and carefully thrust it down out of sight. "That muzzle isn't far from Bruin's corner; and, if nobody has any better plan, I propose to fire." "Archy says he can set a trap that'll catch him when he comes out, if we'll wait," said Jehiel. But Guy preferred to try what virtue there was in powder, and directed the men to range themselves, with levelled guns, in readiness for the bear, in case he should be started. "All ready!" said the men in a row. Then Guy reached down to the rifle-lock, and touched it. A subterranean report was heard, followed by a snarl of rage and a plashing in the water; when instantly out from [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-188.jpg) \- external link  - Page 183. ] his icy den rushed Bruin, right through the rank of hunters, and into the brush, before a gun was fired. The dogs were at him immediately, close and savage, but doing him little harm, while they shielded him from shot. "Well done, boys!" said Guy sarcastically. "Why didn't you hold on to him, Aaron?" "His hair was short," said Aaron (who had fallen), awkwardly regaining his feet and his gun. The chase recommenced. Across the thicket's edge, and aslant up the mountain-side, through stunted growths of birch and fir, over waste spaces blackened by devastating fires, stretching southward to higher and higher altitudes, scaling ledges, breaking through briers and brushwood, went the powerful and ferocious beast. He tossed the dogs from him, and made them howl. Blackfoot went rolling with sharp yelps down a bare shelf of rock, alighting in a tree-top. The hunters climbed as best they could in the toilsome chase; making a foothold of every root and stone, and often hauling themselves up by the boughs of trees in steep places. As they advanced, the mountain rounded, and travel became less perilous and rough, until, a thousand feet above the valley, a magnificent summit was attained. Due east across the bald mountain-top Bruin journeyed; then doubled towards the north, down a gradual descent, entering a vast green wilderness, in the midst of which glimmered a broken sheet of water. It was a mile-long lake, stretching north and south along the hollow of the range; lifted like a cup to the blue sky. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-189.jpg) \- external link  - Page 184. ] "If he swims that pond," said Jehiel, "we shall lose him. He is making straight for it!" "And so are we," answered Guy. "The dogs worry him now: they have learned his style of fight. He is losing blood fast! We are gaining on him! We shall shoot him in the water!" But, before the water was reached, Bruin, weary, wounded, bewildered, having distanced the dogs for a moment, succumbed to temptation. A friendly-seeming tree was at hand. Was it a bright idea, or the last resort of a desperate, disheartened bear, to hug that sturdy trunk in his arms, and work his way up quickly beyond the reach of canine fangs? It is done! Bruin is lodged in a maple crotch, twenty feet from the ground, with a horrible, howling dog-dance beneath him, when the hunters arrive. "Don't shoot with that pop-gun, you idiot!" said Guy, as Mad was about to fire his pistol at the black, shaggy mass laid up along the limb. "Wait till the rest are ready, and let all fire at once. He must be dead when he comes down, or there'll be danger." Only Guy, Jehiel, and Aaron had kept up with them. But now another appeared. "Well done, Archy! What have you got in your gun?" "Jehiel gi' me a musket-ball," panted Archy. "That's well. We won't wait for the rest. Choose your positions." All were soon ready. Four gun-barrels and a pistol were aimed upwards. Guy gave the word: "One --- two --- fire!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-190.jpg) \- external link  - Page 185. ] The volley echoed through the woods. But only from the pistol and two guns curled any smoke. Guy's and Jehiel's pieces had missed fire. Bruin did not stir. "Never touched him, by thunder!" exclaimed Mad. "My musket never was worth a cent to shoot up with; the flint won't throw fire into the pan," said the vexed Jehiel. Guy, having snapped again, impatiently tore the inexplosive cap from his gun to replace it with a fresh one, still keeping his eye on the bear. "Stand from under!" he shouted to Mad. "He is beginning to slide! Here he comes!" Slowly slipped the shaggy mass from the limb, half revolving in the air as it came down, and smiting the ground with a resounding jar. The dogs darted aside, and leaped upon him instantly. But, though momentarily stunned, neither his wounds nor his tremendous fall had finished him. Turning on his haunches, breathing snarls of rage, his mouth covered with foam and gore, he flung right and left with paws and jaws whenever he was attacked. Guy levelled at his heart, and fired. Straight at him, on the instant, rushed the infuriate beast. In vain the dogs beset him. In vain Jehiel's musket, good for a level shot, being newly primed, sent an ounce-ball into his neck. Guy leaped behind a tree-trunk, and drew his knife. "The fork!" said Jehiel; and, snatching it from Mad's hands, he flew to the rescue, driving the tines deep into the monster's flank. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-191.jpg) \- external link  - Page 186. ] That saved Guy. The bear turned. Bruce, encouraged by the hunters, sprang at his throat. The next moment, the rash dog was yelling in a deadly embrace. It would have been all over with him soon; but Guy leaped upon the enemy with his knife, which he buried to the hilt in his side. The desperate animal, releasing Bruce, made a blind and ineffectual dash at Guy, who sprang away, bearing his dripping knife; then giving his tormentors a last look, pitiful to witness but for the passionate eagerness with which they sought the life dear even to a bear, he burst away from them with all his remaining strength, and took to flight. The dogs were now mostly disabled, and he scarcely heeded their onsets. Obdurate, ferocious, drunken with rage and wounds, he tore through the woods towards the lake, streaking the ground with his blood. Jehiel followed him close with the fork. "Let him alone!" shouted Guy, reloading his rifle as he ran. "He is a butchered bear: he'll die in the water. Let him go!" for he knew well the danger, should the beast in his last agony turn on his friend. Jehiel desisted; and Bruin, reeling, snorting blood, wallowed off into the water with the dogs. At that moment a volley of feminine screams went up from the shore, not far off. Guy looked in their direction, and saw through the trees, on a point of the beach, a group of women. They could hardly have reached that wild spot by land; and the idea of a bo at immediately suggested itself. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-192.jpg) \- external link  - Page 187. ] He ran towards them out of the woods, and saw the thing he wanted, drawn upon the sand. He called to them not to be frightened, and sprang into it as he pushed it off. Jehiel came after, plashing through the water, and threw himself into the stern as it veered round. A few swift strokes brought them to the scene of the bear's final struggles. He was fighting the dogs in the water, which all around him was bubbling, and stained with blood. Jehiel took the oars; while Guy, stationed in the bow, prepared to finish the fight. He first drew Blackfoot, half drowned, out of the water. Then, to make a speedy end, he placed his rifle-muzzle at the bear's head, and fired the last shot. The slaughtered brute swam round and round, with feeble plunges, in a streaked and foaming eddy, his loose floating hair making him appear as large as two bears. "It is over!" said Guy. He pierced the shaggy hide with the fork, holding the head submerged, and pushing the unwieldy carcass before them as Jehiel rowed shorewards. Then, leaving his companions to drag it out upon the beach, he rowed back to the point from which he had taken the boat. The ladies had by this time been joined by some gentlemen from the woods; and Guy was astonished to find himself among people he recognized. A small number of spiritualists were having a picnic on the lake-shore; and it seemed something more than chance [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-193.jpg) \- external link  - Page 188. ] which had led him so unexpectedly and so strangely into the very company which Lucy had made him solemnly promise to avoid. "Fatality!" he thought, as his eyes encountered those of the seeress. GUY RETURNS WITH THE BOAT. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-194.jpg) \- external link  - Page 189. ] HE determined not to land. "After stealing your boat, I've come to borrow it. We have a rather large quadruped here, which we want to ship to the end of the pond." The loan was granted, and the picnic-party went to look at the bear. Only the seeress remained, sitting on the shore, watching the water, apparently indifferent to bear-hunters and bears. "Beautiful! wonderful!" said a man with a forked switch in his hand, poking it into Bruin's hair; "but how much more beautiful and wonderful alive! How could the brothers find it in their hearts to take the life of this noble creature?" half closing one eye, with a look of solemn moral inquiry directed at Guy. "You would have thought him wonderful, though maybe not so beautiful, if you had met him alone in the woods," Guy answered pleasantly. "Bears have a way of gitting outside of lambs like you, Mr. Murk," said Mad. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-195.jpg) \- external link  - Page 190. ] "Ah, my young brother! Don't you recognize the young brother, Sister Lingham?" "Certingly," said Sister Lingham. "These folks don't know how wicked I be, or they wouldn't call me brother," chuckled the youth. "All men are our brothers; all God's creatures are our brothers," said the philanthropist. "That bear is our brother. We love him; we love all. Is it not so, Sister Lingham?" "Certingly," smiled Sister Lingham. Aaron was disgusted. "We loved that bear to death: is that the way you love your brothers?" Murk regarded him with his most phlegmatic sapient squint. "I think I recall that countenance. A very material brother, Sister Lingham; an unbelieving brother; who upon one occasion was urgently advised to take my life: but still my brother!" And he offered his hand, which Aaron pressed somewhat malevolently. "Oh, oh!" --- the philanthropist straightened his fingers to let the expelled blood circulate again. "Very cordial, brother, but rather too much of a good thing!" "Fact," said Aaron: "too much brotherly love gets to be a leetle disagreeable sometimes. So I guess we won't shake hands again right away, brother!" In the mean time, Archy, finding himself in the society of mediums, showed symptoms of jerking. That pleased Mr. Murk, who wagged his fist, and said it was Swedenborg's wish that the "mediumistic brother" should remain. But [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-196.jpg) \- external link  - Page 191. ] Guy pushed him into the boat, which he hastened to get off with its load. Mad and a broken-legged dog accompanied them; making, together with the bear, a quite sufficient freight. Guy nursed poor Ranger's hurts, while his companions plied the oars. It was now two o'clock. "I tell you!" said Archy, "I wish I had that basket o' berries I left up on the hill: wouldn't they taste good?" "'Most any thing would taste good jest now," replied Mad with a famished expression. "I feel as if I had Aaron's clo'es on!" "Archy," said Guy, examining the bear's wounds, "you are the hero of the day: you drew the first blood." "Gracious! I did, didn't I! peppered his muzzle, I swan! Say, didn't I shoot within a mile of him?" Archy appealed triumphantly to Mad, who sneeringly replied that a little charge of bird-shot wasn't any thing. At the head of the lake the bear was disembarked, and the boat cleansed. The boys had done their share of rowing; and it was now Guy's turn. "Get a wagon, and don't wait for me," he said, as he set off. Archy and Mad, leaving Ranger with the bear, went to a farm-house for a team, whilst Guy returned alone with the boat. Alone on that lake in the wilderness. The day was calm; the water was glassy smooth. Duplicate woods enclosed it [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-197.jpg) \- external link  - Page 192. ] all around, --- forests above the surface, and forests inverted below. Not a bird flew over; not a fish leaped; not a sound of life, save the oars plashing and the waves lapping. The excitement of the chase was over; and now Guy had a chance to think. The lake was long and narrow, and broken into straits and inlets by low jagged shores. It seemed the loneliest lake that ever was. Here dismal ledges just put their dark backs above the still water. All up and down the beaches were scattered fragments of brown stone, that gave to the scene a dreary aspect of desolation. Lines of flood-wood lay at highwater mark around the shores, whitening in the sun. The solitude was oppressive: it seemed too utterly savage and lonesome even for the heron and the wild drake. Guy rowed slowly by woody points and little sleeping coves; now in the sun which burnished the lake with fire, and now under the cool shadows of primeval trees. A gloom was on his spirit; and, while the boat seemed floating over the craters of old volcanoes, he felt that his life was also gliding upon awful abysses glassed over with transient illusions. For comfort, he reviewed his late experiences of spirit-power, which had at other times filled him with hope and rejoicing. But now he felt only doubts and vague longings, --- a faintness and gnawing hunger of the soul. A desire to be fed with fresh experiences burned within him. Was it for that purpose that the Powers which ruled his life had brought him here? He heard voices, and, glancing over his shoulder, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-198.jpg) \- external link  - Page 193. ] saw the seeress still sitting on the beach, apart from her companions, musing, and (something whispered) waiting for him. But he remembered Lucy, her fears, and his sacred promise. Strong as his thirst was to taste once more the wine of spiritual influence, he firmly resolved to resist it; and approached the point, fully intending to return the boat, and depart as soon as courtesy would permit. But scarcely had the bow touched the sand, when some one sprang into it. "Push off again!" was spoken rather imperiously by a well-remembered voice. Guy felt a strange excitement throb through his nerves. He was alone with the seeress. There was fascination in the thought. But Lucy? He hesitated. "Do as I say! won't you? I have been waiting all this time. It is what I came here to-day for: I knew you would be here. Quick, before any one comes!" And, as he still declined to act, she seized an oar, and pushed off the boat. When Mad and Archy came with the wagon, they found four hunters sitting around the bear on the beach, talking over the adventure. "Where is your pitchfork?" asked Aaron. "Didn't some one bring it?" said Mad with angry surprise. "Jehiel had it; so did Guy." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-199.jpg) \- external link  - Page 194. ] "But you took it afterwards, and threw it to see it stick in the sand," said Jehiel. Muttering with discontent, but hoping that he should meet Guy bringing the fork, Mad hurried back through the woods. The others did not wait, but, finding that they had more than a wagon-load of bear and dogs and men, set off for town. At every house, they had to stop and exhibit their prize. "What a monster!" said little Doctor Biddikin, perching bareheaded on a wagon-wheel, and looking over. "Most extraordinary! It is the largest bear I ever sor! How did you kill him?" "He got at the least ca'c'lation six bullets and a knife into him, --- not to speak of the dogs, --- 'fore he give up," said Aaron. "Bears are awful contrary 'bout dyin'." "Exceedingly tenacious of life," said the doctor. "You must give me a piece of the meat." "You shall have some, if only for that boy's sake," --- Aaron gave a compassionating glance at poor little Job. "He is starved!" "Starved? that boy? Job starved?" The wee man straightened himself on the wagon-wheel, with his skinny neck outstretched, as if he was going to flap his arms, and crow. "Starved, indeed! If you could see him at his dinner! He is an enormous eater! an enormous eater! Ain't you, Job? Tell the truth, Job!" "Y-a-a-s!" drawled the little wretch with a sickly, inane smile. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-200.jpg) \- external link  - Page 195. ] "Run to the house, Job, and bring the carving-knife! --- An enormous eater!" repeated the doctor. "You must cut us a very large piece, Aaron. But a bad boy!" --- in a whisper, --- "a very bad boy! untruthful, very untruthful!"--- shaking his head and compressing his lips significantly. "He tells lies!" "He has told one," said Aaron. "If I should say I was an enormous eater, now," --- swelling his great chest, --- "folks might believe me. But that boy! or you, Doctor Biddikin!"--- and he humorously took the little man under his arm, lifted him from the wheel, and set him softly, as if he had been an infant, upon the ground. "Poor as ever, I see!" he laughed; while all laughed with him, except the doctor, who put his hands together, with a smirk of offended dignity, and leaned forward on his precise toes, saying, --- "You can hardly call a man poor who owns the largest fortune, probably, in the State." "I meant poor in the ribs," replied Aaron, preparing to drive on. "We all know what a millionnaire you be; but you haven't the heft of a wisp of hay." "I am a wronged and distressed man; I confess that," said the doctor tremulously. "I am a victim of plots. You have wiled my son away, my Madison," --- he shook his shrivelled head with grief and resentment, --- "and you keep him from me by your plots and deceits!" Aaron laughed. "Can't cut the bear now, doctor," he said, and drove on. But Jehiel remained behind to speak a comforting word to the poor old man. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-201.jpg) \- external link  - Page 196. ] "Nobody keeps my son from me, do you say? Don't you believe that! He were always one of the most dutiful boys, save when he were led away by others. My heart is well-nigh broken. If you see him, do send him home: influence him to come back, if you can. And see that I have a piece of that bear, won't you? And, wait a moment!" --- mysteriously: "can't you lend me a couple of shillings for a few days?" Out of pity, Jehiel gave him what change he had, and hurried on. "That's the talk! Laugh Jack!" impishly screamed the crow from the eaves. "Stop your noise, Jack!" "Ha, ha, ha!" said Jack. Angry at he knew not what, the doctor looked round for something to throw at the saucy bird. His eyes lighted upon poor little Job standing in the door-yard, with fear in his face, and a carving implement in his hand. "Ha! come here, sir!" Biddikin concluded that it was Job he was angry at, and not the crow. "Why didn't you bring that knife before? What did you come out and show yourself to the men for, and get me insulted? You villain!" He took him by the ear, which was conveniently long in consequence of frequent and very thorough stretching, and led him by that appendage into the house. Madison came presently down the road, and partly because he heard Job scream, but chiefly because he was hungry, resolved to give his parent a call. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-202.jpg) \- external link  - Page 197. ] "Hello!" he shouted, bursting into the room where Job was undergoing fustigation. Biddikin started with alarm; but the crow, flying in with the visitor, cried jubilantly, --- "Mad's come home! Laugh, Jack! Ha, ha! ha, ha!" Upon which the doctor, recognizing his affectionate boy, rushed to embrace him. "Look out there!" said Mad in his rowdyish guttural: "you'll git hooked with the little horns!" And he aimed the pitchfork at the paternal bosom. "Madison! my son! my long-lost, my darling boy! is it you?" "Wal, I bet!" "Give me one embrace!" "Not a darned embrace!" "Madison! my son! what do you mean?" gibbered Biddikin. "What for do you come at me with a fork?" "What for did you go at that boy with a club?" "I --- I were just threatening him." "You struck him! --- Job," said the junior, "didn't he strike you?" "Y-a-a-s!" gasped poor little Job. "Job!" cried the senior, "dare you say I struck you?" "N-o-o!" gasped poor little Job. "Job, look here! didn't I see him strike you with that broom-stick?" "Y-a-a-s!" faltered the terrified Job. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-203.jpg) \- external link  - Page 198. ] "Job, speak the truth!" vociferated the doctor menacingly: " did I strike you with the broomstick?" "N-o-o!" said Job. "There! now remember," cried Biddikin: "once for all, did I strike you?" Job caught the junior's eye, and, concluding that he was most to be feared, gasped out, --- "Y-a-a-s!" "You mean," cried the senior, "that you deserved to be struck." "Y-a-a-s," came feebly from the boy's starved and bewildered soul. "What for did you deserve it?" "For telling lies," he answered like a child reciting his catechism under trying circumstances. "And what do we do with bad boys that tell lies?" "Lick 'em!" was the correct response. "Ha, ha! lick 'em!" screamed Jack. "And what becomes of bad boys that tell lies, when they die?" "Go to hell!" was the formal answer. "Go to hell!" screamed Jack. "And what becomes of old sinners who learn 'em to tell lies?" demanded Mad in great wrath and disgust. "You treat that boy just as you used to me. You licked me one day for lying, and the next for not lying, Do you wonder I despise and hate you? --- you stuffed mouse-skin! you [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-204.jpg) \- external link  - Page 199. ] galvanized toadstool! I'm bad enough, thanks to you; but I swear I'll take Job's part. Come here, Job!" Job started timorously. "Don't you go, Job!" Job started back with a gasp. "You've no business with Job." "Haven't I? What'll become of him then? What become of t'other boy?" asked the junior with the expression of a laughing hyena. "Say, you dressed-up drumstick! what become of Martin?" Biddikin recoiled before that keen, knowing, savage, malicious look. "Martin --- he ran away; you know, you know, he ran away!" "That skeleton of a boy, with them legs of his, run away?" jeered the junior. "Look here!" --- he lifted his malign, accusatory finger, --- "I know as well as you that he never left this house." "'Sh!" interposed the excited senior. "Job, Job, go to the woods for chips, right away." He thrust the boy out. "Madison, why do you talk in this insane manner?" "'Cause I know! and, if you don't take care, I'll blow on you!" "I thought you had more sense than to catch up what that reckless medium said!" "'Twan't what she said, but the way you looked, that told the story." "I looked!" articulated the frightened little man, "did I --- did others notice?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-205.jpg) \- external link  - Page 200. ] "They might, if they had suspected what I did." "It's all wrong: there is nothing in it, I assure you!" said Biddikin most emphatically. "And you must take care what you say, or you'll make mischief." "Wal, I ain't going to kick up a row: only let Job alone, and give me something to eat," said Madison. "That sounds like my son! Sit down: I'll see what I've got." Biddikin ransacked an empty cupboard "Come now, Madison, stay at home: we'll live like princes here, --- like princes!" --- bringing forth a piece of cold corn-cake. "Like princes!" echoed Mad with scornful laughter. "And is this the grub of princes?" blowing the unsavory crumbs from his lips, with intent to hit the paternal face. "They have promised me five dollars a week to live on while they are digging, and a quarter of the money found, if I will only sign papers," said the doctor. "I've stood out so far. I know too much for 'em. I'm suspicious of papers. They have got six thousand dollars pledged, and they are only waiting for me. I think I may consent." "Oh, what a fool if you don't!" cried the junior. "Five dollars a week!" "And a quarter of the money: that'll be a brilliant fortune, a very brilliant fortune! --- What's that?" "A pop-gun Guy let me take. I want to hide it. 'Twill come in use some time. I'll tell him it's lost." And Madison concealed the pistol in a corner of the cupboard. "It will be safe there: I won't say a word," said the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-206.jpg) \- external link  - Page 201. ] doctor with a shrewd smile. "Come, my son! won't you stay? Haven't you got tired of being a servant and degrading yourself?" "When you are having your five dollars a week, and can afford better fodder than this, then'll be time for you to talk." And shouldering his fork, in spite of threats and importunities, the youth put his cap saucily on one side of his head, and went off, swaggering, and munching johnny-cake. The bear had by this time arrived at Jehiel's house. Mrs. Hedge saw her husband, and uttered a cry of joy. But Lucy's heart contracted; for, among all the hunters returning safe to their homes with their trophy, she could not see her lover. Did he not know how anxious she would be? and would he not hasten to re-assure her if he was unhurt? Surely; else he did not love her. Hannah set out bread and milk and berries for her husband's refreshment. As he ate, he related the adventures of the day. Whilst he was talking, he happened to look out, and saw young Biddikin going by with his pitchfork. "Perhaps Mad has seen him!" He ran to the door. "Hello, Biddikin! Where's Guy?" "In a fancy place!" Mad laughed, and entered the yard. "Did you see him when you went back?" Jehiel inquired, while Lucy listened. "Wal, I bet! And wished I was where he was." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-207.jpg) \- external link  - Page 202. ] Seeing indications of something to eat, Mad came boldly into the house. He was a little abashed at sight of Lucy, whom he addressed, however, with off-hand politeness as he sat down. "I guess," said he, "I may as well hold my tongue about Guy!" significantly alluding to her interest in him. "Is he coming home?" "I don't see it!" Biddikin chuckled. "Not right away, I guess! Oh, that young woman has got a devil in her! Did you see how she looked at him? Don't care if I do take a bowl of milk! Guy see her over to our house when we had a setting there. She baited her hook for him then: I had my eyes peeled! Wal, berries be good!" and he helped himself liberally. Jehiel and his wife wished him a thousand miles away. But he remained, eating without invitation, and talking without being questioned. "I didn't tell you where Guy was when I went for the fork. He was in the boat. Good reason why he wanted to take it back there! Sly, Guy is! He was having a fancy time; bet yer life on that! Who do ye s'pose was with him? 'Twas the young woman with the devil in her! Ha, ha, ha!" Lucy vanished from the room like a ghost. CHRISTINA. --- LUCY. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-208.jpg) \- external link  - Page 203. ] PIQUED at Guy's hesitancy, the seeress with a petulant gesture tossed back the oar. "You are not a very gallant youth, Mr. Bannington!" "You are an exceedingly charming woman, Miss Freze!" "What do you tell me that for?" "To win a reputation for gallantry!" She regarded him with a very slight disdainful curl of her imperious lip. "You don't wish to accompany me? Speak honestly!" "Honestly, then, I am tired." "Is that all?" "And hungry." He folded his arms gravely. The boat was floating from the shore. For a minute she remained silent, fixing her dilating eyes upon him, as if she would drink the inmost meaning of his soul. Then, with a wilful, radiant laugh, she shook her jewelled finger at him: --- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-209.jpg) \- external link  - Page 204. ] "For one hour you are mine! If you are tired, I can row. If you are hungry, I have secret bread reserved for this emergency;" and she uncovered cheese and sandwiches in a napkin. He took the napkin; she took the oars. The delicate but vigorous little hands managed them not unskilfully; and with an easy motion the boat glided through water smooth as satin, under the cool green forest-shadows. "If ever I determine on suicide," said she, "I shall come and throw myself into this lake." "Do so," said Guy; "for that would give a fine finishing touch to its weird and sombre character. ` Suicide Pond,  ' --- that would sound well. What is your given name?" "Christina." "The place where you throw yourself in shall be called ` Christina's Leap. ' I'll see to it." She leaned over the side, gazing down intently, and speaking with melancholy softness. "It looks cool and pleasant in there; and life is feverish and bitter. What is there to keep one here in this world?" "There is a good deal to keep me," Guy answered. "I sometimes think the mere breath of life is joy enough. This wild nature, with its clouds, its waters, its crags, fills me full and full! I've not done with it yet: there's juice left and wild honey! Even this sandwich is a solid satisfaction." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-210.jpg) \- external link  - Page 205. ] "You are in the external yet," she replied. "You will some time get beyond that, and feel as I do." "That is to say, you have progressed a good deal beyond me. I find a vast amount of cant and spiritual self-conceit among mediums, which I hoped you were free from. `You are in the external yet; when you have had certain experiences I have had, when you have progressed to a higher plane, when you get to see things from my stand-point;' and so forth." "Let me say what is true, won't you? I have been where you are" --- "That's it, that's the style!" said Guy. "The world was as much to me as it is to you," she went on, regardless of his sarcasm. "And, even now, I can laugh and dance and enjoy; but the only real consolation I have is in the communion of spirits." "The communion of spirits is a glorious thing, if it is true; because it demonstrates that life is perpetual; that the soul, and love, and the sense of joy and beauty, do not cease at death, but continue forever." "Then what is the fear of death? Come," she said coaxingly, "fall overboard with me! I'll do it!" "Thank you, I'd rather be excused. This world is tolerably well got up, on a good plan; and I'm not so sure of being ready for another. I am a child yet: here I have nestled long, and I have no wish to be weaned from the familiar, dear old bosom." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-211.jpg) \- external link  - Page 206. ] "You will talk very differently a year from now. You will be a tired child then, and ask to be put to rest." "Perhaps. But, for the present, this blue roof and spacious play-ground for me! This water, this air, this bread and cheese, suffice. Nectar and ambrosia by and by. Hopes and heart-beats, questions and longings of the soul, the endless curiosity, --- I haven't yet lost my relish for these: have you?" "What is all that without companions?" she replied. "Have you none?" "I have been looking longer than ever Diogenes did for a man;" she gave Guy a significant glance. "I wonder if I have found one at last." "Don't you find any women?" "I hate women!" "Indeed! I judged as much. The more intensely woman a woman is, the more she hates her own sex, I believe. It isn't so with men: there is friendship among men." "Do you know what has brought us together to-day, Guy Bannington?" "No; but I should like to know." "Then I will tell you something which you won't laugh at. It was written through my hand this morning that I must come to the picnic, and that I should meet you here." "That is singular," said Guy; "for I have not been near this lake for a year, and should not have come to-day but for the bear." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-212.jpg) \- external link  - Page 207. ] "What is more singular," replied the seeress, "upon the same paper on which I was made to write that, I drew the picture of your bear." "When was that?" "At eight o'clock this morning. The date is on the paper. The paper is in my portfolio, in my room at the hotel." "I will accompany you to the hotel, enter your room with you, and give you fifty dollars to produce that paper!" "I'll do it for less than that. Here is the key to my portfolio. You shall go with me, and open it if you will grant me one little favor." "What?" "I don't know yet what it will be; but you are to promise." Guy promised. At the instant, Lucy's image rose before him, pale, beseeching, sad. "I like you," said Christina, moving to his side. "Prim, conventional people are the death of me. I want to be lawless: I want the companionship of lawless, glorious souls. You will let me do as I please?" "Probably; for I am very amiable." "You amiable? You are violent, impetuous, domineering; and you can be cruel." "Shall I tell you what your are?" "Yes." "You are fitful, fiery, scornful; and you can be vastly impudent." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-213.jpg) \- external link  - Page 208. ] "You don't dare to say you like me!" she laughed. Guy looked grave. He didn't answer. His thoughts were far away, and his heart was troubled. Christina sat down at his feet, silent, very quiet. Her breast heaved with a long, deep sigh. Her head bent pensively until her cheek touched his knee. In spite of himself, he felt a thrill of something more than interest, --- a melting sensation towards her, tender and yearning. "What are you there for?" he asked coldly. "My place is at your feet." And she lifted her eyes to his face with a burning look, full of wonder and worship. "Christina!" he exclaimed, trying to remove her. In vain: she kept her place. "My lord and my king!" she said with upturned face, and such a smile as he had seen upon it at their first meeting, sweet, enraptured, divine. Late that evening, Guy mounted the dark stairway noiselessly, opened Lucy's door, and entered. No light, no sound, within. He groped his way to the bed-chamber, and passed his hand over the pillow. It had not been pressed. "Lucy!" he called; and the roar of the brook in the midnight answered him. He returned to the little sitting-room, wondering, listening, straining his eyes in the darkness, and thinking of Lucy with pity and repentance. "Guy!" breathed a faint voice from the sofa, --- a tender, suffering, and loving voice. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-214.jpg) \- external link  - Page 209. ] He knelt by her side. She put up her arms, drew his head to her bosom, and burst into sobs of anguish. "Don't cry, don't cry, Lucy! What is the matter? I am here." "I have been waiting so long, so long!" She wept, from a heart wrung with misery. "Oh! how could you leave me so? how could you? I thought you would never come again!" "Have you so little confidence in me?" said Guy softly. "If you could have known all I have thought, all I have felt, this long day, this long, long night," she broke forth bitterly, "you surely would have come! But you were in the boat with that woman, and I was forgotten!" That was a stroke. Guy sat chilled and dumb, answering nothing. Lucy hushed her sobs, waiting for him to acquit himself, and re-assure her of his love. Only the brook moaned. "Speak! say something!" she entreated in a voice full of pain and passionate appealing. "I am wretched, wretched, wretched! Have mercy on me! have mercy!" "I have broken my promise," said he, not tenderly and soothingly, but frigidly and perversely. "I have sinned. I am unworthy of your pure affection." "Oh, never, never!" she cried. "Think what I am to you and never, never say you are unworthy of my affection!" Guy gnashed his teeth together with fiery inward thoughts, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-215.jpg) \- external link  - Page 210. ] knowing how he had wronged Lucy, and how he wronged her still with his stubborn icy will, which even love could not thaw. "My vision, my prophetic vision!" she exclaimed despairingly. "As I lay waiting here in the dark, I saw faces around me, like laughing fiends, and heard voices saying, `Lost, lost, lost!' In the dark and silence I kept seeing the faces, I kept hearing the voices, --- `Lost, lost, lost!' --- with the roaring of the brook. I prayed that they would stop. I entreated the brook to stop: it was torturing me. I know now what it meant. You wish to be free from me. I will not hold you; I will not, though I die! O my father, my father! you are all I have left: come to me, father!" And she threw herself upon her face. "God! God!" groaned Guy, "how you make me suffer! I cannot be free from you: Heaven knows, as you should know, that I have neither the power nor the wish to be." "Oh! then, when you said, so coldly, that you had broken your promise, why couldn't you add one word, one little syllable, to soften that cruel sentence, just to assure me that you did not mean to break it?" "Because I thought you ought to have been satisfied of that without waiting to be told so." "Then you did not willingly break it?" she cried eagerly. "So far from that, it was most unexpectedly and quite unwillingly that I did so." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-216.jpg) \- external link  - Page 211. ] With a cry of joy, she flung herself into his arms. He was softened: he strained her to his heart. But how was he to explain? He knew well that she would not regard as he did the conduct of Christina. Men have boundless toleration for women: women have none for each other. Men excuse, women accuse, --- especially when the question is of those feminine foibles which flatter the masculine vanity. Guy looked upon Christina as a person of keen perceptions, who had seen enough of the hypocrisies and corruptions of society to despise and defy it. She had thrown off its laws, without, however, arriving at the supreme law within herself. Such a woman is always interesting to a man fond of adventure and of the exercise of power; and, in Christina's case, her mediumship invested her with superior attractions. Guy felt that their relation was of a spiritual character, and that they might benefit each other without wronging Lucy. But, clear as all this was to his own mind, he knew that it would be impossible to make Lucy believe a word of it. He stated simply, therefore, that the seeress had offered him sandwiches, when sandwiches were very acceptable; and that she had interested him in a spiritual phenomenon with which he was personally connected. And, passing over circumstances which he thought it unwise to relate, he hastened to call Lucy's attention to a mysterious bit of paper which he brought to her in one hand, with the previously lighted lamp in the other. Lucy read the following sentence in pencil: --- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-217.jpg) \- external link  - Page 212. ] "Go to the lake to-day. The leader, G. B., will be sent to you there." Above this was the date. Beneath it was a drawing of an animal. She studied the paper long with her red eyes, while Guy urged her to tell him what she made of it. "It is plain," she admitted, "that the drawing is intended for a bear; but it isn't so plain that it was done in the morning before she saw you or the bear at the lake," she added with perceptible scorn. "Neither would I readily believe it," said Guy; "though she told me of the written prediction, which had been left, she said, at the Mt. Solomon Hotel. She gave me a key, and invited me to go with her and her friends this evening, and witness the verification of the story. I was curious enough to go. We all went together to her room. There, in my presence, she opened a desk, in which lay a portfolio. `Unlock that,' said she, `with the key I gave you.' I unlocked it, and with my own hands took out this paper." Once more, Lucy studied the writing and the picture. She was pale; her lips quivered; she was evidently not yet convinced. There must have been some legerdemain; or it was all a mere coincidence. But, whatever it was, it stirred up again her jealousy and scorn. "She calls you the leader! " --- flinging away the sheet. "And what if she did meet you there? I don't see the use of a special revelation on the subject!" "Unhappily, there are many things you do not see." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-218.jpg) \- external link  - Page 213. ] "Unhappily, there is one thing I do see!" she exclaimed, pacing the floor with agitation and tears. "I see that there is a plot to dupe you, and it is succeeding. That woman is doing her utmost to take you from me; and you are only too willing to go!" "Lucy!" said Guy warningly. "I shall say no more," --- wiping her tears. "Go, if you wish to. I shall exact no more promises to have them broken afterwards, when my heart will be broken with them. My happiness has been short; I might have known it would be; and I have no desire to prolong it at the expense of your freedom." She fell upon the sofa. Guy stood before her, looking down upon her frowningly, gnawing his lip to control the fiery words that rose to it. "And you give me my freedom?" he said calmly, after a pause. "Freely and entirely." "I thank you, both for you and for myself. By leaving me free, you will find that you make me more your own. Whatever I do, I shall remain true to you: I shall always return to you." His tones were full of truth and tenderness. She could not resist him. The clouds were breaking; her sunny spirit was shining forth. She reached up her arms, and love and sweet forgiveness united them once more --- for a little while. IN THE FOREST. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-219.jpg) \- external link  - Page 214. ] A FEW days later, Guy received the subjoined note: --- "You promised to grant me a favor. This is what I am directed to require of you. Find yourself at Dr. Biddikin's to-morrow at three, P.M. There you will meet a disagreeable little old woman, with yellow hair and a sour temper, named Christina. " It bore date the previous evening. The appointed time was at hand. Now, it so happened that Lucy was expecting him to accompany her that afternoon on a ramble in the woods. Guy was in a dilemma. His hunger for spiritual excitement decided him. He despatched Ann Maria with a note informing Lucy that he would be unable to fulfil his engagement with her, and hastened to meet Christina. On the grass before Doctor Biddikin's house sat little Job, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-220.jpg) \- external link  - Page 215. ] amusing his appetite by nibbling raw corn, and diverting his mind by letting Jack pick his pockets. At the approach of Guy he jumped up, and looked as if afraid of being whipped for something. "He ain't to hum! --- gone up on the mountain!" he answered before he was asked. "Is there nobody in the house? " "Nobody but me and Jack;" and he smiled a sickly smile. "Is that a joke?" said Guy. "Y-a-a-s!" drawled poor little scared Job, pleading guilty without so much as knowing what a joke was. The crow then flew to Guy, hooked himself to his waistcoat, and began to pick his pockets, crying, "Corn, corn!" "Go away, you rascal!" said Guy. "Go 'way, you rascal!" echoed Jack. And he searched with his beak one pocket after another, gossiping in an unintelligible jargon. "Wants something to eat!" said Job. "Don't he have enough?" "N-o-o-o!" "Don't you?" "Y-a-a-s! I'm a 'normous eater!" grinned the little wretch. "Did Doctor Biddikin tell you to say so?" "Y-a-a-s!" "And do you know what a 'normous eater is?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-221.jpg) \- external link  - Page 216. ] "Y-a-a-s! he nors things!" "Hello!" laughed Guy: "we have etymologists among us!" "Et a what amongst us?" said Job, whose mind was on victuals. "Corn, corn!" said the crow, hanging by Guy's pockets. "Did you have any of the bear?" " He had some!" --- meaning the doctor. "Didn't he give you any?" "N-o-o-o!" drawled Job. "He got me out of the poor-'us. Said 'twas too good for poor-'us' boys." The simplicity with which he attested this miserable truth would have moved a harder heart than Guy's. "Come here, my lad!" He placed his hand kindly on the boy's shoulder. "I'll see about that bear-meat: you shall have some. Does Biddikin whip you pretty often?" "Y-a-a-s!" and Job nestled to his side like one who for the first time in his life had found a protector. "What for?" "'Cause I'm a bad boy. I tells lies!" "Poor little Job!" said Guy. "Does he whip you hard?" "Y-a-a-s! But he said, `Tell 'em no, if folks ask.'" "Whips you for lying, and then teaches you to lie! It's too bad, Job! Where are your parents?" "What's parents?" "Merciful Heaven! don't you know what parents are?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-222.jpg) \- external link  - Page 217. ] "Y-a-a-s!" with a gleam of intelligence, --- "Adam and Eve!" He remembered his catechism. "I don't mean your first, but your last parents, Job; your father." "Never had no father." "Nor mother, either?" "She died," said simple little Job, "in the poor-'us'. Then he come and took me." "What do you do here?" "Git sticks in the woods, and wash dishes." "What does he do?" "Eats the victuals, and licks me." Too much interested in Job to look out for Jack, Guy did not perceive that the thief was tugging at his watch-chain. He had unhooked it at one end, and was now bent on detaching it at the other. Suddenly out came the watch. Guy made a snatch to recover it, but too late: the pick-pocket was off with his booty. He flew to the eaves, where he laughed and chattered, trying to pull the chain to pieces, and calling out, "Corn, corn!" "When he steals any thing, you can't git it agin," was Job's comforting observation. "He'll hide it somewheres." "Is there a gun?" said Guy, in whose countenance Jack's doom was written. "N-o-o-o; but there's a ladder." It lay on the ground by the fence. Guy placed it against [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-223.jpg) \- external link  - Page 218. ] the house, and mounted, cane in hand. Jack scolded; Guy flattered. "Go 'way!" said Jack. "Why, Jack!" said Guy, holding the cane behind him. "Jack mustn't steal! pretty Jack! pious Jack!" "Let Jack alone!" screamed Jack; and, catching up his booty, he flew with it over the roof. Before Guy could get down and run round the house, he was out of sight. "Time flies --- in a rather too literal sense!" said Guy. "Where is he, Job?" "Guess he went to the woods," said Job. Beyond an intervening ridge or two rose the woody mountain-side, whose vast and tangled wildernesses foreboded the hopelessness of a search in that direction. However, Guy saw nothing else to be done; and, as Christina had not arrived, he set off in the pursuit. Over hill and through hollow he ran, till he came to a brook, which he was crossing, when a voice called him. Looking down the stream, he saw, a few rods below, Christina. "Am I late?" she said. "I got away from the company as soon as I could. They are all upon the mountain. What time is it?" "Time!" echoed Guy. "Everybody will ask me the time! If you had kept your appointment, you would have saved me very valuable time which I lost waiting for you." And he related his adventure. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-224.jpg) \- external link  - Page 219. ] "It was to teach you," said she, "how riches take to themselves wings." She was radiant: she laughed bewitchingly. "The crow shall be called procrastination; for he is the thief of time. Give up the chase, and follow me: I am of more value than many watches." "A watch reminds us of the time; you cause us to forget it," said Guy. "All the better!" she replied with charming sweetness. "Let my face be your dial, and I will tick to you golden moments! Come!" "What is the enterprise?" "A tramp in the woods. We shall want a shovel. Go to that old cellar yonder, and you will find one." He brought a spade, and they entered the woods. "Sit here," said she, "till I have recovered my breath;" and they rested on a rock by the brook-side. "Do you know what I want of you?" "To dig sassafras-roots, or to help you bury a dead lover." And he added, looking at her fixedly, --- "`Oh your sweet eyes, your low replies! A great enchantress you may be: But there was that across his throat Which you had hardly cared to see!'" She started. "Why do you look at me so? What do you mean?" "I was only quoting Tennyson: --- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-225.jpg) \- external link  - Page 220. ] "`Lady Clara Vere de Vere, There stands a spectre in your hall; The guilt of blood is at your door; You changed a noble heart to gall!'" With a look of pain she sprang from the rock, walked swiftly a dozen paces, then, turning, stood before him. "What do you mean?" she repeated imperiously. "Tell me quick! Tell me, I say!" stamping her foot. "Why, my lady," said Guy, surprised and curious, "I was only reciting poetry." "But what put it in your head?" "I don't know." "You do! You have heard --- Am I a Lady Clara?" "By my soul, I am beginning to think so!" She put up her hand, turning from him with an expression of misery; then, bending over the brook, she washed her hands and bathed her brow. "I'll tell you all about it some time," --- drying her face with her handkerchief. "It's a strange story; but I am not a De Vere. Come, bring your shovel." "Is there really a corpse?" "Yes." "What an enigma you are! You almost make me think you are in earnest." "I am altogether in earnest. But 'tis not my dead, thank Heaven!" "To be buried?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-226.jpg) \- external link  - Page 221. ] "No: to be unburied." "Explain yourself, or I won't stir an inch." And Guy threw down the spade, folding his arms, and sitting on the rock. "Listen, then." She came and sat by his side. "The first time I was in Biddikin's house --- you remember?" "Yes: you spoke of disagreeable influences, and of some person having died there." "I saw the dead body of a child, and the living spirit of the child standing by, pointing at it. The same picture has been presented to me several times since. Then have followed visions of Doctor Biddikin. Now I see him carry the dead child in his arms; and now he is digging with a shovel in the woods, where we are going to dig." "Christina! And is it for this you have sent for me here?" "I did not know what it was for when I wrote to you. I did not know until to-day how I was to get here. Then a party was unexpectedly got up. I came with them. We went up on the mountain. There I was trying to obtain some impressions with regard to the money, when I saw distinctly a peculiar bank in the woods; the body of the child buried by the roots of a tree; on the other side a rock; the brook running close by; a great ravine below. And the words came to me, `Go and search.' I stole away from the company, and met you." "I fear there is something in it," said Guy. "One day, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-227.jpg) \- external link  - Page 222. ] when I was sitting with our little housemaid, Ann Maria, a spirit came and rapped out the name Martin. He gave his age, --- ten years; and said he died at Doctor Biddikin's. This was all I could get from him. I had never known of such a boy by name, and I inquired of Mad about him. `I know who you mean,' said he. `That was Martin: he ran away.' I asked the particulars of the running-away. `Once when I had been off,' he said, `and came home, he was gone, and we never heard of him afterwards: that's all I know.'" "But not all his father knows," said Christina. "It has an ugly look," said Guy. "But what's the use of meddling with the affair? I've no ghoulish appetite to be scratching up dead bodies." "It is necessary the body should be found, or at least sought," replied Christina. "Perhaps these things are all illusions. We can't have too much proof, whether they are true or false. I have seen the buried child; I have seen the buried money. If we can find the one, as it has been shown to me, why not the other?" "How did you come by the shovel?" "That's as much a mystery as any thing. I knew nothing of any shovel till I sent you --- or the spirits sent you --- to the old cellar for it." "I swear, it takes faith to believe these things! Come, now, with your magic, find me my watch: then I will believe; then I will do whatever you require of me." "Will you help me dig for the body?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-228.jpg) \- external link  - Page 223. ] "Yes, and for the money too, provided we find the body." "Remember your words. Take the bawble!" and she drew the lost watch from her bosom. Lucy had all things prepared for the anticipated ramble, when Guy's letter came with its shock of disappointment. She sat down to sew. But her heart was not in her work; it was not in that narrow room: it had been all day among the trees, by the watercourse; and it drew her thither now, though she must go alone. Out into the woods, therefore, she stole, where the brook sang its loud gushing song; where the bluish golden sunlight barred the hazy atmosphere lodged in the forest-tops; where leafy clusters of scarlet and orange and pale gold were beginning to variegate the summer foliage; where the ghosts of happy days and dead loves came out of the gloom to meet her, wrapping her heart also in soft, sun-barred haze, and singing to her with voices far off, veiled and mournful. The cool depths of the forest stretched away before her with an awful yet sweet aspect of loneliness. Tender thoughts, tantalizing fancies, something delicious and vague and evanescent, she knew not what, seemed to lurk in every nook, and flee at her approach. "O Happiness!" she said, "it is you I am always playing hide-and-seek with, --- you flitting, fleeting shade!" She reached the rock where Guy had discovered her retreat one ever-memorable morning. She sat down again [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-229.jpg) \- external link  - Page 224. ] by the torrent, and recalled that time, and the changes since that time; gazing into the bubbling and beaded water; gazing into the vast and misty sea of the future, towards which she was drifting, drifting, on the waves of another stream. Perturbed, pierced with the keen agony of doubt, she rose, and threaded the forest. Farther than ever before, she advanced to meet the brook coming down. Its gladness and beauty reminded her of scenes, which she had heard Guy describe, far up in the gorge of the mountain. Pain and desire urged her on. She came out upon an upland field. Before her stretched the eastern range, all glimmering in blue and gold. There, coiling high and white, wound the snake-like mountain-road. On the right were the columnar crags, with the pyramidal ruins beneath, just visible above billowy verdure. Between the crags and the road was a thick-wooded section of the hill, through which a branch of the brook descended. She felt a wild impulse to visit it. She set out in haste. All breathless and trembling, she reached the jungly recesses of the gorge. There was no path; and she had to make her way through closely interlocked branches of young hemlocks, which harassed her with their hedge-like entanglements, and low, dead, sharply projecting limbs. On these she tore her clothes and wounded her hands. But she persevered, until there appeared before her a hushed and dusky greenwood, rising on the mountain-side with its lofty crested trunks and dim spaces. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-230.jpg) \- external link  - Page 225. ] She advanced with feet that hesitated at their own soft rustling tread. Above her the spotted sunshine slept like leopards on the boughs. The plaint of waterfalls was just audible; towards which she made her way. And now, arrived at the brink of a steep bank, a snowy wonder met her eyes. It was a cascade, bright and curved, dividing the hillside with its flashing cimeter. She uttered a cry of delight, which fell back heavily upon her heart at the thought which instantly followed, --- that Guy should be with her there, but was not. She did not linger. Wonders still beyond awaited her. An almost unbroken chain of waterfalls led her on by a hundred links of discovery and surprise. Few had ever penetrated that secret spot. Female footprints had never before pressed those mosses and old leaves; eyes of woman had never before gazed upon that necklace of cascades dropped from the mountain's breast. Every step was a rapture and a regret. How beautiful! But why had she come without Guy? Sometimes she climbed the stairway of the brook, in the cool scissure of the rocks. From profound recesses, forever chill and dim, she looked up at the sunshine on the leaning trees a hundred feet above her head. She imprinted the dank gravel and sand of mossy nooks; she flitted like a bird over the broad sloping ledges; she pulled herself up steep places by the boughs of trees. At times, by her feet, or deep in the fissure beneath her, or now high on the rocks [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-231.jpg) \- external link  - Page 226. ] above, the Protean water shifted and shone. It gleamed far off like a white statue in a dark niche. It broke into foam and spray on jutting crags, and gathered itself together again in tremulous, surprised pools. Behind screens of foliage it danced like nymphs in snowy drapery. It dripped in a thousand slender threads from long moss-fringes, veiling the blind black front of some Cyclopean rock. It lurked dark and shuddering among the great bowlders and in slimy clefts. Down long, slant grooves it slid and crawled like cream. It rippled a magic ribbon from the lip of the ledge, as if the hill had "oped its ponderous and marble jaws" to rival the conjuror's art; and now, through craggy teeth, it gushed like milk. Weary at length, Lucy laid herself down upon the roots of a great tree that overleaned the chasm. There she reclined, listening to the never-ceasing plash and drizzle of the water, and watching a silver sheet poured over a broad shelf into a misty cave below; when into the murmurous solitude came a sound like human voices. She started, lifted her cheek from her hand, looked all around, but saw no one. Again, --- clear, ringing voices! And now she perceived, emerging from the wilderness above, two figures. They were descending the opposite bank. From root to root, by saplings and shrubs, they let themselves down into the cavern. Leaping from the edge of the solid, water-worn wall, one of them --- a man --- landed upon the gravelly floor, and, reaching up, took in his arms the other, --- a woman, --- whom he placed by his side. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-232.jpg) \- external link  - Page 227. ] They sat down on a fragment of rock. The mist of the cascade enveloped them. The agitated waters of the basin rippled at their feet. All around were upheaved strata and overhanging trees; on the roots of one of which lay Lucy, stunned with jealousy and despair. THE CAVERN OF THE CASCADE. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-233.jpg) \- external link  - Page 228. ] ENTERING the woods on their strange errand, Guy and Christina had not proceeded far by the brook-side when the seeress paused. It was a dismal place. Dark hemlocks and spruces thickly overshadowed it. Below it opened a black ravine, into which the brook rushed with hollow murmurs. On the brink was a huge bowlder overgrown with lichens. A birch-tree was near by. Between the rock and the birch Christina stood, her features pallid, her hands cold and rigidly closed, her body shudderingly convulsed. "This is the spot," she said in a voice unlike her own. "Here dig." Guy leaned upon his spade by the rock, watching her, appalled by her preternatural aspect and the sepulchral significance of her words. He had no heart for the work: he did not move to obey. "Dig!" she repeated with authority. "Under her feet" --- as if it were another speaking --- "lie the bones of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-234.jpg) \- external link  - Page 229. ] murdered Martin. At her side stands the living Martin, together with a numerous company who have brought you here for this work. Lose no time, but dig!" Guy marked the spot with the spade. She stepped aside, and, after a few spasmodic movements, threw off the influences that were upon her. "It is awful!" said she. "Can you stand there, and feel nothing?" "I feel creeping sensations not agreeable to the flesh. Let the dead rest." "Do you believe any thing in it?" whispered Christina, pale and excited. "Not much. I can't discover that the ground here has ever been disturbed. We'll see." Guy thrust in the spade. It struck solid stone. "There is the ledge," said he, with a feeling of relief. "There is not depth enough of soil for a grave." "Are we a couple of fools?" cried Christina. "'Tis the first time I have ever had such clear and strong impressions, and been deceived. Be sure of the ledge." He thrust in the spade again and again, and still found, a few inches beneath the surface of the soil, a sub-surface of rock. Christina sank upon the ground, dismayed. "What do you think of me?" "I think you have been mistaken; and I am not sorry," he frankly answered. "Oh! but am I not guilty of a shallow piece of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-235.jpg) \- external link  - Page 230. ] imposture?" she said bitterly. "Come away. Once duped is enough. I shall never trust my impressions again. I am angry and ashamed." "Hello!" said Guy. He had struck in the spade in another place. "There is no ledge here!" He threw off the dirt rapidly, and discovered that what he had mistaken for the ledge was only a large flat stone. He now removed his coat, and fell to work in earnest. The slab was soon tumbled over upon the ground. It was tolerably easy digging for about a foot farther; when he struck another slab, similar to the first, but of smaller dimensions. From this he scraped the dirt, and stopped to rest. "You promised, that, while I was digging, you would tell me how you came by the watch." "There was not much witchraft about that. I saw Jack flying with something into the woods. He sat on a limb, and tried to break the chain. `Come here, Jack!' said I; and immediately he flew towards me, and dropped the watch at my feet." "But there was witchcraft in it!" exclaimed Guy. "Such things happen only to you. Birds and beasts, and spirits of the earth and air, do your bidding. Christina, I as firmly believe that the dead boy lies under this stone as that I stand on it!" He recommenced digging. The second slab was soon taken out. Beneath it the soil was soft and light. He threw up a fragment of rotten cloth. Whilst Christina was examining it, he continued to dig. Suddenly he stopped. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-236.jpg) \- external link  - Page 231. ] "Never any thing more in this world or the next shall astonish me! I believe in ghosts and prophecy! Look!" "What is it? cried Christina. "Hair?" "Human hair, Christina!" "Horrible! horrible!" "Just a little tuft," said Guy; "once flaxen, and once a wavy lock on Martin's head! Once his mother combed and curled it, and thought it pretty. I am sick at heart." "Let us be satisfied!" she whispered. "I am satisfied. Why uncover this dreadful thing? Let's throw back the dirt, go home, and hold our tongues." "Scrape away a little dirt there;" and she dropped a pebble. The spade rubbed something hard, which was not stone. Shortly after, Guy got up out of the pit, and leaned against the rock. For a long time they did not speak, but only looked at each other. The wind, rising, shook the great trees over them, and the brook still fell with sullen plash into the ravine. "Is it not dreadful?" said Christina. "I was thinking of another who stood here once; of the night when he `bore his dread burden down here,'" said Guy. "There was no moon. The woods were black and awful. He dug in the darkness to the dirge of the wind and the water. It sounded to him like the wail of a lost soul." "I pity him!" said Christina. "But how short-sighted! Why didn't he tumble the body down into the ravine? There [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-237.jpg) \- external link  - Page 232. ] it might never have been discovered; or, if it had been, it would have appeared that the boy had fallen from the bank, and been killed." "Perhaps he brought it here with that purpose. Perhaps he flung it down there, and fled. But the staring horror, naked to the eye of God, would not let him rest. Night and day it haunted him; day and night he saw it tumbled down there in the water among the rocks. He came at last, and covered it up out of sight, and placed over it these slabs to prevent the wild beasts from digging it up. Perhaps the act of burial did, in some sort, relieve his soul. I hope it did. What a heart he must carry in his bosom, at the best!" "In his heart, not here, the dead is buried!" sighed Christina. "Not for all the world would I have such a sepulchre in my breast!" Guy answered. After that he shovelled back the earth; but, instead of replacing the stones as he had found them, he set them up, one at the head, the other at the foot, of the little grave. "It is finished!" said Christina. "Let us wash our hands of this corruption, and cleanse our minds of the memory of it." "Come with me," said Guy. "I know a rare spot. The very atmosphere of it is a bath to the soul." They descended the hillside along by the ravine. A furlong or two below, the stream fell a bright cascade into a misty cavern. This they entered, and sat down, with the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-238.jpg) \- external link  - Page 233. ] cool vapor of the cascade drifting past them, and the agitated waters of the basin rippling to their feet. They did not talk; but, having washed their hands, they sat silent in the roar of the waterfall. Suddenly Christina knelt upon the wet sand. "You strange creature!" cried Guy: "what are you there for? Get up!" She looked up at him with a pale, cold face, half veiled in mist. "Shall I not obey Heaven and my own soul?" she asked. He was silent, awed by the white and illumined countenance. She bared his feet, and washed them in the water of the basin, and wiped them with the hair of her head. "Woman! woman! what are you doing to me?" Her clothes wet, her hair all heavy and tangled, she bowed down her face, and kissed his right foot. A sharp thrill pierced his soul at that kiss. No taint of human passion touched him. He shuddered with an ineffable sense of divine mystery and love. Upon the head bowed before him he laid his hand. "O God our Father! O Christ our Saviour!" he prayed aloud, "teach us the meaning of these things!" And, bending over, he kissed Christina's forehead. Then Lucy, stung to wildness, her soul reeling and sick, crept away, thinking that she would lie down somewhere in the woods, and die. JOB AND HIS BENEFACTOR. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-239.jpg) \- external link  - Page 234. ] LITTLE Job, left alone after Guy's talk with him, kindled his imagination with visions of a great banquet of bear. His idea of heavenly felicity, if called for that afternoon, would have been found to involve a liberal supply of that rare kind of meat. In his Paradise, bill-of-fare and fill-of-bear would have been perpetually and euphoniously synonymous. The hungry child sucked his fingers in fancy over the indefinitely promised repast, until he concluded it would be edifying to take a peep at this necessary ingredient of bliss. The doctor kept some in a prohibited tub down cellar. Thither goes Job, removes the cover, pulls up his sleeve, introduces his grimy little hand into the weak brine, and fishes up a pound and a half of happiness. He grins at it hungrily, not doubting that, raw and salt as it is, it would taste good, and comfort the gnawing, disconsolate stomach of him. If he only durst! But unfortunately, ever since, on an occasion of wrath, he fell into the hands of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-240.jpg) \- external link  - Page 235. ] Biddikin, and came out with a numerical deficiency of front teeth, his bite betrays him. Rinds and crusts seem formed to retain the marks of his dental irregularities. He cannot nibble any thing, but the doctor, with his keen anatomical perception, is fatally certain to discover the depredation, and, holding up the bit of bread or cheese, to shout, "Your teeth, Job! bring the whip, Job!" Therefore, with the exception of such substances as milk and gruel, which do not have to be bitten off, whatever the little wretch tastes furtively he commonly continues to nibble in the vain hope of effacing with each subsequent bite the prints of previous ones, until, like Justice Monkey, he finishes the morsel, --- a feat which he longs to perform with this solid lump of ursine flesh; but hesitates, thinking that, if the bear does not kill him, the doctor will. "How does doctor get a piece off?" he asks himself aloud. "Bites it? No: cuts it." This suggests a knife. He knows where there is a rusty one in the cellar. It is brought; and saw, saw, it goes, until a little piece of the meat comes off in the grimy fingers, and the big piece spatters back into the tub. "I'm a 'normous eater!" chuckles Job, with a glow in his features like fire in dull punk. He sucks the meat a little, but not much, before he resolves that it will be an improvement to wash off the brine as he has seen Biddikin do. And, after all, raw bear is not his ideal. Why not, with a little fire, endeavor to realize his aspirations? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-241.jpg) \- external link  - Page 236. ] A few coals remain after the doctor's dinner. To rake them out of the ashes, add a few chips, and kindle a good blaze, is pleasant work to hungry, anticipating Job. Then to the fire goes the sputtering bit of Bruin, with a stick thrust through it for a spit. How good it smells! It matters little how it smokes and burns. He holds it in the blaze, and looks at it, and turns it, until the stick resembles the Pole, with the Bear revolving round it. He does not stay to cook it much. One with whom meat has always been so rare must not look to have it well done. Night is approaching; and Biddikin may return to intercept the banquet. Biddikin has in fact, some time since, taken abrupt leave of his spiritualist friends, among whom there exists, without any kind of doubt, as he thinks, a plot to swindle him. They will not dig unless he will sign papers. Shrewd Biddikin is skittish of signing papers. To let them do the work, defray all expenses, and give him the treasure when found, would exactly suit the penniless old millionnaire. But they object to such an arrangement: hence a rupture. And Biddikin is hurrying alone from the mountain. Swift and straight he goes, as if the odor of Job's cooking had reached his nostrils. But what possesses him here to diverge from the common path, and make a little circuit down through the woods? One would think he would carefully avoid that spot yonder by the ravine. It can hardly be a comfort to go there, or [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-242.jpg) \- external link  - Page 237. ] even to think of it. But who knows what fascination there is in the crime that refuses forever to be forgotten? Perhaps he wishes to see if every thing remains as when he last came to look and satisfy himself that all was well. When on the spot, the ground seems firm beneath his tread, and he feels how foolish his fears are. His secret is safe. Out of that little grave the dead will never rise. This is the sense of security he likes; and for this he comes often to the lonesome bank where the rock is and the tree. But no sooner is he gone than the dogs snuff out his secret; the beasts of the forest scratch it up. He imagines a thousand mischances, and sees the dead face of the boy uncovered in the sight of heaven and the eyes of men. These nightmares of the brain draw him once more to the unhallowed place this hazy afternoon. The tremor of anxious expectation subsides as he comes in sight of the well-known landmarks, and finds them unchanged. Pathless and dim stretch the forest spaces. No snuffing dogs; no group of amazed and indignant neighbors. Biddikin smiles pallidly in the ghastliness of his wretched triumph. The wind among the trees, the brook dashing into the ravine, are not cheerful sounds; but then they whisper of the solitude which he hopes will ever reign there. The interlaced hemlocks and spruces shed a gloom which is not enlivening to the spirit; yet they seem to screen from the blue eye of heaven the scar in the earth's violated bosom. But what unforeseen portent is this? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-243.jpg) \- external link  - Page 238. ] A beam of sunshine, like the finger of God, reaches down through the sombre and shuddering leafage, and touches the one dread spot betwixt the rock and the tree. All around is gloom: only the little grave has the index of light upon it, --- an awful omen. Superstition and vertigo seize the guilty man. He sinks upon a fallen log. With shaking hands he adjusts his spectacles, and looks again; while a freezing fear creeps swiftly over his flesh. The prodigy is not what it seemed. More horrible still: the ground has been disturbed, and what appeared sunshine is the fresh yellowish soil thrown up over the grave. And, lo! the tombstones at the head and at the foot! The soul of Biddikin shrivels; his flesh seems falling from his bones. But he rallies; he recovers from his swoon of terror, and listens, and looks all around. He has but one hope, --- that ambushed eyes are not watching him. He will not come nearer the grave. There shall be no proof against him. Who can affirm that he ever did Martin any harm? "Is it indeed true that his body has been found? Buried in the woods, do you say? Gentlemen, you astonish me! Then he did not run away, as we supposed? And the things that were stolen from me --- alas that I ever accused him! They were no doubt taken by thieves, who went to the house and murdered him, and then hid him in the woods. Yes, by all means, gentlemen, let us ferret out the assassins, and bring them to justice." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-244.jpg) \- external link  - Page 239. ] Thus Biddikin rehearses his part, sitting there on the log, and watching to see if he is watched. He acquits himself triumphantly before imaginary juries. On the whole, he thinks he will feel better now that the grave has been discovered; and perhaps better still if there is an investigation, and he can air his charnel heart and its ghastly secret a little by talking freely, and fortify himself by making his innocence clear to the world. His limbs gain strength each moment: he can walk now; and he sets out homewards. The terrible pressure, which has sometimes almost driven him to go and confess his guilt, lets up a little. But he is still beset by superstition and mystery. He fancies a thousand eyes following him; and the vulture Dread will prey upon him, he foresees, until the discovery of the grave has been explained, and he has faced suspicion. The sun is setting. The woods cast their vast shadows before him as he hurries home. Twilight sits dim on the mountain; but its coolness and quiet bring no rest to his fevered mind. Every noise, every unusual sight, has a terror in it. What is yonder? Smoke from his kitchen chimney: another mystery. No doubt, even now the officers of the law are sitting round his hearth, waiting for him with manacles and a rope. He considers himself no better than a hanged man. He approaches tremblingly. It is a frightened, glaring face that appears an instant at the window. What! nobody but little Job? All this consternation of smoke raised by him? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-245.jpg) \- external link  - Page 240. ] Biddikin sees the boy squatting on the floor there, roasting his meat by the fire; but Job sees not Biddikin. It is the last turn: the bear falls from the burnt stick into the ashes. Job picks it out with his fingers, and places it on a chip. It will do: the moment of fruition has arrived; relish and ravishment wait upon his tongue. He opens his mouth to admit the morsel just as the door opens to admit the doctor. "Job! you villain! what does this mean?" It means wrath and retribution, Job is perfectly well aware; and the meat falls from his hand, and his nether jaw falls from the upper, and he gasps out, --- "Hungry! --- something t' eat!" "Hungry? what business have you to be hungry?" rasps the harsh voice of Biddikin. "Where did you get that meat?" The miserable child knows that he might as well be dead as confess; and life is sweet even to those who taste only its dregs. "Man come along and give it to me," says poor little frightened Job. There is a vagueness about the bare epithet man, which to the doctor's scared imagination conveys much. He demands to know what man. Job has Guy in his mind; but thinks, if he names him, Biddikin will ask Guy if he gave Job meat. Guy will say no: then woe to Job! So he falters, "Don't know." "Which way did he come from?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-246.jpg) \- external link  - Page 241. ] "That way;" and Job, in his bewilderment, indicates the direction in which Guy went. "From the woods?" demands Biddikin with chattering teeth. "Y-a-a-s!" drawls Job. "How did he look?" says the doctor. "Great big man," says Job. "What did he say?" "Said I ought to have some." And Job ventures to pick up the meat. "Tell me every word he said: I shall whip you if you don't; oh, I shall whip you almost to death if you don't!" And Biddikin adds effect to the menace by producing a strap. "Told me not to tell," uttered Job, sucking the meat. Biddikin pounces upon him. Job tries to think; but both memory and invention fail him, and he can only articulate, --- "In the woods, --- hunting for something." This loose allusion to the lost watch, Biddikin applies directly to the search for Martin's grave. He sits down, his eyes glassy, his face like ashes. Job takes advantage of the lull to regale himself. "Did he ask for me?" "Y-a-a-s!" --- munching. It is at all times a grief to Biddikin to watch that boy eat; and to see him sit there now so stoically, tearing and chewing like a little harpy, rapt and absorbed in his viand, puts [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-247.jpg) \- external link  - Page 242. ] a fury into him. Job knows what is coming. Those eyes never glitter so but affliction is swiftly to ensue. He vacillates between hunger and fright, but concludes to make the most of his meat. Gratification of appetite is a rare event with him, whereas flagellation is altogether too common. He accordingly sticks to the meat, trying to swallow it as the doctor strikes and beats him. The door flew open, and Christina stood on the threshold, --- a spectre to Biddikin, but a joy to Job. Without speaking, she stood there, with a countenance of sorrow, regarding the miserable pair. Job made haste to finish his banquet; whilst Biddikin rubbed his hands, and stammered, --- "Beg your pardon, madam! I were correcting this boy. A very bad boy; ain't you, Job?" "Y-a-a-s, awful bad; wicked!" "Very wicked!" said the doctor: "he knows it. Tells lies; don't you, Job?' "Y-a-a-s!" grinned the starveling. "Awful lies! I'm a 'normous eater!" --- smacking and licking his chaps. "Bad, very bad! --- wicked, dreadful wicked!" muttered the doctor. "And who is not?" said the pale prophetess at the door. "Is there one good? Not one!" "Ah, that indeed!" grimaced Biddikin. "But Job" --- and he shook his head at the boy's desperate case. "It would be well for you and me, Doctor Biddikin, if we [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-248.jpg) \- external link  - Page 243. ] had no greater sins on our souls than that poor child!" said Christina. "Very true. We are all sinners, great sinners," --- caressing his skinny, trembling hands. "What can I do for you, madam?" --- with ghastly affability. "Invite me in," said Christina. "Ah! excuse me: come in!" And he stood twisting and simpering, in the endeavor to be civil; while he would about as lief have seen the avenging angel enter his house as the dangerous clairvoyant. "Won't you ask me to sit down?" said Christina. "Ah, yes! Pray, sit down!" And, bustling about, he brought a broken chair, which he dusted, and placed for her. "A chair for yourself, doctor." He seated himself near her, and spread his handkerchief on his knees, and put his thumbs together over it, and smirked, and played glad to see her. "Some men!" said little Job, just as footsteps and a loud knock were heard. Biddikin gave a wild start; but Christina motioned him to keep still. Job opened the door; and Mr. Murk, the philanthropist, put in his nose. "Ah, sister! Your absence has occasioned some alarm. The friends have been looking for you." "Tell them to go without me. I shall spend the night with Doctor Biddikin." An announcement which filled the involuntary host with dismay. ANOTHER GRAVE IS OPENED. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-249.jpg) \- external link  - Page 244. ] I SHOULD be most happy --- the honor --- but, I regret to say, there isn't a room in my house!" Christina smiled. "I --- I mean a room to offer a lady. Under other circumstances, I should be delighted. I --- I --- wouldn't I, Job?" "Y-a-a-s!" said Job. "But you --- you couldn't think of sitting up all night, you know!" --- with a livid smile. "Why not? --- for I am sure you will be gallant enough to sit up with me: won't he, Job?" "Y-a-a-s!" said Job. "That settles it, doctor. Now, what have you got for supper?" "I --- I declare!" stammered the distressed little old man: "I believe --- Eaten up every thing in the house, haven't you, Job? That boy! --- he's a perfect vampire, a cormorant!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-250.jpg) \- external link  - Page 245. ] "Indeed! What a pity he don't fat up a little!" "Fat? A bullock a day wouldn't fat him. The quantity of food he consumes is perfectly incredible: isn't it, Job?" "Y-a-a-s!" said Job, with an inane stare, as if it was perfectly incredible. Christina opened her porte-monnaie. "Here, Job! Go to the neighbors. Say the doctor has company, and you want the best that is to be had, --- bread, milk, butter, cake, tea." At Biddikin's suggestion, she wrote down a list of the articles she required, and despatched Job with it; while the doctor began to think her visit might be, after all, rather an occasion for thanks than a cause for alarm. "How you need a woman to keep your house for you!" she said, looking into his closets. "Ah! you have a daughter in the spirit-world, doctor! She is here now. She glides about the room: she shows me what to do. She says she is with you when you never know it," she continued softly, with a changed expression, setting the table as quickly and handily as if she had always been accustomed to the house. Biddikin gazed as at an apparition. It was many years since his daughter, or any woman, had lighted that gloomy abode with her presence. Memories thronged upon him. "It makes me sad to think of you alone here all winter. Isn't it dreary?" "Excuse me --- I --- you overcome me! I can't speak!" "Have you no friends?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-251.jpg) \- external link  - Page 246. ] "Not one!" faltered the old man. "My brother gives me the lease of this house; but he never comes to see me. And now even my son has been taken from me. You see before you a man with a broken heart!" "Ah, doctor, the world is full of such hearts! We suffer that we may have pity for the sufferings of others." "Pity? No: none can know; none can sympathize; nobody ever felt the keen anguish!" And, with his convulsed left hand, involuntarily the doctor made the movement of a serpent writhing into his heart. "Don't be too certain of that," answered Christina. "I never yet found a sorrow so deep that I could not go to the bottom of it, and bring up a pearl of hope, as divers do." She kept about her work; while the trembling old man watched her wistfully, his countenance betraying fear, bewilderment, and a dawning faith that in this frail woman's form help from Heaven had come to him, to comfort and to save. The messenger presently returned with a plentiful supply of provisions. The table was soon loaded, the tea was made, and the firelight shone upon a scene of cheerfulness which had not within the memory of Job been witnessed in that house. "Come, doctor! supper is ready," said Christina. "Ah, forgive me!" He started as from a dream. "So many things come up! To see the tea steaming there, and a woman sitting beside it" --- He paused, choking with emotion. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-252.jpg) \- external link  - Page 247. ] "You must reflect that the woman sitting beside it is hungry," said Christina. "Come, Job!" "Job!" exclaimed the doctor, his voice changing instantly to the habitually sharp tone in which he addressed the poorhouse child, "why don't you be getting sticks to keep up the fire?" Christina set down the tea-pot, and looked up in sorrowful astonishment. "How can you speak so to that poor boy, doctor?" "I --- I were not aware --- I'm a good master to you; ain't I, Job?" Job assented with his usual sickly grin, and drawling "Y-a-a-s." "Doctor Biddikin, you are a harsh and cruel master!" and all the disdain of her nature flashed angrily and witheringly upon him. "You don't know how to be a good master, you have grown so hardened. I'll show you the difference." The old man, who had been gazing at her a minute before with an expression which betrayed how much he felt drawn to her for refuge and for solace, writhed and cowered before her; while, imitating his fierce tone and manner, she said, --- "Job! why don't you start? Get those sticks, or I'll take a stick to you! --- Is that the way he talks to you, Job?" "Y-a-a-s!" said Job, getting his basket, thinking it was all in earnest. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-253.jpg) \- external link  - Page 248. ] "Ah, no, Job!" Her voice changed to a wonderfully contrasting softness. "Never mind the sticks, my child. Come to the table, and be happy once in your life. Poor little Job! you have a hard time, at the best; and you deserve all our kindness. --- Does he ever speak in that way?" "N-o-o; not to me. He does to Mad sometimes," said Job, with a wishful, wondering look. Christina sighed. "Well, he will speak to you so after this, I hope," she said. "Come!" "Won't let me come to table when he does." "Doctor Biddikin won't!" she exclaimed. "Ah --- yes --- come, Job! I haven't been in the habit --- but of course since you desire it. I were bred in a very aristocratic family, and have had servants." "Oh, what a pride it is that can keep alive in all this misery! I should have thought," she said with sad and pitying scorn, "it would have starved out long ago." She placed Job at the table, and bade him eat. The doctor endeavored also to sup like a person with a good appetite and a clear conscience. But ever-recurring recollections of a grave in the woods made his soul sicken and his gorge rise; and the banquet was for the most part left to Job, who did it ample justice. "You are ill, doctor," said Christina. "I am very well, --- very well indeed!" Biddikin assured her. "I have an excellent appetite, as you see. I have eaten prodigiously!" And he clasped his hands before his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-254.jpg) \- external link  - Page 249. ] stomach, leaning over them, and smiling across the table at his guest with sepulchral suavity. He had neither candles, nor oil for his lamps; and the firelight was beginning to fail. He was glad of an excuse to quit the table, and busied himself kindling up the blaze with fresh sticks, while Christina and Job finished their repast. She joined him presently on the hearth; and, Job having gone to bed, the young woman and the old man sat there and talked till she had thawed his heart-springs and broken his pride. "What is there about you that affects me so?" he said. "How other days come back to me! My wife, my daughter, all I have loved, all I have lost, --- you suffocate me with the memories of them!" And he clutched his bosom, gasping for breath. "I do not talk of these things," answered Christina. "It is your spirit: your atmosphere is filled with them. They press upon me and around me, --- a cloud of witnesses! What is it?" he said. "It is the day of judgment which has come to your soul," she responded solemnly. "Do you not see Martin with the rest?" He bent over the hearth, and nervously pushed together the falling brands. "I have had a dozen patients in this house at a time," he spoke up suddenly. "I were occupied from morning till night; a proud and happy man. Now not even my son is [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-255.jpg) \- external link  - Page 250. ] left me. Shouldn't you think I would have some dark hours?" "I should think you would wish to die!" she exclaimed. "Die? die?" He shuddered. "But I am not prepared!" "Few who die are prepared. Was Martin prepared?" Again he stirred the fire with aguish hands; and again, after a pause, he attempted to turn the conversation. "A dozen patients at a time. I were famous for my treatment of rheumatic complaints. I had this house built for a hospital. It is very large, you see. But I am all alone in it now!" "Not quite. Do not any longer consider Job as no more than a dumb beast, doctor. If you have no mercy on him, how can you expect God to have mercy on you? In the sight of Heaven, he is as good as you or I, and may be a great deal better. One thing is certain: he has not the blood of a fellow-creature on his hands." He rolled his eyes up at her quickly. "Who has? You--- you cannot say I have." "Poor old man!" she said, "it is time for us to understand each other. I do not accuse you; but I know all." He sat crouching over the fire, mute, paralyzed, as if he had heard the stroke of doom. "Fear nothing from me," she continued, with deep pity in her tones. "I am your sister. I have come, not to harm you, but to save." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-256.jpg) \- external link  - Page 251. ] He fell upon his knees, and lifted up his poor old hands imploringly. "Have mercy on me! --- have mercy!" "Oh, I will, as I, too, hope for mercy!" she said with a tenderness and a radiance, even as an angel might have looked and spoken. "I will bless you, and not hurt you. The grave in the woods has been opened; and the grave in your heart must also be opened, or else you can never know peace." "The grave!" he articulated, with a terrified inquiry in his face. "Heaven guided me to it for your good. Shut up in your heart, the dreadful secret gnaws like the undying worm. You must give it to me." "I did not kill him! --- I did not!" "I know you did not willingly; and yet, in the eyes of the world, it would be murder. And you feel the stain of murder on your soul, --- as I have felt it on mine!" her voice suddenly sinking. "You! --- you have felt it?" eagerly uttered the culprit. "And all the while," she added, "I would have given my life for the life I destroyed!" "Is it true?" he cried, selfishly grasping at a fellowship in guilt. "True, or else I should not be here," she sadly answered; "else I should still be in the world where I was, shallow-hearted and frivolous as any. I am an exile, but not from [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-257.jpg) \- external link  - Page 252. ] God. Come," she said with unfathomable tenderness, "put your tired head on my lap, as if you were a child, and I your mother, and tell me all." "It is that treasure that has been my ruin!" "I know it well. And it may prove the ruin of more of us yet: it certainly will, if we seek it selfishly, or for base ends. You wanted it for your pride." "I were very ambitious. Great wealth and a great name, they were my idols, and they have lost me my soul!" he said with a wail of anguish. "Heaven have mercy on you!" prayed Christina. "There is in heaven no mercy for me!" "What! have the angels less love than I? Has God less than the angels? Old man, I bend over you now with a bosom full of pity; with arms of charity large enough to clasp all the sins of the world! And is Christ less than I?" "Save me, --- stay with me, --- do not leave me again!" he pleaded wildly, clinging to her, on his knees. "I never heard such words from human lips: I shall never again. Help me, or I am lost!" She laid her hand on his head, soothing him as if he were indeed an erring, repentant child, and she a forgiving mother. And so she encouraged him to speak of Martin. "He were a beautiful boy, and I might have loved him; but to love a poorhouse-boy went against my pride. I were very proud," the old man continued, with something like the ghost of a smile. "I wanted to keep up the illusion that I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-258.jpg) \- external link  - Page 253. ] were a rich man. I could not have servants; but I could have a slave. I --- I confess I made a slave of Martin." "Christ," said Christina with deep, tremulous fervor, "is on the side of the lowly. Just so sure as we set ourselves above the least of his little ones, we separate ourselves from him. He who makes a slave of a fellow-creature severs the divine bond of brotherhood, the umbilical cord of love which unites each soul with the great life-giving Source of all souls. It is not the slave that is cut off, but the tyrant. He gives himself over to pride and selfishness, the father and mother of all bad passions. Ah, you knew not what you did, old man! You have been more unfortunate than you supposed." "Fifteen years of hope deferred, --- think of that, before you condemn me!" whined the wretch. "Fifteen years of seeking for that treasure, --- it had almost made me mad! I confess I vented my disappointments on Martin. I beat him; yes, I beat him often. I used to shut him up without any supper, and leave him all night. One morning, I found him dead." "And you the cause!" "But I did not intend his death, --- no, no! And it were a terrible shock when I found him stiff and cold!" Christina moaned as if the deed and the remorse were her own. "Oh! why did you not then call in your neighbors, and say, `Behold the child I have punished: he has died'?" "There were marks where I had beaten him: I could not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-259.jpg) \- external link  - Page 254. ] make them disappear. There were traces of suffering, --- of starvation: I could not hide them. I feared exposure; I dreaded investigation; I feared more for my pride than for my life. People would have pointed at me, and said, `Childmurderer! ' so I buried him in the woods." "And your own soul with him!" said Christina; "when only confession and repentance could have brought you peace." "Peace! --- I have never known peace! I have been haunted by horror and remorse. I thought I would atone for what I did to Martin by getting another boy, and being kind to him. I brought Job here. But I had lost possession of myself: a devil has seemed to have me!" "Many devils have had you, poor old man! To-night we begin to cast them out. To-night God lifts the curse." "By your hand, --- angel!" he broke forth with sobs and tears. "Be my guide, my guardian. Tell me what to do!" "In the first place, be kind to Job; and, when prejudices against the poorhouse arise, reflect that you may yet be there yourself!" "I --- with all that treasure!" "The closer you cling to that, the poorer you will always be. You must give it up. If there is a treasure, it is not for men, but for humanity." "It is hard, after all these years. I cannot sign away my claims! I cannot give up my riches!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-260.jpg) \- external link  - Page 255. ] Christina rose impatiently. "Sordid wretch! are you so incorrigible? Have I labored with you in vain?" "You have come here, then, to beguile me of my treasure!" cried the doctor; "to frighten me into compliance! But I will not be frightened: I will not sign." Quietly Christina put on her bonnet and shawl, and was about to quit the house. He ran after her, and threw himself at her feet. "Don't go! Pardon my childishness: I am very childish. Stay: I will do any thing you wish." She looked down at him a moment, half in pity, and half in disdain of his terrified servility: then with a sigh, as if the resolution to depart had been a relief to her, she removed again her bonnet and shawl, and resumed her seat by the hearth, he cringing at her side. MAD BIDDIKIN'S RIDE. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-261.jpg) \- external link  - Page 256. ] FORTUNE is to certain marriageable ladies what a molasses-cup is to flies; and Elphaz Pelt, Esq., consoling himself for the loss of Lucy by retaining her dowry, looked about, and saw with a grim smile at least a score of young women ready to rush into his arms and the fine new house he was building. But Elphaz was circumspect; Elphaz was nice; and gradually narrowing the circle of his observation, like a wheeling bird of prey, he fixed his eagle eye, and pounced on the Pinworth cottage. Metaphorically speaking. He did not exactly swoop down the chimney, nor dash through a window; nor is it to be understood that he had swapped off his two very distinct organs of vision for one prime aquiline orb. On the contrary, he walked in regularly every Sunday night by the front-door, in his finest plumage; polished his beak with a silk handkerchief; gave a claw to Sophy, and a claw to her mother; perched himself between that amiable pair of doves for the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-262.jpg) \- external link  - Page 257. ] evening; and found his oblique dual optics just the thing for the occasion. "Takes a cross-eyed man to court two women at once," said Mad Biddikin; bitterly, for reasons. It was some time before it was known which of the ladies was the lawyer's choice. September decided the question. Pelt proposed to Sophy: Sophy accepted Pelt. At which, society held up all its hands; one of which was clinched and shaken. The fist was young Biddikin's. He had courted Sophy himself all summer, and been secretly favored; when Pelt stepped in, and he was turned out: Sophy, lured by lucre, transferring her affections to a man nearly twice his age, and not half as good-looking. The turbulent Biddikin blood boiled at this perfidy. But he blamed Sophy less than he did her mother, by whom she had been over-persuaded; and Pelt, by whom she had been purchased. Against these two his vengeance burned. He had a scene with Mrs. Pinworth in the street, --- very scandalous. He stood and blackguarded Elphaz as he went in and out of his office. In short, he was fast becoming a nuisance which the squire particularly desired to have abated; and his sharp eyes consulted each other on the subject, while he waited his chance. It so happened, that the same evening on which the elder Biddikin went through the terrible ordeal of discovery and confession also brought a crisis in the junior's fortunes. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-263.jpg) \- external link  - Page 258. ] Colonel Bannington had taken advantage of the fine weather to visit the village; and Mad, who accompanied him, had experienced the sting of seeing dash by him, as he slowly wheeled the chair through the street, a smart buggy, containing a pair of laughing lovers. It was Elphaz and Sophy. "What's the matter?" demanded the invalid; for Mad had halted involuntarily, all ablaze. "He'd rather be pulling Pelt's nose than pushing your chair," laughed the tavern-keeper. Mad, galled as never before by his mean occupation, which was thrown into humiliating contrast by the gay style in which Sophy was riding out, crushed an oath between his teeth, and moved on. Everybody stopped to speak with the colonel, who was in so sociable a mood, that the sun had set before he thought of the homeward journey. Then he remembered the evening dews, and ordered a rapid retreat. Mad sullenly took his time to ascend the long grade, his volcanic soul ready at any moment to belch fire. "Seems to me you are growing deused lazy," said the colonel. "Seems to me you are growing deused sassy!" Mad answered, and stopped. It took the colonel an instant to realize the supreme insolence of the retort. Then, slowly twisting himself round in his chair, he struck at Mad with his cane; which was seized quickly, wrenched from his hand, splintered, and flung upon the roadside. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-264.jpg) \- external link  - Page 259. ] "Look out how you raise cane with me, you old limp-legs!" And Mad sat down on a stone, and laughed. They were on an unfrequented road, at a distance from any house. It was fast growing dark. The evening was damp and chill. The invalid stormed and threatened. "Better keep quiet there, you wheelbarrow-full of corruption! or you'll get spilt over," Mad warned him. The colonel remembered how he had suffered from the vengeance of one man. He did not like to fall into the hands of another with so murderous a disposition as Mad manifested. He accordingly arranged his muffler, strained his keen eyes to peer into the dusk, and kept silent, waiting for succor. Unfortunately, in the first ebullition of his wrath, he discharged the offender from his service; for which Mad mockingly thanked him, saying that he was "tired of being a hoss." And now, when, shivering in the dark and cold till he felt the chill striking to his vitals, he humbled himself to inquire how much longer he was to be kept exposed there, the answer came jeeringly back, --- "Don't ask me: it's none of my business. I'm out of a situation; and I'm going to set here till somebody comes along and hires me." "I'll give you a job," said the colonel. "You'll give somebody a job to carry you to your grave, you tub of wickedness! Look out," muttered Mad, "that you don't hurry up your funeral-cakes by striking me again!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-265.jpg) \- external link  - Page 260. ] The invalid pushed his chin out of his muffler, and breathed quick, fierce breaths, for a minute, with clinched teeth. He wished he had his pistols with him. "I'll give you a dollar to take me home; and let that end it." "Bid higher'n that, you old huckster! You are in a bad place, right in the road there, where wagons'll be running over ye. Though maybe there won't be any wagons passing, and you may have to stay till morning, --- you bowled-down ten-pin!" "Two dollars!" chokingly said the colonel, appalled by the prospect. "Two dollars is cussed little for a man you've struck with a cane. The law'll give me more'n that." And Mad began to whistle. Darker still; clouds rising, and shutting out the stars. No vehicle coming. "Five dollars," --- the words tasted like gall to the helpless, enraged man, --- "and square accounts." "Five dollars won't square accounts. I'm to have a crack at you to make us even, you broken-bladed jack-knife! Ah! won't it feel good to get hold of your sack of bones, and shake it a little! Grind your hatchet-face sharper'n 'tis now in the sand here! Now, do you know what I'm waiting for?" The colonel had no longer a doubt but it was the villain's intention to delay until it was dark enough, and then quietly murder him. He didn't want to be murdered. Although [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-266.jpg) \- external link  - Page 261. ] by no means a coward, he felt an impotent and selfish clinging to life, wretched as life had become. "Say, don't you think you've lived about long enough, you crippled old sinner?" the assassin continued. "There's Guy waiting for your shoes. He'll marry Lucy Arlyn as soon as you're out of the way: then your money'll go! Five dollars to take you home? Wonder what they'd give to have you sent to your long home!" The colonel then began to call for help. "Look a here! just you dry up! shut down on that arrangement mighty quick!" said Mad, starting to his feet. "My fingers are aching to get hold o' your wind-pipe. You never'll scream again if they do!" "By the gods! I can't stay here," cried the colonel furiously, prepared to grapple and die game. "I'll call; and lay a hand on me if you dare!" He did not shout, however, but pulled a bank-note from his pocket, and made Mad a last offer. "Ten dollars to take me home. Yes or no; and speak quick!" "Agreed," said Mad, laughing as he pocketed the note, although it was too dark to ascertain its value; and, laying hold of the chair, he pushed it a few rods, then halted. "Go on, go on!" vociferated the colonel: "you've got your pay." "Yes: but I ain't working by the week now; I'm working by the job. No time was set to have it finished; and I can afford to be all day to-morrow about it." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-267.jpg) \- external link  - Page 262. ] After resting a while, he went on a little farther with exasperating deliberation, and halted again. "You haven't give me any chance for supper yet," said he. "I guess now I'll leave you while I go and get some." It was in vain that Bannington reminded him of the agreement. "I'll keep my word, colonel. Dead or alive, I'll wheel ye home. I'll come back and wheel ye a little farther after supper; then I can finish the job easy in the morning." And Mad marched away, heedless of threats, and disappeared in the darkness. Nothing was left the invalid but to shout for help with his feeble lungs, which were soon quite exhausted by the exertion. Mad, in the mean time, returned by a circuitous route through the fields, and crept under the fence, where he could just see the dim outline of the colonel in the darkness, and enjoy his swearing. At length the sound of wheels was heard, then the tramp of a trotting horse, then voices. Very gay the voices were; but they were like swords to the soul of young Biddikin. Sophy and Elphaz were returning from their drive. The colonel had been left exactly in the middle of the road; and Mad hoped that he would get run over, and that all --- particularly Pelt --- would get broken necks. The colonel screamed to avert the danger, and got himself out of the track by turning a wheel with his hand. The horse, hearing the noise, and seeing a mysterious object moving [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-268.jpg) \- external link  - Page 263. ] by the road, dashed aside, and ran directly into the fence behind which lay Madison. "What's that? Who's there?" cried Elphaz. "Pelt!" returned the colonel. "Come here!" "Bannington! --- that you?" Pelt went to his client; and Mad lay and chuckled while Bannington told his story, and the two consulted. "You'd better have followed my advice, and got rid of the scoundrel a month ago," said Elphaz. "According to your own account, I don't see how the law can take hold of him. He didn't force you to give him the money?" "No," admitted the client. "Nor agree to take you home to-night? And you had discharged him previously?" "That's so. But you'll find some trap for him, Pelt, or you are no lawyer. Think it up at your leisure. But get me home now the first thing: I'm half dead." "I'll go and get Aaron." "No, no! Don't you leave me a minute. Wheel me yourself: 'tain't far." "It's half a mile at least! And here is Sophy." "Sophy be d---! Isn't a man's life of any consequence?" Pelt was in great perplexity. He didn't like the job at all; yet he dared not offend his client. After a consultation with Sophy, who agreed to drive the horse, he concluded to go before with the chair. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-269.jpg) \- external link  - Page 264. ] It was a dismal road; and they had hardly got started, when Sophy uttered a scream. "What's the matter?" cried Elphaz. "'Sh!" whispered Mad. "It's me!" Pelt left the chair, and started to come back; when Sophy hastily cried, --- "'Tain't any thing. I --- thought I was going to tip over." "All right now?" said Elphaz. "Yes: I --- guess so!" --- in an uncertain voice. "Come along, then." And Pelt returned to the colonel; while Mad softly climbed into the buggy, and took a seat by Sophy's side. "Mad! you mustn't!" she whispered. He answered by clasping her waist. He was wildly hilarious. He kissed her savagely; and still she did not dare, or did not wish, to scream. "Did you speak?" said Elphaz. "No: I --- I was talking to the horse," replied the virtuous maiden. "Now go! --- do go, Mad!" "I shall go mad if you marry him! Do you think I'll let you, and not tell him something you wouldn't like to have me tell?" "O Mad! I don't mean to marry him: I only go with him to please mother. You mustn't turn against me. Oh, if you should!" Mad had taken the reins. He drove very slow, making the most of his interview, and terrifying Sophy by his violence. Pelt called to her to keep nearer the chair. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-270.jpg) \- external link  - Page 265. ] "Ask him how he likes his job," said Mad. She hesitated. "If you won't, I will." "No, don't!" she whispered; adding, in sweet accents, "How do you like your job, Mr. Pelt?" "Oh! very well," muttered Elphaz. "Tell him, maybe the colonel would like to hire him by the week, in my place." "Perhaps Colonel Bannington would like to employ you in Madison's place," said the reluctant maiden. "He'll employ me --- to punish that rascal!" growled Pelt, toiling at the chair. Mad could scarce restrain his savage merriment. He stopped the horse, and held Sophy, and whispered frantic things to her. Then, when Pelt grew anxious, and called to her to drive on, Mad urged the animal forward with headlong recklessness, resolved to run down both Pelt and Bannington. "Ho! hollo!" shouted Pelt; "what in thunder!" --- "I didn't see you," faltered Sophy. "You broke my shoulder," scolded the lawyer. "Hold him, now, till I get on a little piece; and don't drive so like Jehu again." "He is awful angry!" whispered Sophy. "Now, Mad, do behave yourself!" "I will!" said Mad, crouching in the fore part of the buggy. "You'll see some bully fun!" And, reaching over the dash-board, he pricked the nag with his knife. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-271.jpg) \- external link  - Page 266. ] The animal jumped, and was on Pelt's heels again in an instant. A volley of oaths and yells proclaimed the success of Mad's experiment. "I couldn't hold him in!" cried Sophy. "Murder!" ejaculated Elphaz. "He trod right on my foot! and he has almost killed the colonel! What the deuse is the matter with him?" "Tie him to the fence!" snarled the invalid. "Another such blow would dislocate my neck." "Whoa, bonny; whoa!" said Elphaz, leading the beast to the roadside. "Oh, my foot! I believe he has smashed it! Whoa, --- ho! \--- WHOA!" raising his voice to a shriek, as, by another leap of the horse, he was knocked against the wall, and jammed. "What in the old Harry, Sophy!" --- "He acts dreadfully!" said Sophy. "Something must be biting his heels." "He has finished me!" groaned Elphaz. "I never shall step on that leg again! Oh, my knee!" "Hurt ye much?" said Sophy sympathetically. Pelt made no reply, but twisted one of the reins round a stake in the wall, and, groaning and limping, walked about the buggy to discover the cause of the animal's unruliness. The impatience of the colonel did not give him time to ferret out Mad, who lay in ambush, half covered by Sophy's skirts, and ready at any moment to dash down his rival, and leap over him, in case of discovery. Sophy, in constant terror of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-272.jpg) \- external link  - Page 267. ] some such catastrophe, entreated Elphaz to leave her where she was, and take the invalid home; and drew a long breath of relief when he consented. "Now you must go, Mad! You are getting me into the terriblest scrape that ever was!" "Ain't it rich?" chuckled Mad, tickled to the heart's core. "He's doing the job I've been paid ten dollars for; and now I'm going to have a ride at his expense." "O Mad! you mustn't! you can't!" But, the next minute, the wall was heard tumbling down. "Scream! scream!" whispered Mad, springing into the buggy after accomplishing this little feat and freeing the rein from the stake. "O-w-w! o-w-w!" shrieked Sophy. "Mr. P-e-l-t!" "What is it?" roared Pelt in the distance. "He has pulled the wall down, and I can't hold him!" she replied by Mad's dictation. Elphaz came running with all his might; but Mad had already got the buggy headed in the other direction. "Oh! quick, quick!" screamed Sophy. "Stop him!" breathlessly shouted the lawyer. "I can't!" "Turn him into the fence!" "He won't turn! Oh, I shall be killed!" Pelt forgot his hurts, and ran as never lawyer ran before; but Mad was down again at the dash-board with his knife, which he used discreetly, regulating the horse's speed in a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-273.jpg) \- external link  - Page 268. ] manner to keep Pelt trotting after them at the distance of a rod or two. If he grew discouraged, and lost breath, Mad slacked up a little. If he started on again, in the hope of catching the buggy by a strenuous effort, he was suffered almost to reach it; then the horse was once more spurred into a gallop, and he was left gasping and wheezing, with aching lungs, far back in the darkness. It was Mad's intention to play with his distress till the last moment, and take him as far from the colonel as possible. And all this while Sophy did not cease to scream, and to implore Elphaz to rescue her from the fate that threatened. But there is a limit to human endurance; and finally Pelt gave up the chase in utter exhaustion and despair. "This is fancy sport, Sophy! Hear him blow! And the colonel --- oh, ho!" laughed Mad convulsively. "Do leave me now! You've had fun enough!" entreated Sophy. "No, not by a jug-full! The hoss is running away, you know. Scream, keep screaming!" And, seating himself comfortably at her side, Mad plied the whip, and reined up the woodland road, bent on a jubilant night's ride. THE NIGHT ENCOUNTER. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-274.jpg) \- external link  - Page 269. ] HAVING parted from Christina, Guy sat that evening on a roadside wall, and watched the ebbing sea of sunset fire, till of the crimson foam Venus was born, interpreting anew the old myth, --- a softeyed infant star, with the crescent moon for a cradle. Shadow and dewy coolness filled all the valley, and hung upon the purple mountain-slopes. It seemed as if the pensiveness of Deity had fallen upon the earth and upon man. Guy bared his head to the oncoming night; while the moon descended behind the western peaks like a horn of white flame, and the young star followed, and clouds began to rise like vast clotted masses of darkness stretching over the world. Long he sat abstracted, powerful emotions agitating him as he reviewed the experience of the afternoon. It had been to him, in many respects, a sacred experience. Surprises and wonders had marked the few hours he had spent with Christina. The discovery of the child's corpse was an astonishing and awful manifestation of spiritual power. The washing of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-275.jpg) \- external link  - Page 270. ] his feet, and the kisses of the seeress, appeared to him mystic symbols of humility, of consecration, and of celestial love, pure from earthly fire. Even the finding of the watch he regarded as by no means the result of accident, but of design superior to accident, --- a simple lesson teaching much: how the minutest circumstances of life are often, if not always, shaped by mysterious agencies; nay, how even the action of the elements, and of the brute creatures of the earth, may be controlled for our benefit by those magnetic threads of Providence which run through nature and the hearts of men, string good and evil together like many-colored beads, and bind in exact orbits the wildest comets of chance. The soul of the young man, swelling and throbbing with these thoughts, put to itself the stern question: "Why not, since these things are so, surrender myself entirely to these influences, and accept the holy mission to which I am called?" He shuddered with awe, and yet with secret joy, as he remembered how unequivocally it had been promised by invisible intelligences, through inspired lips, that he should become a savior of men. Just then, by no volition of his own as it seemed, but by an impulse imparted to him from on high, he turned his face upwards, and beheld a strange appearance in the heavens. A broad space of the sky was clear of clouds; in the midst of which burned the golden nails of the great Cross, as it were on the bosom of God. Up to this moment he had been utterly unconscious of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-276.jpg) \- external link  - Page 271. ] every thing around him. The chilliness, the deepening darkness, the shrill song of the field-cricket, the gathering and breaking of the clouds, had been alike unnoticed. This long and intense abstraction of his thoughts from all outward objects enhanced the effect of what he considered a portentous spectacle. Often as he had gazed on the sacred symbol which glitters in the constellation of the Swan, it had never before impressed him as it did now. The canopy of the sky seemed rent asunder to reveal it. He was seated --- could it be by chance? --- in an attitude to view it in its natural upright position. No other important group of stars was anywhere visible; but there, like a stupendous picture in a frame of cloud, hung the sublime emblem of Christ's suffering and death, and of our faith and salvation. No marvel, that, to one who was inclined to see mystical meanings in every thing, the apparition should have seemed to possess a significance of the most solemn character. But how interpret it? Did it prefigure to him his own heaven-ordained mission to mankind? With rapture and with worship he gazed, hoping, trembling, pleading for divine guidance, till his eyes grew dim, and suddenly the clouds closed again, and the cross was hidden. Guy then got down from the wall, and set out to walk homewards. Home was to him where Lucy was. Often, during the afternoon, he had thought of her with unaccountable uneasiness of mind. His trouble increased as he proceeded on his way. He was presently to meet her; and what account [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-277.jpg) \- external link  - Page 272. ] should he render of that day's doings? How would she regard those things which appeared to him so momentous and so pure? Ought he to tell her all? Ought he to tell her any thing? Had she been sitting alone in her chamber all the afternoon? and could she listen with equanimity to the story of his adventures with Christina? He was walking near the brookside, through the woods, his way dimly lighted by the heavens, now cloudless, but obscured by tree-tops, through which dripped the starlight here and there in golden rain, like that drizzled into Danae's lap through her prison roof. The brook sang its ever-pensive song in its lonesome wanderings. The glow-worm (rarely seen) slowly opened its little lantern under the bushy bank. No other light or sound diverted his meditations, until a vehicle came rattling towards him, and a strong ray of light penetrated the dark woods. Two men appeared to be rapidly looking for something by the roadside. As they approached, Guy recognized one of his father's horses and his father's carryall; Aaron driving, and Squire Elphaz Pelt bearing aloft a lantern. They stopped, and inquired if he had seen a horse running with a buggy and a young woman, or whether he had observed the wrecks of any such objects in the road. Guy said he had heard one or two vehicles pass when he had been sitting on a wall; but he could give no description of them. "It's queer!" said Elphaz. "My horse passed this way; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-278.jpg) \- external link  - Page 273. ] and he must have been going so fast, you couldn't have helped noticing him." "How did he get away?" asked Guy. "That rascally young Biddikin left your father in the street after dark, where I came within an inch of driving straight over him. I suppose that put the old scratch into the beast. He acted skittish after it; and, as I was getting the old gentleman home, he pulled the wall down I had hitched him to, and ran with Sophy." "Now I recollect," said Guy, "there must have been more than one person in the wagon that passed me; for I heard voices. Your horse may have dashed into the woods below here, if he came this way at all. Give me the lantern, and let me see if I can find any fresh tracks." Elphaz dismounted from the carryall, and they looked together along the road. "Hoofs and wheels have been this way not long since," said Guy; "but a running horse would throw up more dirt than any of these prints show." "That's so: they don't look like the tracks we saw back here a piece," replied Elphaz. "The corks cut up the gravel right smart at first," observed Aaron; "but it has looked to me all along as if the critter was slackening his pace." "Hark! --- what's that?" said Guy. The light of the lantern flashed into the woods, and fell upon an extraordinary object near the brook. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-279.jpg) \- external link  - Page 274. ] "It moves!" whispered Elphaz. "It is a woman!" said Guy. She had at first appeared lying on the ground; but now, as if alarmed by the noise and light, she rose, and attempted to run. "It's Sophy!" ejaculated Elphaz. "Sophv!" he called, springing after her. The hollow woods rang with the wild cry; but the fugitive heeded it only to quicken her pace. Suddenly she fell. "She has been flung from the buggy, and her brain has been injured," suggested Guy, hastening to the lawyer's side. They reached the spot where she was. She sat on the ground, leaning against a log which had probably occasioned her fall. She made no further attempt to escape. Guy laid hold of her gently, bending over her, and asking if she was hurt; little guessing how she had been hurt, or by whom. She made no answer, but appeared to be arranging her hair; when Pelt anxiously advanced the lantern to her face. Even before the glare of light fell upon that pallid, despairing countenance, a chill of astonishment and terror had shot to Guy's soul. "Good laws!" exclaimed Elphaz: "it ain't Sophy!" --- stooping, the lantern dangling from his hand. "Lucy Arlyn!" "What does this mean? how came you here?" hurriedly demanded Guy. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-280.jpg) \- external link  - Page 275. ] "I am not hurt. I ran, --- I don't know why," said Lucy with a bewildered air. "Have you been looking for me long?" "We have not been looking for you. How came you here? What ails you, Lucy?" "Nothing, --- nothing at all. Who were you looking for?" "Your cousin Sophy. She has been run away with," answered Guy, trembling with undefined apprehension. "Come along," said Aaron to Elphaz. "They understand each other, and don't want any of our help." The wagon went its way, the lantern disappeared, and Guy and Lucy were left alone in the darkness of the woods. The unhappy girl, dragging herself homeward from her visit to the cascades, had sunk down in a trance of misery and physical exhaustion near the spot where she was discovered. But she was now sufficiently aroused to perceive all the embarrassment of her situation. She had resolved in her soul, that, if ever Guy saw her again, he should not know from her lips what she had that afternoon witnessed; and how to account to him for her present condition she could not contrive. In vain she assumed an air of cheerfulness, and took his arm, assuring him that she was well, and able to walk. He questioned her at first tenderly, but at length impatiently. Her answers were incoherent and constrained. "How long have you been here?" "I don't know. I was tired, and sat down. I think I must have fallen asleep." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf730T&image=730-281.jpg) \- external link  - Page 276. ] "Why did you attempt to get away from me?" "I --- did not --- know you --- at first," faltered Lucy; which was perhaps true. "Still you thought we were looking for you." "I knew by what I heard that you were looking for some one. I was ashamed of having made trouble, and I thought I might get home without being seen." Her replies were becoming more natural and satisfactory than at first. Still the strangeness of her manner betrayed too plainly that she had suffered some unusual stroke, on the subject of which she was persistently silent. "Very well!" he said bitterly. "Treat me as a stranger; conceal from me your motives; leave your conduct a mystery. No doubt I have deserved it." "What a woman suffers, what a woman in my condition must suffer, any moment when she pauses to think, will always be a mystery to any one but a woman," answered Lucy. The words fell like fiery coals on his heart. "I have done every thing for you I could, --- all you would let me do. What more can I do?" "Be kind to me!" murmured Lucy in faint accents, full of helpless pain and entreaty. "Am I not kind? But your strange conduct tortures me beyond endurance.

I cannot make you happy!" She made no answer, and he said no more. They walked to Jehiel's house in silence. Perhaps Guy was not the least miserable of the two. His sufferings were fiery and keen, while hers had settled into a dull ache, --- a cold, curdling sorrow. At the door he relented; love and pity softening a heart which could be as tender at one moment as it was flinty at another. But her reserve repelled him: and she went up alone to her wretched room, unutterably desolate; while he parted from her as he had never done before, gnashing his teeth, --- a spectacle to the calm stars, and to the angels that look down with sad commiseration at the perverse ways of men.
