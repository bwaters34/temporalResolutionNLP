 the seeds of Chivalry before it became a solemn institution  7 . " Chivalry , as a distinct military order, "conferred in the way of investiture, and accompanied with the solemnity of an oath, and other ceremonies," was of later date, and sprung out of the feudal constitution, as an elegant writer has lately shown  8 . But the ideas of Chivalry prevailed long before in all the Gothic nations, and may be discovered as in embrio in the customs, manners, and opinions, of every branch of that people  9 . That fondness of going in quest of adventures, that spirit of challenging to single combat, and that respectful complaisance shewn to the fair sex, (so different from the manners of the Greeks and Romans), all are of Gothic origin, and may be traced up to the earliest times among all the northern nations  10 These existed long before the feudal ages, tho' they were called forth and strengthened in a peculiar manner under that constitution, and at length arrived to their full maturity in the times of the Crusades, so replete with romantic adventures  11 most of them familiar to the ancient Scalds of the north, long before the time of the Crusades. They believed the existence of Giants and Dwarfs  12 , they had some notion of Fairies  13 , they were strongly possessed with the belief of spells and inchantment  14 , and were fond of inventing combats with Dragons and Monsters  15 We have a striking instance of their turn for Chivalry and Romance, in the history of King Regner Lodbrog, a celebrated warrior and pirate, who reigned in Denmark about the year 800  16 . This hero signalized his youth by an exploit of gallantry. A Swedish prince had a beautiful daughter, whom he intrusted (probably during some expedition) to the care of one of his officers, assigning a strong castle for their defence. The Officer fell in love with his ward, and detained her in his castle, spite of all the efforts of her father. Upon this he published a proclamation through all the neighbouring countries, that whoever would conquer the ravisher and rescue the Lady should have her in marriage. Of all that undertook the adventure, Regner alone was so happy as to atchieve it: he delivered the fair captive, and obtained her for his prize. It happened that the name of this discourteous officer was Orme , which in the Islandic language signifies Serpent : Wherefore the Scalds, to give the more poetical turn to the adventure, represent the Lady as detained from her father by a dreadful Dragon, and that Regner slew the monster to set her at liberty. Even Regner himself, who was a celebrated poet, gives this fabulous account of the exploit in a poem of his own writing that is still extant, and which records all the valiant atchievements of his life  17 . decorate their narratives: and they were the more lavish of these, in proportion as they departed from their original institution, but it was a long time before they thought of delivering a set of personages and adventures wholly feigned. Of the great multitude of romantic tales still preserved in the libraries of the North, most of them are supposed to have had some foundation in truth, and the more ancient they are the more they are believed to be connected with true history  18 . It was not probably till after the historian and the bard had been long disunited, that the latter ventured at pure fiction. At length when their business was no longer to instruct or inform, but merely to amuse, it was no longer needful for them to adhere to truth. Then began fabulous and romantic songs which for a long time prevailed in France and England before they had books of Chivalry in prose. Yet in both these countries the Minstrels still retained so much of their original institution, as frequently to make true events the subject of their Songs  19 ; and indeed, as during the barbarous ages, the regular histories were almost all written in Latin by the Monks, the memory of events was preserved and propagated among the ignorant laity by scarce any other means than the popular Songs of the Minstrels. II. The inhabitants of Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, being the latest converts to Christianity, retained their original manners and opinions longer than the other nations of Gothic race: and therefore they have preserved more of the genuine compositions of their ancient poets, than their southern neighbours. Among these the progress from poetical history to poetical fiction is very discernible: they have some of the latter kind, that are in effect complete Romances of Chivalry  20 . They have also a multitude of Sagas 21 or histories on romantic subjects, containing a mixture of prose and verse, of various dates, some of them written since the times of the Crusades, others long before: but their narratives in verse only are esteemed the more ancient. Now as the irruption of the Normans 22 into France under Rollo did not take place till towards the beginning of the tenth century, at which time the Scaldic art was arrived to the highest pitch in Rollo's native country, we can easily trace the descent of the French and English Romances of Chivalry from the Northern Sagas. That conqueror doubtless carried many Scalds with him from the north, who transmitted their skill to their children and successors. These adopting the religion, opinions, and language of the new country, substituted the heroes of Christendom instead of those of their Pagan ancestors, and began to celebrate the feats of Charlemagne, Roland, and Oliver; whose true history they set off and embellished with the Scaldic figments of dwarfs, giants, dragons, and inchantments. The first mention we have in song of those heroes of chivalry is in the mouth of a Norman warrior at the conquest of England  23 : and this circumstance alone would sufficiently account for the propagation of this kind of romantic poems among the French and English. But this is not all; it is very certain, that both the Anglo-saxons and the Franks had brought with them, at their first emigrations into Britain and Gaul, the same fondness for the ancient songs of their ancestors, which prevailed among the other Gothic tribes  24 , and that all their first annals were transmitted in these popular oral poems. This fondness they even retained long after their conversion to Christianity, as we learn from the examples of Charlemagne and Alfred. 25 Now Poetry , being thus the transmitter of facts, would as easily learn to blend them with fictions in France and England, as she is known to have done in the north, and that much sooner, for the reasons before assigned  26 . This, together with the example and influence of the Normans, will easily account to us, why the first Romances of Chivalry that appeared both in England and France  27 were composed in metre, as a rude kind of epic songs. In both kingdoms tales in verse were usually sung by Minstrels to the harp on festival occasions: and doubtless both nations derived their relish for this sort of entertainment from their Teutonic ancestors, without either of them borrowing it from the other. Among both people narrative Songs on true or fictitious subjects had evidently obtained from the earliest times. But the professed Romances of Chivalry seem to have been first composed in France, where also they had their name. The Latin Tongue, as is observed by an ingenious writer  28 , ceased to be spoken in France about the ninth century, and was succeeded by what was called the Romance Tongue, a mixture of the language of the Franks and bad Latin. As the Songs of Chivalry became the most popular compositions in that language, they were emphatically called Romans or Romances of Chivalry can be traced as early as the eleventh century  29 The famous Roman de Brut by Maistre Eustache was written in 1155: But this was by no means the first poem of the kind; others more ancient are still extant  30 . And we have already seen, that, in the preceding century, when the Normans marched down to the battle of Hastings, they animated themselves, by singing (in some popular romance or ballad) the exploits of Roland and the other heroes of Chivalry 31 . So early as this I cannot trace the Songs of Chivalry in English. The most ancient I have seen, is that of Hornechild described below, which seems not older than the twelfth century. However, as this rather resembles the Saxon poetry, than the French, it is not certain that the first English Romances were translated from that language. We have seen above, that a propensity to this kind of fiction prevailed among all the Gothic nations; 32 and, tho' after the Norman Conquest, both the French and English translated each others Romances, there is no room to doubt, but both of them composed original pieces of their own. The stories of King Arthur and his Round Table, may be reasonably supposed of the growth of this island; both the English and the French had them from the Britons  33 . The stories of Guy and Bevis, with some others, were probably the invention of English Minstrels  34 . On the other hand, the English procured translations of such Romances as were most current in France; and in the List given at the conclusion of these Remarks, many are doubtless of French original. The first prose books of Chivalry that appeared in our language, were those printed by Caxton  35 ; at least, these are the first I have been able to discover, and these are all translations from the French. Whereas Romances of this kind had been long current in metre, and were so generally admired in the time of Chaucer, that his Rhyme of Sir Thopas was evidently written to ridicule and burlesque them 36 . He expressly mentions several of them by name in a stanza, which I shall have occasion to quote more than once in this volume. Men speken of Romaunces of Price, Of Horne-Child, and Ipotis, Of Bevis, and Sir Guy, Of Sir Libeaux and Blandamoure, But Sir Thopas bereth the floure, Of riall chevallrie. Most, if not all of these are still extant in MS. in some or other of our libraries, as I shall shew in the conclusion of this slight Essay, where I shall give a list of such metrical Histories and Romances as have fallen under my observation. As many of these contain a considerable portion of poetic merit, and throw great light on the manners and opinions of former times, it were to be wished that some of the best of them were rescued from oblivion. A judicious collection of them accurately published with proper illustrations, would be an important accession to our stock of ancient English Literature. Many of them exhibit no mean attempts at Epic Poetry, and tho' full of the exploded fictions of Chivalry, frequently display great descriptive and inventive powers in the Bards, who composed them. They are at least generally equal to any other poetry of the same age. They cannot indeed be put in competition with the nervous productions of so universal and commanding a genius as Chaucer, but they have a simplicity that makes them be read with less interruption, and be more easily understood: and they are far more spirited and entertaining than the tedious allegories of Gower, or the dull and prolix legends of Lydgate. Yet, while so much stress is laid upon the writings of these last, by such as treat of English poetry, the old metrical Romances, tho' far more popular in their time, are hardly known to exist. But it has happened unluckily, that the antiquaries, who have revived the works of our ancient writers, have been for the most part men void of taste and genius, and therefore have always fastidiously rejected the old poetical Romances, because founded on fictitious or popular subjects, while they have been careful to grub up every petty fragment of the most dull and insipid rhymist, whose merit it was to deform morality, or obscure true history. Should the public encourage the revival of some of those ancient Epic Songs of Chivalry, they would frequently see the rich ore of an Ariosto or a Tasso, tho' buried it may be among the rubbish and dross of barbarous times. Such a publication would answer many important uses: It would throw new light on the rise and progress of English poetry, the history of which can be but imperfectly understood, if these are neglected: It would also serve to illustrate innumerable passages in our ancient classic poets, which without their help must be for ever obscure. For not to mention Chaucer and Spencer, who abound with perpetual allusions to them, I shall give an instance or two from Shakespeare, by way of specimen of their use. In his play of King John our great Dramatic Poet alludes to an exploit of Richard I. which the reader will in vain look for in any true history. Faulconbridge says to his mother, Act 1 sc. 1. "Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose ... Against whose furie and unmatched force, The awlesse lion could not wage the fight, Nor keepe his princely heart from Richard's hand: He that perforce robs Lions of their hearts May easily winne a woman's:"--- The fact here referred to, is to be traced to its source only in the old Romance of Richard Ceur de , in which his encounter with a lion makes a very shining figure. I shall give a large extract from this poem, as a specimen of the manner of these old rhapsodists, and to shew that they did not in their fictions neglect the proper means to produce the ends, as was afterwards done in so childish a manner in the prose books of Chivalry. The poet tells us, that Richard in his return from the Holy Land having been discovered in the habit of "a palmer in Almayne," and apprehended as a spy, was by the king thrown into prison. Wardrewe, the king's son, hearing of Richard's great strength, desires the jailor to let him have a sight of his prisoners. Richard being the foremost. Wardrewe asks him, "if he dare stand a buffet from his hand?" and that on the morrow he shall return him another. Richard consents, and receives a blow that staggers him. On the morrow, having previously waxed his hands, he waits his antagonist's arrival. Wardrewe accordingly, proceeds the story, "held forth as a trewe man," and Richard gave him such a blow on the cheek, as broke his jaw-bone, and killed him on the spot. The king, to revenge the death of his son, orders, by the advice of one Eldrede, that a Lion kept purposely from food, shall be turned loose upon Richard. But the king's daughter having fallen in love with him, tells him of her father's resolution, and at his request procures him forty ells of white silk "kerchers;" and here the description of the Combat begins, The kever-chefes 38 he toke on honde, And aboute his arme he wonde; And thought in that ylke while, To slee the lyon with some gyle. And syngle in a kyrtyll he stode, And abode the lyon fyers and wode. With that came the jaylere, And other men that wyth him were, and the lyon them amonge; His pawes were stiffe and stronge. The chambre dore they undone, And the lyon to them is gone. Rycharde sayd, Helpe, lorde Jesu! The lyon made to hym venu, And wolde hym have all to rente: Kynge Rycharde besyde hym glente 39 . The lyon on the breste hym spurned, That aboute he tourned, The lyon was hongry and megre, And bette his tayle to be egre; He loked aboute as he were madde; Abrode he all his pawes spradde. He cryed lowde, and yaned 40 wyde. Kynge Rycharde bethought hym that tyde, What hym was beste, and to hym sterte, In at the throte his honde he gerte, And hente out the herte with his honde, Lounge and all that he there fonde. The lyon fell deed to the grounde: Rycharde felte no wem 41 , ne wounde, He fell on his knees on that place, And thanked Jesu of his grace. ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) What follows is not so well, and therefore I shall extract no more of this poem: but the preceding circumstances are not unworthy the selection of any Epic poet. ---For the above feat the author tells us, the king was deservedly called Stronge Rycharde Cure de Lyowne. Lear , Act 3. sc. 4. Mice and Rats and such small deere Have been Tom's food for seven long yeare, has excited the attention of the critics. Instead of deere , one of them would substitute geer ; and another cheer 42 . But the ancient reading is established by the old Romance of Sir Bevis , which Shakespeare had doubtless often heard sung to the harp. This distich is part of a description there given of the hardships suffered by Bevis, when confined for seven years in a dungeon. Rattes and myse and such smal dere Was his meate that seven yere. Sign. F. iii. III. In different parts of this work, the Reader will find various extracts from these old poetical Legends: to which I refer him for farther examples of their style and metre. To complete this subject, it will be proper at least to give one specimen of their skill in distributing and conducting their fable, by which it will be seen that nature and common sense had supplied to these old simple bards the want of critical art, and taught them some of the most essential rules of Epic Poetry.---I shall select the Romance of Libius Disconius 43 , as being one of those mentioned by Chaucer, and either shorter or more intelligible than the others he has quoted. If an Epic Poem may be defined, "  44 A fable related by a poet, to excite admiration and inspire virtue, by representing the action of some one hero, favoured by heaven, who executes a great design, in spite of all the obstacles that oppose him:" I know not why we should withhold the name of Epic Poem from the piece which I am about to analyse. My copy is divided into IX Parts or Cantos, the several arguments of which are as follows. Opens with a short exordium to bespeak attention: the Hero is described, a natural son of Sir Gawain, a celebrated knight of K. Arthur's court, who being brought up in a forest by his mother, is kept ignorant of his name and descent. He early exhibits marks of his courage, by killing a knight in single combat, who encountered him as he was hunting. This inspires him with a desire of seeking adventures: therefore cloathing himself in his enemy's armour, he goes to K. Arthur's Court, to request the order of knighthood. His request granted, he obtains a promise of having the first adventure assigned him that shall offer.---A damsel named Ellen, attended by a dwarf, comes to implore K. Arthur's assistance, to rescue a young Princess, "the Lady of Sinadone" their mistress, who is detained from her rights, and confined in prison. The adventure is claimed by the young knight Sir Lybius: the king assents: the messengers are dissatisfied, and object to his youth; but are forced to acquiesce. And here the first book closes with a description of the ceremony of equipping him forth. Sir Lybius sets out on the adventure: he is derided by the dwarf and the damsel on account of his youth: they come to the bridge of Perill, which none can pass without encountering a knight called William de la Braunch. Sir Lybius is challenged: they just with their spears: De la Braunch is dismounted: the battle is renewed on foot: Sir William's sword breaks: he yields. Sir Lybius makes him swear to go and present himself to K. Arthur, as the first-fruits of his valour. The conquered knight sets out for K. Arthur's court: is met by three knights, his relations: who, informed of his disgrace, vow revenge, and pursue the conqueror. The next day they overtake him: the eldest of the three attacks Sir Lybius: but is overthrown to the ground. The two other brothers assault him: Sir Lybius is wounded; yet cuts off the second brother's arm: the third yields: Sir Lybius sends them all to K. Arthur. In the third evening he is awaked by the dwarf, who has discovered a fire in a wood. Sir Lybius arms himself, and leaps on horseback: he finds two Giants roasting a wild boar, who have a fair Lady their captive. Sir Lybius, by favour of the night, runs one of them through with his spear: is assaulted by the other: a fierce battle ensues: he cuts off the giant's arm, and at length his head. The rescued Lady (an Earl's daughter) tells him her story; and leads him to her father's castle: who entertains him with a great feast; and presents him at parting with a suit of armour and a steed. He sends the giant's head to K. Arthur. Sir Lybius, maid Ellen, and the dwarf, renew their journey: they see a castle stuck round with human heads; and are informed it belongs to a knight called Sir Gefferon, who, in honour of his lemman or mistress, challenges all comers: He that can produce a fairer lady, is to be rewarded with a milk-white faulcon, but if overcome, to lose his head. Sir Lybius spends the night in the adjoining town: In the morning goes to challenge the faulcon. The knights exchange their gloves: they agree to just in the market place: the lady and maid Ellen are placed aloft in chairs: their dresses: the superior beauty of Sir Gefferon's mistress described: the ceremonies previous to the combat. They engage: the combat described at large: Sir Gefferon is incurably hurt; and carried home on his shield. Sir Lybius sends the faulcon to K. Arthur; and receives back a large present in florins. He stays 40 days to be cured of his wounds, which he spends in feasting with the neighbouring lords. Sir Lybius proceeds for Sinadone: in a forest he meets a knight hunting, called Sir Otes de Lisle: maid Ellen charmed with a very beautiful dog, begs Sir Lybius to bestow him upon her: Sir Otes meets them, and claims his dog: is refused: being unarmed he rides to his castle, and summons his attendants: they go in quest of Sir Lybius: a battle ensues: he is still victorious, and forces Sir Otes to follow the other conquered knights to K. Arthur. Sir Lybius comes to a fair city and castle by a river-side, beset round with pavilions or tents: he is informed, in the castle is a beautiful lady besieged by a giant named Maugys, who keeps the bridge, and will let none pass without doing him homage: this Lybius refuses: a battle ensues: the giant described: the several incidents of the battle; which lasts a whole summer's day: the giant is wounded; put to flight; slain. The citizens come out in procession to meet their deliverer: the lady invites him into her castle: falls in love with him: and seduces him to her embraces. He forgets the princess of Sinadone, and stays with this bewitching lady a twelvemonth. This fair sorceress, like another Alcina, intoxicates him with all kinds of sensual pleasure; and detains him from the pursuit of honour. Maid Ellen by chance gets an opportunity of speaking to him; and upbraids him with his vice and folly: he is filled with remorse, and escapes the same evening. At length he arrives at the city and castle of Sinadone: Is given to understand that he must challenge the constable of the castle to single combat, before he can be received as a guest. They just: the constable is worsted: Sir Lybius is feasted in the castle: he declares his intention of delivering their lady; and inquires the particulars of her history. "Two Necromancers have built a fine palace by sorcery, and there keep her inchanted, till she will surrender her duchy to them, and yield to such base conditions as they would impose." Early on the morrow Sir Lybius sets out for the inchanted palace. He alights in the court: enters the hall: the wonders of which are described in strong Gothic painting. He sits down at the high table: on a sudden all the lights are quenched: it thunders, and lightens; the palace shakes; the walls fall in pieces about his ears. He is dismayed and confounded: but presently hears horses neigh, and is challenged to single combat by the sorcerers. He gets to his steed: a battle ensues, with various turns of fortune: he loses his weapon: but gets a sword from one of the Necromancers, and wounds the other with it: the edge of the sword being secretly poisoned, the wound proves mortal. He goes up to the surviving sorcerer, who is carried away from him by inchantment: at length he finds him, and cuts off his head: He returns to the palace to deliver the lady: but cannot find her: as he is lamenting, a window opens, through which enters a horrible serpent with wings and a woman's face: it coils round his neck and kisses him; then is suddenly converted into a very beautiful lady. She tells him she is the Lady of Sinadone, and was so inchanted, till she might kiss Sir Gawain, or some one of his blood: that he has dissolved the charm, and that herself and her dominions may be his reward. He joyfully accepts the offer; makes her his bride, and then sets out with her for King Arthur's court." as regular in its conduct, as any of the finest poems of classical antiquity. If the execution, particularly as to the diction and sentiments, were but equal to the plan, it would be a capital performance; but this is such as might be expected in rude and ignorant times, and in a barbarous unpolished language. IV. I shall conclude this prolix account, with a List of such old Chaucer. I. The Romance of Horne-childe is preserved in the British Museum, where it is intitled yep geste of kyng Horne. See Catalog. Harl. MSS. 2253. p. 70\. The Language is almost Saxon, yet from the mention in it of Sarazens, it appears to have been written after some of the Crusades. It begins thus, All heo ben blyyee yeat to my song ylyyee: A song ychulle ou sing Of Allof yee gode kynte 45 &c. Another copy of this poem, but greatly altered and somewhat modernized, is preserved in the Advocates Library at Edinburgh, in a MS. quarto volume of old English poetry [W. 4. 1.] Num. XXXIV. in seven leaves or folios  46 , intitled, Horn-child and Maiden Rinivel , and beginning thus, Mi leve frende dere, Herken and ye may here. 2\. The Poem of Ipotis (or Ypotis ) is preserved in the Cotton Library, Calig. A. 2. fo. 77. but is rather a religious Legend, than a Romance. Its beginning is, He yeat wyll of wysdome here Herkeneth nowe ze may here Of a tale of holy wryte Seynt Jon the Evangelyste wytnesseth hyt. 3\. The Romance of Sir Guy , was written before that of Bevis, being quoted in it  47 . An account of this old poem is given below, pag. 100. To which it may be added, that two complete copies in MS. are preserved at Cambridge, the one in the public Library  48 , the other in that of Caius College, Class A. 8.---In Ames's Typog. p. 153. may be seen the first lines of the printed copy.---The 1st MS. begins, Sythe the tyme that God was borne. 4\. Guy and Colbronde , an old Romance in three parts, is preserved in the Editor's folio MS. (p. 349.) It is in stanzas of 6 lines, the first of which may be seen in vol. 2. p. 163. beginning thus, When meate and drinke is great plentye. In the Edinburgh MS. (mentioned above) are two ancient poems on the subject of Guy of Warwick : viz. Num. XVIII. containing 26. leaves. and XX. 59 leaves. Both these have unfortunately the beginnings wanting, otherwise they would perhaps be found to be different Copies of one or both the preceding articles. 5\. From the same MS. I can add another article to this list, viz. The Romance of Rembrun son of Sir Guy; being Num. XXI. in 9 leaves: this is properly a Continuation of the History of Guy : and in Art. 3. the Hist. of Rembrun follows that of Guy as a necessary Part of it. This Edinburgh Romance of Rembrun begins thus Jesu that erst of mighte most Fader and sone and Holy Gost. Before I quit the subject of Sir Guy , I must observe, that if we may believe Dugdale in his Baronage, [vol. I. p. 243. col. 2.] the fame of our English Champion had in the time of Henry IV. travelled as far as the East, and was no less popular among the Sarazens, than here in the West among the Nations of Christendom. In that reign a Lord Beauchamp travelling to Jerusalem, was kindly received by a noble person, the Soldan's Lieutenant, who hearing he was descended from the famous Guy of Warwick, "whose story they had in books of their own language," invited him to his palace; and royally feasting him, presented him with three precious stones of great value; besides divers cloaths of silk and gold given to his servants. 6\. The Romance of Syr Beuis is described in pag. 216. of this vol. Two manuscript copies of this poem are extant at Cambridge; viz. in the Public Library  49 , and in that of Caius Coll. Class A. 9. (5.)---The first of these begins, Lordyngs lystenyth grete and smale. There is also a Copy of this Romance of Sir Bevis of Hamptoun , in the Edinburgh MS. Numb. XXII. consisting of 25 leaves, and beginning thus, Lordinges kerkneth to mi tale, Is merier than the nightengale. The printed copies begin different from both: viz. Lysten, Lordinges, and hold you styl. 7\. Libeaux (Libeaus , or, Lybius) Disconius is preserved in the Editor's folio MS. (pag. 317.) where the first stanza is, Jesus Christ christen kinge, And his mother that sweete thinge, Helpe them at their neede, That will listen to my tale, Of a Knight I will you tell, A doughtye man of deede. An older copy is preserved in the Cotton Library [Cal. A. 2. fol. 40.] containing innumerable variations: the first line is, Jesu Christ our Savyour. As for Blandamoure , no Romance with this title has been discovered;, but as the word occurs in that of Libeaux , 'tis possible Chaucer's memory deceived him. 8\. Le Morte Arthure , is among the Harl. MSS. 2252.  § 49\. This is judged to be a translation from the French; Mr. Wanly thinks it no older than the time of Hen. vii. but it seems to be quoted in Syr Beuis, (Sign. K. ij. b.) It begins Lordinges, that are lesse and deare. In the Library of Bennet Coll. Cambridge, N o . 351. is a MS. intitled in the Cat. Acta Arthuris Metrico Anglicano , but I know not whether it has any thing in common with the former. 9\. In the Editor's Folio MS. are many Songs and Romances about King Arthur and his Knights, some of which are very imperfect, as K. Arthur and the king of Cornwall . (p. 24.) in stanzas of 4 Lines, beginning Come here, my cozen Gawain so gay. The Turke and Gawain , (p. 38.) in stanzas of 6 lines, beginning thus, Listen, Lords, great and small. Sir Lionel in distichs (p. 32.) thus beginning, Sir Egrabell had Sonnes three. but these are so imperfect that I do not make distinct articles of them. See also in this Vol. Book 1. N o . 1. II. IV. V. 10\. In the same MS. p. 203. is the Greene Knight , in 2 Parts, relating a curious adventure of Sir Gawain, in stanzas of 6 lines, beginning thus, List: when Arthur he was kinge. 11\. The Carle of Carlisle , is another romantic tale about Sir Gawain, in the same MS. p. 448. in distichs. Listen to me a little stonde. In all these old poems the same set of knights are always drawn with the same manners and characters; which seem to have been as well known and as distinctly marked among our ancestors, as Homer's Heroes were among the Greeks: For as Ulysses is always represented crafty, Achilles irascible, and Ajax rough. So Sir Gawain is ever courteous and gentle, Sir Kay rugged and disobliging,  &c. " Sir Gawain with his ould courtesy " is mentioned by Chaucer as noted to a proverb, in his Squire's Tale. Urry's Ed. p. 60. v. 115. 12\. Syr Launfal , an excellent old Romance concerning another of K. Arthur's Knights, is preserved in the Cotton Library, Calig. A. 2. f. 33. This is a translation from the French  50 made by one Thomas Chestre , who is supposed to have lived in the reign of Hen. vi. [See Tanner's Biblioth.] It is in stanzas of 6 Lines, and begins, Le douzty Artours dawes. The above was afterwards altered by some Minstrel into the Romance of Sir Lambwell , in 3 Parts, under which title it was more generally known  51 . This is in the Editor's folio MS. p. 60. beginning thus, Doughty in king Arthures dayes. 13\. The Romance of Merline , in 9 Parts, (preserved in the same folio MS. p. 144.) gives a curious account of the birth, parentage, and juvenile adventures of this famous British Prophet. In this poem the Saxons are called Sarazens ; and the thrusting the rebel angels out of Heaven is attributed to " oure Lady. " It is in distichs, and begins thus, He that made with his hand. There is an old Romance Of Arthour and of Merlin , in the Edinburgh MS. of old English Poems: I know not whether it has any thing in common with this last mentioned. It is in the volume, numbered XXIII. and extends through 55 leaves. The two first Lines are Jesu Crist, heven king Al ous graunt gode ending. 14\. Sir Isenbras , (or as it is in the MS. copies. Sir Isumbras ) is quoted in Chaucer's R. of Thop. v. 6. Among Mr. Garrick's old plays is a printed copy; of which an account has been already given, in Vol. 1. p. 305. It is preserved in MS. in the Library of Caius Coll. Camb. Class A. 9. (2.) and also in the Cotton Library, Cal. A. 12. (f. 128.) This is extremely different from the printed copy. E.g. God yeat made both eryee and hevene. 15\. Emar e , a very curious and ancient Romance, is preserved in the same Vol. of the Cotton Library, f. 69. It is in stan. of 6 lines, and begins thus, Jesu yeat ys kyng in trone. 16\. Chevelere assigne , or, The Knight of the Swan, preserved in the Cotton Library, has been already described in Vol. 2. p. 272. as hath also 17\. The Sege of Jerlam , (or Jerusalem) which seems to have been written after the other, and may not improperly be classed among the Romances: as may also the following which is preserved in the same volume: viz. 18\. Owaine Myles , (fol. 90) giving an account of the wonders of St. Patrick's Purgatory. This is a translation into verse of the story related in Mat. Paris's Hist. (sub Ann. 1153.)---It is in distichs beginning thus, God yeat ys so full of myght. In the same Manuscript are one or two other narrative poems, which might be reckoned among the Romances, but being rather religious Legends, I shall barely mention them; as, Tundale , f. 17. Trentale Sci Gregorii. f. 84. Jerome. f. 133. Eustache. f. 136. 19\. Octavian imperator , an ancient Romance of Chivalry, is in the same vol. of the Cotton Library, f. 20. ---Notwithstanding the name, this old poem has nothing in common with the history of the Roman Emperors. It is in a very peculiar kind of Stanza, whereof 1, 2, 3,  & 5, rhyme together, as do the 4 and 6. It begins thus, Ihesu yeat was with spere ystonge. In the public Library at Camb.  52 is a poem with the same title, that begins very differently Lyttyll and mykyll, olde and yonge. 20\. Eglamour of Artas (or Artoys ) is preserved in the same Vol. with the foregoing both in the Cotton Library, and public Library at Camb. It is also in the Editor's folio MS. p. 295 where it is divided into 6 Parts.---A printed Copy is in the Bodleian Library, C. 39. Art. Seld. And among Mr. Garrick's old plays, K. vol. X. It is in distichs, and begins thus, Ihesu Crist of heven kyng. 21\. Syr Triamore (in stan. of 6. Lines) is preserved in MS. in the Editor's folio Volume, p. 210. and in the public Library at Camb. (690.  § 29\. Vid. Cat. MSS. p. 394.)---Two printed Copies are extant in the Bodleian Library, and among Mr. Garrick's plays in the same volumes with the last article. Both the Editor's MS. and the printed Copies begin Nowe Jesu Chryste our heven kynge. The Cambridge Copy, thus, Heven blys that all shall wynne. 22\. Sir Degree (Degare , or Degore , which last seems the true title) in 5 parts, in distichs, is preserved in the Editor's folio MS. p. 371. and in the public Library at Camb. (ubi supra.)---A printed Copy is in the Bod. Library, C. 39. Art. Seld. and among Mr. Garrick's plays K. vol. IX.---The Editor's MS. and the printed Copies begin Lordinge, and you wyl holde you styl. The Cambridge MS. has it Lystenyth, lordyngis, gente and fre. 23\. Ipomydon , (or Chylde Ipomydon ) is preserved among the Harl. MSS. 2252. (44.) It is in distichs and begins, Mekely, lordyngis, gentylle and fre. In the Library of Lincoln Cathedral. K k. 3. 10. is an old imperfect printed Copy, wanting the whole first sheet A. 24\. The Squyr of Lowe degre , is one of those burlesqued by Chaucer in his R. of Thopas  53 \---Mr. Garrick has a printed Copy of this, among his old plays, K. Vol. IX. It begins It was a squyer of lowe degre, That loved the kings daughter of Hungre. 24\. Historye of K. Richard Cure [ Coeur ] de Lyon . [Impr. W. de Worde, 1528. 4to.] is preserved in the Bodleian Library, C. 39. Art. Selden. A fragment of it is also remaining in the Edinburgh MS. of old English Poems; Num. XXXVI. in 2 leaves. A large Extract from this Romance has been given already above, p. xv. Richard was the peculiar patron of Chivalry, and therefore was a favourite with the old Minstrels. See Warton's Observ. V. 1. p. 29. V. 2. p. 40. 26\. The following I have not seen, but I believe they may all be referred to the Class of Romances. The Knight of Courtesy and the Lady of Faguel (Bodl. Lib. C. 39. Art. Seld. a printed Copy.) This Mr. Warton thinks is the Story of Coucy's Heart, related in Fauchet, and in Howel's Letters. [V. 1. S. 6. L. 20. See Wart. Obs. V. 2. p. 40.] The Editor has seen a very beautiful old ballad on this subject in French. 27\. The four following are all preserved in the MS. so often referred to in the public Library at Camb. (690. Appendix to Bp. More's MSS. in Cat. MSS. Tom. 2. p. 394.) viz. The Erle of Tholouse . (N  o 27.) beginning Jesu Chryste in Trynyte. 28\. Roberd Kynge of Cysyll (or Sicily) shewing the fall of Pride. Of this there is also a Copy among the Harl. MSS. 1703. (3.) The Camb. MS. begins Princis that be prowde in prese. 29\. Le bone Florence of Rome , beginning thus As ferre as men ride or gone. 30\. Dioclesian the Emperour , beginning, Sum tyme ther was a noble man. 31\. The two knightly brothers Amys and Amelion (among the Harl. MSS. 2386. § 42.) I suppose to be an old Romance of Chivalry; as also the fragment of the Lady Belesant, the Duke of Lombardy's fair daughter , mentioned in the same article. See the Catalog. Vol. 2. 32\. In the Edinburgh MS. so often referred to (preserved in the Advocates Library, W 4. 1.) might probably be found some other articles to add to this list, as well as other copies of some of the pieces mentioned in it; for the whole Volume contains not fewer than XXXVII poems or romances, some of them very long. But as many of them have lost the beginnings, which have been cut out for the sake of the illuminations; and as I have not had an opportunity of examining the MS. myself, I shall be content to mention only the articles that follow  54 , viz. An old Romance about Rouland (not I believe the famous Paladine, but a champion named Rouland Louth ; quere) being in the Volume, Numb. XXVII. in 5 leaves, and wants the beginning. 33\. Another Romance, that seems to be a kind of continuation of this last, intitled, Otuel a Knight , (Numb. XXVIII. in 11 leaves and a half.) The two first lines are, Herkneth both zinge and old, That willen heren of battailes bold. 34\. The King of Tars (Numb. IV. in 5 leaves and a hal) beginning thus, Herkneth to me bothe eld and zing, For Maries love that swete thing. 35\. A Tale or Romance, (Numb. 1. 2 leaves), that wants both beginning and end. The first lines now remaining are, Th Erl him graunted his will y-wis. that the knicht him haden y told. The Baronnis that were of mikle pris. befor him thay weren y-cald. 36\. Another mutilated Tale or Romance (Numb. III. 4 leaves). The first lines at present are, To Mr Steward wil y gon. and tellen him the sothe of the Reseyved bestow sone anon. gif zou will serve and with hir be. 37\. A mutilated Tale or Romance (Numb. XI. in 13 leaves). The two first lines that occur are, That riche Douke his fest gan hold With Erls and with Baronns bold. I cannot conclude my account of this curious Manuscript, without acknowledging publicly, that I am indebted to the friendship of the Reverend Dr. Blair , the present ingenious Professor of Belles Lettres in the University of Edinburgh, for whatever I know of its contents, and for the important additions it has enabled me to make to the foregoing List.
