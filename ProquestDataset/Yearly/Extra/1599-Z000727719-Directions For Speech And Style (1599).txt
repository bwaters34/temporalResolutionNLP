 and of unconventional career. He left no published book or other record of distinguished achievement to keep his name alive. Yet the influence he wielded through his public labors and through his conversation and unpublished writings can be traced multifariously in documents remaining from seventeenth century England. As will appear later, he seems to have had some direct influence in shaping the prose writings of Ben Jonson and Sir Walter Ralegh. His verses in Latin and in English appear in dozens of manuscripts and in printed miscellanies. Latin inscriptions of his composition adorn several tombs. The circumstance that his son, Sir Bennet Hoskins, was a friend of John Aubrey has resulted in our having a fairly complete picture of John Hoskins in his private person; and every stroke of this picture adds to our impression that in its subject we have a man of mark, a 'character'---one of those originals in which the seventeenth century seemed to abound. Anthony  a Wood 1 is likewise very full upon Hoskins, recording one or two anecdotes which do not appear in Aubrey's manuscripts. Doubtless much more biographical material than is now generally available will come to light. The present account draws largely, as will be seen, upon Aubrey,  2 with some additions and corrections taken in part from W. P. Courtney's article in the Dictionary of National Biography. Hoskins was born into a middle-class country family at Monnington-upon-Wye (formerly Monkton) in Herefordshire. His parents did not intend that he should receive a literary education, and by Aubrey's account John was ten years old before he learned, through his own unaided efforts, to read (i.e., to read Latin?); but within a year he was working upon Greek. His father sent him to Westminster School for a year and to Winchester for the remainder of his preparatory studies. He was matriculated in New College, Oxford, in 1585, proceeded B. A. in 1588, and M. A. in 1592. For the Commencement exercises in February 1592, Hoskins was appointed terrae filius , a speaker charged with delivering a burlesque oration. Although the filius was a licensed person (the corresponding figure at Cambridge was called prevaricator ), Hoskins's oration went so far in its satire and buffoonery that he was exiled by the authorities. He withdrew to Somerset and supported himself by teaching school. He began preparing a lexicon of the Greek language, but proceeded with it no farther than the letter Mu. Then he became a lively and learned member of the Middle Temple and mastered the law. 3 He seems to have been admitted to the bar in one of the early years of the seventeenth century, though he did not become 'Serjeant Hoskyns'(as he is usually styled in later seventeenth century references) until 1623. In the meantime, as a Templar and a young lawyer, he enjoyed his acquaintanceship among the wits, writers, lawyers, and 'under-secretaries at court.'  4 What seems to have been the most fortunate step of his life was his marriage with a wealthy widow, Benedicta Bourne (n ee Moyle) of Sutton St. Clare, Somersetshire. Francis Bourne, her first husband, was buried at Bath Abbey in 1600, and it is supposed that this marriage took place in 1601 or thereabouts. From this time, Hoskins's worldly fortune and position became steadily more favorable. In 1604 he was elected to the House of Commons as member for the city of Hereford; he was returned in 1614 and 1628. That freedom in speech which had made him unacceptable as terrae filius at Oxford, when exercised upon the floor of the House, cost him an imprisonment in the Tower for more than two hundred days, beginning in July 1614. In 1611 he became a stockholder (having adventured  £37 IOS.) in the Virginia Company; on the same subscription list appear the names of his friend Christopher Brooke, a minor poet, and William Crashaw, father of Richard--- not to mention Dudley Digges, Carew Ralegh, Henry Goodyer, Nicholas Ferrar, and many others well known to posterity.  5 In 1619 Hoskins was made Lent reader of his Inn; and later he was appointed a justice-itinerant of Wales and member of the Council of the Marches. His declining years seem to have been spent largely at his fine country seat at Morehampton, in Herefordshire, purchased about 1621. Aubrey records the Latin, Hebrew, and Greek inscriptions which Hoskins placed in the gate-house, chapel, galleries, and garden of this estate. Thomas Fuller, in commenting upon the vigor of aged people in Herefordshire, tells this anecdote:  6 The ingenious Serjeant Hoskins gave an intertainment to King Iames and p[r]ovided ten aged people to dance the Morish before him; all of them making up more then a thousand yeares . Upon circumstances that led up to Hoskins's death, Aubrey's account is detailed: Not many moneths before his death (being at the assises or sessions at Hereford) a massive countrey fellowe trod on his toe, which caused a gangrene which was the cause of his death. One Mr. Dighton of Glocester (an experienced chirurgian who had formerly been chirurgian in the warres in Ireland) was sent for to cure him; but his skill and care could not save him. His toes were first cutt-off. The minister of his parish had a clubbefoote or feete (I think his name was Hugh). Said he, 'Sir Hugh'---after his toes were cutt off---'I must be acquainted with your shoemaker.' Hoskins was buried in the abbey church at Dore, Herefordshire, and a tomb was erected with a Latin inscription in twenty-four verses, eulogizing him for his twofold accomplishments, in law and government on the one hand, in poetry and letters on the other. The literary friendships of Hoskins began at Winchester College, where he knew John Owen, later the chief Latin epigrammatist of England. Either there or at Oxford he met Henry (later Sir Henry) Wotton, and through him gained at least a second-hand acquaintance with Sir Philip Sidney and his literary methods. Later, Hoskins was a drinking-companion of Ben Jonson, Sir Benjamin Rudyerd, and Richard Martin (the early friend of Sir John Davies) and an acquaintance of John Donne, John Selden, and Samuel Daniel. He fought a duel with Rudyerd, but after it, seems to have patched up the friendship. Richard Zouche, the civilian, was sufficiently close to Hoskins or his friends to have known, by 1613, of the existence of the Directions. 7 'In shorte,' says Aubrey, 'his acquaintance were all the witts then about the towne; e.g. Sir Walter Raleigh, who was his fellow-prisoner in the Tower, where he was Sir Walter's Aristarchus to reviewe and polish Sir Walter's stile.' Most notable of all, 'Ben: Johnson called him father . Sir Benet ... told me that one time desiring Mr. Johnson to adopt him for his sonne, "No," said he, "I dare not; 'tis honour enough for me to be your brother: I was your father's sonne, and 'twas he that polished me".' The truth of this last relation is enforced by the discovery that Jonson set down in his Timber a considerable passage from the introductory epistle, and the entire section on letter-writing, of Hoskins's Directions for Speech and Style . The friendship of humbler writers is recorded in the several epigrams addressed to Hoskins by John Owen and the epigrams 'To my beloued Mr Iohn Hoskins'and 'To my ingenious deere friend and Countryman Mr Iohn Hoskins, Councellor at Law'by John Davies of Hereford.  8 Hoskins was one of the host of poets and wits contributing commendatory verses to Coryats Crudities (1611), and his varied offering in English and Latin runs to several pages. He was named as one of 'the lovers of Vertue, and Literature' in Coryat's letter of 1615 'To the High Seneschall of the Right Worshipfull Fraternitie of Sireniacall Gentlemen, that meete the first Friday of euery moneth, at the signe of the Mermaid in Bread-street. '  9 A review of Hoskins's writings, both extant and lost, will show the nature of his talents. First of all, he contributed eight Latin poems to Peplus (1587), the volume of memorial verse written by members of New College in honor of Sir Philip Sidney. Two of these poems run to more than a hundred lines each; the total for all the poems is four hundred and thirty-six lines. The unfinished Greek lexicon and Directions for Speech and Style 10 probably come next in order of composition. Besides these, he left, according to Aubrey, 'a method of lawe (imperfect).'Also, 'he had a booke of poemes, neatly written by one of his clerkes, bigger then Dr. Donne's poemes, which his sonn Benet lent to he knowes not who, about 1653, and could never heare of it since.' From this book we probably have some specimens in the 'Ode'beginning, 'Absence, hear thou my protestation,'first published in Davison's Poetical Rhapsody of 1602,  11 and in the dozen or more epigrams and lyrics found in the 'Dr. Farmer Chetham Manuscript.'  12 Some of his best satirical epitaphs appear in all editions of Camden's Remaines as 'composed by Master Iohn Hoskines when he was young.'A work which to modern readers might be more interesting than his poems is Hoskins's lost autobiography, described by Aubrey in a sentence of confused syntax but fairly plain intent: He wrote his owne life (which his grandsonne Sir John Hoskyns, knight and baronet, haz), which was to shew that wheras Plutarch, ..., ..., etc., had wrote the lives of many generalles, etc., grandees, that he, or an active man might, from a private fortune by his witt and industry attained to the dignity of a serjeant-at-lawe \---but he should have said that they must have parts like his too.---This life I cannot borrowe. Aubrey also set down a memorandum 'to collect his nonsense discourse, which is very good.'One specimen of such discourse is reprinted in Appendix B, below, from Le Prince d'Amour (1660), where it appeared without Hoskins's name. In the Directions there is an allusion to 'my booke of Charity and resignacion ,' with a quotation from it; there are also allusions to the piece of 'nonsense discourse'already mentioned, to 'my speech of a widdowe,' and to a passage 'reprehendinge the prodigality of monuments in the speech of D. H.,' apparently Hoskins's own. Here we may properly raise the question, when did Hoskins write the Directions ? To date the composition of it is not difficult. There are allusions to books and events which form a fairly complete series down to a certain date and then break off. Beginning with Euphues (1578), spoken of as belonging to an older generation, we can follow the allusions down through Albions England (1586, etc.), The Faerie Queen (1590, 1596), the Arcadia (1590, 1593), Davies's Orchestra (1596), and Bacon's Essayes (1597). Thomas Bilson is mentioned as 'Bishop of W.' The letter could stand for Worcester, where Bilson was consecrated bishop in 1596, but more probably means Winchester, to which see he was translated in 1597. John Lyly ( d. 1606) and Queen Elizabeth ( d. 1603) are spoken of as still living. There is a veiled reference to the attack by John Davies upon his friend Richard Martin, which occurred in 1598. Finally there is the sentence (introduced as an example of synecdoche), 'the Earle is gone into Ireland for E:E:' which can be taken only as an allusion to the Earl of Essex and his unhappy Irish expedition of 1599. These words might have been written shortly before Essex went, as a specimen of the talk then going around. They were more probably written while he actually was in Ireland (April through September, 1599); but again they could have been written in the months after his return and thus represent gossip to the effect that Essex had 'gone into Ireland' again. They could hardly have been written later than early in 1601, for the outbreak of Essex's conspiracy took place on February 7-8 of that year. The fact that no books published later than 1597 are alluded to, and no events later than 1599, leads to the conclusion that the composition of the Directions belongs to the years 1599-1600, while the allusion to Essex makes 1599 the more likely date. A reader of the present work finds no reason to doubt the statements of its title-page and introductory epistle regarding the author's design. From these we learn that Hoskins wished to instruct a young gentleman of the Temple in the best modes of speech and writing. As an admirer of Sidney's style he believed that he could exemplify these modes by quotations from the Arcadia. Also, as a student of rhetoric for many years he believed that he could make a new classification of figures, one more useful and simple, perhaps, than the classifications made by previous writers. With the Directions he gave to the young man a copy of the Arcadia , as published 1590 in quarto, which he had profusely annotated in the margins: he had indicated the presence of metaphors by an M , notable descriptions by des , and passages exemplifying poetic decorum by dc. Hoskins also mentions having given his young friend directions for compiling a synonym-book. This fact, taken with other hints here and there, suggests that the relation of the two men had been that of tutor and pupil. We learn also that the father of the pupil was a friend of Hoskins; and from scattered passages we glean the suggestion that the young man came from the country and expected to return thither after he had received training in the law. We have, then, a text-book in rhetoric, but one written in the language of familiar address. As a good schoolmaster Hoskins missed no opportunity of edifying his pupil, loading even his invented examples with advice upon the proper conduct of life. But as a friend he was free to speak without formality, to make allusions to writings of his own which evidently he had shown to the young man, and to indulge in jokes, personalities, and asides. He wished his student to improve himself not only in his writing but also in his public speaking and conversation. The figure of anaphora, for instance, 'beates vppon one thinge to cause the quicker feeling in the audience,  & to awake a sleepie or dull person .' Paronomasia or 'that kinde of breakinge wordes into another meaning is prettie to play wth amonge gentlewomen,'but is to be eschewed in dignified public address. Accumulation and division 'doe amase an adversarie of meane conceipt.' Plainly Hoskins kept in mind the actual demands which the career of the young man would make upon him, the occasions for discourse which normally might arise in the life of such a person. On the other hand, he did not write a complete ars rhetorica , comparable with the classical treatises he had studied. Aside from the discussion of letter-writing, he confined himself to two of the five traditional canons of rhetoric. From the late Greek period rhetoric had been handled under the headings of (1) inventio (finding and gathering material), (2) dispositio (arrangement), (3) elocutio (style, phrasing), (4) memoria (memorizing), and (5) pronuntiatio (delivery). The 'speech and style'of Hoskins's title points to the two divisions of 'pronunciation'and 'elocution.' Such a limitation of rhetorical instruction was by no means novel, but had become fairly orthodox: the canon of memoria had been almost universally dropped out; and except by a few (and those earlier than Hoskins), such as Melanchthon in Germany and Coxe and Wilson in England, invention and disposition had been turned over to writers on dialectic and logic; elocution (or style) and delivery had come to be the favored subjects,  13 and elocution alone was sometimes talked about as constituting the whole of rhetorical art. Hoskins's two subjects correspond exactly with those of the Ramist Rhetorica by Omer Talon (Audomarus Talaeus), one of the avowed sources of his work, while Johann Sturm, another of his masters, had written a work upon elocution alone. The section on pronunciation, though called for by the title-page, is not extant. We have left, then, a section on letter-writing (which represents the art of dictamen that had been brought into alliance with rhetoric during the Middle Ages  14 ) and a much longer section on rhetorical style. It is to be noticed that in presenting the subject of letter-writing, however, Hoskins refused to follow the mediaeval ars dictaminis , with its lore of forms and ceremonies, or even the popular treatises in English which had grown out of it, with their elaborate classifications of letters. He turned his attention rather to the familiar letter, and he put out of court (or, perhaps, back in court, where it belonged) the empty diffuseness and pomp of the official style. He followed the recently published Epistolica Institutio (1590) of Justus Lipsius, and thereby shared in that tendency toward terse and significant utterance which had appeared, variously, in Lipsius, Montaigne, and Bacon. Instruction in style had become, for all practical purposes, instruction in using figures of speech. We must recall at once, however, that to an educated man of the sixteenth century (and of earlier centuries) the category of 'figures' included a much broader range of stylistic devices than we now associate with the term; that some of these devices, such as description, example, allegory, and irony, were of such inclusive and basic character that to discuss them was to discuss the largest considerations relevant to discourse. It will be seen by a reader of the present work, for example, that in canvassing some forty figures Hoskins finds opportunity to give instruction upon almost all of the topics one might expect in a rhetorical work. His adherence to a list of figures prevented his treating some matters of diction and sentence-structure which properly found a place in essays upon rhetorical elocution; yet these were touched upon, at least, in the section upon letter- writing. As to further omissions, it is strange, in the light of the author's use of the Arcadia , that he omits consideration of epithets. For epitheton appears in many of the lists of figures he had consulted, the subject had been discussed by Aristotle in the third book of his Rhetoric , and Sidney's use of compound epithets (as in his 'day-shining stars'or 'many-headed multitude') had already been remarked upon by Joseph Hall in Virgidemiarum (1598):  15 He knows the grace of that new elegance, Which sweet Philisides fetch't of late from France , That well beseem'd his high-stil'd Arcady , Tho others marre it with much liberty; In Epithets to ioyne two words in one, Forsooth for Adiectiues cannot stand alone, As a great Poet could of Bacchus say, That he was Semele-femori-gena. Furthermore, Sidney himself had commended the compounding of words in his Defence of Poesie :  16 ... And [our language] is perticularly happy in compositions of two or three wordes togither, neare the Greeke, farre beyond the Latine, which is one of the greatest bewties can be in a language. It is possible that Hoskins agreed with Hall's unfavorable opinion of the compound epithet and preferred passing over the subject in silence to writing a commentary that would have sounded apologetic. Two other figures ordinarily presented by rhetoricians but omitted by Hoskins are onomatopoeia and aposiopesis.  17 Possibly the rarity, or absence, of examples in the Arcadia accounts for the omission of these. The classification of figures has ever been one of the most difficult tasks of the rhetorician, and the performing of this task has resulted in much confusion and debate. What had come to be a more or less established classification may be outlined briefly. We first divide figures into figures of words and figures of thought . Figures of words may then be divided into tropes and schemes. 18 A trope is a figure which involves using words to mean something different from their ordinary, or proper, meaning---as in metaphor and metonymy. In a scheme, or figure of arrangement, however, words are used in their literal sense but are arranged or repeated in an unusual or artificial way---as in alliteration or in balanced phrases (parison). So much for figures of words. Figures of thought are devices which involve more than a word, phrase, or sentence, devices wherein the thought itself is given an unusual or artificial treatment, as in dilemmas, examples, wordportraits, or imaginary dialogues. At once we see that a figure of words may appear within the compass of a figure of thought. The classification seems convenient and simple, but it breaks down as one brings into it all of the possible variety of discourse. Antithesis, for example, is at once a scheme (i.e., a figure of words) and a figure of thought. The same holds for iteration (on an extended scale) and for parenthesis. Periphrasis was sometimes classified as a trope and sometimes as a scheme; but there would seem to be grounds for calling it a figure of thought. Sententia , or the apothegmatic remark, was sometimes made a figure of words and sometimes a figure of thought. It may be said that many writers altered the very framework of the classification and recognized figures of words which fell into the class neither of schemes or of tropes, or introduced such headings as 'figures of sound'or made special groupings within the larger classes.  19 Wisely, in view of his purpose, Hoskins ignored the technicalities and tangles of such a classification. Instead he made a division, as we might say, upon a functional basis, and treated the figures as aids (1) in varying, (2) in amplification, and (3) in illustration.  20 If we might interpret his terms in more familiar language, we find him saying, in effect, that the principal virtues of the writer and speaker are variety, impressiveness, and vividness. Such a one must know how to avoid monotony, how to magnify his theme (or, corresponding to this, how to minimize a hostile or unwelcome idea), and how to awaken the imagination of his hearers or readers. Such a classification will not prove, to be sure, logically perfect; there will be overlappings and border-line cases. But it has the virtue of throwing the emphasis away from figures as ends in themselves, or as ornaments, and upon the larger problems of their user. It was this classification that justified Hoskins's claim that his directions proceeded 'otherwise than euer any precepts haue taught.' The result of this method makes the reader believe that a student using the Directions might actually have become more forceful and more interesting in his speech and writing. By his sense of balance, and by his hostility to fads and affectations, Hoskins placed himself in the main stream of the English prose tradition. Much as he owed to Lipsius, he still spoke of Cicero with respect, and borrowed from Quintilian more than one caution against writing all matter in short sentences and prose epigrams. 'But let discrecion ,' he says, 'bee the greatest  & generall figure of figures.'Adherence to such an injunction leads directly away from Euphuism, away from some of the excesses at least, of Arcadianism, and towards the prose of Jonson, Ralegh, and Dryden. So far we have been thinking of Hoskins's main and explicit purpose. The modern reader, however, may well find greater value in subsidiary matters, in the by-products of the work. These need not be dwelt upon, as they will appear upon even a hasty reading of the Directions. For the light Hoskins throws upon Arcadianism, upon Sidney, upon Euphuism, and upon the new movement towards a 'sententious'or Senecan style, we must needs be grateful. Then there are incidental comments upon writers and preachers of the age--- Francis Bacon, John Davies, Bishops Bilson and Matthew, and 'Mr. P.'There are Hoskins's good-humored protests against fashions in rhetoric and against the overworked words of the time, 'App  re hensiveness Complem ts Spirrit accommodate &c,' though he had himself caught from his master, Sidney, a trick of overworking the word sweet and its derivatives, and he had caught from other mea of the time a fondness for humour and humourous. He reveals, indeed, much concerning his own writings and more of his mind and character ---good-tempered, companionable, facetious, keen, and a little too independent for his own good. Yet, when all is said, Directions for Speech and Style remains chiefly as a document witnessing to the charm exerted by the person and writings of Sir Philip Sidney. Even before the Arcadia was printed, Abraham Fraunce had written and published his Arcadian Rhetorike (1588?) containing about eighty quotations from the manuscript of the romance and that of Astrophel and Stella . Hoskins's shorter work contains more than one hundred and eighty quotations and citations (almost none of which had been used by Fraunce), with page-references for about one hundred and forty of them. The continuous emulation of Sidney's style by English writers appears in the sequels or additions to the Arcadia written by Gervase Markham (two parts, 1607, 1613), Sir William Alexander (1621), R. B. (1624), James Johnston (1638), and Anne Weamys (1651). All of these writers strove to attain to the right Arcadian style. At the time Hoskins was writing, Ben Jonson rather satirically represented Fastidius Briske as making the Arcadia the standard in pure phrases and choice figures.  21 Later Jonson was to say:  22 Sir Philip Sidney and Mr. Hooker (in different matter) grew great Masters of wit, and language; and in whom all vigour of Invention, and strength of Judgment met. ... And as it is fit to reade the best Authors to youth first, so let them be of the openest, and clearest. As Livy before Salust, Sydney before Donne . Peter Heylyn's oft-reprinted Microcosmus (1621) recommended the Arcadia as an aid to literary art, with one phrase (here italicized) which suggests Hoskins's title-page: It [Arcadia] is a Countrey whose fitnesse for pastorage and grazing hath made it the subiect of many worthy and witty discourses, especially that of S r Philip Sidney  (of whom I cannot but make honorable mention) a book which besides its excellent language, rare contriuances, & delectable stories, hath in it all the straines of Poesy, comprehendeth the vniuersall art of speaking , and to them which can discerne, and will obserue, notable rules for demeanour both priuate and publike. At the end of the seventeenth century Sir William Temple wrote:  23 The true Spirit or Vein of ancient Poetry in this kind [poetry in prose, romance] seems to shine most in Sir Philip Sidney , whom I esteem both the greatest Poet and the noblest Genius of any that have left Writings behind them, and published in ours or any other modern Language. With the discovery that Thomas Blount's widely read Academie of Eloquence (1654, etc.) borrowed Hoskins's essay almost in toto , we see that by an underground route, so to speak, as well as by the republication (1655, 1674) of the Arcadia , Sidney's style was made an example to the generation which grew up after the last sequel was written. John Hoskins would have asked no better fate for his labors than this, that they might help to keep alive the fame and skill of him whose name he used as a synecdoche for 'an eloquent, learned, valiant gentleman.' Rather conveniently for a future editor, Hoskins informed the young gentleman of the Temple that he was setting down instruction 'taken out of Aristotle, Hermogenes, Quintillian, Demosthenes , Cicero , and some latter, as Sturmius and Talleus , and such honest men.' He had cast his net widely, and there was truth in his jocular boast (introduced as an example of paralipsis): 'I vallue not my paines in collectig these observacons, I will forget that I denied the earnest intreaties of many kindes of gent: that sued vnto me for such helpes, I am loth to tell yo  w they are notes of whome (yo ur maisters of the universities haue thought) the author, as great a reader & a greater observer thereof then themselues.' Yet Hoskins had 'disgested'his reading, and what is more, as his entire career shows, he did not shun originality. Hence when he defined a metaphor as 'the friendly and neighb ou rly borrowing, of one word to expresse a thing w th more light & better note,' he was not translating a Latin definition by one of the 'honest men'he named. As every student knows, a categorical claim of originality for a sixteenth century author is dangerous, or worse; and more study than the present editor has given will doubtless reveal a larger number of borrowings than are here recorded. Even so, there is a personal stamp upon the matter of the Directions , an individual quality which is the author's, no matter where he may have found any specific bit of lore. To touch upon the sources named, we may say that while Hoskins's directions for the use of Aristotle's Rhetoric, Topics , and Ethics will be encountered by every reader, apart from these references there is little to be assigned to Aristotle, as distinguished from the general rhetorical tradition of which he is a fountainhead. That little may be found in the discussion of metaphor. To establish a direct relation between the Directions and Hermogenes is even more difficult. This late Greek rhetorician was a favorite with men of the sixteenth century, probably for reasons which one of them set down in a letter:  24 ... Nowe dothe he [Sturmius] mynd to rede over all Demosthenes wherin he hath promised me to open all Hermogenes arte, without the w  ch no man I sayd shalbe a good orator. I am so in love w th this Author ... that all the rest yea Cicero himself I leave behind, and not to be compared, for openinge the arte. For Cicero was even muche of Aristotles nature he would not haue all this arte knowen. Latin translations of Hermogenes were available to Hoskins,  25 though with his skill in Greek he may have disdained using them. The extant treatises (or parts of a single treatise) by this author are far removed from the usual handbook of rhetorical figures or from such popularizations as have circulated in almost all periods. They rather deal authoritatively and acutely with both the larger and minuter considerations of style and rhetoric, particularly forensic, making distinctions of great subtlety and definitions of lasting value. The work of Sturmius, noted below, draws heavily upon Hermogenes; but the present editor has been able to suggest, as a debt of Hoskins to this author, only the analysis of the figure of comparison. In its general tone, the Directions , with a mixture of informality and formality, a variety and profusion of illustration, suggests Quintilian's treatment of style ( Institutio Oratoria , VIII and IX) oftener than any other model. The magnum opus of this author and the rhetorical works of Cicero were familiar text-books in schools and colleges of Hoskins's time; we may be safe in saying that he knew them as well as he knew any literature, excepting the Arcadia . Hence he makes easy allusion to them and occasionally borrows their language. Such allusions and borrowings are specified in the Notes. Cicero is rarely drawn upon for doctrine, but the reader is directed to his De Oratore , his De Finibus , and his Tusculanae Quaestiones , and some illustrative material is cited from his orations. The Rhetorica Ad Herennium , for centuries ascribed to Cicero and still (in the sixteenth century) associated with his work,  26 was a widely used text-book which Hoskins must have known. His method of definition and multiple example resembles that of the Ad Herennium no less than that of Quintilian. Demosthenes, though mentioned in the quoted list of sources, is alluded to only as having made less use of amplification than did Cicero. With the two names next on Hoskins's list we come to the sixteenth century. Had he added Melanchthon to his Talaeus and Sturmius, our author would have named the three most influential compilers of systematic rhetorics in that period; though the De Duplici Copia Verborum ac Rerum (1511), of Erasmus, as a vade mecum or thesaurus of rhetorical aids for young speakers and writers, must have been still more widely known. By reason of Hoskins's reference to the Apothegmata , we may assume that he intended Erasmus as one of the 'honest men'who had 'renewed their acquaintance'with him. Another handbook of wide and continuous use, which he probably knew, was the Epitome Troporum ac Schematum by Joannes Susenbrotus ( d. 1543), which had several times been published in England, first in 1562. And he used two other still more recent sources which he does not mention: the Epistolica Institutio (Leyden, 1591) of Justus Lipsius, which provided him with much of his doctrine concerning letter-writing, and L'Acad emie Françoise (Paris, 1577-1594) by Pierre de la Primaudaye, which had set forth the view concerning the relation of thought and speech which Hoskins so clearly states in his prefatory address. The French scholar, Omer Talon ( c. 1510-1562), a friend and associate of Peter Ramus, had published his Institutiones Oratoriae at Paris in or about 1544. Under the name Rhetorica the work became widely known, as did its author under his Latinized name of Audomarus Talaeus.  27 Some editions bore a commendatory preface by Ramus, saying, among other things, that Talaeus's rhetoric 'had not been collected from the workshops of rhetors but had been noted down in the meeting-places of eloquent men.' Ramus may be said to have spoken with authority, for Talaeus had collected his precepts largely from the lectures of Ramus himself, who presumably had made the first-hand study of the practice of good speakers. In 1597 Charles Butler, M.A., a country school-teacher and vicar, published an abridgment of Talaeus under the title, Rameae Rhetoricae Libri Duo (Oxford); and he reissued the work in 1598, with some additions and revisions, as his own Rhetoricae Libri Duo ; with further changes this remained as a text-book in the schools for many years.  28 It may be said that in the section 'For Varying'(pp. 8-17) Hoskins follows Talaeus rather closely as to choice and order of figures treated. A further very interesting observation may be made when we compare the Directions with La Rhetorique Fran çoise (1555) by Antoine Fouquelin. This last work is acknowledged by its author to have been based upon Talaeus (though greatly simplified and less comprehensive even than the Directions ); and Fouquelin, like Hoskins, drew his principal illustrative material from a romance in the vernacular, namely, from Th eagene et Chariclee (1547), the then recent French version, by Jacques Amyot, of Heliodorus's 'Ethiopian romance.' Without being able to establish any direct influence from Fouquelin upon Hoskins, we perceive, when we consider Sidney's own familiarity with the work of Heliodorus and his following of it in parts of the Arcadia , a nexus of relations between the Greek romance and the cultivation of figured prose in both French and English. As for Sturmius,  29 Hoskins plainly was familiar with the works of this German scholar; but again he seems not to have made specific borrowings. Among earlier books of rhetoric written in English, Hoskins betrays familiarity only with Thomas Wilson's Arte of Rhetorique (1553, etc.), and he cannot be said to have depended, in any sense, upon this. The one book we might expect to find him using, Abraham Fraunce's Arcadian Rhetorike (1588?),  30 he apparently ignored. Fraunce was more thoroughly Ramist, or Talaean, than was Hoskins; he thought of the figures as ornaments rather than as means to persuasiveness or effectiveness in discourse; and he drew his examples from poetry more often than from prose. He quoted Homer, Virgil, Du Bartas, Tasso, Lasso de la Vega, Boscan, Remy Belleau, Petrarch, and some others, in their original tongues, not to mention Spenser and Piers Plowman in English; and hence his rhetoric is not so truly 'Arcadian'as is the Directions for Speech and Style. As first pointed out by Louise B. Osborn in the 'Literary Supplement' of the London Times , May 1, 1930, Ben Jonson embodied in his Timber, or Discoveries made upon Men and Matter (1641) a fair share of Hoskins's prefatory epistle and the entire section upon letter-writing.  31 It has long been known that Timber is largely a compilation of selections from Jonson's reading, as the phrasing of its title-page indicates: 'as they have flow'd out of his daily Readings; or had their refluxe to his peculiar Notion of the Times.'Miss Osborn's discovery, however, revealed the only known instance (in Timber ) of Jonson's having borrowed from an English writer, and also the borrowing of largest extent. The importance of these facts may be qualified by our certainty that Jonson knew that what he copied came, in large part, from Lipsius. But that Hoskins did have something to do with shaping Jonson's ideas upon the writing of prose, and his literary practice, we have the evidence of Aubrey's report.  32 And it is a likely conjecture that early in his career Jonson enjoyed familiar acquaintance with Hoskins and received a copy of his Directions. A comparison of the passages as printed by Jonson's editor in 1641 with those passages in the present text reveals many variant readings. Some changes may have been deliberate upon Jonson's part, but most represent misreadings by either Jonson, his editor, or the printer.  33 An instance of apparently intentional change is Jonson's 'Elocution'for the manuscript's 'fancie'in the sentence: 'Neither can his mind be thought to be in tune, whose words doe jarre: nor his reason in frame, whose sentence is preposterous; nor his Elocution cleare and perfect, whose utterance breakes it selfe into fragments and uncertainties.'Yet the change is by no means an improvement; for Hoskins's point is that the action of the mind (including the 'fancy') determines one's expression, that speaking well depends on thinking well, whereas Jonson's version makes the obvious remark that one is speaking poorly if one speaks fragmentarily and uncertainly. In fact the general thought of this passage and its context has been weakened and confused by Jonson (or his editor). As another instance of deliberate change we may notice the list of 'p er fumed Termes of the tyme,'which in the manuscript appeared as 'Apprehensiveness Complemts Spirrit accommodate  &c,'but in Jonson, 'Accommodation, Complement, Spirit, &c.'By the time Jonson set down the passage, 'apprehensiveness' may have come into better usage; or it may always have seemed unexceptionable to Ben. The change of the manuscript's 'But sometimes men make busines of kyndnes,'to 'But sometimes men make basenesse of kindnesse,' seems to result from a misreading; for here the context indicates that 'busines'was intended by Hoskins. Compare also these passages: [Harl. MS. 4604, fol. 3 v] ... few wordes they darken the speech, & soe doe too many, as well too much light hurts the eyes as too little, & a longe bill of Chauncery confounds the vnderstanding, as much as the shortest note; Therefore lett not your letters be pennd like an English statute, This is obteyned,  & their vices eschewed by pondering your busines well, and distinctly conceiving of your selfe, wch is much furthered by vttering your thoughts, ... [ Timber , p. 124] Few words they darken speech, and so doe too many: as well too much light hurteth the eyes, as too little; and a long Bill of Chancery confounds the understanding, as much as the shortest note. Therefore, let not your Letters be penn'd like English Statutes, and this is obtain'd. These vices are eschewed by pondering your busines well, and distinctly concerning your selfe, which is much furthered by uttering your thoughts, ... Here a misinterpretation as to the grouping of clauses and the misreading of 'concerning'for 'conceiving'have almost spoiled a good piece of advice. The fact is that the present editor is tempted to adopt none of the variant readings for which Timber is the sole authority. Swinburne's remarks upon Hoskins's portion of Timber should be quoted in full:  34 The remarks 'on epistolary style'are rich in humour and good sense, as well as curiously illustrative of the singular fashion of the time. 'Sometimes men make baseness of kindness,'observes the writer; and proceeds to illustrate the fact, in a manner which may remind us of Thackeray's, by examples of absurd and verbose adulation, expressed in phrases 'that go a-begging for some meaning, and labour to be delivered of the great burden of nothing.' A word seems to have dropped out of the following admirable sentence; but the beetle headed boobies to whose carelessness the charge of Jonson's posthumous writings was committed by the malignity of accident were incapable of noticing the nonsense they had made of it:--- The next property of epistolary style is perspicuity, and is oftentimes [lost] by affectation of some wit ill angled for, or ostentation of some hidden terms of art. Few words they darken speech, and so do too many; as well too much light hurteth the eyes as too little; and a long bill of chancery confounds the understanding as much as the shortest note; therefore let not your letters be penned like English statutes, and this is obtained.  35 Swinburne rightly complained of the bad text of this and others of Jonson's works, as printed in 1640-1641; but here, as elsewhere in his remarks upon Timber , he praised Jonson for ideas and expressions more properly to be credited to his sources. We have now to consider Thomas Blount's use of Directions for Speech and Style as a principal part of his rhetorical handbook, The Academie of Eloquence (1654).  36 In his 'Epistle Dedicatory' Blount wrote: The first part containes a more exact English Rhetorique, then has been hitherto extant, comprehending all the most usefull Figures, exemplifi'd out of the Arcadia, and other choicest Authors . This English Rhetoric occupied pp. 1-48 of the book (232 pp. in all); and is nothing but a copy of the second, third, fourth, and fifth sections of Hoskins's Directions , with such omissions and changes as Blount's fancy, reason, or inadvertence dictated. Again, on pp. 141-8 Blount included a section entitled, 'Instructions for writing and addressing Letters,'which is closely adapted from Hoskins's first section, with the addition of some remarks on handwriting and orthography. Nowhere in the volume did Blount mention the name of Hoskins; but he satisfied his conscience by this veiled acknowledgment at the end of his 'Epistle Dedicatory': ... nor have I in the Rhetorick or Letters transplanted much from my own barren Seminary; I may say to some noble Correspondents, what the Poet did of old in a like Case , sic vos non vobis--- But, you will easily distinguish Tinsill from better mettal: what is mine will appear to be so, by the Bluntismes that frequently occur, the rest are of better allay; So that, if the defects of my own Essayes be but pardoned, the rest I am confident will abide the touch, and pass for Sterling. A comparison of Blount with the extant manuscript copy of Hoskins's essay shows four groups or varieties of changes. First, there are omissions and additions. The omissions are very slight, except for those made by way of adapting certain passages, discussed below. Elsewhere, the principal omissions are of one or more from a series of examples. The additions are greater: as notably the opening paragraph of Blount's rhetoric, the page and a half on epithets (pp. 47-8), and the notes on penmanship and orthography (pp. 147-8). Blount had read John Hall's translation of Longinus (1652) and introduced references to this author at almost every opportunity; he likewise made some use of Sir William Davenant's and Thomas Hobbes's remarks prefaced to Gondibert (1650). The second class of changes includes adaptations made to avoid allusions to authors or events which had gone out of date by 1654, or to avoid references which Hoskins had made to himself or his own works. Sometimes Blount substitutes an up-to-date allusion for that of Hoskins, and sometimes he makes merely a general reference instead of a specific allusion. Some examples may be cited. [MS. 4604, fol. 6 v] And the speciall for the perticuler, as the Earle is gone into Ireland for E: E: The perticuler for the speciall, as I would willingly make yow a Sr Phillip Sidney for an eloquent learned valliant gent, One for many as the Spaniard they say comes against vs, for the Spaniards ... [Blount, p. 5] And the special, for the particular; As, the Admiral is gone to sea , for Admiral Blague [ Blake , 1654]. The particular for the special. As, I would willingly make you a Sir Philip Sidney , for, an eloquent, learned, valiant Gentleman ; or for many; as, the Hollander they say comes against us , for the Hollanders ... [MS. 4604, fol. 4 r] Yo w are not to cast a ring for the perfumed Termes of the tyme, as App  re hensivenes Complem ts Spirrit accommodate &c: [Blount, p. 145] You are not to cast a ring for the perfumed moding terms of the time; as to acquiesce, to espouse an interest, to cajole, to incommode, to have a pique against one, &c. [MS. 4604, fol. 18 r] ... & in my booke of Charity and resignac i on of the Chapter that the truest mortificacion is the study of Cosmographie, o! endlesse endeavo  urs , ... [Blount, p. 29] And in another Author thus, O endless endeavour! The discussion of paronomasia may be cited as an extreme example of Blount's adaptation by omission of Hoskins's contemporary allusions; and the discussion (quoted below) of the fashion of sententiousness, and other rhetorical fads, likewise exemplifies adaptation by addition. A third class of changes is composed of those made for the sake of style or clearness, apart from names or historical allusions. At their most extended, such changes amount to paraphrase, as in the two paragraphs of Blount's 'Epistle Dedicatory'which follow the middle portion of Hoskins's prefatory address. A shorter example of this sort follows: [MS. 4604, fol. 20 v] Sententia (if it be well vsed) is a figure (if ill  & too much) it is a style, whereof none that writes humerously or factiously: nowe adayes can bee Cleare, for nowe there are such Schismes of eloquence, that it is enough for any 10 yeares that all the bravest witts doe imitate Some one figure wch a Criticke hath taught some great personage ; Soe it may bee wthin this 200 yeares, wee shall goe through the whole bodie of Rhethorick. It is true that we studie accordinge to the p  re dominacie of Courtly inclynac i ons, whilest mathematiques were in requeste all our simillitudes came from lynes, circles,  & Angles, whilst morrall philosophie is nowe a while spoken of, it is rudenesse, not to be Sententious, ... [Blount, p. 34] SENTENTIA , if it be wel used, is a Figure, if ill and too much, a Style, of which none that write humorously and factiously, can be clear in these days, when there are so many Schisms of Eloquence: We study now-a-days according to the predominancy of Criticall fancies. Whilst Moral Philosophy , was in request, it was rudeness, not to be sententious; whilst Mathematicks were of late in vogue, all similitudes came from Lines, Circles and Angles ; but now that Mars is predominant, we must recruit our wits, and give our words a new Quarter . On a smaller scale, the changes of this third class mean merely the substitution of one word for another. In some instances the variants may go back to the manuscript used by Blount, and represent a better text than the extant manuscript. Examples follow: [MS. 4604, fol. 19 r] But the former fashion of diminucion sometimes in erroneous sort goes for amplificacion ... [p. 31] But the former fashion of Diminution sometimes in ironious sort goes for Amplification ... [MS. 4604, fol. 14 r] Progression is the last kinde of amplificacon w  ch by stepps of Comparison stores euerie degree, till it come to the topp, & [to] make the matter seeme the higher advaunced, Sometimes descends the lower; ... [Blount, p. 21] PROGRESSIO is the last kind of Amplification , which by steps of comparison scorns every degree, til it come to the supreme; and sometimes to advance the matter higher, it descends lower. [MS. 4604, fol. 24 r] ... & indeed all parenthesis are in extremities, either graces, or disgraces, to a speech; ... [Blount, p. 40] And indeed all Parentheses are in extreams, either graces or foyles to a Speech. [MS. 4604, fol. 6 r] In the former example, plant a Castle compas't w th rivers ... [Blount, p. 4] In the former example, Paint a Castle, compast with Rivers ... Fourth, and finally, there are numerous variants in Blount which result from his misreadings of his source, or from erroneous readings within that source. Several of these mistakes occur in connection with proper names, as our examples will show. The first exemplifies all the other classes of variants as well: [MS. 4604, fol. 22 r] ... therefore the vnderstanding of Aristotles Rhetorique , is the directest meanes of skill to discribe, to moue, to appease, or to prevent any mocion , whatsoeuer: whervnto, whoesoeuer can fitt his speech, shalbe truely eloquent, This was my oppinion ever;  & Sr Phillip Sidney , betrayed his knowledge in this booke of Aristotle to me, before euer I knewe that hee had translated any p ar te of it, for I found the 2 first bookes englished by him in the handes of the noble studious Henry Wotton , but lately I thinke alsoe that he had much helpe out of Theophrasti imagines , for the webb (as it were) of his storie hee followed three Heliodorus in greeke, Sanazarus Arcadia in Itallian,  & Diana de monte maior in spanish, ... [Blount, p. 36] Therefore the understanding of Aristotles Rhetorique is held to be the best means to attain to true Eloquence; Excellent on this subject also are Theophrasti imagines; Heliodorus and Longinus in Greek (the last lately well translated into English) Zanaxarus his Arcadia in Italian, Diana de monte majori in Spanish ,  &c. [MS. 4604, fol. 20 v] I take Ciclops to be as handsome a man as Argus ... [Blount, p. 34] I take Cyclops to be as handsom a man, as Argos. [MS. 4604, fol. 5 v, exemplifying metaphors 'too base'] ... shoulders of friendship ... [Blount, p. 3] ... Souldiers of friendship , ... [MS. 4604, fol. 14 r] ... Then to Vrvinus towards his servant, ... [Blount, p. 21] ... then to Urbanus, towards his servant ; ... [MS. 4604, fol. 7 v] ... to awake a sleepie or dull person. [Blount, p. 8] ... to awake a sleepy or dull passion.  37 [MS. 4604, fol. 16 r] Sometimes there is a certaine quantitie of a thinge set but plainely & ingeniously told, vnenarrable, as beyond the bounds of conceipt, much more of vttering & this figure is more Creddit to your wit then to yo ur speech: [Blount, p. 25] Sometimes there is no certain quantity of a thing set, but plainly and ingeniously told unvariably. As, Beyond the bounds of conceipt, much more of utterance . And, this Figure is more for the credit of your wit then of your speech. 38 The close comparison of Blount with Hoskins will repay the reader who is interested in the history of English style. In general Blount tends more to the 'florid'manner than did Hoskins, sometimes replacing Hoskins's straightforward statement with a simile or allegory. The examples of metaphor which Blount added (p. I) show a tendency toward the conceit, and suggest Feltham more than Sidney: ... As to say, Drops of Dew are Pearls; Flowers in Meadows are Starres , and the murmuring of waters, Musick ; that little Birds are Angels of the Forests; Whales are living Rocks , or Ships with souls; that the Sea is a moving Earth , and fountain water, liquid Crystal . The same tendency is still more apparent in the collections entitled 'Common Places'and 'Formulas'which occupy many pages of Blount's book. In Charles Hoole's A New Discovery of the Old Art of Teaching School (1660) there is a recommendation (p. 133) of 'the late English Rhetorick 'as a book of reference. Hoole may have meant either Blount's Academy , with 'An English Rhetorique'as one of its parts, or John Smith's The Mysterie of Rhetorique Unvail'd , first published in 1657. This book, a more systematic and thoroughgoing work than Blount's, proved to be widely useful; in 1709 it was published in its ninth edition, and in 1739 appeared in an abridgment made by 'J.H., Teacher of Geography.'Smith evidently had no access to a manuscript copy of Hoskins's Directions , but he took over more than a hundred definitions and examples (mostly the latter) from Blount's version of Hoskins. That Smith depended upon Blount for his use of Hoskins and the Arcadia is abundantly demonstrable.  39 In spite of the numerous quotations, at third hand, from the Arcadia , it is never mentioned by name in Smith's book, and its author is named only once (p. 154). Smith does not give his sources, except for Biblical and (some) classical quotations, so that examples invented by Hoskins, those quoted by Hoskins from Sidney, those invented by Smith himself, and those from other sources lie together without distinction. A few of Smith's readers, we may assume, recognized now and again the accents of Sidney; but Smith's work represents, even better than does Blount's, a stage at which Arcadianism had been absorbed into the general rhetorical tradition, and its distinguishing marks overlooked. The basic text of the present edition is that of Harleian MS. 4604, a paper- book of twenty-eight leaves, with the following inscription in red chalk on the first: 'D.M. Dan: Manwaring's Booke. A o Domini MDCXXX.' There is no other evidence regarding its early history. That it is not Hoskins's own holograph production is indicated by the mistakes and corrections, or rather by the kinds of mistakes and corrections, made by its scribe.  40 . A few passages may be cited: 1\. [fol. 5 v] 'Therefore to delight generally take those Termes from ingenious  & seuerall professions from ingenious Arts to please the learned & from seu er all Arts to please the learned of all sorts.'The words the learned , when used the second time, are inserted above the line, with a caret. 2\. [fol. 10 r] 'The one was to excellent the other too noble for the envious of their Country men to endure, Such is the force of virtue, (aboue all quarrells of nac i ons  & divisions of Allegiances, that their exiles were ho blye enterteyned ...'The scribe first wrote two as the eighth word of this passage, and crossed it out. He first wrote the six words that their ... enterteyned before the parenthesis, and crossed them out. 3\. [fol. 12 r] ' ... & shall a lawyer for a bastinadoe given in a hall of Court to his Companion be advanced?' The scribe first wrote given in before for a bastinadoe and scratched it. 4\. [fol. 12 r] ' ... rather usuall for his sorte then fantasticall for his invencion.'The scribe first wrote then immediately after rather. 5\. [fol. 13 v] ' ... & makes our meaning more palpable by a touch.'This was first written makes our meaning more palpably a touch ; the y of palpably was changed to e , and by was inserted above the line, with a caret. 6\. [fol. 23 v] ' Complement is performance ...'etc. This definition, which is one of a series of four illustrations of the figure Definition , is made the beginning of a new paragraph, as if Compliment were a separate figure, parallel with Definition. 7\. [fol. 19 v] ' Sturnius 'is written for Sturmius. 8\. [fol. 20 r] 'a Syndeton 'is written for Asyndeton. 9\. [fol. 12 r] ' Division the second way of amplyficacion , w  ch Bacon in his first Colonie took out of the Rhetoritians . ...'This is followed by a quotation from the fifth of Bacon's 'Colours of Good and Evil'as printed in 1597. Hence 'first Colonie'seems to be a misreading of 'fifth Colour.' Nearly all of these indicate the hand of a copyist; and the last four, at least, indicate that Hoskins himself was not the copyist. In Harleian MS. 850 is found a portion of the Directions , including the prefatory letter, the section on letter-writing, and the treatment of 'varying'through the figure Paronomasia. There is no indication, except the penmanship, of the date or early owner of this manuscript.  41 On the first leaf is set down a collection of 'sentences,' several of them from among the examples given in the Directions , and also a number of unrelated words and phrases written as if in practice by the scribe. The text as found in this manuscript also indicates the work of a copyist. In some passages, however, it gives better readings than MS. 4604, notably in quotations from the Arcadia , and its margins furnish five more page references to the Arcadia than the corresponding margins of our basic text. Hence it is clear that the fragment in MS. 850 is not copied from MS. 4604; though it may have been copied from the same source and by the same copyist. A list of all important variants (i.e., other than in spelling and punctuation) will be found below, in Appendix A. A comparison of these variants with the text of the same portions as given by Jonson (in Timber ) and Blount shows some interesting agreements. The tentative conclusion of the editor is that both Jonson and Blount had access to a manuscript better than MS. 4604, and that MS. 850, as far as it goes, is somewhat closer to this better manuscript than is our basic text.  42 In the following text, insertions by the editor are indicated by square brackets. Other emendations are indicated by asterisks, with an explanation in the Notes. Scribal abbreviations have been expanded, and the spelling and punctuation modernized. In the sections upon figures of speech, names of figures not in the N.E.D. have been italicized as foreign words. Numbers in the margin and in the text are Hoskins's own references, by folio, to Sidney's Arcadia (1590). 43 Pronounce --------- Pen Letters To  Vary  Otherwise than ever any precepts have taught Amplify Illustrate Containing all the figures of Rhetoric and the Art of the best English, exemplified, either all out of Arcadia , which it censureth, or by Instances The matter whereof may benefit Conversation The quotations being taken out of Sir Philip Sidney's [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Arcadia , the first edition in quarto, without Sanford's additions Temple By The Author: [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701002&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) The conceits of the mind are pictures of things and the tongue is interpreter of those pictures. The order of God's creatures in themselves is not only admirable and glorious, but eloquent; then he that could apprehend the consequence of things, in their truth, and utter his apprehensions as truly were a right orator. Therefore Cicero said much when he said, dicere recte nemo potest nisi qui prudenter intellegit. The shame of speaking unskilfully were small if the tongue were only disgraced by it. But as the image of the king in a seal of wax, ill represented, is not so much a blemish to the wax or the signet that sealeth it as to the king whom it resembleth, so disordered speech is not so much injury to the lips which give it forth or the thoughts which put it forth as to the right proportion and coherence of things in themselves, so wrongfully expressed. Yet cannot his mind be thought in tune whose words do jar, nor his reason in frame whose sentences are preposterous; nor his fancy clear and perfect whose utterance breaks itself into fragments and uncertainties. Were it an honor to a prince to have the majesty of his embassage spoiled by a careless ambassador? And is it not as great an indignity that an excellent conceit and capacity by the indiligence of an idle tongue should be defaced? Careless speech doth not only discredit the personage of the speaker but it doth discredit the opinion of his reason and judgment, it discrediteth the truth, force, and uniformity of the matter and substance. If it be so, then, in words which fly and escape censure, and where one good phrase begs pardon for many incongruities and faults, how shall he be thought wise whose penning is thin and shallow? How shall you look for wit from him whose leisure and whose head, assisted with the examination of his eyes, could yield you no life and sharpness in his writing? I never flattered you, and now methinks I terrify and threaten you, for you see my opinion of you if you should not write well. Nay, you were happy if I should think so favorably of you. I know how far you are stepped into the judgment, skill, and practice of a good style; you cannot but make a most shameful retreat to the ordinary fashion of penning. If I were not bound to your father's love and yours, if I saw not in him most kind providence and in you most willing endeavors to make somewhat more of you than one of my young masters of the Temple, I should think it ill manners to trouble myself and you with a great deal of instruction taken out of [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701003&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Aristotle, Hermogenes, Quintilian, Demosthenes, Cicero, and some later, as Sturmius and Talaeus and such honest men, who, but for your sake, had never renewed their acquaintance with me nor had not become clients to any student of Her Majesty's laws.

For the invention, that ariseth upon your business, whereof there can be no rules of more certainty or precepts of better direction given you than conjecture can lay down of all the several occasions of all particular men's lives and vocations. But sometimes men make business of kindness, as: I could not satisfy myself till I had discharged my remembrance, and charged my letter, with commendations unto you. My business is no other than to certify my love towards you and to put you in mind of my willingness to do you all kind offices. Or: Have you leisure to descend to the remembrance of that assurance which you have long had in me, and upon your next opportunity to make me happy with any employment you shall assign me, or such like words, which go a-begging for some meaning and labor to be delivered of a great burthen of nothing. When you have invented (if your business be matter and not bare form, nor mere ceremony, but some earnestness), then are you to proceed to the ordering of it and the digestion of the parts; which is sought out of circumstances. One is the understanding of the person to whom you write; the other is the coherence of the sentences. For men's capacity and delight, you are to weigh what will be apprehended first with great delight and attention, what next regarded and longed for especially, and what last will leave most satisfaction and, as it were, the sweetest memorial and brief of all that is past, in his understanding whom you write to. The rules of decency follow after, in a chapter by itself. For the consequence of the sentences, you must see that every clause doth, as it were, give the cue to the other and be, as it were, spoken before it come. This for invention and order. 44 Now for fashion, it consisteth in four things, or qualities of your style. The first is brevity. For letters must not be treatises or discoursings, and except it be among learned men, and even amongst them, there is a kind of thrift or saving of words. Therefore are you to examine the clearest passages of your understanding and through them to convey your sweetest and most significant English words that you can devise, that you may the easier teach them the readiest way to another man's conceit; and to pen it fully, roundly, and distinctly, so as the reader may not think a second view cast away upon your letter. But though respect be a part after this, yet now still must I here remember it. If you write to a man whose estate and senses you are familiar with, you may be the bolder to set a task to his brain. If to your superior, you are bound in him to measure three further points: your interest in him, his capacity of your letters, and his leisure to peruse them. For your interest and favor with him, you are to be the shorter or longer, more familiar or submiss, as he will afford you time. For his capacity, you are to be quicker or fuller of those reaches and glances of wit or learning as he is able to entertain them. For his leisure, you are commanded to the greater briefness as his place is of greater discharges and cares. With your better you are not to put riddles of your wit by being too scarce of words, nor to cause the trouble of making [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701005&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) breviats by writing too plenteously and wastingly. Brevity is attained, by the matter, in avoiding idle compliments, ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) prefaces, protestations, parenthesis, superfluous and wanton circuits of figures, and digressions; by the composition, omitting conjunctions, not only, but also, both one and the other, whereby it cometh to pass , and such idle particularities that have no great business in a serious letter; by breaking of sentences, as oftentimes a long journey is made shorter by many baits. But, as Quintilian saith, there is a briefness of parts sometimes that make the whole long; as, I came to the stairs, I took a pair of oars. They launched out, rowed apace, I landed at the Court-gate, I paid my fare, went up to the presence, asked for my lord. I was admitted. All this is but: I went to the Court and spake with my lord . This is the fault of some Latin writers (within this last hundred years) of my reading, and perhaps Seneca may be appeached of it---I accuse him not. 45 The next good property of epistolary style is perspicuity; and is oftentimes endangered by the former quality (brevity), oftentimes by ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) affectation of some wit ill angled for, or ostentation of some hidden terms of art. Few words they darken the speech, and so do too many; as well too much light hurts the eyes as too little; and a long bill of chancery confounds the understanding as much as the shortest note. Therefore let not your letter be penned like an English statute. This is obtained, and their vices eschewed, by [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701006&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) pondering your business well and distinctly conceiving of yourself, which is much furthered by uttering your thoughts and letting them as well come forth to light and judgment of your own outward senses as to the censure of other men's ears. That is the reason why many good scholars speak but stumblingly, like a rich man that for want of particular note and difference can bring you no certain ware readily out of his shop. For this reason talkative shallow men do often content the hearers more than the wise. But this may find a speedier redress in writing, where all comes under the last examination of the eyes. First mind it well, then pen it, then examine it, then amend it, and you may be in the better hope of doing reasonable well. Under this virtue may come plainness, which is not to be curious  46 in the order, as to answer a letter as if you were to answer interrogatories: to the first, second , etc., but both in method and word to use, as ladies use in their attire, a kind of diligent negligence. And though with some men you are not to jest or practise tricks, yet the delivery of most weighty and important things may be carried with such a grace as that it may yield a pleasure to the conceit of the reader. There must be store, though not excess, of terms; as, if you are to name store , sometimes you may call it choice , sometimes plenty , sometimes copiousness , or variety ; and so that the word which comes in lieu have not such difference of meaning as that it may put the sense in hazard to be mistaken. You are not to cast a ring for the perfumed terms of the time, as, apprehensiveness, compliments, spirit, accommodate , etc. but use them properly in their places, as others. Thereof followeth life, which is the very strength and sinews, as it were, of your penning, made up by pithy sayings, similitudes, conceits, allusions to some known history, or other commonplace; such as are in the Courtier and the second book of Cicero De Oratore. Last is respect, to discern what fits yourself, him to whom you  47 write, and that which you handle; which is a quality fit to [conclude the rest because it doth] include the rest, and that must proceed from [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701007&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) ripeness of judgment, which (as another truly saith) is given by four means--- God, nature, diligence, and conversation. Serve the first well and the rest will serve you. of one word to express a thing with more light and better note, though not so directly and properly as the natural name of the thing meant would signify. As, feigned![](/images/inline/ast.gif) sighs  : the nearest to feigning is ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) teaching an imitation of truth by art and endeavor; therefore Sir Philip Sidney would not say unfeigned 48 sighs  , but untaught sighs (341). Desirous : now desire is a kind of thirst, and not much different from thirst is hunger, and therefore for swords desirous of blood he saith hungry of blood ; where you may note three degrees of metaphors in the understanding: first that the fitness of bloodshed in a weapon usurps the name desirous , which is proper to a living creature, and then that it proceedeth to thirst , and then to hunger . The rule of a metaphor is that it be not too bold nor too far-fetched. And though all metaphors go beyond the signification of things, yet are they requisite to match the compassing sweetness of men's minds, that are not content to fix themselves upon one thing but they must wander into the confines; like the eye, that cannot choose but view the whole knot when it beholds but one flower in a garden of purpose; or like an archer that, knowing his bow will overcast or carry too short, takes an aim on this side or beyond his mark. Besides, a metaphor is pleasant because it enricheth our knowledge with two things at once, with the truth and with similitude; as  49 this: heads disinherited of their natural seigniories , whereby we understand both beheading and the government of the head over the body as the heir hath over the lordship which he inheriteth (268). Of the same matter in another place: to divorce the fair 50 marriage of the head and the body  , where besides the cutting off the head we understand the conjunction of head and body to resemble marriage (331). The like in concealing love , uttered by these  51 words: to keep love close prisoner (244); and in number of places in your book, which are all noted with this letter, M , in the margent; there came along the streets a whole fleet of coaches , for a great number. An Allegory is the continual following of a metaphor (which before I defined to be the translation of one word) and proportionable through the sentence, or through many sentences; as, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701008&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Philoclea was so environed with sweet rivers of virtue as that she could neither be battered nor undermined, where Philoclea is expressed by the similitude of a castle, her nature (defense) by the natural fortification of a river about a castle, and the metaphor continues in the tempting her by force or craft, expressed by battering and undermining. Another: But when that wish had once his ensign in his mind, then followed whole squadrons of longing, that so it might be a main battle of mislikings and repinings against their creation. Ensigns, squadrons, main battle ,---metaphors still derived from the same thing [as] at first, war. As I said before that a metaphor might be too bold or too far-fetched, so I now remember that it may be too base; as, the tempest of judgment had broken the main-mast of his will, a goodly audience of sheep, shoulders of friendship , and suchlike too base; as in that speech, fritter of fraud and seething-pot of iniquity , and they that say a red herring is a shoeing-horn to a pot of ale . But they that speak of a scornful thing speak grossly. Therefore, to delight generally, take those terms from ingenious and several professions; from ingenious arts to please the learned, and from several arts to please the learned of all sorts; as from the meteors, planets, and beasts in natural philosophy, from the stars, spheres, and their motions in astronomy, from the better part of husbandry, from the politic government of cities, from navigation, from military profession, from physic; but not out of the depth of these mysteries. But ever (unless your purpose be to disgrace) let the word be taken from a thing of equal or greater dignity, as, speaking of virtue, the sky of perfect virtue ever clouded with sorrow , where he thought it unfit to stoop to any metaphor lower than heaven. You may assure yourself of this observation, and all the rest, if you but compare those places in your book noted with this note, M ; and in truth it is the best flower, growing most plentifully, in all Arcadia. An emblem, an allegory, a similitude, a fable, and a poet's tale differ thus: an Emblem is but the one part of the similitude, the other part (viz., the application) expressed indifferently and jointly in one sentence, with words some proper to the one part, some to the other; a the most part, by gods and men. In the former example, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701009&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) plant a castle compassed with rivers and let the word be, Nec obsidione nec cuniculis (neither by siege nor undermining): that is an emblem, the proper terms of the one part. Lay it as it is in Sir Philip S[idney]: Philoclea's virtue , the proper terms of the one part; environed, rivers, battered, undermined , the terms of the other part; all these terms in one sentence and it is an allegory. Let it be this: There was a lamb in a castle, and an elephant and a fox besieged it. The elephant would have assailed the castle, but he would not swim over the river. The fox would make a hole in the earth to get under it, but he feared the river would have sunk in upon him and drowned him. Then is it a fable. Let Spenser tell you such a tale of Faery Queen, and Ovid of Diana, and then it is a poet's tale. But utter it thus in one sentence: Even as a castle compassed about with rivers cannot be battered or undermined, and this in another: Philoclea, defended round about with virtuous resolutions, could neither be forced nor surprised by deceit, then it is a similitude in his own nature,---which is the ground of all emblems, allegories, fables, and fictions. not for similitude, but for other natural affinity and coherence; as when the matter is used for that which thereof consisteth, as, I want silver , for money ; when the efficient or author is used for the thing made, as, my blade is a right Sebastian , for of Sebastian's making ; the thing containing for the thing or person contained, as, the city met the Queen , for the citizens ; the adjunct, property, quality, or badge for the subject of it, as, deserts are preferred , for men deserving ; give room to the coif , for the sergeant . No doubt better examples of this sort are in Arcadia , if I had leisure to look so low as where they are name of the whole for the part. There are two kinds of total comprehensions, as an entire body and a general name; as, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701010&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Ay, my name is tossed and censured by many tongues , for many men , where the part of an entire body goes for the whole.  52 Contrariwise, he carries a goldsmith's shop on his fingers , for rings; he fell into the water and swallowed the Thames , for the 53 water . So the general name for the special: put up your weapon , for  54 your dagger ; and the special for the particular, as, the Earl is gone 55 into Ireland , for E[arl of] E[ssex] ; the particular for the special,  56 as, I would willingly make you a Sir Philip Sidney , for an eloquent, learned, valiant gent [leman ]; one for many, as, the Spaniard, they 57 say, comes against us  , for the Spaniards ; and suchlike, which, because they are easy, I have exemplified familiarly. Both these figures serve well when you have mentioned a thing before, for variety in repetition; and you may well observe better instances in your reading than my interrupted thought can now meet with. abuses are. It is somewhat more desperate than a metaphor. It is the expressing of one matter by the name of another which is incompatible with it, and sometimes clean contrary; as, I gave order to some servants of mine, whom I thought as apt for such charities as myself, to lead him out into the forest and there to kill him, where charity is used for cruelty (but this may also be by the figure ironia ); and the abuse of a word drawn form things far different, as, A voice beautiful to his ears.  58 Accusing in himself no great trouble in mind, by his  59 behavior or action. Do you grudge me part of your sorrow?  60 Being sister in nature, I would I were not so far off akin in fortune. This is a usual figure with the fine conversants of our time, when they strain for an extraordinary phrase, as, I am not guilty of those phrases. I am in danger of preferment. I have hardly escaped good fortune. He threatens me a good turn, all by contrary; and as he said that misliked a picture with a crooked nose, affirming the elbow of his nose to be disproportionable. 61 The ears of men are not only delighted with store and exchange of divers words but feel great delight in repetition of the same; which, because it beginneth in the middle, and in the end, and in sundry correspondencies of each of their places, one to another, it happeneth, therefore, it hath purchased several names of figures; as a repetition of the same word or sound immediately or without interposition of any other is called Epizeuxis.

And as no man is sick in thought upon one thing but for some vehemency or distress, so in speech there is no repetition without importance. word a step to the further meaning. If it be turned to an argument, it is a 67 A young man of great beauty, beautified with great honor, honored by great valor, etc. 68 You could not enjoy your goodness without government, nor government without a magistrate, nor magistrate without obedience, and no obedience where every one upon his private passion doth interpret the doings of the rulers. Now to make it a sorites, or climbing argument, join the first and the last with an ergo , as, ergo, you cannot enjoy your own goods where every man upon his private passion doth, etc. This in penned speech is too academical, but in discourse more passable and plausible.

What doth become wisdom better than to discern what is worthy the loving, what is more agreeable to goodness than to love it so discerned, and what to greatness of heart than to be constant in it once loved. The like, 150a, where the last word or some one word in the last  70 sentence begets the next clause. This figure hath his time when you are well entered into discourse and have procured attention and mean to rise and amplify. Whom virtue hath made the prince of felicity, be not  71 the minister of ruin; you whom my choice hath made the gods of my safety, you that nature hath made the lodestar of comfort, be not the rock of shipwreck. This figure beats upon one thing to cause the quicker feeling in the audience, and to awake a sleepy or dull person. words: Where the richness did invite the eyes, the fashion did  72 entertain the eyes, and the device did teach the eyes. And all the night he did nothing but weep Philoclea,  73 sigh Philoclea, and cry out Philoclea, etc. [P.] 45. Either arm their lives or take away their lives (356a).

Because it is impossible. The most ambitious wight vexeth not his wits to climb into heaven. Why? Because it is impossible. This is the wantonest of repetitions, and is not to be used in matters too serious. You have an example of it in [my] fustian speech about tobacco, in derision of vain rhetoric. in several sentences, as, Severe to his servants, to his children severe, or the same sound reiterated first and last in a sentence, as, His superior in meat, in place his inferior. In sorrow I was born, and must die in sorrow. Unkindness moved me, and what can so trouble my courses or wrack my thoughts as unkindness?

Your diligence to speak well must be great, but you shall be abundantly recompensed for the greatness in the success, persuasion. If I ever wish for the perfection of eloquence, it is for your instruction; and for your benefit I would wish I were eloquent. This kind of repetition and the former epanalepsis are most easily admitted into discourse and are freest from the opinion of affectation, because words received at the beginning of many sentences or at both ends of the same are more notorious. as, 76 If any for love of honor, or honor of love. 77 That as you are child to a mother, so you may be mother to a child. 78 They misliked what themselves did, and yet did still what themselves misliked. 79 If before he languished because he could not obtain his desire, he now lamented because he could not desire the obtaining.

Our learned knight skipped often into this figure, as, 2a and b at the very beginning, 116a and b, 137, 219a, 205; yet he ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) concealed the particularity of his affection by this, sometimes by not turning the words wholly back as they lay: To account it not a purse for treasure, but as a treasure  81 itself worthy to be pursed up, etc. Men venture lives to conquer, to conquerors lives without  82 venturing. Showed such fury in his force, such stay in his fury, which is rather epanodos. Sometimes the same sense must be in contrary words, as, Parthenia desired above all things to have Argalus;  83 Argalus feared nothing but to miss Parthenia, where fear to miss is put in stead of desire to have. Neither could you have thought so well of me if extremity  84 of love had not made your judgment partial, nor you could have loved me so entirely if you had not been apt to make so great undeserved judgment of me, where he returns for extremity of love, loving entirely , and for partial judgment, great undeserved judgment . And notwithstanding that this is a sharp and witty figure and shows out of the same words a pithy distinction of meaning, very convenient for schoolmen, yet Mr. P. did wrong to tire this poor figure by using it thirty times in one sermon. For use this, or any other point, unseasonably, it is as ridiculous as it was in the fustian oration: horse-mill, mill-horse , etc. But let discretion be the greatest and general figure of figures. with a different meaning; as, for the running upon the word more , This very little is more than too much. Sir Philip Sidney, in Astrophel and Stella , calls [it] the 'dictionary method' and the verses so made 'rhymes running in rattling rows,' which is an example of it. There is a swinish poem made thereof in Latin, called Pugna Porcorum ; and L. Lloyd in his youth tickled [it] in fashion of a poet's dictionary: Hector, Hanno, Hannibal dead, Pompey, Pyrrhus spilled; Cyrus, Scipio, Caesar slain, and Alexander killed. [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701015&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) The author of Albions England hath set forth good invention too often in this attire. In those days Lyly, the author of Euphues , seeing the dotage of the time upon this small ornament, invented varieties of it; for he disposed the agnominations in as many fashions as repetitions are distinguished. By the author's rhetoric, sometimes the first word and the middle harped one upon another, sometimes the first and the last, sometimes in several sentences. sometimes in one; and this with a measure, compar , a change of contention, or contraries, and a device of a similitude, in those days made a gallant show. But Lyly himself hath outlived this style and breaks well from it. An Agnomination of some syllables is sometimes found in Arcadia , as, 85 Alas, what can saying make them believe whom seeing cannot persuade? 86 And whilst he was followed by the valiantest, he made a way for the vilest. 87 Who went away repining but not repenting. 88 His mind, her merit. Loving, living. Not only Lyly, whose posy at the beginning of his book was stamped with cognizance, Commend it or Amend it , but even with Doctor Matthew this figure was of great accompt, and he lost no estimation by it: Our paradise is a pair of dice, our almes-deeds are turned into all misdeeds, our praying into playing, our fasting into feasting. But that kind of breaking words into another meaning is pretty to play with among gentlewomen, as, you will have but a bare gain of this bargain ; otherwise it will best become the tuftaffeta orators to skip up and down the neighborhood of these words that differ more in sense than in sound, tending nearer to meter than to matter,---in whose mouth long may that phrase prosper, a man not only fit for the gown but for the gun, for the pen but for the pike, for the book but for the blade! See to what preferment a figure may aspire if it once get in credit in a world that hath not much true rhetoric! That was the cause that Sir Philip Sidney would not have his style be much beholding to this kind of garnish. And of a truth, if the times gives itself too much to any one flourish, it makes it a toy and bars a learned man's writings from it, lest it seem to come more of the general humor than the private judgment. lineage, that differ only in termination, as, Exceedingly exceeding that exceedingness. [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701016&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) 89 By this faulty using of our faults.  90 Sometime the same word in several cases, as, For fear hid his fear.  91 Sometime the same verb in several voices, as,  92 Forsaken by all friends and forsaking all comfort. Sometimes the same adjective in several comparisons: Much may be said in my defense, much more for love,  93 and most of all for that divine creature which hath joined me and love together. This is a good figure, and may be used with or without passion, but so as the use of it come from some choice and not from barrenness. To amplify and illustrate are two the chiefest ornaments of eloquence, and gain of men's minds two the chiefest advantages, admiration and belief. For how can you commend a thing more acceptably to our attention than by telling us it is extraordinary and by showing us that it is evident? There is no looking at a comet if it be either little or obscure, and we love and look on the sun above all stars for these two excellencies, his greatness, his clearness: such in speech is amplification and illustration. We amplify five ways: by comparison, division, accumulation, intimation, and progression. Equal, as,  94 Themistocles and Coriolane, both great statesmen, both of great deserts to their countries, both banished, both dead. At one time Themistocles his counsel could not prevail against the ingratitude of the Athenians, nor Coriolanus' discretion overcome the unkindness of the Romans. The one was too excellent, the other too noble, for the envious of their countrymen to endure. Such is the force of virtue, above all quarrels of nations and divisions of allegiances, that their exiles were honorably entertained, Coriolanus by the Volsci, Themistocles by the Persians, both by their enemies. And both, leading great armies against those countries which so ingratefully expelled them, were so inwardly restrained with a conscience of sacking their native soil that they chose rather to offer violence to their own lives than to the lives of their fellow-citizens, and took it for a sufficient revenge to show that it was evident they might have been revenged. But this [is] not so forcible an amplification, of things equal indeed (wherein, as you see, there are to be searched out all the several points of a consorted equality), as when things seeming unequal are compared, and that in similitudes as well as examples; as in [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701017&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) my speech of a widow compared to a ship, both ask much tackling and sometimes rigging . And you shall most of all profit by inventing matter of agreement in things most unlike, as London and a tennis court: for in both all the gain goes to the hazard. Policy is like the sea: it serves for intercourse of profits, for defense against invasions. There are in both ebbings and flowings, calms and tempests, the observation whereof may make a man first wise, then rich. But as the water serves for many outward uses, so can it not please inwardly swallowed. If you sail upon it, it will carry you whither you will desire; but if you drink it, it doth not satisfy but increase a desire. Again, for examples: Eriphyle and Tarpeia, both women, in whom nature should govern love and love warrant fidelity, were both easily seduced to be false with trifling temptations. They both betrayed, not one friend to another, nor the dearness of love for the highness of preferment, but their most assured lovers to their most deadly enemies, for toys, jewels, and for bracelets; Eriphyle, her husband Amphiaraus (the stay of her life) to Adrastus, his professed foe; Tarpeia, the capitol (the stay of her country) to the Sabines that besieged it. Yet neither can remain unto posterity as an enticement, much less as an encouragement, to treason. For Eriphyle was slain by her son, whom nature should have bound to her defense, and Tarpeia by the Sabines, whom her deserts should have won to her safeguard. In comparing two, when you should praise the person or thing whom you intend to make excellent, you must take the meanest part of greater examples and match them with the best of your purpose, and by such partiality you shall grace and extol your subject which you handle; as [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701018&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Isocrates doth in his comparisons of Cyrus and ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Evagoras. Otherwise, for unpartial comparisons, which notwithstanding do amplify, read the matches and encounters of the most famous Grecian and Roman examples in Plutarch. Comparisons of things different. In the former comparisons is  95 a composition of the history on both sides, to be favorable unto you by reading. But if I were to marshal histories whereof both, or either, were not sufficiently known, then had I need to begin with single relations. As, if a man would compare Vascus Gama with Sir Francis Drake, he might say: Sir Francis Drake indeed travelled round about the world in two years, saw divers nations, endured many perils at sea, and returned laden with great treasure. And Vascus Gama first searched the coast of Quiloa, Mozamba, and Calicut, and opened a passage to the East Indias. But it was easy for Drake to proceed further in discoveries, when he had an entrance made by Columbus; so was it most dangerous and difficult for Gama to adventure a course without example and direction. Drake scoured the coast with a sufficient company of ships, made pillage of others, and thereby furnished his own enterprises. Gama went but weak at the first, lost most of his small fleet, and met nothing at sea but tempests and famine. Drake invaded upon opportunities, hazarded but his own fortune, and retired to sea upon all advantage. Gama had in charge an expedition of his sovereign's commandment, was constrained to victual himself amongst barbarous nations, and not only to buy provision in their continent land with the price of his blood, but durst not depart without leaving his king proclaimed and possessed in their territories, divers places of strength established to his use. So that if Gama had been to peruse the example of Drake as Drake had the light of Columbus' and Magellus' travels, Vascus Gama's spirit was as likely to have conquered the whole world as Drake's fortune was to compass it. And where your parts of collation are more obscure, then your narration must be the longer, as Cicero, in comparing [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701019&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Marcellus and Verres, makes a long recital of the acts of Marcellus, to acquaint the hearers with them before comparison. In some cases, after good confidence of proof, your examples may come in more quick, hot, and plentifully, as, If to protract battle upon advice be cowardice, then Phocion, then Metellus, then Fabius, then all the valiantest captains of all ages were cowards. If to displant the rebellious natives of Ireland, and to root them out of the island, be cruelty, then colonies translated into France, into Sicily, into several coasts of Italy, and divers other places, by the Romans, testify great cruelty. But now in comparison of things different [it] is most commendable where there seems to be great affinity in the matter conferred, as in the King of Spain's assisting the Irish, the Queen of England's aiding the Netherlands: The Spaniard prepared helps for a people untrue in their treatises, uncivil in their manners, for them which have traitorously rebelled without provocation, and fled out contrary to their own submission brake their own peace, and wasted their own country. The Queen did but lend some few voluntaries to the protection of a nation peacable in their lives, free by their privileges, a people denying no claim of any true prince except perpetual servitude of their bodies and insupportable exactions in their goods. Another example of things different compared: The marriages of heads of houses and colleges is not as lawful as the marriage of the Doctors of the Arches or Clerks of the Chancery. Both were interdicted by the same law, and yet I take it not indifferent that both should, by the abrogation of the same law, be equally repealed. The one hath his living casual by his temporal pains, the other his maintenance certain by ecclesiastical provision. The one may purchase by his annual revenue and so may raise a patrimony lawfully, to maintain his posterity; the other can by no thrift upon these common goods gather a living for wife and children without embezzling from the poor, deducting from hospitality, defrauding the intent of the giver, or defrauding his successors. Lastly, the one hath all to the use of his office; the other is owner of nothing but to his own behoof and disposition. In these two sorts of amplifying you may insert all figures as the passion of the matter shall serve, and for the proper season and state of each figure look in the end of their particular treatises. Comparison of contraries is the third and most flourishing way  96 of comparison. Contraries are sometimes arranged together by pairs, one to one, as, Compare the one's impatience to the other's mildness, the one's impenitency with the other's submission, the one's humility with the other's indignation, and tell me whether he that conquered seemed not rather confounded, that he which yielded unto him not anything discouraged. Compare not mind with mind, lest it seem fantastical, and beyond the trial of our senses; but set the one's triumph against the other's captivity, loss against victory, feasts against wounds, a crown against fetters, misfortune against felicity: and the majesty of courage will be found in the overthrow. More examples of this you have in the figure contentio , which is one of the instruments to aggravate by way of comparison. Yet one example more: He that prefers wealthy ignorance before chargeable study prefers contempt before honor, darkness before light, death before life, and earth before heaven. Thus are contraries arranged one way. There is another way of ordering them with interchangeable correspondencies in sentences, that though each touch not the other, yet each affronts the other, as, Shall a soldier for a blow with his hand, given in war to a captain, be disgraced, and shall a [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701020&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) lawyer, for the bastinado given in a hall of Court to his companion, be advanced? We that profess laws maintain outrage, and they that break all laws yet in this observe civility? where you may observe every word in the latter sentence aggravated by opposition to every word in the former. Another: Did the most innocent vouchsafe it as a part of His glory to pray for His enemies, and shall we, the most sinful, esteem it a blot to our reputation to be unrevenged on our brethren? Of this you shall have more examples in the consorts of figures, especially where compar and contentio meet. But unless it be for declamatory exercise, you are to avoid too great swelling without substance in the figure compar[ison]. You shall have examples of this out of Arcadia. 97 ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) fifth 'color' took out of the rhetoricians: A way to amplify anything (quoth he) is to break it and make an anatomy of it into several parts, and to examine it according to several circumstances. He said true. It is like the show which peddlers make of their packs, when they display them; contrary to the German magnificence that serves in all the good meat in one dish. But whereas he says that this art of amplifying will betray itself in method and order, I think that it rather adorneth itself. For instead of saying, he put the whole town to the sword , let men reckon all ages and sorts and say: He neither saved the young men, as pitying the unripe flower of their youth, nor the aged men, as respecting their gravity, nor children, as pardoning their weakness, nor women, as having compassion upon their sex; soldier, clergyman, citizen, armed or unarmed, resisting or submitting,---all within the town destroyed with the fury of that bloody execution. Note that your divisions here are taken from age, profession, sex, habit, or behavior, and so may be from all circumstances. This only trick made up [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701021&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) J.D.'s Poem of Dancing : all danceth, the heavens, the elements, men's minds, commonwealths, and so by parts all danceth. Another example varied, he apparelleth himself with great discretion , thus amplified by circumstances: For the stuff, his clothes were more rich than glittering; as for the fashion, rather usual for his sort than fantastical for his invention; for color, more grave and uniform than wild and light; for fitness, made as well for ease of exercise as to set forth to the eye those parts which in him had most excellency. So, to say he would take any occasion of discourse with a gentlewoman , first, with young witty ladies, from their behavior: If she said nothing, he would prettily quarrel with her silence; if she smiled, he would gather out of it some interpretation of her praise and favor, and of his own joy and good fortune; if she frowned, he would both move her to mirth and deny that she would be angry in earnest. If she were scornful, he would conform his speech and action in that soberness to her humor as might beguile her passion by way of false confederacy. If she walked or  98 played, the secret [was to] praise her face, her eyes, her hair, her voice, her body, her hands, her gait, with the application of other conceits, whatever gave the ground of them; yet with such dissembled art as if forgetfulness or love alluded in them, not cunning or want of variety. So you may divide by the forms of speech in general, as, He was never to seek how to propose or ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) invent, to raise or maintain, reconcile or distinguish, an argument. Histories, similitudes, proverbs, jests attended him in greater plenty than he needed to employ. He could offer weighty reasons clearly, and choice words smoothly and unaffectedly. He used a sporting wisdom and eloquent prattling; but with matrons and ladies of better respect and less curiosity, his duty, their kindness, their common acquaintance, the occasion of his coming, the remembrance of his last conference, the place, the time, the last news of foreign lands, the court, the country, the city, fed his invention, satisfied their ears. All this is but division of the persons with whom you meet, their manners, carriage, the fashions and ornaments, the matter and subject of discourse. This in some sort used is more properly called dilation than amplification; and being often practised will enable you to discourse almost of anything wherein you are not precisely tied to the exact manner of division with use, but you have liberty of seeking all things compassed within the sense of your general theme, differ they essentially or in any notable property. But you may also, if you please, run over the entire part of comparison, as, the ship was blown up : for the ship you may say the mast, sails, tackling, keel, prow, stern ; for blown up, rent, torn, smothered, scattered in the air, sunk under water , and all the circumstances of blowing up. So in saying a fair tree , you may divide it into the roots, body, branches , and fruit ; and fairness into tallness, straightness, fresh color , and such things as are fair in a tree. In describing a valiant man, you may talk of his mind, body, his attempting, prosecuting, finishing of an enterprise: but [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701022&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) thereof more in the art of invention. Only note this, that this amplification hath in it more credibility and instruction, for it makes instances of that which, being generally spoken, would seem but a flourish, and gives more especial note of that which universally could not be conceited without confusion and dullness. This kind of amplification is more taken up by Cicero than Demosthenes; for Demosthenes never useth it but it follows his way. 99 The third kind of amplification is Accumulation , which is heaping up of many terms of praise or accusing, importing but the same matter without descending to any part; and hath his due season after some argument or proof. Otherwise it is like a school-master foaming out synonymies  100 , or words of one meaning, and will sooner yield a conjecture of superfluity of words than of sufficiency of matter. But let us give some example. To amplify a sedition : Tumults, mutinies, uproars, desperate conspiracies, wicked confederacies, furious commotions, traitorous rebellions, associations in villainy, distractions from allegiance, bloody garboils, and intestine massacres of the citizens. But this example is somewhat too swelling. Now to talk of one with mild looks , you may say: He hath a sweet countenance, a most pleasant eye, a most amiable presence, a cheerful aspect; he is a most delectable object, etc. You will be well stored for this purpose when you have made up your synonyma book after my direction. The taste of former times hath termed it sweet to bring in three clauses together, of the same sense, as, Your beauty, sweet lady, hath conquered my reason, subdued my wit, and mastered my judgment. How this will hold amongst our curious successors, in their time, I know not. He that looks on the wearing of it will find it bare, how full of stuff soever it appeareth; for it passeth for parts of a division when indeed it is but variation of [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701023&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) an English. Yet, notwithstanding, the practice of it will bring you to abundance of phrases, without which you shall never have choice, the mother of perfection. Cicero in his orations useth it oft. Some others follow it to four clauses, but he seldom exceedeth three. But it hath this certain effect, that it will sufficiently testify your vein not to be dry and spent. And to return to our first sort of accumulations and fetch it with this under one precept, I take the use of this amplification to be in anger, detestation, commiseration, and such passions as you, seeming throughly possessed with, would willingly stir in others. The fourth way of amplifying is by Intimation , that leaves the collection of greatness to our understanding, by expressing some mark of it. It exceedeth speech in silence, and makes our meaning more palpable by a touch than by a direct handling; as, he that should say, you must live many years in his company whom you shall accompt for your friend , saith well; but he that saith, you had need eat a bushel of salt with him , saith more, and gives you to reckon more than many years . It savors sometimes of hyperbole. That a man is grown gross, he is grown from a body to a corporation . Again, for a little man on horseback, as the tale is, that he was mistaken for a hat riding on the pommel of a saddle . Of this sort you have examples in your paragnomies: so honest a wrangler that his nose being betwixt was the only cause his two eyes went not to law , etc. For the highness of a giant is expressed by saying, his skull held half a bushel of wheat . This may be done with ironia , or denial: He was no notorious male factor, but he had been twice on the pillory and once burnt in the hand for trifling oversights. So by the ambiguity of the word: He draws his sword oftener than he draws his purse. This fashion of amplification I term intimation because it doth not directly aggravate but by consequence and proportion, and intimateth more to your mind than to your ears. 101 comparison [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701024&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) scores every degree till it come to the top, and [to] make the matter seem the higher advanced sometimes descends the lower. It is a bad grace in dancing either to shrink much in, or sink far down, that you may rise the higher caper, but it is an ornament in speech to begin at the lowest, that you the better aspire to the height of amplification. For example, in reprehending the prodigality of monuments in the speech of D.H., I begin with the excess of Alphonsus on his father's funeral, thence to Alexander's profusion on his friend's tomb, then to Urbinus towards his servant, thence to Caesar on his horse's burial, after that to the Molossians on their dogs, thence to the Egyptians, that charge themselves with the sumptuous burial of a crocodile. So, seeming in some sort to admit the first, but less the second, and so growing weaker in the excuse of every one as I proceed, the last will seem most ridiculous, if not odious. So Cicero against Verres, meaning to amplify his bribery and extortions: It is a rigorous action (quoth he) not to absolve the innocent without money, great cruelty to commit him till he ransom himself; but not to suffer the parents to come unto him without a reward is lamentable convetousness; to sell the egress and regress of them that bring him victuals, nay, to take money that he shall have but an easy death, to put a price on the stocks that shall execute him--- so much that he shall be beheaded at one blow, so much that at two---this is beyond device of most barbarous and intolerable extortion. So in another example: He was careless of well-doing---a looseness of youth; he was inclined to ill ---a weakness of flesh; his mind consented to offend---a shrewd temptation; he committed the act---an unhappy fall; he accustomed himself to the abuse---a lamentable overthrow: but he did not only this, but infect others with his persuasions and seduced them by his example. Not that only, but held in those whom he had carried away, with fresh invention, and disgraced the modesty of them who resisted his corruption, and scorns their admonitions: which would argue no less in him than a most reprobate and damnable resolution. The rule of this is, when you would praise or dispraise anything, to consider how many less things there are of that kind, to which notwithstanding you would give show of importance; as he that could make sleep heinous may show that [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701025&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) idleness, which is less, by Draco's laws was as felony. Or to give that bishop his right that built two absolute colleges at his own charges and endowed them with lands, look downwards: How rare it is in these days for a prelate not to grant long leases, diminish the revenues of his ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) see; how laudable it is but to repair the ruins of his own decayed palaces and churches; how magnificent a thing it is thought for a nobleman to build an hospital, how royal for two or three princes to erect one college: and can there be such unthankfulness as to bear but one ordinary remembrance of him that enriched his bishopric, built two of the most famous nurseries of learning in the land, was liberal to all wants in his life, and left worthy bequests to all degrees at his death? In like sort in this example, to abuse the name of God : To make table-talk of a mean man's name [were] wrong, to run upon a nobleman's title were a great scandal, to play with a prince's name were a treason; and what shall it be to make a vanity of that name which is most terrible even to tyrants and devils, and most reverend even to monarchs and angels? There be two contrary ascents to the top of this form, either by extenuating the means, as in the former example of D.H., or by aggravating them, as by this last of swearing. And may not a matter be as well amplified in this form by examining the comparison in every particular circumstance, that the whole may seem the greater? In this example, it is lamentable that [ a ] young man should be offended with the advice of his experienced friend, tending to his profit : First, it is a hard case that counsel should be neglected, but harder that it should offend. It is woeful to see any man displeased with good admonitions; but more woeful to see a youth so affected. Who would not grieve to have his advice ill taken? But who would not grieve to see his own experience controlled? Unhappy is that youth that listens not to good exhortations of his skilful friends, he is miserable and infortunate that quarrels with the sound precepts of his discreet friends, but more miserable and unfortunate that mislikes directions given for his own good advantage. This is a most easy, clear, and usual kind of amplification, for it gives more light and force out of every circumstance. [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701026&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) The circumstances are these: the persons who and to whom, the matter, the intent, the time, the place, the manner, the consequences, and many more, out of every one of which anything may be made more notable and egregious by way of comparison. And because I would leave it fresh in your memory, let this be your last charge: to inquire in every controversy for the circumstances and compare them with other less matters, and you shall hardly fail of discourse or be left on ground for want of good invention. There is a richer show in this kind of amplification by every circumstance than in any other. First, that you must begin every circumstance with a figure, sometimes with affirmation, sometime with interrogations, sometimes with admission, sometimes with ironia ; and secondly, that when you upon every circumstance urge the whole sense, you are for every circumstance, almost, to vary the words, as here, for lamentable : unhappy, unfortunate, heavy case, woeful, grievous ; so for counsel: admonitions, instructions, precepts, directions . Again I say, remember this kind of progression by circumstances and urging and aggravating all the points of a sentence, for you shall see it handled most commendably by any color in rhetoric by all good speakers and writers. Here are figures that make a fair offer to set forth a matter better than it is. The first of them in single words and phrases [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701027&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) is Hyperbole ,  102 wherein I will give you some such examples as by my once reading long since I observed in Arcadia . Sometimes it expresseth a thing in the highest degree of possibility, beyond the truth, that it descending thence may find the truth; sometimes in flat impossibility, that rather you may conceive the unspeakableness than the untruth of the relation. Possibly: as, for an hypocritical host : He gave as pleasing entertainment as the falsest heart  103 could give him that he means the worst unto. That ever eye saw or thought could imagine for delight.  104 Inquiry making their eyes, ears, and tongues serve for nothing else but that inquiry. This is the uttermost that is possible, but in the frontiers of impossibility: Accustomed to use victory as an inheritance.  105 With more impossibility, thus: Though a thousand deaths followed, and every death  106 followed with a hundred shames. The world sooner want ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) occasions than he valor to 107 go through them. Words and blows came so thick together as the one seemed lightning to the other's thunder. Sometimes there is ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) no certain quantity of a thing set, but plainly and ingeniously told, unenarrable, as, beyond the bounds of 108 conceit, much more of uttering ; and this figure is more credit to your wit than to your speech. greater vehemence of meaning, refuseth it and supplies the place with a greater, as: I persuaded you not to lose hold of occasion whilst it may not only be taken but offers, nay, sues to be taken, where the first rising of the matter is upon not only, but also , then upon the correcting, nay . Again: You must be content, nay, you must be desirous to take pains if you will write well. It is the only quality which in all actions in your shire will win you praise. Praise, quoth I? Nay, honor and admiration. This figure is to be used when you would make the thing more credible itself than in the manner of your utterance. It is sometimes used upon passion, with an intent to amplify, as: [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701028&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) 109 You stars, you do not succor me! No, no, you will not help me! 110 O Parthenia! No more Parthenia! What art thou? There are two contrary ways to these former, and both lead to  111 amplification, but in dissembling sort. The first is Ironia , which expresseth a thing by contrary, by show of exhortation when indeed it dehorteth, as: Yet a while, sleep a while, fold thine arms a while, etc., and so shall necessity overtake thee like a traveller, and poverty set upon thee like an armed man. Or as if a man should say: It is simple credit that the diligent man shall come to, when he shall stand before princes. It was but small charge of idle money that Egyptians bestowed upon the erecting of a pyramis of brick, when the expense in onions and garlic for workmen's diet in the building of it came to above 238,000 pounds of money. Milo had but a slender strength, that carried an ox a furlong on his back and then killed him with his fist and ate him to his breakfast. Titormus had a reasonable good arm, that could hold two bulls by the tail, the one in one hand, the other in the other, and never be stirred out of the place by their violent pulling. Here small, slender, reasonable amplify as much as if you had said great, exceeding, incredible. let pass that which notwithstanding you touch at full, as: I account not my hindrance in others the direct studies of my course. I value not my pains in collecting these observations, I will forget that I denied the earnest entreaties of many kinds of gent[lemen] that sued unto me for such helps, I am loth to tell you they are notes of whom your Masters of the Universities have thought the author as great a reader and a greater observer thereof than themselves; I desire not that you should make any greater estimation of them than as a testimony of my love to you and a pledge of my resolution to encourage those lively sparks of invention, which, if you smother or quench, you commit a kind of intellectual murder. The like is often used in progression. But another: I urge not to you the hope of your friends, though that should animate you to answer their expectation; I lay not before you the necessity of the place which you are to furnish, wherein to be defective and insufficient were some shame; I omit the envious concurrencies and some prepared comparisons in your country, which have some feeling with young men of foresight; I only say how our own promises shall give judgment against us: how shall we discharge our own engagements to your father, if this time hath not taken full effect of profit in our labor and endeavors? Two figures properly belong to these kinds of amplification which I called accumulation and division. The first is a round dispatching of much disjointed matter, not plainly and simply the same in sense yet tending to the same end; as, Love's companions be unquietness, longings, fond comforts, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701029&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) 112 faint discomforts, hopes, jealousies, ungrounded rages, causeless yieldings, etc. Spite, rage, disdain, shame, revenge came upon hatred. These examples are out of Arcadia . You may frame one, thus: All men exclaim upon these exactions. Nobles, gentlemen, commonalty, poor, rich, scholar, merchants, peasants, young, old, wise, ignorant, high, low, and all cry out upon the hard impositions of these burdens. This in one word is but all men , and therefore appertains to accumulation, but is expressed by several degrees and professions of men, and therefore belong[s] to division. The second figure differs not much from the first, but that the first is a sudden entrance into a confused heap of matter, this is a wild and dissolute repetition of all that went before; as, You have heard of his pride, ambition, cosenage, robberies, mutinies, in the city, in the camp, in the country. What kinsman of his unabused, what friend undeceived, what companion uncorrupted can speak for him? Where can he live without shame? Where can he die with honor? These two figures do not only make your cause seem better but, skilfully and fitly used, do amaze an adversary of mean conceit. There are other figures that fitly come in after amplification, or any great heat justly inflamed: interrogation and exclamation.  113 [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701030&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) more fitly than a bare affirmation, which were but too gentle and harmless a speech; as, The credit of your behavior is to cover imperfections and set forth your best parts, better thus uttered: Is it not the chiefest credit of behavior to set forth your good parts fairly, and cleanly to cover your imperfections? [Again:] The most part of men are ignorant, and therefore by shows, without vaunting and impudency, you should gain a more general opinion than by sufficiency smothered into a modest disposition. By interrogation, thus: Are not the most part of men ignorant? Shall you not, then, by mere shows, that are not too gross and vaunting, please more and get a more general good opinion than by great sufficiency darkened by your own shamefacedness? To retire and dissemble excellencies is only good policy in him whom his course must at length necessarily draw into light and proof, and then all that he shows will be admirable, because expectation forestalled nothing of his worth. Which sentence may likewise turn interrogatio . It is very fit for a speech to many and indiscreet hearers, and therefore much used in Pirocles's oration to the seditious multitude, and then it may well be frequented and iterated: Did the sun ever bring fruitful harvest, but was more [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701031&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) 114 hot than pleasant? Have you any of your children that be not sometimes cumbersome? Have you any fathers that be not sometimes wearish? Shall we therefore curse the sun, hate our children, or disobey our parents? The like, 338b, and in many places in like sort. An example of many interrogations of mine: Have you not seen a stately kind of courtesy, and proud kind of humility? Have you not seen a wise man draw himself from mean company with a better grace and more kindness than some silly gent[leman] that bestowed himself upon fools, thrown himself down into the middest of his miseries? Doth not a commendation, a cap, a good word, a good morrow purchase more hearts than a month's familiar prattling with a flock of rude people? Do not you converse with your superiors to learn them, and to be able to judge of them and benefit yourself? And shall not your inferiors do the like with you? Is it not a safer game of popularity with ceremonies than with disclosing of your nature? Another: Shall he be a bad husband who, having all his wealth abroad in stocks doth not oftentimes survey it? And shall he be a discreet gent[leman], whose credit consisting in acquaintance of great personages, and doth not often visit them, since they accompt it their honor to be visited? I could here write a whole life of interrogations; but let it suffice that it is easy and sweet to ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) reserve the flat style of affirmations to a downer right telling of tales. the mild Philoclea innocently beheaded, cried out: O tyrant heaven, traitor earth, blind providence, no  115 justice! How is this done! How is this suffered? Hath this world a government? The like in the beginning of the second book of Arcadia in the person of Gynecia, tormented in mind: [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701032&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) O sun! O you heavens, deserts! O virtue! O imperfect proportion! And in my book Of Charity and Resignation , of the chapter that the truest mortification is the study of cosmography: O endless endeavors and vain-glorious ignorance! Dost thou desire to be known? Where? In Europe? How canst thou be famous, when Asia and Africa, that have thrice as many people, hear not of thy actions? Art not thou then thrice as obscure as thou art renowned? Dost thou look that all the world should take notice of thee, when for five thousand years these three parts of the world took no notice of the fourth? But Europe is the house of fame, because it is the nursery of arts, and books, wherein reports are preserved. O weak imagination, O self-pleasing fancy! Canst thou expect in these parts from forty degrees to ninety northwards such praises and honor for thy name, when every map, or every wall, shows thee as much space from forty to ninety southwards inhabited with nothing but silence and forgetfulness? Daniel in his poems concludes with perpetually. It is a general instruction; for every man commonly for his pains in reading any history of other men looks for some private use to himself, like a teller who, in drawing great sums of other men's money, challengeth somewhat in the pound for his own fee. It serves for amplification, when, after a great [crime] or desert exclaimed upon or extolled, it gives a moral note worth credit and observation; as, after the true relation of Scipio Africanus his course, who, having been chief general of the greatest armies in the world, having all his lifetime kings suitors for his favor and nations kept in awe of his name; yet in fifty-six years never bought or sold goods or lands, never built any house or castle of his own, left not above 40 pounds in gold and 6 pounds in silver behind him at his death; it may be folded up in this acclamation: So little need hath he to stoop to private cares that thrives upon public victories, and so small leisure hath he to be desirous of riches, being but the means, who hath been so long possessed of honor, which is the mortal end of mortal actions. Such notes are these [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701033&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) scraps of policy which men nowadays gather out of Polybius and Tacitus, and not unlike are those morals that hang upon Æsop's fables. This acclamation expresseth sometimes the cause and reason of a former narration, as, a story of one who, being a servant of a family and of many qualities won the doting love of a witty lady in the house, whereas she never looked upon the humble suits, the cunning insinuations, the worthy deserts, of many lovers of higher degree but with free judgment and careless censure; this clause may follow: So hard entrance hath liking into a heart prepared to suspicion, especially in the weakest natures, whose safeguard is mistrust; so easy is the increase of love by insensible steps, when the service you offer seems to issue out of the goodness of your own disposition, which women expect to be permanent, and not out of the necessity of your suit, which may frame you for a time to vain difference from your proper honor. Yet if this be too much used, it is like a note-book gathered out of histories. Contrary to amplification is Diminution , and descends by the  116 same steps that ampli[fication] ascends by, and differs no otherwise than up- hill and down-hill; which is the same way, begun at several times. Yet some examples in your Arcadia give you to observe two ways of diminishing single terms; one, by denying the contrary, as, if you should say reasonable pleasant , Arcadian speech is not unpleasant; hardly liked---not misliked; not unfit, not 117 altogether modest, not deny . But why should I give examples of  118 the most usual phrases in the English tongue? As, we say not the 119 wisest man that ever I saw , for a man of small wisdom . The second way is by denying the right use of the word but by error of some; as, Those fantastical-minded people which children and  120 musicians call lovers. This color of mine, which she in the deceivable style of  121 affection would entitle beautiful. That in misfortune of letting fall his dagger, which the rude swaggerers of our time call disarmed. That opinion of honesty which hath lately been so proudly translated by soldiers into the word honor, and such like. But the former fashion of diminution sometimes in [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701034&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ironious sort goes for amplification; as, speaking of a great personage, no mean man , etc. This is an ordinary figure for all sorts of speeches. But these figures are but counterfeits of amplification. the meaning of neither precisely but a moderation and mediocrity of both; as, bravery and rags are contrary, yet somewhat  122 better than both is brave raggedness . The like: 123 Wanton modesty, enticing soberness. 124 And with that, she prettily smiled, which, mingled with her tears, a man could not tell whether it were mourning pleasure or delightful sorrow. Witty ignorance : It was an excellent pastime to those that would delight in the play of virtue, with what a witty ignorance she would not understand. Impatient patient, 183. Absented presence, 49. Well-willing spite, 213. Unkind carefulness. And one contrary is affirmed to be in the other directly by making one the substantive, the other the adjective, as above in the examples; or indirectly, as in these words following: 125 Seeking honor by dishonoring and building safety upon ruin. 126 O foolish woman, and most miserably foolish because wit makes thee foolish. 127 Captivity might seem to have authority over captivity. This is a fine course to stir admiration in the hearer and make them think it a strange harmony which must be expressed in such discords; therefore this example shall conclude: There was so perfect agreement in so mortal disagreement, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701035&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) 128 like a music made of cunning discords. This is an easy figure now in fashion, not like ever to be so usual. ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) terms disagreeing; this is an opposition of them, as: There was strength against nimbleness, rage against  129 resolution, fury against virtue, confidence against courage, pride against nobleness. He is a swaggerer amongst quiet men, but a quiet man amongst swaggerers; earnest in idle things, idle in matters of earnestness, where there is both antimetab[ole] for the turning of sentences back and contentio respecting the contrarieties of things meant thereby. Could not look on, would not look off.  130 Neither the one hurt her nor the other help her.  131 Just without partiality, mighty without contradiction, liberal without loosing, wise without curiosity. This figure Ascham told Sturmius that he taught the Queen of England, and that she excels in practice of it; and indeed it is a figure fit to set forth a copious style. This figure serves much for amplification. For comparison [ Compar , or Parison ]: comparison is an even gait of sentences answering each other in measures interchangeably, such as in St. Augustine but often in Gregory the Divine, such as in the Bishop of W. his books which he hath written in English, and many places of Euphues ; but that St. Austin, Bilson, and Lyly do very much mingle this figure with agnominatio and Similiter Cadens . It is a smooth and memorable style for utterance, but in penning it must be used moderately and modestly. A touch of agnom[ination] of the letter is tolerable with a ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) compar , as in the first words of Philanax his speech, If ever I could wish my faith untried and my counsel untrusted, and where there is a similiter cadens ; but a more eminent falling alike in this: 132 My years are not so many but that one death may conclude [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701036&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) them, nor my faults so many but that one death may satisfy them. Without consonancy of fall or harping upon letter or syllable, and yet a compar because they say the words match each other in rank: 133 Save his gray hairs from rebuke and his aged mind from despair, answer each other. Again: 134 Rather seek to obtain that constantly by courtesy which you cannot assuredly enjoy by violence, verb to verb, adverb to adverb, and substantive to substantive. Loneliness can neither warrant you from suspicion in others nor defend you from melancholy in yourself. 135 In some place there is a shorter ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) compar where substantive to substantive or word to word are joined, and yet without conjunction, which is Asyndeton : 136 Her skull with beauty, her head with wisdom, her eyes with majesty, her countenance with gracefulness, her lips with lovingness, where many ands are spared. Some places only the conjunction is put in in the last in a compar of three; as, 137 Her wit indeed by youth, her affection by birth, and her sadness by her beauty. 138 A fair woman shall not only command without authority but persuade without speaking. This is an excellent figure in no place untimely if not too often. It fits well the even ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) phrases and interpretations of an eloquent tongue that seems to be rich and wise, and to contain many parts (whereof each with a tedious man would make a sentence) [which] stick in the hearer's senses. Thereof I called it smooth and memorable. It hath been in request ever since the days of Isocrates, whose orations are full of them. This figure belongs more properly to that part of amplification called division than to accumulation. style; whereof none that writes humorously or factiously nowadays can be clear. For now there are such schisms of eloquence that it is enough for any ten years that all the bravest wits do imitate some one figure which a critic hath taught some great personage. So it may be within this two hundred years we shall go through the whole body of rhetoric. It is true that we study according to the predominancy of courtly inclinations: whilst mathematics were in requests, all our similitudes came from lines, circles, and angles; whilst moral philosophy is now a while spoken of, it is rudeness not to be sententious. And for my part, I'll make one. I have used and outworn six several styles since I was first Fellow of New College, and am yet able to bear the fashion of [the] writing company. Let our age, therefore, only speak morally, and let the next age live morally. [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701037&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) It is very true that a sentence is a pearl in a discourse; but is it a good discourse that is all pearl? It is like an eye in the body; but is it not monstrous to be all eyes? I take Cyclops to be as handsome a man as Argus. And if a sentence were as like to be an hand in the text as it is commonly noted with a hand in the margent, yet I should rather like the text that had no more hands than Hercules than that which had as many as Briareus. But these short- breathed gent[lemen], these judicious minds, will show me in their works interrogations, agnominations, corrections, and all the figures of rhetoric: I yield to it; and yet will they show me nothing but sentences, unless there be some difference betwixt writing all in sentences and writing all sententiously. This is a sentence: Man's experience is woman's best eyesight.  139 There is small difference between a proposition and a question, if I forget not Aristotle, I Topica. Since length of acquaintance, mutual secrecies, nor  140 height of benefits could bind a savage mind. There is a sentence, and in it asyndeton, Zeugma , and metaphors. He felt, valuing money higher than equity, that guiltiness  141 is not always with ease oppressed, where there is Meiosis , not always with ease for ever and hardly. Who stands only upon defense stands upon no defense,  142 with synoec[iosis] and epanodos. 143 Unlawful desires are punished after the effect of enjoying, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701038&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) but impossible desires are punished in the desire itself, a sentence with distinctio and contentio. 144 Love to a yielding heart is a king, but to a resisting is a tyrant, compar and contentio. It is a foolish wittiness to speak more than one thinks, synoec[iosis]. Neither is this sentence without a compar and is a double sentence, as they call it: 145 To a heart fully resolute, counsel is tedious but reprehension is loathsome, and there is nothing more terrible to a guilty mind than the eye of a respected friend. There be also sentences particular to some men as well; as  146 Amphialus, to whom abused kindness became spiteful rage; fearfulness ( contrary to all other vices) making Clinias think the better 147 of another, the worse he found himself  ; Evarchus making his life the example of his laws, his actions arising out of his deeds . Which all may be taken for rule and commonplaces by putting the general name for the special; as they say, crawing it a thesi ad hypothesin , from a position to a supposition. These examples may make you believe that a sentence may be course[d] through the whole figure-book; and it shall appear in a set treatise that many figures may easily assemble in one clause and any figure may sort with any: a slender reason to ground upon any one figure the frame and fashion of your whole style. In our profession there are not many (if two were many) whose speeches rely upon this figure; and in my judgment sententia is better for the bench than the bar. Then of all others, why would the writers of these days imprison themselves in the straitness of these maxims? It makes their style like arena sine calce , as one saith of such a writer; and doth not he vouchsafe to use them that [called] them posies for rings ? If it be a matter of short direction for life and action, or notes for memory, I intend not to discredit this new trick. But otherwise, he that hath a long journey to walk in that pace is like a horse that overreacheth and yet goes slow. St. Ambrose sanctifies this figure. living or dead; of living things, either reasonable, as of men and of personages and qualities, of unreasonable, as of horses, ships, islands, castles and suchlike. Men are described most excellently in Arcadia : Basilius, Plexirtus, Pirocles, Musidorus, Anaxius, etc. [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701039&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) But he that will truly set down a man in a figured story must first learn truly to set down an humor, a passion, a virtue, a vice, and therein keeping decent proportion add but names and knit together the accidents and encounters. The perfect expressing of all qualities is learned out of Aristotle's ten books of moral philosophy; but because, as Machiavel saith, perfect virtue or perfect vice is not seen in our time, which altogether is humorous and spurting, therefore the understanding of Aristotle's Rhetoric is the directest means of skill to describe, to move, to appease, or to prevent any motion whatsoever; where unto whosoever can fit his speech shall be truly eloquent. This was my opinion ever; and Sir Philip Sidney betrayed his knowledge in this book of Aristotle to me before ever I knew that he had translated any part of it. For I found the two first books Englished by him in the hands of the noble studious Henry Wotton. But lately I think also that he had much help out of Theophrast Imagines . For the web, as it were, of his story, he followed three: Heliodorus in Greek, Sannazarius' Arcadia in Italian, and Diana [by] de Montemayor in Spanish. But to our purpose---what personages and affections are set forth in Arcadia . For men: pleasant idle retiredness in King Basilius, and the dangerous end of it; unfortunate valor in Plangus; courteous valor in Amphialus; proud valor in Anaxius (305); hospitality in Kalander; the mirror of true courage and friendship in Pirocles and Musidorus; miserableness and ingratitude in Chremes (188); fear and fatal subtlety in Clinias (299); fear and rudeness, with ill- affected civility, in Dametas (84). And through the story, mutual virtuous love: in marriage, in Argalus and Parthenia (291); out of marriage, in Pirocles and Philoclea, Musidorus and Pamela; true constant love unrespected in Plangus and Helena (47); in the true Zelmane (200) inconstancy and envy; suspicion and tyranny in a king and his counsellors (139); generally false love in Pamphilus [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701040&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) (185); and light courage and credulity in Chremes' daughter; base dotage on a wife in Plangus' father. But in women: a mischievous seditious stomach in Cecropia (251); wise courage in Pamela; mild discretion in Philoclea; Pamela's prayer (264); her discourse (281); squeamish cunning unworthiness in Artesia; respective and restless dotage in Gynecia's love; proud ill-favored sluttish simplicity in Mopsa. Now in these persons is ever a steadfast decency and uniform difference of manners observed, wherever you find them and how-soever each interrupt the other's story and actions. And for actions of persons, there are many, rarely described: as a mutiny and fire in a ship (210); causes of an uproar (223, 218); the garboil (215); an armed skirmish (268, 271); policy and preparation (286); (but policy generally in all particular actions is noted in your book ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) pc ;) managing a horse is described (122); tilting shows (from 69 to 72). Many other notable and lively portraits are, which I will not lay down to save you so sweet a labor as the reading of that which may make you eloquent and wise. Sir Philip Sidney's course was (besides reading Aristotle and Theophrastus) to imagine the thing present in his own brain that [h]is pen might the better present it to you. Whose example I would you durst follow till I pulled you back. This have I written of illustration in conveyance and well gaining of the substance of a treatise. Where evident and lively descriptions are in Arcadia , you have this note, des ; where the person is aptly fitted with speech and action, dc : both these give light to the handling and grow into very pleasant acquaintance with the understanding and memory of the reader. 148 For special lights in every sentence, there are other sparks of figures. First, if there be any doubt or ambiguity in the words, it is better left out than distinguished; but if you are to answer any former speeches, you may disperse all clouds and remove all scruples with Distinction . As, being charged that you have brought very light reasons, you may answer: If by light you mean clear , I am glad you do see them; if by light you mean of no weight , I am sorry you do not feel them. So you may express yourself: A man of hidden learning, hidden as well for the obscure and mean estate of his person as hidden for the unusual and intricate conceit of the matter. But as ambiguity is not only in words but in matter, so both ways it is taken away by distinction. Sometimes it is in single words, as in these former ( light and hidden ); sometimes in coherence of sentences, by relation of each word to each, or by reason of [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701041&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) change of the pointing---which is opened by utterance. You have many examples thereof in the Courtier , the second book of Cicero De Oratore , and in Quintilian where there is mention of jocus ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) ab ambiguo . And you may satisfy yourself at full if you search but the margent of Erasmus' Apothegms where ambigus is written. Distinction of ambiguity in matter is a determination of the truth of general propositions, to tell wherein they are certain and wherein they are not; as, Travel in foreign countries settleth a young man's humors . If it be taken in this sort, 'It will enforce him to wariness and secrecy and restrain him from pouring forth his counsels,' it is very profitable; for he shall have few friends to put confidence in and few companions to prattle with, upon whom he might bestow his idle time or idle thoughts. But if you intend that by travelling all vanities should be taken away, it seems not so likely and admittable; because he shall walk through many ill examples and great liberty. Another proposition distinguished: They are but frail merits which you shall bestow upon young men's friendship . It is true, if you please those desires which are like to depart with their youth (as gaming, feasting, and idle sportings), you are like to be cast off with those toys, and forgotten. But if your deserts of young men be in honest exercise, learned conference, and civil friendly offices, the remembrance thereof will increase, and grow as fast as their discretion. So much for distinction. Next follows Definition , which is the shortest and truest exposition of the nature of anything. Hereof you have examples: of virtues and vice, in Aristotle's Morals ; of passions, in his Rhetoric ; both, in [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701042&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Thomas Aquinas' Secunda ; of many affections and perturbations, in Tusculan Questions and Cicero De Finibus . The general definition of virtue is this: virtus est habitus rationi consentaneus , virtue is a quality settled in reason. Fear is an apprehension of future harm. Thrift is a moderate and lawful increase of wealth by careful government of your own estate. Compliment is performance of affected ceremonies in words, looks, or gesture, where definition runs into division. Of seven or eight ways of definition, read Valerius's Logic . But to be most perfectly instructed, read the sixth book of Aristotle's Top [ica ]. Your definitions need not be strictly tied to the rules of logic, nor your divisions. The matter is sometimes illustrated by paraphr[asis], as:  149 spurred his horse apace , made his spurs claim haste of his horse; 150 a man not to be contemned, a man against whom contempt might  151 make no just challenge; snorting aloud, snorting so loud that no man might lay the stealing of a nap to her charge  . But of paraphr[asis] and periphr[asis] is a several chapter. Sometimes Parenthesis makes your discourse fair and more sensible; as, 152 He, swelling in their humbleness (like a bubble swollen up with a small breath, broken with a great), forgetting (or not knowing) humanity, caused their heads to be struck off. That what his wit could conceive (and his wit can conceive as far as the limits of reason can stretch) was all directed to the setting forth of his friend. Till the next morning (better by the hourglass than by the day's clearness) having run fortune, etc. And indeed all parentheses are in extremities, either graces or disgraces to a speech. If they be long, the[y] seem interruptions, and therefore at the end of them there must be a retreat to the matter, called Antanaclasis , as: Assure thyself (most wicked woman! that hast so plaguily a corrupted mind as that thou canst not keep thy sickness to thyself, but must most wickedly infect others) assure thyself, I say, etc. Shall that heart (which doth not only feel them but hath all the working of his life placed in them) shall that heart, I say, etc. past, present, and to come (which is rather a breaking than a division); of magistrates, into supreme or subordinate, from their order; of beasts or unreasonable creatures, into those of the air, water, earth; love is either of beauty or virtue, from the object; study is of liberal or mechanical sciences, from the subject. And so you may divide as many ways as things may differ, as: by their beginnings, endings, properties, marks, effects, times, places, forms, and persons in whom they are, and howsoever; whereof the proper [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701043&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) treaty belongs to logic. And something is spoken thereof in the second way of amplification. Out of division arise three several enforcements and manifestations of your purpose, which, though they are by rhetoricians diversely termed, yet are in effect grounded upon one art of distribution. The first is Expedition , which, reckoning upon divers parts, destroys all but that one which you mean to rest upon, as: One of these courses must be taken: either you must diligently observe or practise these rules, or deny that ever you received instructions, or allege want of capacity in yourself or want of use of them in your life. That they are unnecessary you cannot say; for what more necessary in your life than to write well? That you are uncapable is a slander and contradiction to your own conscience and my experience, that have seen such fair essays and beginning of your endeavors. And to say you had never any directions were to give your two eyes the lie, and to make me believe that I did never but dream you good. Therefore must your labor conspire with my inventions, and so must you unexcusably become skilful. This enumeration, and inference thereupon, is that which the logicians call induction; as, in reckoning up, it is neither this nor that, therefore it is this; and (as one merrily saith) it is the dog's syllogism in a cross-way, that saith, My master is gone this or that way: but I smell him not this way, nor this; therefore he runs on his conclusion, without smelling. The second of this sort is [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701044&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Prosapodosis , that overthroweth no part of the division, but returneth some reason to each member. In Arcadia : 153 Heretofore I have accused the sea, condemned the pirates, and hated my evil fortune that deprived me of thee. But now thyself art the sea, thyself the pirate, and thy will the evil fortune. Time at one instant seeming short and long to them: short in the pleasingness of such presence, long in the stay of their desires. Your silence must carry with it a construction of contempt, unkindness, or displeasure. If you take me not for your friend, you offer unkindness. If you deem me unworthy of an answer, it comes of contempt. If your passion defers a reply, it argues your displeasure. The first of this sort denied all parts save one; this affirms and keeps all sides up. The last is Dilemma , which proposeth two sides and overthrows both. You must have both ability and will to write well, for to say I can not is childish, and to say I will not is womanish. There is in the best writers sometimes a vein of speech wherein the vulgar conceits are exceedingly pleased; for they admire this most, that there is some excellency in it and yet they themselves suspect that it excels their admiration. In some examples I would gladly discover the reason thereof. It cannot be but if either the meaning or the words be obscure or unfamiliar unto a man's mind, that the speech so consisting should be much accepted; and yet it is impossible that there should be any extraordinary delight in ordinary words and plain meaning. How then shall we determine? It is as it is in many dishes at our tables: our eyes and taste give them commendation, nor for the substance but for the dressing and service. What plainer meaning than sleep amongst thieves ? And verily, sleep, life, trust , are common English words. Yet it is  154 not a common fashion of speech to say, trust a sleeping life amongst thieves . In the same sense, when they had slept awhile is ordinary; but when they had a while hearkened to the persuasion [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701045&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) 155 of sleep is extraordinary. Though all the words of it, by themselves, are most known and familiar, yet the bringing-in and fetch of it is strange and admirable to the ignorant. We therefore call it periphrasis, or circumlocution; and it is much helped by metaphors; as before, inclined to sleep is expressed by a metaphor taken from an orator, who moves and inclines by persuasion, and to be so moved it is to hearken. In this sort Sir P[hilip] S[idney], being to speak his usual meanings, yet notwithstanding shunned usual phrases, as, for it is absurd in my conceit , saith he: it hath a great incongruity . But let us have one bout more with our adversary, sleep. For having risen early , he saith: having striven with the sun's earliness . Instead of  156 Mopsa wept ill-favoredly, Mopsa disgraced weeping with her 157 countenance . Instead of saying, they that guarded Amphialus were killed themselves , it is said: seeking to save him, they lost their fortresses which nature placed them in . Instead of Plangus' speech began to be suspected , it is said: Plangus' speech began to be 158 translated into the language of suspicion . And this of purpose did he write, to keep his style from baseness: as, being to name a thresher , he called him one of Ceres' servants . Instead of his name 159 was known to high and low , he saith that no prince could pretend 160 height nor beggar lowness to bar him from the sounds thereof . For old and young malcontents , he saith: such whom youthful age or youthful minds had filled with unlimited desires . And this is by going a concreto ad abstractum , and divers other ways. If a short ordinary sense be oddly expressed by more words, it is false oaths, plentiful perjury; to make a great show of himself, to make a muster of himself in the island ; for kill any married 161 man, make his sword accursed by any widow (which is by consequence); seeking by courtesy to undo him, making courtesy the outside of mischief (by similitude or metaphor). So, then, the course is: instead of any ordinary words importing any trivial sense, to take the abstract, or some consequent, similitude, note, property, or effect, and thereby declare it. These two figures serve for illustration. It is most convenient sometimes for the bringing in of life and lustre to represent some unexpected strains beside the tenor of your tale, and act, as it were, your meaning; which is done either by feigning the presence or the discourse of some such persons as either are not at all or, if there be, yet speak not but by imagination. The first is by apostrophe or prosopopoeia. people when your speech before was to the judge, to the def[endan]t, to the adversary, to the witnesses, as: And herein you witnesses are to consult with your own consciences and to enter into true examination of your memory. Did you mark his looks? Did you note his speeches? Did you truly observe the particular proceedings of the action? To the people, thus: Now let me entreat any man here present that thinks himself not exempted from misfortunes and privileged from all mischances, to imagine himself in my case and to undertake for my sake but some few thoughts of my distress. Sometimes the occasion is to some quality, or thing, that yourself gives show of life to, as: [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701046&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) 162 Hope, tell me, what hast thou to hope for? Love, be ashamed to be called love. But to animate and give life is Prosopopoeia , as, to make dead men speak; as, 163 If your ancestors were now alive and saw you defacing so goodly a principality by them established, would they not say thus? Sir P[hilip] S[idney] gives meaning and speech to the needle, the cloth, and the silk; as learning, as a city, as death itself, is feigned to live and make a speech. Another way of clearing and reviving your course is by deliberating, by entering into communication, by preventing and answering objections. In Whom shall I blame? What shall I pretend? Shall I make learning hateful to you by my reprehensions? Shall I make my silence accessory to your idleness? It is not in my power, it is in your discretion, to reform it. Under this figure are Philoclea's wishes of Zelmane. [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701047&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) 164 Here is another kind of deliberation which proposeth many things without entangling a man's self, as: Nothing can assure me your love to continue towards me if you discontinue the study of speaking well. For suppose you marry into some worthy family; suppose they enrich you with some new friends. May not a vein of thriving rob me of your acquaintance? May not you lose yourself in a labyrinth of worldly cares? Sometimes we enter into Communication ; as, Were it your case, what would you answer? Tell me, I appeal unto your secret thoughts. Your friend hath esteemed better of his own stomach than of the eternal love betwixt you vowed, and preferreth the trial of his valor before the regard of both your credits; which must die howsoever either or both of you survive the combat: would you not judge him unworthy ever to be your friend that began not his fidelity with an inviolable covenant never to be your enemy? You will say to me that in a factious country it is the only policy to stand neutral. I say, no, unless many circumstances help you; videlicet , these: if none of those friends by whom your love is scanned be entered into a quarrel; if you be assured that your wealth and discretion is equal to the best; if there be likelihood of scattering the reliance of both sides and making a new pack. Then is it wisdom to stand aloof off a while, that if you please you may add the victory to which side you will. But having undertaken a side, if you intend to be upright, you will grow contemptible; [if] you offer reconciliation, your strength will forsake you; if you dispraise your adversary, you will be deemed envious; if you commend his wisdom, you betray your own weakness. Praise then his wealth, his ancestors, his beauty, his pleasantness; but praise not his foresights nor his valor. Are you judge amongst your neighbors and inferiors, be precisely just and equal. Are you assistant to your friend, be advisedly but throughly partial. You would be accounted liberal: testify seldom, but publicly and worthily. You would thrive in bargaining; do it not in many matters, covertly, for many small breaches of confidence are more infamous than one great one. But offend not your conscience wittingly, to be tre[asure]r of all the Indian mines. Thus you see how counsel, precepts, or sentences may be translated into the form of occupatio and subiectio. Sometimes occupatio is left out, and argument brought to the contrary, as Cecropia, persuading her son Amphialus to offer violence to Philoclea, presupposed that he would say he must be modest; she replies: [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=09701048&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFD67C26&area=prose&forward=textsFT) 165 Each virtue hath his time. The soldier that should march foremost must not give the way for modesty. There is occupatio and subiectio in Arcadia (112): if she contemned me, then thus; if, then , etc. The like is (251): Did I go to charge them? etc. Did I walk abroad to see any delight? my walking was the delight itself. He saw her alive, he was glad to see her alive; he saw her weep, he was sorry to see her weep; he heard her comfortable speeches, nothing more gladsome. This figure cannot be out of season but of purpose, as was in the fustian speech: You listen to my speeches; I must confess it. You hearken to me; I cannot deny it. You look for some sense; I partly believe it. But you find none; I do not respect it. And if you will read over that speech, you shall find most of the figures of rhetoric there, meaning neither harm nor good, but as idle as yourself when you are most at leisure. There is another figure, called Concessio , but I mean to mistake occupatio and concessio one for another till I know them better. The form of concessio is this: I admit you are resolute; I grant your determination is immoveable; but it is in things against your friends' judgment, and things against your own praise and profit.

On fol. 8 r is a heading, 'The Argument' and a headnote, as follows: A faire younge wife beinge left of her husband who went to travell, there arrives at the same Village where shee lived a Marchant who solicitinge by all meanes her chastitye, receives onelie denyalls from her. It falls out yt this Marchant dies whilst he was in this pursuite, and leaves the faire wife heire to all his goods, adding this reason (because I haue found her honest) she enters on the possession of his goods, her husbande returnes, suspects, and accuses her of Adulterie. Then begins a plea headed 'Maritus contra Vxorem,' which ends on fol. 8 v, and this is followed by 'Responsio Vxoris,' at the middle of 10 v. The subject of this accusation and defence is exactly that of Declamation 65 in The Orator (1596) by Alexander van den Busche, or Silvayn (translated by Lazarus Pyott, or Piot), and the statement of the case, just quoted, follows closely the corresponding statement in The Orator in purport, though not in wording. Yet the speeches of the manuscript are entirely different from those of the printed book. It seems that they represent the compositions of some one who had read those in The Orator and was trying, as a rhetorical exercise, to write entirely different pleas. The editor has been so fortunate as to find three separate and perhaps independent texts of the 'fustian speech' referred to more than once in the text of the Directions. It is easily identifiable by the quotations from it (above, pp. 15, 50). The designations and locations of the texts are as follows: A. Additional MS. 25,303, fols. 184 v-185 v. This seems to be the oldest, and may come from early in the seventeenth century. B. HM 1338, folios unnumbered, in the Huntington Library; a commonplace-book, c. 1630-1635. The text shows some degradation. C. Le Prince d'Amour, or the Prince of Love. London, 1660. pp. 37-40. The last was chosen for reprinting because its punctuation helps keep clear the intention of the writer, and because in the main its text combines the respective superiorities of A and B. Important variants appearing in the manuscripts are given in footnotes. Before presenting the text, however, we must notice the light which the presence of this speech in Le Prince d'Amour (1660) casts upon the facts of Hoskins's life. This book (sometimes indexed as by Sir Benjamin Rudyerd because he is known to have written a part of it) contains an account of a Christmas revel of the Middle Temple.  214 The book is dedicated by W. L. (William Leake, the stationer) 'To the Honourable the Society of the Middle Temple,' as containing ' wit born long before our unhappy intestine divisions. ' To read with understanding, one must turn first to "A brief Chronicle of the dark Raign of the bright Prince of burning Love" (pp. 78-90), Rudyerd's night-by-night account of the Christmas festivities of the Templars (at a date presently to be discussed), lasting from Christmas Eve until January 14. The account begins, ' Anno ab Aula condita the 27,' a phrase which has been interpreted as pointing to 1599, twenty-seven years after the completion of the new Hall of the Temple in 1572. But Rudyerd's days of the week do not correspond with the Christmas season of 1599-1600. In the festivities described, Christmas and New Year's Day fell upon Sundays, which means that the season referred to must be that of 1597-1598.  215 As for the twenty-seven years 'from the founding of the Hall,' the new building was in process of erection from 1562 until 1572, and Rudyerd might have had some reason for considering 1570 as the year of its foundation. After reading Rudyerd's account of the festivities, one should turn back to the first section of the book and find there the texts of speeches, challenges, announcements by heralds, the prognostication of the Prognosticator, and other matter mentioned in that account. Upon the first Thursday (December 29) of the festivities, for example, one learns from Rudyerd (p. 83): The Orator made a neat Tufftaffata Oration, which was answered in a handsome Fustian speech by the Clerk of the Councel; in the middle of which Tuftaffata Oration the Orator took Tobacco; and being charged with it in the Fustian Answer, at first denied it. Turning back to p. 37, we find: The Princes Orator having made a ridiculous and senseless speech unto his Excellency, the Clerk of the Council was requested to make an answer thereto at ex tempore , which at the first he refusd; but being importuned, he began and said, followed by the speech reprinted below. From the Directions and the evidence of the manuscripts, in both of which Hoskins's name is subscribed to the speech, we infer that the Clerk of the Council of the Prince d'Amours throughout this revel was John Hoskins. And in the prophecy delivered by the Prognosticator (p. 35) we get further information as to Hoskins's part: 'The Clerk of the Councils note of the duty of the Officers shall help furnish some that are out of discourse.' Turning further back, we find (pp. 22-31) this 'note of the duty of the Officers' under the heading, ' The Charge and duty of the Officers of the Prince d'Amours ,' written in Hoskins's burlesque vein. There are other portions of Le Prince d'Amour (such as the speeches of the champion and the challenger, pp. 6-13) which might also have been written, so far as one can judge from style, by Hoskins. The first poem in the collection of Elizabethan and Jacobean poetry which constitutes the second half of Le Prince d'Amour , is one attributed to Hoskins by John Aubrey and said by him to be 'printed in some of the Drolleries. '  216 For some interesting speculations aroused by our memoranda of these revels, we might first notice the fact that in Additional MS. 25,303 (our text A) the heading of the speech, while resembling the last bit of the heading already quoted from Le Prince d'Amour , introduces a new character: Refused to answer at extempore beinge importuned by ye Prince & Sr Walter Raleigh began  217 It is not impossible that Ralegh, a former resident of Middle Temple, was a distinguished visitor on the night in question; and there may be some connection between his presence and the mock-defense of tobacco to be found in the speech. Furthermore, we learn from the speech that the Prince's orator was named Best or Bestia. Elsewhere in the documents ( Le Prince d'Amour , pp. 47, 51) we have references to one of the revellers under the name of Carolus Asinius Bestia. Hence it seems likely that the orator to whom Hoskins replied was Charles Best, whom we know as a minor poet, a contributor to Davison's Poetical Rhapsody of 1602.  218 Best entered the Middle Temple in 1592. Thus we gain knowledge of another literary friend of our author. Finally, the man who was elected Prince for the period of the revels is called, in the printed account, Martino; and is probably none other than Richard Martin, whom we know to have been a Middle Templar and for several years a crony of Hoskins. Further examination of Le Prince d'Amour , with constant reference to the records of the Middle Temple, doubtless would reveal the identity of other revellers. The text of the 'fustian speech' follows: Then ( Mr. Orator ) I am sorry that for your Tufftaffata Speech, you shall receive but a Fustian Answer. For alas! what am I (whose ears have been pasted  219 with the Tenacity of your Speeches, and whose nose hath been perfumed with the Aromaticity of your sentences) that I should answer your Oration, both Voluminous and Topical, with a Replication concise and curtal? For you are able in Troops of Tropes , and Centuries of Sentences to muster your meaning: Nay, you have such Wood-piles of words, that unto you Cooper is but a Carpenter, and Rider himself deserves not a Reader. I am therefore driven to say to you, as Heliogabalus said to his dear and honourable servant Reniger Fogassa , If thou dost ill ( quoth he ) then much good do thee; if well, then snuffe the candle. For even as the Snow advanced upon the points vertical of cacuminous Mountains, dissolveth and discoagulateth itself into humorous liquidity; even so by the frothy volubility of your words, the Prince is perswaded to depose himself from his Royal Seat and Dignity, and to follow your counsel with all contradiction and reluctation; wherefore I take you to be fitter to speak unto stones, like Amphion , or trees, like Orpheus , than to declaim to men like a Cryer, or to exclaim to boyes  220 like a Sexton: For what said Silas Titus, 221 the Sope-maker of Holborn-bridge? For ( quoth he ) since the States of Europe have so many momentary inclinations, and the Anarchical confusion of their Dominions is like to ruinate their Subversions,  222 I see no reason why men should so addict themselves to take Tabacco in Ramus Method ; For let us examine the Complots of Polititians from the beginning of the world to this day; What was the cause of the repentine mutiny in Scipio's Camp? it is most evident it was not Tabacco. What was the cause of the Aventine revolt, and seditious deprecation for a Tribune? it is apparent it was not Tabacco. What moved me to address this Expostulation to your iniquity? it is plain it is not Tabacco. 223 So that to conclude, Tabacco is not guilty of so many faults as it is charged withal; it disuniteth not the reconciled, nor reconcileth the disunited; it builds no new Cities, nor mends no old Breeches; yet the one, the other, and both are not immortal without reparations: Therefore wisely said the merry-conceited Poet Heraclitus , Honourable misfortunes shall have ever an Historical compensation.  224 You listen unto my speeches, I must needs confess it; you hearken to my words, I cannot deny it; you look for some meaning, I partly believe it; but you find none, I do not greatly respect it: For even as a Mill-horse is not a Horse- mill; nor Drink ere you go, is not Go ere you drink;  225 even so Orator Best, is not the best Orator. The sum of all is this, I am an humble Suitor to your Excellency, not only to free him from the danger of the Tower, which he by his demerits cannot avoid; but also to increase dignity upon his head, and multiply honour upon his shoulders, as well for his Eloquence, as for his Nobility. For I understand by your Herald that he is descended from an Ancient house of the Romans , even from Calphurnius Bestia , and so the generation continued from beast to beast, to this present beast.  226 And your Astronomer hath told me that he hath Kindred in the Zodiack ; therefore in all humility I do beseech your Excellency to grant your Royal Warrant to the Lo. Marshal , and charge him to send to the Captain of the Pentioners, that he might send to the Captain of the Guard to dispatch a Messenger to the Lieutenant of the Tower, to command one of his Guard to go to one of the Grooms of the Stable, to fetch the Beadle of the Beggars, ut gignant stultum , to get him a stool; ut sit foris Eloquentiae, 227 that he may sit for his Eloquence.  228 I think I have most oratoriously insinuated  229 unto your apprehension, and with evident obscurity intimated  230 unto your good consideration, that the Prince hath heard your Oration, yea marry hath he, and thinketh  231 very well of it, yea marry doth he.  232
