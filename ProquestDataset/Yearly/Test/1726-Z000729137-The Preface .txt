 with the discerning Eye shut it, to keep them Company. It is pleasant enough, however, to observe, frequently, in these Enemies of Brightnesses, when the opening Glooms will permit. Nay, I have seen their Heaviness, on some Occasions, deign to turn friskish, and witty, in which they make just such another Figure as Ã† sop's Ass , when he began to fawn. To compleat the Absurdity, They would, even, in their Efforts against Poetry , fain be poetical; like those Gentlemen that reason with a great deal of Zeal, and Severity, against Reason. That there are frequent, and notorious, Abuses of Poetry is as true as that the best Things are most liable to that Misfortune; but is there no End of that clamorous Argument against the Use of Things from the Abuse of them? And yet, I hope, that no Man, who has the least Sense of Shame in Him, will fall into it after the present, sulphureous, Attacker of the Stage. To insist no further on this Head, let Poetry , once more, be restored to her antient Truth, and Purity; let Her be inspired from Heaven, and, in Return, her Incense ascend thither; Let Her exchange Her low, venal, trifling, Subjects for such as are fair, useful, and magnificent; and, let Her execute these so as, at once, to please, instruct, surprize, and astonish: and then, of Necessity, the most inveterate Ignorance, and Prejudice, shall be struck Dumb; and Poets , yet, become the Delight and Wonder, of Mankind. But this happy Period is not to be expected, till some long-wished, illustrious Man, of equal Power, and Beneficence, rise on the wintry World of Letters: One of a genuine, and unbounded, Greatness, and Generosity, of Mind; who, far, above all the Pomp, and Pride, of Fortune, scorns the little addressful, Flatterer; peirces thro' the disguised, designing, Villain; discountenances all the reigning Fopperies of a tasteless Age: and who, stretching his Views into late Futurity, has the true Interest of Virtue, Learning, and Mankind, intirely, at Heart---A Character so nobly desirable! that to an honest Heart, it is, almost, incredible so few should have the Ambition to deserve it. Nothing can have a better Influence towards the Revival of Poetry than the chusing of great, and serious, Subjects; such as, at once, amuse the Fancy, enlighten the Head, and warm the Heart. These give a Weight, and Dignity, to the Poem: Nor is the Pleasure, I should say Rapture, both the Writer, and the Reader, feels unwarranted by Reason, or followed by repentant Disgust. To be able to write on a dry, barren, Theme, is looked upon, by some, as the Sign of a happy, fruitful, Genius---fruitful indeed!--- like one of the pendant Gardens in Cheapside , water'd, every Morning, by the Hand of the Alderman , Himself. And what are we commonly entertain'd with, on these Occasions, save forced, unaffecting, Fancies; little, glittering Prettinesses; mixed Turns of Wit, and Expression; which are as widely different from Native Poetry , as Buffoonery is from the Perfection of human Thinking? A Genius fired with the Charms of Truth, and Nature, is tuned to a sublimer Pitch, and scorns to associate with such Subjects. I cannot more emphatically recommend this Poetical Ambition than by the four following Lines from Mr. Hill's Poem , called, The Judgment Day , which is so singular an Instance of it. For Me, suffice it to have taught my Muse, The tuneful Triflings of her Tribe to shun; And rais'd her Warmth such Heavenly Themes to chuse, As, in past Ages, the best Garlands won . I know no Subject more elevating, more amusing; more ready to awake the poetical Enthusiasm, the philosophical Reflection, and the moral Sentiment, than the Works of Nature . Where can we meet with such Variety, such Beauty, such Magnificence? All that enlarges, and transports, the Soul? What more inspiring than a calm, wide, Survey of Them? In every Dress Nature is greatly charming! whether she puts on the Crimson Robes of the Morning ! the strong Effulgence of Noon ! the sober Suit of the Evening ! or the deep Sables of Blackness , and Tempest ! How gay looks the Spring ! how glorious the Summer ! how pleasing the Autumn ! and how venerable the Winter ! ---But there is no thinking of these Things without breaking out into Poetry ; which is, by the bye, a plain, and undeniable, Argument of their superior Excellence. For this Reason the best, both Antient, and Modern, Poets have been passionately fond of Retirement, and Solitude. The wild romantic Country was their Delight. And they seem never to have been more happy, than when lost in unfrequented Fields, far from the little, busy, World, they were at Leisure, to meditate, and sing the Works of Nature . The Book of Job , that noble, and antient, Poem , which, even, strikes so forcibly thro' a mangling Translation, is crowned with a Description of the grand Works of Nature ; and that, too, from the Mouth of their Almighty Author . It was this Devotion to the Works of Nature that, in his Georgicks , inspired the rural Virgil to write so inimitably; and who can forbear joining with him in this Declaration of his, which has been the Rapture of Ages. Me vero primum dulces ante omnia Mus ae, Quarum Sacra fero ingenti perculsus Amore, Accipiant; Coelique Vias et Sidera monstrent, Defectus solis varios, Lun aeque labores: Unde tremor Terris: qua vi Maria alta tumescant Obicibus ruptis, rursusque in seipsa residant: Quid tantum Oceano properent se tingere soles Hyberni: vel qu ae tardis Mora Noctibus obstat. Sin, has ne possim Natur ae accedere Partes, Frigidus obstiterit circum Pr aecordia sanguis; Rura mihi et rigui placeant in valibus amnis Flumina amem silvasque inglorius .--- Which may be Englished thus. Me may the Muses, my supreme Delight! Whose Priest I am, smit with immense Desire, Snatch to their Care; the Starry Tracts disclose, The Sun's Distress, the Labours of the Moon: Whence the Earth quakes: and by what Force the Deeps Heave at the Rocks, then on Themselves reflow: Why Winter-Suns to plunge in Ocean speed: And what retards the lazy Summer-Night. But, least I should these mystic-Truths attain, If the cold Current freezes round my Heart, The Country Me, the brooky Vales may please Mid Woods, and Streams , unknown.--- I cannot put an End to this Preface , without taking the Freedom to offer my most sincere, and grateful, Acknowledgments to all those Gentlemen who have given my first Performance so favourable a Reception. It is with the best Pleasure, and a rising Ambition, that I reflect on the Honour Mr. Hill has done me, in recommending my Poem to the World, after a manner so peculiar to Himself; than whom, none approves, and obliges, with a nobler, and more unreserving, Promptitude of Soul. His Favours are the very smiles of Humanity; graceful, and easy; flowing from, and to, the Heart. This agreeable Train of Thought awakens naturally in my Mind all the other Parts of his great, and amiable, Character, which I know not well how to quit, and yet dare not here pursue.
