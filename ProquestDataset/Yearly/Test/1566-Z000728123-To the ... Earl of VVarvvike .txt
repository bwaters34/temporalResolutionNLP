 Offices. De beneuolentia autem, quam quisq habeat erga nos, primum illud est in officio, vt ei plurimum tribuamus, a quo plurimu diligimur . Of beneuolence vvhich eche man beareth towards vs, the chiefest duetie is to giue most to him, of vvhome vve be most beloued. But hovv vvel the same is done, or hovve praise vvorthy the translation is, I referre to the skilful crauing no more praise therefore, than they shall attribute and giue. To nothing seke I to aspire by this my presumption (right honorable) but cherefull acceptation of the same at your handes: desirous hereby to shevv my selfe studious of a friende of so noble vocation. And vvhere greater thinges cannot be done, these small I trust shall not be forsaken and contempned: vvhich if I doe perceiue to be fauored, hereafter more ample indeuor shalbe imploied to achieue greater, if abilitie thereunto be consonant. In these histories (vvhich by an other terme I call Nouelles ) be described the liues, gestes, coquestes and highe enterprises of great Princes, wherin also be not forgotte the cruel actes and tyrannie of some. In these be set forth the great valiance of noble Gentlemen, the terrible combates of coragious personages, the vertuous mindes of noble Dames, the chaste hartes of constante Ladies, the woderful pacience of puisaunt princes, the milde sufferaunce of well disposed Gentlewomen, and indiuers, the quiet bearing of aduerse Fortune. In these Histories be depamted in liuely colours, the vglye shapes of Insolencye and Pride, the deforme figures of Incontinencie and Rape, the cruell aspectes of Spoyle, breache of order, treason, ill lucke and mischiefe of States and other persons. VVherin also be intermixed, pleasant discourses, merie talk, sporting practises, deceytful deuises, and nipping tauntes, to exhilarate the readers minds. And althoughe by the first face and view, some of these may seme to intreat of vnlawfull Loue, and the foule practises of the same, yet beinge throughlye read and well considered, both old and yonge maye learne hovve to auoide the ruine, ouerthrovve, inconuenience, and displeasure, that lasciuious desire, and vvaton vvil, doth bring to the suters and pursuers of the same. All which may render good example for all sortes to follovv the best, and imbrace the vertuous, contrariwise to reiect the vvorst, and contempne the vicious. For vvhiche intent and purpose be al things, good and bad recited in histories, Chronicles, and monumentes, by the firste authors and elucubrators of the same. To vvhome then may the same (vvherein be contained many discourses of nobilitie) be offred vvith more due desert than to him, that in nobilitie and parentage is not inferior to the best? To vvhom maye factes and exploites of famous personages be consigned, but to him vvhose provvesse and valiant actes be manifeste and vvell knovven to Englishemen, but better to straungers, vvhiche haue felt the puissance therof? To vvhome may the combats, gests, and courses of the victorious be remembred, but to him, vvhose frequent vse of mighty incountrie and terrible shocke of shield and Launce: is familier in the Court, and famous in the towne and countrie? In vvhom may pacient bearing of aduersitie, and constant suffrance of Fortunes threates more duly to the vvorld appere, than in him that hath constantly susteined and quietly passed ouer the bruntes of the same? To vvhom may be giuen a Theatre of the vvorld, and stage of humaine miserie, more vvorthily, than to hym that hath vvhith comely gesture, vvise demeanor, and orderly behauiour, bene an actor in the same? VVho is he that more codignely doth deserue to be possest in a Palace of Pleasure , tha he that is daily resiant in a pallace of renovvmed fame, guided by a Queene adorned vvith most excellent beautie and shape, indevved and garnished vvith great learning, passing vertues and rare qualities of the minde. To vvho (I say) may constancie of Ladyes, and vertuous dedes of Dames, more aptly be applied, than to him that hath in possession a Lady and Coutesse of noble birth (vvhose sire vvas the olde Earle of Bedford, a graue and faithful councelor to her Maiesties most noble Progenitors, and father is the same, in deare estimatio and regard with her highnesse, vnder vvho he trustily and honorably serueth (vvhose curteous and countesse lyke behauior glistereth in the court amogs the troupe of honorable Dames and for her tovvard disposition, first preferred by the Quenes Maiesty, into her secret chaber, and after aduaunced to be Countesle of your noble Earledome. Besides all vvhiche rare giftes, by Nature ingrafted in your honor, and by her bountifully bestovved vpo the same, the perfect pietie and brotherly loue betvvene you and the right noble and vertuous the Earle of Leicester your honorable brother, is had in greatest admiration. VVhose noble courage in dedes of honor and passing humanitie to his inferiours, is very comendable to the vvorlde. But here I vvil stay my selfe, lest vvhilest I go about to extoll your fames, I doe (for wate of skill in due praise) seme to diminish that vvhich amog all men by daily experiece is sufficiently renovvmed. And as your honor doth vvith great prudece gouerne that office of the Ordinance (vvherof I am a meber) eue so, the same hath vvith great care and diligence comended such to the Queenes Maiesty, to ioyne aud serue in the same, as officers right vvorthy their vocations, specially the vvorshipfull Edward Randolse Esquire, Lieutenaut of that office a man for his experiece and good aduise rather fostred in the bosome of Bellona her selfe, than nourced in kentish soile (although in the schole house of curtesie and humanitie he appeareth ful carefuly to haue bene trained vp by his vertuous parets) whiche is familarly knowe vnto me and other that domestically (as it vver) do frequet his copany. But alas my lord, amoges the mid of my reioyce of those before remebred, I can not pretermit the lametable losse of the best approued gonner that euer serued in our time his Prince and countrie, Robert Thomas , the Maister Goner, vvho for skil and seruice both, a title of Prince of Goners iustly did deserue: And see the lucke, vvhe he thought best to signifie his good vvil, to honor Hymeneus bed, at Nuptial night, a clap of yt he neuer feared did end his life Such is the dradfull furie of Goners, art, and hellish rage of Vulganus vvorke. And therfore that daungerous seruice in skilfull me is specially to be recomended and cherished. VVhervnto as your honor hitherto hath borne singuler affection, by preferring to her Maiestie suche as from their infancie haue bene trained vp in that necessarie seruice, and very painfully haue imployed the same, in the time of the Quenes maiestie that novve is, and her progenitours, euen so I humblie besech your honor for cotinuance of the same, speciallie in those, that be indevved vvith greateste experience, in vvhom onely resteth the brunte of our defence. A seruice so commendable and needefull, as none more. But vvhat neede I to prouoke the vvilling mind, vvhose honor is more prest to cherishe such, than I am able by vvishinge heart for to conceiue. Finallie yet once again, I humblie besech your honour gratefullie to accept this booke, and at your Leisure and conuenient time to reade and peruse the same. By reuoluing vvherof your honor I trust shal be delighted vvith the rare Histories and good examples therin contained, such as to my knovvledge hereto fore haue not bene made comon to our countrimen, vvhich vvith al my good vvill and indeuor I duetifully exhibit. Beseching Almightie God fauourably to defend and gouerne your honour, prosperouslie to maintaine and kepe the same, godly to direct my righte honorable Ladie in the steppes of perfect vertue, bountifullie to make you both happie parentes of manie children: and after the expence of Nestors yeares in this transitorie life, mercifull to conduct you to the vnspeakable ioyes of his kingdome. Nere the Tower of Londons the firste of Ianuarie. 1566\. By your L. most bounden VVylliam Painter . NOTHING IN MINE opinion can be more acceptable vn to thee (friendely Reader), thenne oft readinge and dayelye perusing of varietie of Histories, which as they bee for diuersitie of matter pleasaunte and plausible, euen soe for example and imitacion right good and comendable. The one doth reioyce the wearye and tedious minde, manye times inuolued with ordinarie cares, the other prescribeth a directe pathe to treade the trace of this presente life. VVherefore if in these newes or Nouelles here presented, there do appeare anyethinge woorthye of regarde, giue thankes to the noble Gentleman to whom this booke is dedicated, for whose sake onelye, that paine (if any seme to bee) was wholy imployed. Inioy therfore with him this present boke, and curte ously with friedly talke report the same, for if other wise thou doe abuse it, the blame shall light on thee, and not of me, which onelye of good wil did meane it first. But yet if blaming tongues and vnstayed heades, will nedes be busy, they shall sustain the shame, for that they haue not yet shewen forth any blamelesse dede to like effect, as this is ment of me, whiche when they do, no blame but prayse they can receaue. For praise be they well worthy for to haue whiche in well doing doe contende. No vertuous dede, or zelous worke can want due prayse of the honest, though faulting fooles and youthly heades full oft doe chaunt the faultles checke, that Momus mouth did once finde out in Venus slipper. And yet from faultes I will not purge the same, but whatsoeuer they seme to be, they be in number ne yet in substace such, but that thy curte ous dealing may sone amend the or forget the VVherfore to giue thee full aduertisement of the whole collection of these Nouelles, vnder stande that, vi of them haue I selected out of Titus Liuius, two out of Herodotus, certain out of Aelianus, Xenophon, Aulus Gellius, Plutarche, and other like approued authors. Other Nouels haue I adioyned, chosen out of diuers Italian and Frenche wryters, VVherein I confesse my selfe not to be so well trained, peraduenture as the fine heades of suche trauailers would desire. And yet I trust sufficiently to expresse the sense, of euery of the same. Certayne haue I culled of the Decamerone of Giouan Boccaccio, wherein be conteined one hundred Nouelles, amonges whiche there be some (in my iudgement) that be worthy to be condempned to perpetuall prison, but of them suche haue I redemed to the libertie of our vulgar, as may be best liked, and better suffered. Although the sixt part of the same hundreth may full well be permitted. And as I my selfe haue alreadie done many other of the same worke yet for this present I haue thought good to publishe onely tenne in number, the reste I haue referred to them that be able with better stile to expresse the authours eloquence, or vntill I adioyne to this another tome, if none other in the meane time doe pre uent me, whiche with all my heart I wishe and desire: because the whole workes of Boccaccio for his stile, order of writinge, grauitie, and sententious discourse, is worthy of intire provulgation. Out of Bandello I haue selected seuen, chosing rather to followe Launay and Belleforest the Frenche Trauslatours, than the barren soile of his owne vayne, who being a Lombard, doth franckly confesse him selfe to be no fine Florentine, or trymme Thoscane, as eloquent and gentle Boccaccio was. Diuers other also be extracted out of other Italian and Frenche authours. All whiche (I truste) be bothe profitable and pleasaunte, and wil be liked of the indeferent Reader. Profitable they be, in that they disclose what glorie, honour, and preferment ech man attaineth by good desert, what felic itie, by honest attemptes, what good successe, laudable enterprises doe bringe to the coragious, what happye ioye and quiet state godly loue dooth affecte the Imbracers of the same. Profitable I say in that they do reueale the miseries of rapes & fleshly actions, the ouerthrow of noble men & Princes by disordered gouernment,y tragicall endes of theym that vnhappilye doe attempte practises vicious and horrible. VVilte thou learne how to behaue thy selfe with modesty after thou hast atchieued any victorious conquest, and not to forget thy prosperous fortune in the glorious triumphe of the same, by committing a fact vnworthy of thy valiaunce: read the first Nouel of the valiant Romayne Horatius? VVilt thou vnderstand what dishonour and infamie, desire of libidinous lust doth bringe, read the rape of Lucrece. VVilt thou knowe what an vnkinde part it is vnnaturally to abuse the state of thine owne countrie, reade Martius Coriolanus? VVilt thou learne what fruit is reaped of wicked lust, to dispoile virgins and mayd ens of their greatest vertue, se the historye of Appius Claudius and sir Didaco the Spanish knight? Desirest thou to know, how closely thou oughtest to kepe the secretes of honourable mariage, peruse the historie of Candaules? Doost thou couet to be aduertised what is true felicitie, read of king Cr aesus and the wise man Solon? Hath the Ladye, Gentlewoman, or other of the femininekind desire to behold a mirrour of chastitie, let theym read ouer the Nouelles of the Ladye Panthea, of the Duchesse of Sauoye, of the Countesse of Salesburie, of Amadour and Florinda? Is the noble man affected to vnderstande what happye ende, the vertue of Loyaltie and fidelitie doothe conduce, the Earle of Angiers may be to him a right good example? VVill Gentlemen learne howe to prosecute vertue, and to profligat from their mind, disordinate Loue, and affection, I referre theym to the Historie of Tancredi, and to Galgano of Siena? Is not the marchant contented with his goodes already gotten, but wil needes go seeke some other trade. Let hym note and consider the daungers wherein the aduenturer Landulpho was? Is he disposed to sende his factor beyonde the seas, about his affaires, let him firste bidde him to peruse Andreuccio, and then commaund him to beware of Madame Floredelice. If the yeoman inte n deth to be carefull of his businesse, meaning to reapethat he hath sowen in due time, let him take hede how he repose any trust in friends and kinsemen, least in Haruest he be deceyued, which Aesops Larke dooth pretely note If the Artificer wil not faithfully deale accordynge to the truste reposed in him, I would not wishe hym to suffer that which Bindo did, but aduisedlye to reade the Historie, and trustelye to accomplishe that hee taketh in hand. If scornful speach or floutinge sport do flow in ripe wittes and lauish tongues of womankind, lette them beware they do not deale with learned sort, least Maister Alberto with Phisicke drougues or Philinio with Sephest art do staine their face, or otherwise offende them with the innocencie of their great Graundmother Eue when she was somoned from Paradise ioy. If the poore mayden of base birth be aduaunced (by fortunes grace) to high estate:let her fixe in mind the L ady of Thurin. Finallye, for al states and degres, in these Nouelles be set forthe singuler documents and examples, right commodious and profitable to them that wil vouchsafe to read them. Pleasaunt they be for that they recreate, and refresh weried mindes, defatigated eyther with paynful trauaile, or with continual care, occasioning them to shunne and auoid heauinesse of mind, vaine fantasies and idle cogitacions. Pleasaunt so wel abrode as at home, to auoyde the griefe of VVinters night and length of Sommers day, which the trauailers on fote may vse for a staye to ease their wearied body, and the Iourneors on hers backe, for a chariot or easier meane of Trauaile instead of a merie companion to shorten the tedious toile of weary wayes. Delectable they be (no doubt) for alsorts of men, for the sad, the angry, the cholorike, the pleasaunt, the hole and sick, and for al other with what soeuer passion rising eyther by nature or vse they be affected. The sad shalbe discharged of heauinesse, the angre and cholerike purged, the pleasaunte maintayned in mirthe, the whole furnished with disporte, and the sicke appaised of griefe. These Nouelles then, being profitable and pleasaunt histories, apt and meete for all degrees, I trust the indifferente Reader, of what complection, nature and disposition so euer he be, wil accept them in good part, although perchaunce not so set forth or decked with fine and eloquent stile, as this age more braue in tongue then maners doth require, and do pray thee to receyue them into thy curteous hands, with no lesse good wil, (though not with like regard) then Alphonsus king of Arogon did Q. Curtious, out of whom be som of these selected. VVho vppon a time being sicke at Capua receauing at the hands of diuers Phisitions manye medicines, in his greatest fit called for the histories of Quintus Curtius, In whom hauing great delight for his eloquent description of the gestes and factes of King Alexander, when he was restored to health, sayd. Farewel Auicen, Adieu Hipocrates and other Phisitians, welcome Curtius the restitutor, and recouerie of my health. VVherby he declared what pleasure he had in the exercise and reading of Histories, not contepning for all that, the honorable science of Phisicke, which in extremities be hole somly vsed. VVhat commoditie and pleasure histories doe yeld to the diligent serchers and trauallers in the same. Tullie in his fift booke . De finibus bonorum et malorum ad Brutum dothe declare, who affirmeth that he is not ignorant what pleasure and profit the readinge of Histories dothe import. And after he hath described what difference of commoditie, is betwene fained fables, & liuely discourses of true histories, concludeth reading of histories to be a certaine prouocation and alluremente to moue men to learne experience: If Tullie then the prince of Orators, doth affirme profite and pleasure to be in perusing of histories, then fitly haue I intituled this volume with the Pallace of Pleasure. For like as the outward shew of Princesse Palaces be pleasaut at the viewe and sight of ech mannes eye, bee decked and garnished with sumptuous hanginges and costlie Arras of splendent shew, wherein be wrought and bet with gold & silke of sundry hewes, the dedes of noble states: Euen so in this our Pallace here, there bee at large recorded the Princely partes and glorious gestes of renowmed wights represented with more liue ly grace and gorgeous sight, then I apestrie or Arras worke; for that the one with deadly shape dothe shew, the other with speaking voice declare what in their time they were. Vpon whom do waite (as meete it is) inferior persons, eche one vouch safinge to tell what he was, in the transitorie trade of present life. VVherfore accepte the same in gratefull wise, and thinke vpon the mind of him that did the same, which fraughted is with no lesse plenty of good will, thenne the coafers of king Croesus were, with store of worldlye pelfe . And so farevvell. Quenes Maiesties Armarie. Everie Science hauing hys peculiar comoditic, and conducing to the trauailer and diligent searcher, a duc deserued benefite (bysides the exercise and shunning the pestilent monster Idlenesse) discloseth the mirachlous effect of the Diuinitie and the excellencie of his Creature: Who breathing life into that sencelesse work, framed within the mould of humane Conception, forceth in him by Nature and timely institution, such capacitie of Science, as not only by that knowledge he glorifieth his Creator, but also besides himselfe, helpeth and dothe good to other. For prose whereof, the Science of that surpassing and delight some pasture of  Theologie, is profitable to teach, argue, reproue, and instruct, that by paciece and consolatio, we may conceue hope of Eternitie. The knowledge of Philosophie cureth the minde, auoideth childish care, expelleth feare, and shunneth fonde desires. O Philosophie, the guide of life (exclameth Tullie) the inquisitor of Vertue, and expeller of vice . Rhetorike ( affirmeth he) causeth vs to learne that we knowe not, and that we know, to teach to other: By the same we exhort, with that we persuade, with that we cofort the afflicted, by it we incourage the astonned, and appease the outragious . Musike easeth the troubled mind, lenifieth sorowe, comforteth the heauie hearted, and erecteth a contemplation of heauenly things . Astronomie reuealeth the nature of the Starres and Planets, presageth dayes and times for the helpe and maintenance of life . Poesie teacheth amendement of manners, directeth what things be mete for imitation, and with what detriment wantonnesse anoyeth the bodie of man. By meanes of it (Saint Augustine saith) he learned many good lessons to p[illeg.]site himselfe, and doe good to other. To be short, euery scu[illeg.] so necessarie, as the same taken away, Reason is deprmed, and the Life of man, of due order and gouernement defia[illeg.] Thinke(sayth a Greke Orator) the knowledge of many t[illeg.] to be more precious and excellent, than a chest heaped vp with abundance of money: for the one quickly faileth, and the other for euer lasteth. For , Scientia ( affirmeth he) is the onely Immortall storehouse of all possessions: Amongs which troupe of Sciences the knowledge and searche of Historie deserueth a place in the chiefest ranke, and is for example of humane affaires, a Christall light to shew the pathes of our Ancestours The same displayeth the counsels, aduises, policies, acts, [illeg.] and ends of Kings, Princes, and great men, with the order and description of time and place, And like a liuely image representeth before our eyes the beginning, ende and circumstaunce of eche attempt. The same (like a Mistresse of our life) by probable examples, stirreth vp our sluggishe mindes, to aspire the eternall glorie of praise and fame, and terrifieth the desperate and adueturous, from enterprise of things vnsemely. The same is a passing picture of Veritie, and an absolute Patern, framing the matter, greater nor lesse than it is. And bicause I am not ignorant what Encomia innumerable Authors in time paste, and writers of cure time doe attribute vnto that Science, and with what titles the Prince of them all decketh the praise of Historicall knowledge, I onely referre the worthinesse, to the practisers, and the singularitie of Histories trauell and delight, to eche willing mind that imploy their leysure and time therin. And I for my part do confesse (that by reading of Histories) I find the saying which Tullie aduoucheth of Publius Scipio to be true: That he was neuer lesie idle, than when he was idle, and neuer lesse alone than when he was alone: Meaning thereby, that when he was at beste leisure, he was neuer idle, nor when he was alone, vnoccupied. For when Labour resteth him selfe in me, and Leisure refresheth other affaires, nothing delights more that vacant time, than reading of Histories in such vulgar speche, wherein my small knowledge taketh repast. And for that my priuate reding might not delight and pleasure me alone, to auoide the nature of that cancred chorle ana[illeg.]foe of humane companie , Timon of Athenes, that liued but for him self, I haue (after my skill) culled some floures and frutes from that pleasant store of those my readings to impart for vniuersall gaine and benefite, choosing rather hereby to follow the liberalitie of Cimon a Gentlemen of that Citie, who knowing himselfe to be borne to prosite other, and for the enriching of his countrey, not only atchieued marueious matters for furtherace of Comon wealth, but left his Gardens and Orchardes open for all men to participate the fruits of his pleasure and trauell. Wherby (so well as I can) I follow the tracte and practise of other, by whose meanes, so manifold sciences in our knowne tongue, and translation of Histories bee frequent and rife amongs vs. All which be done for our commoditie, pleasure, solace, preseruation and comfort, and without the which we can not be long sustained in this miserable life, but shall become not muche vnlike the barbarous, ne discrepant from the sauage sort. The inuestigatours and bringers to light wherof, direct their eyes and mening to none other end, but for the benefite of vs and our posteritie, and that our faces be not tainted with the blushing color, to see the passing diligence of other Coutreys, by curious imbelishing of their states, with the troublous trauaile of their brain, and laborsome course of penne, Who altogether imploye those paines, that no Science lurke in corner, that no Knowledge be shut vp in cloisters, that no Historie remain vnder the maske and vnknowne attire of other tongues. Amogs which crew (I say) I craue an inferior place, and haue vndertaken the vnfolding of sundry Histories, from the couerture of foren language, for none other purpose and intent but to vniuer sall benefite. Parte wherof, two yeares past (almost) wer made commune in a former boke, now succedeth a seconde, furnished with like ornaments that the other was. The first (by dueties chalenge) was addressed to the right honorable the Erle of Warwike, for respect of his honor, and my calling. This the second, by like band, your worship may iustly clame as a iust tribute, nowe this moneth of Nouembre, payable. Or if your Curtesie woulde not deale so roughly with your bounden creditour, yet for dutie sake I must acquite and content that which hath so long ben due. The same I offre now, not with such vsurie and gaine as your beneuolence and singular bountie, by long forbearing hath deserued, but with sache affected will and desire of recompence, as any man aliue can owe to so rare a friend. Your worship I haue chosen for the first person of this boke, and the protectour of the same (the matter most specially therin comprised, treting of courtly fashions and maners, and of the customes of loues galantise, and the good or yll successe thereof) bicause you be an auncient Courtier, and one of the eldest Traine, and suche as hath ben imployed by sundrie our Princes, in their affaires of greatest weight and importance: and for that yourself in your lustiest time, (euer bred and brought vp in Court) haue not bene vnacquainted with those occurrents. If I should stande particularly to touch the originall of your noble Ancestrie, the succession of that renoumed line, their fidelitie for graue aduise and counsell, your honourable education, the mariage of a mighty King with one of your sisters, the valiant exploites of your parentes against the French and Scots, the worthie seruice of your seif in field, whereby you deseruedly wanne the order of Knight hode, the trust which hir Maiestie reposeth in you, by disposing vnder your charge the Store of hir Armure, and your worthie preferment to be Maister of hir Armarie generall. If I shoulde make recitall of your carefull industrie and painfull trauell, sustained for answering hir Maiesties expectation, your noble cherishing of the skilfull in that Science, your good aduauncement of the best, to supplie the vacant romes, your refusall of the vnworthie: and finally of your modest and curteous dealings in that office, I feare lacke of abilitie (and not of matter) would want grace and order by further circumstaunce, to adde sufficient praise: Yea although my self do say nothing (but reserue the same in silence to auoide suspect of adulation) the very Armure and their furnitures do speake, vniuersall testimonie doth wonder, and the Readinesse of the same for tyme of seruice doth aduouche. Which care of things continually resting in your breast, hath atchieued suche a timely diligence and successe, as when hir Maiesties aduersarie shall be ready to molest, she shal be prest (by Gods assistance) to defend and marche. But not to hold your worship long by length of preamble, or to discourse what I might further say, eyther in fauour of this Boke, or commendation of your selfe, I meane (for this instant) to leaue the one to general indgement, and the other to the particular sentence of eche of your acquaintaunce. Humbly making this only sute, that my good will may supplie the imperfection of mine abilitie. And so with my heartie prayer for your preseruation, to him that is the Author of life and health. I take my leaue. From my poore house besides the Toure of London, the fourthe of Nouember 1567. Your moste bounden William Painter. forceth mutual merit, So for gentle acceptation of my other boke, I render to thy delight and profit a Second Tome. For which I craue but like report: albeit neither worthy of any: or other, than the rude Artificer gayneth by trial of his arte. Who hauing committed to his skill and workemanship, some substance of golde or other precious mater, fashioneth the same with such bungled shape and order, as (besides dispraise) it carieth the vnablenesle of the workman. Howsoeuer (then) the ablenesse or perfection hereof vniuersally shall content or particularly displease: the Boke craueth milde construction, for imployed paines And yet the same (liking or lothing the licorous diet and curious expectation of some) shall beare regarde with those, that more delight in holsome viandes (voide of varietie) than in the confused mixture of foren drugges fetched farre of. Who no dout will supply with fauorable brute, default of ablenesse, and riper skill in the mysteries of forren speche. Which is the guerdon (besides publique benefit) after which I gaze, and the best stipende that eche well willing mynde (as I suppose) aspireth for their trauell. And briefly to touche what comoditie thou shalt reape of these succeding Histories, I deme it not vnapt for thine instruction, to vnfolde what pithe and substance, resteth vnder the context of their discourse. In the Nouell of the Amazones, is displaied a strange and miraculous porte (to our present skill) of womens gouerment, what states they subdued, what increase of kingdome, what combats and conflicts they durst attempt contrarie to the nature of that sexe. In Alexandre the great, what ought to be the gratitude and curtesie in a puislant Prince, toward his slaue and captiue, and to what perilous plundge he slippeth by exchange of vice for vertue. In Timoclia and Theoxena the stoutnesse of two noble Dames to auoide the beastly lust and raging furie of Tyrants. ought not to contend with his soueraine in maters of curtesie, at length also the condition of Courting flaterers: and the poyson of the Monster Enuie. vvhereunto Tyrants do atteine, and how that vice plageth their posteritie. The two Romane Queenes do point (as it were) with their fingers, the natures of Ambition and Crueltie, and the gredy lust (hidden in that feble sexe) of soueraintie. that licorous sappe to inuenim the harts of valiant gentlemen. The Gentlewoman of HYDRVSA the sicklenesse of Fortune. The Empresse FAVSTINA and the Countesse of Celant, what blossoms blome of whorish life and what fruites thereof be culled. The Letters of the Emperor TRAIANE , do paint a right shape of vertue a good state of gouernment, and the comely forme of obedience. Three Amorous Dames reueale the sleightes of loue, the redinesse of Nobles to be baited with that amorous hooke, and what desine such infamous Strumpets haue, to be honored. Queene ZENOBIA , what the noble Gentlewomen, (whom the fates ordaine to rule) ought to do, how farre their magnanimitie ought to stretch, and in what boundes to conteine their soueraintie.
