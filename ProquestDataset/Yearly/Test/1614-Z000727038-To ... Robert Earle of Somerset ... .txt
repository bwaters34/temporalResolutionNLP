 He sits and laughs, to see the iaded Rabble, Toile to his hard heights, t'all accesse vnable. &c.

In one , Predominant Perturbation; in the other , ouer-ruling Wisedome: in one, the Bodies feruour and fashion of outward Fortitude, to all possible height of Heroicall Action; in the other, the Minds inward, constant, and vnconquerd Empire; vnbroken, vnalterd, with any most insolent, and tyrannous infliction. To many most soueraigne praises is this Poeme entitled; but to that Grace in chiefe, which sets on the Crowne, both of Poets and Orators; ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ; ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  : that is , Parua magn e dicere; peruulgata noue; ieiuna plene: To speake things litle, greatly; things commune, rarely; things barren and emptie, fruitfully and fully. The returne of a man into his Countrie, is his whole scope and obiect; which, in it selfe, your Lordship may well say, is ieiune and fruitlesse enough; affoording nothing feastfull, nothing magnificent. And yet euen this, doth the diuine inspiration, render vast, illustrous, and of miraculous composure. And for this (my Lord) is this Poeme preferred to his Iliads: for therein much magnificence, both of person and action, giues great aide to his industrie; but in this, are these helpes, exceeding sparing, or nothing; and yet is the Structure so elaborate, and pompous, that the poore plaine Groundworke (considered together) may seeme the naturally rich wombe to it, and produce it needfully. Much wonderd at therefore, is the Censure of Dionysius Longimus ( a man otherwise affirmed, graue, and of elegant iudgement) comparing Homer in his Iliads, to the Sunne rising; in his Odysses, to his descent or setting. Or to the Ocean robd of his aesture; many tributorie flouds and riuers of excellent ornament, withheld from their obseruance. When this his worke so farre exceeds the Ocean, with all his Court and concourse; that all his Sea, is onely a seruiceable streame to it. Nor can it be compared to any One power to be named in nature; being an entirely wel-sorted and digested Confluence of all. Where the most solide and graue, is made as nimble and fluent, as the most airie and firie; the nimble and fluent, as firme and well bounded as the most graue and solid. And (taking all together) of so tender impression, and of such Command to the voice of the Muse; that they knocke heauen with her breath, and discouer their foundations as low as hell. Nor is this all-comprising Poesie, phantastique, or meere fictiue; but the most material, and doctrinall illations of Truth; both for all manly information of Manners in the yong; all prescription of Iustice, and euen Christian pietie, in the most graue and high-gouernd. To illustrate both which, in both kinds, with all height of expression, the Poet creates both a Bodie and a Soule in them. Wherein, if the Bodie (being the letter, or historie) seemes fictiue, and beyond Possibilitie to bring into Act: the sence then and Allegorie (which is the Soule) is to be sought: which intends a more eminent expressure of Vertue, for her louelinesse; and of Vice for her vglinesse, in their seuerall effects; going beyond the life, then any Art within life, can possibly delineate. Why then is Fiction, to this end, so hatefull to our true Ignorants? Or why should a poore Chronicler of a Lord Maiors naked Truth, ( that peraduenture will last his yeare) include more worth with our moderne wizerds, then Homer for his naked Vlysses, clad in eternall Fiction? But this Prozer Dionysius, and the rest of these graue, and reputatiuely learned, (that dare vndertake for their grauities, the headstrong censure of all things; and challenge the vnderstanding of these Toyes in their childhoods: when euen these childish vanities, retaine deepe and most necessarie learning enough in them, to make them children in their ages, and teach them while they liue) are not in these absolutely diuine Infusions, allowd either voice or relish: for , Qui Poeticas ad fores accedit,  &c. ( sayes the Diuine Philosopher) he that knocks at the Gates of the Muses; sine Musarum furore: is neither to be admitted entrie, nor a touch at their Thresholds: his opinion of entrie, ridiculous, and his presumption impious. Nor must Poets themselues (might I a litle insist on these contempts, not tempting too farre your Lordships Vlyssean patience) presume to these doores, without the truly genuine, and peculiar induction There being in Poesie a twofold rapture, (or alienation of soule, as the abouesaid Teacher termes it) one Insania, a disease of the mind, and a meere madnesse, by which the infected is thrust beneath all the degrees of humanitie: & ex homine, Brutum quodammodo redditur: ( for which, poore Poesie, in this diseasd and impostorous age, is so barbarously vilified) the other is , Diuinus furor; by which the sound and diuinely healthfull , supra hominis naturam erigitur,  & in Deum transit. One a perfection directly infused from God: the other an infection, obliquely and degenerately proceeding from man. Of the diuine Furie ( my Lord) your Homer hath euer bene, both first and last Instance; being pronounced absolutely, ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  ; the most wise and most diuine Poet. Against whom, whosoeuer shall open his prophane mouth, may worthily receiue answer, with this of his diuine defender ; (Empedocles, Heraclitus, Protagoras, Epichar:  &c. being of Homers part ) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  & c. who against such an Armie, and the Generall Homer dares attempt the assault, but he must be reputed ridiculous? And yet against this hoast, and this inuincible Commander, shall we haue euery Besogne and foole a Leader. The common herd (I assure my self) readie to receiue it on their hornes. Their infected Leaders , Such men, as sideling ride the ambling Muse; Whose saddle is as frequent as the stuse. Whose Raptures are in euery Pageant seene; In euery Wassall rime, and Dancing greene: When he that writes by any beame of Truth, Must diue as deepe as he; past shallow youth. Truth dwels in Gulphs, whose Deepes hide shades so rich, That Night sits muffl'd there, in clouds of pitch: More Darke then Nature made her; and requires (To cleare her tough mists) Heauens great fire of fires; To whom, the Sunne it selfe is but a Beame. For sicke soules then (but rapt in foolish Dreame) To wrestle with these Heau'n-strong mysteries; What madnesse is it? when their light, serues eies That are not worldly, in their least aspect; But truly pure; and aime at Heauen, direct. Yet these, none like; but what the brazen head Blatters abroad; no sooner borne, but dead. Holding then in eternal contempt (my Lord) those short-liued Bubbles; eternize your vertue and iudgement with the Grecian Monark; esteeming, not as the least of your New-years Presents , Homer (three thousand yeares dead) now reuiu'd, Euen from that dull Death, that in life he liu'd; When none conceited him; none vnderstood, That so much life, in so much death as blood Conueys about it, could mixe. But when Death Drunke vp the bloudie Mist, that humane breath Pour'd round about him (Pouertie and Spight, Thickning the haplesse vapor) then Truths light Glimmerd about his Poeme: the pincht soule, (Amidst the Mysteries it did enroule) Brake powrefully abroad. And as we see The Sunne all hid in clouds, at length got free, Through some forc't couert, ouer all the wayes, Neare and beneath him, shootes his vented rayes Farre off, and stickes them in some litle Glade; All woods, fields, riuers, left besides in shade: So your Apollo , from that world of light, Closde in his Poems bodie; shot to sight Some few forc't Beames; which neare him, were not seene, (As in his life or countrie) Fate and Spleene, Clouding their radiance; which when Death had clear'd; To farre off Regions, his free beames appear'd: In which, all stood and wonderd; striuing which, His Birth and Rapture, should in right enrich. Twelue Labours of your Thespian Hercules, I now present your Lordship: Do but please To lend Life meanes, till th'other Twelue receaue Equall atchieuement; and let Death then reaue My life now lost in our Patrician Loues, That knocke heads with the herd: in whom there moues One blood, one soule: both drownd in one set height Of stupid Enuie, and meere popular Spight. Whose loues, with no good, did my least veine fill; And from their hates, I feare as little ill. Their Bounties nourish not, when most they feed, But where there is no Merit, or no Need: Raine into riuers still; and are such showres, As bubbles spring, and ouerflow the flowers. Their worse parts, and worst men, their Best subornes, Like winter Cowes, whose milke runnes to their hornes. And as litigious Clients bookes of Law, Cost infinitely; taste of all the Awe, Bencht in our kingdomes Policie, Pietie, State; Earne all their deepe explorings; satiate All sorts there thrust together by the heart, With thirst of wisedome, spent on either part: Horrid examples made of Life and Death, From their fine stuffe wouen: yet when once the breath Of sentence leaues them, all their worth is drawne As drie as dust; and weares like Cobweb Lawne: So these men set a price vpon their worth, That no man giues, but those that trot it forth, Through Needs foule wayes; feed Humors , with all cost, Though Iudgement sterues in them: Rout: State engrost (At all Tabacco benches, solemne Tables, Where all that crosse their Enuies, are their fables) In their ranke faction: Shame, and Death approu'd Fit Penance for their Opposites: none lou'd But those that rub them: not a Reason heard, That doth not sooth and glorifie their preferd Bitter Opinions. When, would Truth resume The cause to his hands; all would flie in fume Before his sentence; since the innocent mind, Iust God makes good; to whom their worst is wind. For, that I freely all my Thoughts expresse, My Conscience is my Thousand witnesses: And to this stay, my constant Comforts vow; You for the world I haue, or God for you.
