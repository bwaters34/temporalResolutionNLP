 But there is no need to have either; and no age need be afraid of it, if superstition will let us alone. We now come to the last, and not the most pleasant part of our task, Mr. more or less however be inevitably handled when a name is left to posterity; and it may not be amiss, if those who begin with being the most explicit about it, should be found also not the most wanting in charity. When we speak of a part of Mr. Sheridan's character, we mean to let it be understood that we only know what has been long known to the public; and we would infer also, that what has not been known, has been very likely not obnoxious to censure. It says a great deal for him, that his Wife and Son were so unremitting in their attentions during his last days, and that he took so much pleasure in the consciousness of it. But Mr. Sheridan was notoriously careless of his finances, and fond of his bottle; and these two vices, it is said, were the ruin of him. We believe they were. Mr. Sheridan also was notoricusly consistent and liberal in his politics, and has produced some delightful dramas; and for these two features in his repulation, we have to be thankful to him. Providence has weighed the evil with the good. Let it be our parts to weigh the evil with the causes of it, and the objection with the gratitude. And here we must pay attention to a new species of liberality that has started up in the superabundant crop of excellent things which this age has produced, and warn the dealers in people's characters that in professing charity for the faults of Mr. Sheridan , we really are not asking it for similar ones of our own. We wish these gentlemen and ladies, in the intervals of their tea, could by any process be persuaded, that it is possible to be a little charitable without being iniquitous. Let the person that condemns Mr. Sheridan ,---we mean, uncharitably and with little knowledge of human nature,---look at the early circumstances of his life. He came, in the first place, of an improvident stock; and though we do not mean to blame his father, who we believe was rather negatively than positively careless, and who came of the same stock himself, yet these things have their effect. In many instances indeed, the parent, by his selfish avoidance of trouble in forming proper habits, is altogether to blame, if any one is; and doubly so, because the mischief is all his, and the odium his offspring's. We repeat that we do not mean to apply this censure to Mr. defaulter this way; and in him the vice is probably traceable to causes which have stamped so much of the careless desperation of poverty on the Irish in general. But this was certainly part of a character that had otherwise many excellent points about it. Swift , in one of his copies of verses to him, says--- "Friend Sheridan , when will you know your own good?" In the next place, Mr. Sheridan was sent with an hereditary carelessness and little means to a great school, containing the sons of many rich people; and this we hold, under such circumstances, to be very dangerous. He was then launched upon the town, with a disposition rather to enjoy a fortune than to make one,---which latter propensity, by the way, is the actual enjoyment of many a person who values himself on his self-demals;---a remark that may serve for a world of similar want of self-knowledge. He here was led by the turn of his genius into the most dangerous society such a temper could meet with. From this he got among the politicians, and clubs, and wits about town, the drinkers and sitters-up at night; and here, delighting every body with his talent, repaid with unlucky usury by their wine, and feeling at graver times those exhausted calls for refreshment which the over-exercise of the intellectual faculty occasions, to an extent that can be appreciated only by its fellow-labourers, he wanted the admonitions of solitude, the counteraction of early and better tastes, and the more fortunate pressure of imperious necessity, and became habitually lax, discomposed, self-indulgent, self-reproaching, disreputable. That the case was so, is a melancholy truth, which those who can turn it to advantage for the happiness of themselves or others are unquestionably at liberty so to use. Let it be done properly, and nobody will be to blame. The wit will try to take care of his hours and habits;---the philosopher will speculate upon the evils to which we are subjected in a world nevertheless full of beauties and delight, and seemingly interwoven with them; ---the gentle will regret,---the humble be self-doubting,--- the generous find out what to admire:---the ignorant and uncharitable alone will be contemptuous, and retire to their respective stupidities. And here, before we finish, we cannot but allude to the circumstance hinted at in a former paper; and ask those who talk of Mr. Sheridan's incorrigible habits, in answer to that hint, what their observations have to do with his death-bed, and the persons who never came near it? For this is the only complaint made by observers; and they only were the complainers. Mr. it. It is very probable, that twenty Receiverships would not have benefited him, any more than twenty Lordships and Dukeships would benefit some of his old acquaintance; but what then? Were they of all the exemplary person breathing to desert him on his death-bed? to send wretched messages from the midst of their pleasures; and not have a hand to extend, a last look to give, to the man that had been the sole ornament of their lives, as well as unceasing advocate of their interests? We may here be reminded of moral lessons again, and also of our charity;--- and so be it. The instance, we confess, is striking. But then let truth, if it must be broadly spoken, be spoken of the prosperous as well as the unfortunate; and let us own, that if ever our charity is put to a severe test, it is in favour of those who seem heartless to friendship. To sum up the character of Mr. Sheridan ,---he was a man of wit, a lively and elegant dramatist, a winning and powerful orator, a sound politician, a lover of real freedom, a careless liver; an Irishman, in short, with much of the worst, and more of the best, of his naturally lighthearted but unfortunate countrymen. His worst can affect but few;---his best will redound to the good of his country, and be the delight of thousands to come.
