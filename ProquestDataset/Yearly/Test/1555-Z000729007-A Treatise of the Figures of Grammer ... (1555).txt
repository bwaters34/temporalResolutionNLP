 compound, or ioyned together in speach, according to this we say, that euery eloquent oratio must haue in it. iii. pointes euidence, which belongeth to the fyrste part of eloquution, composition, & dignitie, which belongeth to the other. Of these thinges that we put in eloquutio, let this be ye first care, to speake euidently after the dignitie and nature of the matter: & to vtter suche wordes, whiche as Cicero sayth in his oratour, no man may iustly reprehed. The plain & euident speache is learned of Grammarians, and it kepeth the oratio pure, and without al fault: and maketh that euery thyng may seme to be spoke, purely, apertly, & clerely. Euery speach stadeth by vsual wordes, that be in vse of daily talke, and proper wordes that belong to the thing, of whiche we shall speake neither bee properties to be referred only to the name of the thyng, but much more to the strength & power of the siguification: and must be considred not by hearing, but by vnderstandyng. So translatio in the which comoly is the greatest vse of eloquution, applieth woordes, not to the selfe proper thynges. But yet an vnused woorde, or poeticall, hath also sometyme in the oration his dignitie & being put in place, (as Cicero sayth) ofte times may seme greater, & of more antiquitie. For that Poetes doe speake in maner as it were in an other tongue, it is right sone perceiued. Finally two fautes are committed in euery language, wherby it is not pure, Barbarisme and Solecisme. Of the which that one is committed, when any worde is fautily spoken or writer, that other, whe in many wordes ioyned together, the woorde that followeth is not well applied to that that goeth before. Euery good and eloquent oratio must haue three principall vertues: that it be pure, playn, and garnished. To these are there as many contrary vices. Barbarous, dark, and vngarnished. Of which three generall vices, there bee gathered certayne kyndes, whereof exaumples shall folow. Barbarous is a fault, when a certein vnputenes is brought into the speche, and it hath three kindes. Barbarisme. --- Barbaralexis, Solecisme. Barbarisme the fyrste fault of Eloquution, is an errour in true writyng, and true accenting. We misse in true writing, when in any word a letter or sillable is put too, taken away, chaunged, or transposed. Examples we will shewe afterwardes whe we speake of ye figures of Gramer. The fault in accenting is, when contrarye to the ryght pronunciation of woordes, we put downe that syllable which should be lift vp: or contrary lift vp, which should be put down. And that we should not so do, the Grammarians haue made good prouision, which to euery syllable haue assigued their accet, wherby it is eyther lift vp, put downe, or strayned: calling the first an accente acute, the seconde graue, the thyrde circumflecte. Barbaralexis, when a rude worde or of a straunge tong is brought into the Romain tonge. In the English speache there be so many, that some thinke we speake litle English or none at al. Solecisme, this fault pertayneth to ye figures of construction and is defined afore in the begynnyng. Contrary to barbarous is pure latin, which standeth by rule, authoritie, & custome. For to speake latin is no lawe, but an obseruacion of excellent menue, whose iudgement standeth for reason. Obscuritie is, when through the fault of wordes, or of settyng them together, a certayn darkenes is brought in, and hath these kyndes. Impropertie, whe a worde is brought into the talke hauing nothyng at al his owne proper signification: as when we say, you shall haue sixe stripes whiche you long for: when thei long for the not one whit. Ambiguitie, is of one word or of moe, as, I say the Eacida the Romains may ouercome. Were through the faulte of composicio, it is in doubt to whom the victorie is promised. An intricate construction, or lenger than should bee. Suche as oftentymes happeth to them that fondly labour to tell a good rounde tale. Eclipsis is, when there lacketh a necessary word in the setence, so that it is not ful and perfecte. Many of these are in Ciceros Epistles written to Atticus when Brachylogia, when of a graue matter we speake too briefly, and that it required a larger, & more mete treatise. It is also a vertue in speache, when we comprehend many thynges in fewe wordes. Contrary to obscuritie, is playnesse, standyng in proprietie, sense, and composition, as Fabius dooeth shewe in hys eyght booke. Ungarnished is, when eyther there lacketh order, or beautifying in the wordes. The kindes be these. Pleonasmus, the putting too of a superfluous worde, to a ful signification: as. So she spake with her mouth. Somtyme it is vsed for asseueracion, as I sawe it with these eyes of myne: denye it not. Perittologia, a superfluous addyng of woordes, without any pythe of matter. It is like faulte to Pleonasmus, saue that the one standeth in sense, the other is seen in wordes, Seneca, Montanus hath this fault, that he marreth all by to much repetyng of sentences, & while he is not content to haue spoken a thing once, he maketh all nought. when with great yrcksomnes we double the matter, whiche commonly they are wont to doe that bee not exercised, but therefore sing all one song. Periergia, when in a small matter we spend many wordes, & labour much in vain, and tarry to long in it. Which thing happeth to them yt lewdly seke for copie. Fabius calleth it, vayne curiositae. Contrary to this, is Expolicion, which is a vertue, whe in dede we stad in one thing and sentence, turnyng the same diuers waies. Macrologia, when eyther the whole oration, or some sentence thereof, is lenger then it should be, and weryeth the hearer. Fabius taketh this example out of Liuie, in the eyght booke. The Legates (peace not beyng obtayned) did returne home agayne from whence thei came, Terence. This is my reason, and thus I thinke in my minde. There bee that call it Macrologia, when the oration is to trimme, & set out at legth with some godly descriptio. Me thinke it is much like Periergia. Periphrasis which draweth nye to this, is counted a vertue. Tapinosis, when a weightie & high matter is brought downe by basenes of a worde: as if you would say to a king. And it please your Mastership. matters, are set out with gaye and blasing wordes. Suche as in Commedies are wont to be spoken, of stakyng souldiers, & smell feastes. Asiatismus, a hynde of endighting vsed of the Asians, full of figures, and wordes, lackyng matter. Aischrologia, when through the fault of ioynyng wordes together, some vncleanly meaning may be gathered. Lacemphaton, when letters & syllables hang euil fauouredly together: as if there be to many of this letter, r, or of t, which causeth a roughnes, or stammering. Cacozelia, a peuishe desyree to folowe suche a kynde of wrytyng as thou arte not mete for: defacyng the thyng which thou wouldest faynest beautifie. Aschematon, whe in the oratio there is no varietie, nor pleasauntnes, but it is all alike, and by no varietie taketh away tediousnes, a fault lyke to that ye goeth before, and contrary to thys that foloweth. ![](/images/inline/Rgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  When in the oratio ther is nothing rightly and properly spoke, but all is to muche befigured and be gayed. Such is the writing of Apuleius ![](/images/inline/Ggk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif)  A foolishe mingling together of wordes out of diuers languages. Also if a man in prose would vse figures poeticall. ![](/images/inline/rbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  A kind of endighting drawe out a long, vtterlye voyde of all swete and rounde composicion. Cacosyntheton, when the wordes be euil heaped together, and be worde ioyned: beyng good if thei wer set in place. ![](/images/inline/sbagr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  A faulte somewhat lyke the other: when there is no good disposicion of the woordes, but all are confused vp and down, and set without order. The like vnto these figures gentel reader, vndoubtedly be foud in oure Poetes, where for the metre sake, they oftentymes bee fayne, to adde, to chaunge, to dyminyshe Letters, and Syllables, woorde: as Chaucer sometyme calleth hym nerown, whose name in dede is Nero: and that to make the Meter agree with the staffe that went before, & so addeth a syllable in the latter end of the woorde, as dooe the Latines, whan they saye Dicier for dici . And as here is added somewhat to the ende: so in thys verse, In wintars iuste returne whan Boreas gan his raygne: is taken awaye asyllable from the begynnyng, (gan) beyng put for began: but so yf she should haue sayde, than had the verse been to long by a syllable, although in deede the worde shoulde so haue been truelye written. Nowe because I am not well seen in Englishe Meters my self, therfore I coulde not, I confesse, wel exemplifye in Englishe all these foresayde figures in Latin. Uirgil sayde well. Non omnia possumus omnes . Who so can do it, is worthy prayse, and worthy more praise yf he wyll doe it. But to say some what of these figures: whosoeuer thynketh them lyghtly to be passed ouer, iudgeth ouer lightly. For truly it is not inough in expouding Latin Poetes, to say, here figure: except he tell him also it is a faulte. But because of the metre, in stede of fault it is called a figure. And the like is not to be vsed in prose, whan there is no necessitie why we shoulde not bothe write out the worde at legth and also pronounce it as it is wrytten. Who will saye, and say truely, porge dextram , for, porrige dexteram : and yet so sayeth Uirgill before alleged, in the figure Sincope . And so of the reste. Thus muche I thinke sufficiet to haue noted touching this matter. Apposition is an immediate ioyning together of two nownes substantiues or moe, the one declaring the other. As, The floude Temmes floweth into the Sea. the other to be put in wordes, wha they are ioyned together, which in Greke is called construction. That is, a maner and way to set them together after the rules of the Arte, that of them maye be made a perferte and full oration. Of whiche the Grammarians have geuen many preceptes. The faulte thereof in a generall woorde is called Incongruite . But because this is openlye vsed of excellet authours, not at al aduetures, but for certayn causes, in stede of fault it is called a figure. So then the figure of Construction is, when we somewhat turne away fro the common and vulgare maner of speaking, because of briefnes or some comoditie. The kindes be these. Eclypsis, when to the iuste Construction a necessarye woorde lacketh, whiche yet is wont to be vnderstande eyther by the custome of authours, or because it is certayne by other wordes that go before: as. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 In all whiche must be vnderstand the wordes put in the margent. Aposropesis is, when any thing lacketh to the perfectues of speache, eyther for some affection, or for passing to an other thing, yt standeth vs more vpo. For affection thus. Often haue I warned thee of this faulte, but except thou beware. Here the sentence is cut of for anger. I know whan, and in what place thou, here is a stoppe, through shame. And thou also, if thou remember. But I say no more. Here for passing to an other matter, we breake of the tale. common woorde or thyng, putte in one clawse, and not chaunged in the other, is pet left out, and vnderstand, and that many wayes. That that is taken away, eyther is ye verbe itselfe, or somewhat that goeth before the verbe, or somewhat that foloweth. The verbe thus. Not the place honesteth the manne, but the manne the place. In the seconde clawse is left out (honesteth.) That goeth before the verbe thus. A good ma loueth not only his fredes presente, but maketh muche also of hys frendes absent. Here must be supplyed this worde (good man.) That foloweth the verbe thus. As a good man defendeth frendes absent, so an euill man forsaketh: vnderstande (frendes.) Zeugma is varyed also by the place, where that common woorde is putte. For if it be set in the fore clawse, it is called, Prozeugma. If in the myddle, Mesozeugma. In the last. Hipozeugma in this wyse. Lechery ouercame chastitie, boldnes, feare, madnes, reason. Beauty, by age decayeth, & by sicknes Beautie by sickenes, by sorowe, or by age decayeth. Diazeugma, when of those thinge so which we speake either both, or ech one of them is cocluded, with their certain verbe, thus: The people of Rome destoyed Numacc, ouerthrew Carthage cast down Corinthe, and raced Fregels Also, couetousnes hurteth the bodye, & corrupteth the mind. Prolepsis, when the generall worde going before, is diuided into partes where must be vnderstande a coniunction copulatiue, as. Aegles flee, one fro the East, another from the West: for, & the one flieth from the East, and the other from the West. Thei toke prisoners, partly hole, partly wounded: for, and partlye they took hole, and partlye they tooke wounded. Merueylouslye serue these figures to breuitie both in speakyng and writyng standeth in excesse, called generallye, Pleonasmos, That happeth, whan one, or many wordes, not necessarye to the iust and lawfull construccion dooe abounde thus. I saw it with myne eyes. He spake it with his mouth. I wote not in ye world wher to synd hi Epanalepsis, whe after some thinges put betwene, we repete agayne that we set in the beginning, the construccio neuerthelesse beyng perfecte without it. And we repete it again either with the same wordes, or other yt be of like value or els more general. With the same thus Thinke not Brutus, how be it I haue no nede to write these thiges vnto the, that thou knowest wel ynough I think not, I say, any man like vnto him, in vertue, constaunce and diligence. With other wordes that be of like value thus. This thing confyrmed, of whiche if the Philosophers saye true, we cannot doubt, when in death there is no suche vtter vndoing, that not yt lest suspicio of sense maye remayne: this then I saye wel assured, we must discusse this, what it is to lack sorow wtmore general thus But to ouercome thy mynde, to restrayne thyne anger, to temper the victorie. Him that doth these thynges, I doe not compare to the noblest menne, but iudge most like vnto god. Nowe remayne those figures, which trouble the Grammaticall order: & therfore as to ye chiefe are vnder this Greke worde, Hyperbaton, which is as muche to saye, of woordes and construction a troubled order. His kindes be these. Anastrophe, a preposterous orderyng or setting of woordes as: The sea floweth all Englande about. Long when they had fought. Hysterologia when the preposicion is not put vnto the nowne whereunto it serueth, but to the verbe, as though it were compound with it, thus. He slydby with his wheles the vppermost of the water wher by is ioined to the verbe that properly belonges to the nowne, thus: He slydde with hys wheles by the ouer part of the water. Hysteron proteron differs from the figure before, because there is but transposicio of the wordes: & here is a transposicion of thinges: that is, when that in the order of speaking is set in ye fyrst place, that was not firste done, but second. Uirgil. Phebus lyghtned the earth with his golge Lampe, and draue away the moyst shadow from the Pole. Here is set in the seconde place, that whiche was fyrste done. For night was drieuen awaye before the Sunne gaue lyght vpon the earth. Imesis is, whe a compoud word being diuided, some other word is put betwene ye partes, thus. What thinges soeuer pleased him to do, he did. Here (thinges) diuideth this one word, whatsoeuer. Interpositio, a sense cast betwixte the speache, before the talke be al ended: which though it geue some strength, yet whe it is take away, it leaueth the sentence perfect inough. Other that be of this sort (thei be so many) are able to wery babling Fabius. Because the knowledge of Tropes is very necessary for chyldren, and the teachyng of them ioyned with those figures, of whiche hytherto we haue talked: therefore we wyll brieflye shew & expounde, and diuide them. For an entraunce to Rhethorike, by them is made open to such as be studious of Eloquence. So that the Grammarian here semeth to end his art, and Rhetorician to begin, and as it wer to lay his foundacion. A trope the is a bowing of a worde or speache from his owne signification into another. And is in two sortes, of a worde, and of oration. The trope of a worde is a figure veryng the woorde from his proper and vulgar significacion, to an other that is not proper, eyther for pleasautnes or necessitie. Whose kyndes be these. out of his proper place ito another, when either there lacketh a proper worde, the worde translated is better, and of more significatio, & may well be so done for a similitude. And that many wayes. Fyrst from the senses of the bodye to, the minde: as, from the sight. Terence. Loke vpo your old age, for haue regard From the hearing. Terence. Whether I should leaue my mayster, or herken to the olde man, for obey, From smelling, doth my father smel out any thing? for suspect any thyng. From tasting. Cicero. Swallow vp the payne of a fewe daies, for thinke ye fele it not. From the reasonable to the vnreasonable, as. When we applye the dede, or affeccion of man to any beast: and many suche be in virgil in Georgikes touching Bees. From the vnreasonable to the reasonable, as. Cato, was wont to barke at Scipio, for, to chide with him. horsebacke. From the lyuyng to the not liuyng as nowe all the fieldes laughe. From the not liuing to the liuyng. Sometime in a verbe there is translacion, as, time flyeth away. Catachresis is a necessarye abuse of like wordes, for the proper: as, when we cal hym a manqueller, whiche hath kylled any perso, man or woman, mother or wife. This figure differeth fro Metaphora, because abusio is wher ther lacked a word: translation where another was. Metonymia, when in thynges that be syb together, one name is chaunged for another, as. The finder for the thing that is foud Terence. Without Ceres and Bacchus Uenus is colde: where Ceres is put for meate, Bacchus for wyne, and Uenus for Lechery. The possessor for the thig yt is possessed: as, haue here this man to be eaten vp for hys goodes. the workes of Cicero. The captain for the host. Hannibal at Cannas killed.lx. thousand men: for, the hoost of Hanniball. The coteiner for that that is coteined, Italic canot be ouercome by warre, nor Grece by learnyng: for, the menne that dwell there. The signe for that that is signified, as Let weapons geue place to the gowne, and the Lawrel to the tongue. This trope differeth fro Metaphora: because Metaphora chaugeth aword of her own wt another, though the thinges be very diuers: but here as ye thiges must be very nigh, so must the wordes also be Metaleysis, whe a word that is dew to the cause is ascribed to the effect. Synecdoche, whe one thing is vnderstande by an other, or we vnderstande more then we speake, as. Of one many. The Larthaginian holy the spanyardes. for, the Carthaginians. By the part the whole. O thou folish head, for foolishe man. see thine enemies Aise, fall vnder hysburthen, for cattell. By the mater, the thig yt is made of it as fleshe and bloude did not shewe thee this. Fleshe and bloude, is put for man made of fleshe and bloude. By that that goeth before, the thyng that foloweth. As he vnlosed her virgins gyrdle. For he had her virginitie. By that that foloweth the thing that goeth before: as, in the swet of thy face, thou shalt eate thy bread. For with labour. Antonomasia, whan for the proper name, some other external is put, either of study, art, office, or dignitie, as. 11 --------- Or contrary, proper names, for appellatiues, as. --------- Also the name of nacion for the properties attributed to the nacion, as. --------- Periphrasis is, when that, that may be spoken with one woorde, is declared in many, and that three maner wayes. By explicacion of the name: as whe for this word Philosopher, we saye: a man studious of wisedom. By diffinicion of the thyng, as for Logike, the art of reasoning. By notacion, that is, when by certain markes, and signes we do describe any thing: as, if a man vnderstandyng anger, wil saye it is the boylyng of the minde, which bringeth palenes vnto the countenaunce, burning to the iyes, trebling to the partes of the body. Also, when for the proper name we put the countrey, the sect, or some great act: as. For Uirgil, the Poet of Mantua. For Aristotle, the prince of peripateticall schole. and Numance. Periphrasis is, to hide thinges that be foule: as when we saye, I wyl goe to the priuie, for. I will make water, for And to garnish thinges ye be goodly and to make that that is shorte, goodly and long, as dothe Erasmus vpon the gospels and pistles. It differeth from Antonomasia, because there, but one worde is chaunge with another, here one worde is declared with many. Trope of Oration is, when the sygnification, not of one word only, but al that be in the construction be chaunged. The kyndes be these. Allegoria, which is an oration, shewing one thing in wordes, and another sense. Horace. O ship, shal new floude carye thee agayn into the sea? O what dost thou? take ye haue lustil Where ship is put for the como welth floudes for ciuil battell: hauen for peace and concorde. He hath these kindes. Enigma, whiche is an oracion, out of whiche for the darkenes, there can be no certaintie gathered: as. My mother begat me, & of me anon is begotten again: fragment of yce froze of water, and resolued agayne into the same. Also the halfe is more then the whole. By which is commended mediocritie. Paroemia, a saying much vsed, & notable for some noueltye: as. I holde the woulfe by the eares. Also the woulf is in our tale. Ironia, dissimulacion, not so muche perceiued by the woordes, as either by pronunciation, or by the behauior of the perso, or nature of the thing. His kinds be these. Sarcasmus, a scorne of our enemye, and a nipping taunt. As the Iewes said to Christ: now let him come down from the crosse, and saue hymselfe, that saued other. Astysmus, whan a thyng is polished with some mery conceit, as Uirgil speaking of twoo foolishe Poetes, Mauius and Bauius sayde: He that hateth not Bauius, lette hym loue thy verses, O Meui, ioyne fores, and mylke he goates. Myetirismus, a counterfayted laughter, but yet suche one as may be perceyued. Persius. I care not, to be as Arceasilas is. Charientismus, when thinges that be hardely spoken, be mollifyed with pleasaunte woordes. Terence. Sir I prayd you be good master to me, quod Dauus whe yet he desired Simo, that he might not bee thrust into the bakehouse. Figure or Scheme, is a facion of insighting made newe, by some crafte, as sayeth Fabius. Or a facioning of many wordes remoued from the common maner of speaking, as it commeth out at the fyrst. Ther be two sortes of figures: of seteces, & wordes, These ofte cum together As in this saying of Cicero, Now now Dolebella, neyther doe I force of thee nor thy children. For the oration turned from the iudge, is in sentence, now now and liberum , be Schemes in woordes: In iam iam is Epizeuxis, in liberum, Syncopa . And thei be figures of wordes. And this is ye difference betwene these figures, that the Schemes of wordes be taken away if thou chaunge the wordes: but thei of sentences remain vse what wordes thou wilte, The figure of wordes is of .ii. sortes For ether the significacio of the word is chauged, & is called a trope, of ye which we haue spoken afore: Or the significacio of the word remayneth, & that in eche word alone, of the which also we haue spoken: or in wordes ioygned together, which we cal talke, or Oration. Of this figure we wyll nowe speak. So in thys place the figure of woordes is, when the order and settyng of woordes is chaunged, and varieth somewhat from the common setting of them together. And hereof these bee the kyndes. Repeticion is, when we take one beginnynges styll at one, and the selfe same woorde, thus. To thee this thing is ascribed: To thee thankes are to be geuen: To thee it shall bee great honoure. This is a pleasaunt and sharpe figure. Conuersion is, which taketh not his beginning at one, & the selfsame word, but with all one worde styll closeth vp the sentence, and it is contrarye to that other before: as., Since the time that concorde was taken away from the cytye, libertye was taken away, fidelitie was taken away, frendship was taken away Coplexion, copriseth both two exornacions, bothe this, and that we declared before, that bothe one fyrste woord shoulde bee often repeted, and that we should turne ofte to alone last word: as who were they that often brake theyr Leagues? The Carthaginians. Who made cruel warre in Italie? The Carthaginians. Who defaced all Italie? The Carthaginians. An adiplosis is, when the last woorde of a verse is repeted in the begynnyng of ye next verse, as in this verse of Uirgil. Then folowed fayre Astur, Astur bolde on horsebacke. The oratours also vse this figure. Cicero. And yet he liueth. Liueth? yea commeth into the cousell house. Reduplicacion is a rehearsyng again of one worde or moe, for the more vehemence or some pitie, as. Terence. Thys Phanium to be his cowsin, dothe Demipho denye? Doth Demipho deny this Phanium to be his cowsin. Interpretacion differeth not muche from this figure: herein onelye, that in this alone thing & setece is rehersed, the woorde by variacion beyng chaunged. Cicero. What gladnes shalt thou fele? With what ioyes shalt thou leape? in how great rage of pleasure shalte thou be? It is also in seueral woordes, thus: Thou caust nowe be no longar in oure company. I wyl not beare it, I wil not abide it, I wil not suffer it. Epanalepsis, whe al one word is put in the beginning & in the end of a verse: as, Many thiges thei axed of Priamus and of Hector many thinges. This fygure is spoken of hereafter among the figures of construction. The doublyng of one worde nothing being betwixt: with a swift pronunciacion. Cicero. Thou, thou Autony gaueste cause of ciuyle battaile to Cesar, willyng to turne al vpside downe. Copulatio cosin to repeticion is, whe all one woorde beyng put twise strayte together, signifieth diuers thinges, as is this. Yet at that daie Meminius was Memmius. This later noteth his maners that wer well knowen. all one worde is repeted in a contrarye sense, as I know all this life to bee but bitternes, but I pray you geue me such bitternes. Traduccion, when al one woorde repeted in another case, not onely is not tedious, but also maketh ye oration more trimme, thus. Suffer riches to belonge to riche men, but preferre thou vertue before riches. For if thou wilt compare riches with vertue, thou shalte thinke riches scarse mete to bee handmaydens to vertue. Diaphora, whan the woorde rehearsed again signifieth another thing than it did afore: as. Suche was his mother, yf she were his mother, for, yf she bare a motherly mynde towarde her sonne. Also. Think many Hectors to be there, that is, many valiaunt men, and like vnto Hector. Annominacion is a certain declining into a contrarye, by a likelihoode of letters, added, chaunged, or taken awaye: Added thus. If he had tepered himself: fro pleasure, he had not been thus distepered out of measure: By takyng away thus. If he had hated brokes, as wel as bookes, he had been aliue at this houre. by chaunging thus. Geue him a Bible nay, geue hym a bable. Asyndeton is, which kepeth ye partes of our speakyng together, without help of any coniunctions: thus Feare God, reuerence the kyng, obey thy parentes, folow good men, beare with the weake. Article is, when eche woorde is sette from other by cutting the oratio thus. Thou hast lost thy substance, thy name, thy parentes, thy frendes, and god hymselfe. Member of an Oracion is, whiche in fewe woordes maketh an ende in deede of the Construccion, but not of the sentence also, as. Thou haste wasted thy Patrimonie, cast thy parentes into sorowe, turned awaye thy frendes, defyled thy name: prouoked God to anger. Both these figures serue to sharpnesse: because in maner they stryke the mynde with often strokes. And this muste he marked in both, that the speaking grow by degrees, so that the greatest bee set last. And if it so be not, then is it the figure called Congeries , whiche forceth more by heaping, the by ecrease. They bothe are well sette out by this figure Asyndeton. The equalitie of partes muche commendeth this figure called Membruin: whiche equalitie must yet be tryed by a certain secrete sense of the eare, and not by measuring vpon oure fyngers. For that is childish to tel the syllables, whe oftentimes a few long syllables match in measure many that be short. But vse and exercise doth so muche, that we may soone referre one member to another. As, for L, Ualerius Flaccus. whe the names were recited, the bold man was aferde, & the great babler hild his tong. Also, the father died in warre, the sonne was maryed at home. Falling like is, when in the same construction of wordes, there be .ii. Wordes or moe, which be spoken alike in the self same cases, as. Thou praisest a ma nedy of health, pletiful of wealth. Cicero for Flaccus. There is in the no varietie of opinion, none of affection, none of communication. Ending alike, whe wordes or seteces, haue like edinges, thus. Thou darest do filthily, and studiest to speake, baudely. Thou liuest disdaifully, thou sinest purposely. Thou speakest hatefully. These two kindes of ornametes, agree greatly together: of which the one is in lyke endinges: the other in like cases. Secundi generis. Of demaundes there bee two sortes. One plaine, as. I pray you tel me what you be, or fro what coastes you do come The figuratiue hath many kindes, For somtime we are, not to haue an answer, but to set our purpose more forwardes thus, Cicero. Thou Catiline, how log wylt thou abuse our paciece? Or for pitie sake, as Sinon doth in Uirgil. Alas what grounde, what sea may nowe receyue me? for anger also. And wyll anye man hereafter worshippe the power of Iuno? for meruaylyng. Terence. O Lorde what a sort now goe to the law? or more sharpelye to commaunde them. Wyl they not nowe bring foorth theyr harnes, and folowe me through all the citie? This figure serueth to many affections, but speciallye whan we haue wonne by reasonyng. Subiection is, when we aunswer to our owne demaunde thus. Shall we therfore forsake studies, because greate payne must be taken in them? No verelye. Also, I axe where this felowe gate this riches. Had he any great patrimonie left him? Nay, al his fathers goodes wer solde. Had he any thing by enheritaunce? it cannot bee sayde, for he was disherited from all thynges necessarye. Exclamation is, whiche sheweth the signification of sorowe, or anger for somewhat, by callyng vpon any manne or thyng: thus. Cicero. O deceyuable hope of men, and frayle fortune, & oure vayne contentions, whiche often tyme are broken in the midde way, and rushe downe, and in the verye fall are ouerwhelmed before they can see the hauen. Execration is, when we deteste any thing, for the great euils that it bringeth with it, thus. O detestable Idolatrye, whiche taketh awaye the honour dew to God, and geueth it to sinneful creatures, and ymages made by mans handes. Dubitation, when we signifie that we doubt either where to take out begynnyng for the multytude of thynges or for sorowe say, wherat shal we fyrst begi. Cicero for Roscius. Of what shal I first complaine? Or O iudges, where shal I first begin? What, or of who shal I cal for help? Communication, when eyther we are our aduersaries counsaile, or delibe rate with ye iudges, what is to be done or ought to haue been done. as. Tel me If you were in the like state, what other thing would you doe? And in this troublous worlde, geue me counsell, what you thinke best to be done. Permissio, whe it hath a dissimulatio or an affirmatio, than in dede is it a fygure: asseueratio thus. Rub thy forehed & say thou art more worthy to be cosull then Cato. Dissimulation thus. Terece. What meaneth this? If it so please thee, let hym wast, let hym destroie, and be destroyed, I haue nothing to do with it. This is a crafty forbidding, by a mocking graunt. Licence, when we mitigate thinges spoken freelye before, leste the hearer should bee offended, thus. If my bytter woordes greue you, remember, that sort sickenes is not eased with lyght remedies. Diminution, when any thyng that is excellent in vs, or in those that we defende, is by woordes diminished, to auoyde boastyng, thus. For this dare I boldely saye, you Iudges, that I haue trauayled and laboured to vnderstande the feates of warre, not with ye worst. Here if a manne shoulde haue sayde to bee as good as the beste, althoughe he shoulde haue sayde trewe: yet he should haue been thought proude, and arrogat Now to auoide disdayn, and get praise, ynoughe is spoken. Further, as this figure Liceutia, causeth that our free spekyng doth no displeasure: so doth diminution make that whiche is necessarily spoken, seme not spoken proudly. Reiection is, when we trifle out a thing brought against vs by our aduersarye, to the whiche it is harde to aunswere and then say either it is not worthy to be spoken of or that it pertaineth not to the purpose, or that we wyll kepe it till another meter time, thus. What neede me speake of this matter, seing it maketh not muche to the purpose. Like is in the oration for Milo. For why shoulde Milo hate Clodius, seing he is the groud and chief cause of his glorie. Here did Cicero trifle out euen the principal argument of the Clodians, and did not solue it. Gradation is, when the wordes that goe before, be forthwith repeted, and so runneth as it wer from steppe to steppe, thus. Industrie to Affrican gat vertue, vertue glorye, glory disdayne. Here the matter hath degress, and therefore is more graue. Sometime it standeth in woordes, as. The Leeues foloweth the woulf, the woulf the goate. It is much like Anadiplosis, whereof we spake before. Commutation is, when the order of the sentence is tourned, thus. We must not liue to eate, but eate toliue. Of this suit is this set ece most worthily praised If thou dooe any sinne with pleasure the pleasure goeth awaye: the synne remaineth: if thou dooe vertuously with labour, thy labour goeth away, the vertue remayneth. Contention is a proper settyng together of contraries. And eyther it is in woordes that be contrarye, or in cotrarye thinges, thus. He that alwaye was enemye to his owne reckonynges, how shoulde we hope hym to be a frend to other mennes matters? Here is contrariety in setences. Flattery hath pleasaunt begynnynges, and the same biter endynges. Here is the strife in wordes. When perceyuing aforehande an obiection that might be layde agaynste vs and hurte vs, we wipe it away or euer it bee spoken, as. Cicero sayeth: that he knoweth some me wil meruayle, syth so many yeres he defended many and hurt none, he doth now come to accuse verres Then dothe he shewe that this accusation of Uerres. is a defence of theyr felowes. vs, thus. Cicero agaynst Uerres. Yea, but you say he hath done these thinges so, that all men knewe it not. I thinke there bee no man whiche hath heard of his name, but can also rehearse his mischeuous actes. Uirgil. But the chauce of fyght woulde haue been doubtfull. What then? Whom feared I whiche was ready to dye. Confession, when we graunte some thinges to our aduersarye, that the rest may bee made the more greuous, thus. Bee it that thou wast once his frende, his felowe in warre, and that thou hast done somewhat for hym. What than? Myght ye not therfore falle out? somewhat, that we take awaye something that is nere vnto it, thus. Trouth maye be in ieopardy, but neuer opprest. Aetiologia, whan we shew by and by the cause of oure purpose. Cicero for Archia. This witte that I haue (you Iudges,) Archias may iustly chalinge it vnto hym. For he was the chiefe and principal, that made me to set my self to these maner of studies. Dicaeologia, when we shew some cause of oure duetye, or some excuse that it is honeste so to dooe, Or laye some reason for oure selfe, thus. I dyd amisse, but I was yonge, and in suche coumpanye, where I must of force bee naught. Anangeon, when we aledge necessity, which in deliberation is of great force, as. I forsooke my friende, but the lawe compelled me: I kept fredship as long as the lawe suffred me, now I am turned from hym: not by wyll, but by force of lawe. Partition is, when that that might be spoken generally, is more largely declared by partes. As if we would say: he is perfectly seen in al sciences. Thys sentence thou mayest declare by partes in this wise. He knoweth merueylously well the fables of Poetes, the flowers of Rhetorique, the painefull rules of Grammer, the subtilties of Logitians, the secretes of natural philosophy, the hardnes of wisedom supernatural, the misteries of diuinitie, the mathematicall demonstrations, the mocions of starres, the reasons of nubers, the measuring of ye earth, the situations, names and spaces of Cities, Mountaynes, Floudes, and Fountaynes, the dyfference, and harmonies of Tunes, histories olde, and newe: antiquities, nouelties. Greke and Latine: finally what soeuer good learnyng hath been founde and taught of good authours, all that wholy hath this one man perfitlye perceyued, knowen, and remembred. Enumeratio is, whe we reherse those thynges seuerallye, by which ye matter was brought to passe: as. That Cicero oppressed the purposes of Catiline: thus you maye sette it foorth. The myschieuous enterprises of Catiline by moste vngracious younge menne whiche wente about the vtter destruction of Roome, Marcus Tullius the Consull, by hys foresyghte dyd quicklye smell oute, by his singuler vigilance soughte out, by his hyghe prudence founde out, by hys meruaylous loue to the common wealth shewed out, by his incredyble Eloquence proued oute, by hys graue authorytye, power, and happynesse, thruste out. Distribution is, when businesse are dyspersed into many thynges, or certain persos, thus. It is ye office of the senate to help ye citie wt cousel: of ye magistrate with laboure and diligence to dooe the wil of the Senate: of the people to chose out the best thinges, and to chose and alowe men that be moste metest. Cicero for Lucius Murena. And this man, you iudges, bothe was in Asia, and greatlye holpe that good man his father in perils, dyd cofort him in sorowes, and reioysed in his victories. It is called Description, which conteyneth a playne and euidente settyng out of thinges that folowe after, and that with a certayne grauitie, thus, You knowe ryght wel, you people, whe the citie is taken, what miseries be wot to folow. Such as fought against them, are by and by most cruelly kylled, other whiche be so strong that they be hable to laboure, are made bondeslaues: they that cannot, are slayne: at one tyme bee our houses burnt, our kynsmenne and acquaintaunce pulled awaye from vs. Younge chyldren, some are pulled from their mothers lappes, and some are threatled in their mothers armes, and some defiled before their fete: you iudges, there is no man hable to expresse in woordes or writyng the great sorow and calamitie. and copiously expresse a thing, a perso, & an affection, maners, speach, and circustaunce, that the reader, semeth to see it before his eies, as though it wer liuelye paynted in a table. The kyndes bee these. The description of a thyng, where not concent, lightly and briefly to haue shewed it, we so set it before the Readers eyes, that it semeth not to be told, but to be done: & the reader not to here it, but se it. Suche is the description of the floude in the firste booke of Metamorphosis, & of a tempest in the second Prosopopoeia, when any man is described. As Plutarche dothe the noble men, both Grecians and Latines. Suetonius also the twelue Emperours. How be it, the Rhethoricians vse thys woorde, Prosopopoeia largely to comprehende these syxe kyndes folowyng. Characterismus, the expression or painting out, eyther of the body or mind So Dauus setteth out Crito: & Cherea the troublous olde man. This hath two kindes. The fyrste is the description of a feined person properlye belongyng to Poetes, syldome vsed of Oratours. As Virgil fayneth sybbill to bee madde, and persones beneath in hell. Another fourme is, when vnto a thyng that is dumme, or without a bodye, we fayne a persone, speache, and affection of a manne, or some lyuyng thyng, as to the byrdes called Harpyans, Furyes, Deuilles, Slepe, Hungar, Enuye, Fame, Uertewe, and lyke, the Poets bee woonte to fayne a persone, and speache. Also when Oratours make the common wealthe speake, or as it were rayse vp agayne dead men. Ethopoeia, propertye, or expressyon of mylde maners and affections. Of thys there bee three kyndes. The fyrste, a large settyng out of maners, as of wyttes, artes, vertues, or vyces. So Terence setteth out boastyng. Thraso, Plautus, a crakyng souldyoure. And thys facyon properlye belongeth to Commoedies, and Dialogues. The seconde fourme is an expressyon of naturall inclinations, and affections naturall, as of the fathers loue towarde the chyldren, the housebande and wyfe, of frendes among them selues, of compaygnions, geastes, neyghbours: of hatred also, and of enemyes. In expressyng of these among the Latines, Liuius is very cunnyng. For an Hystorye chyeflye setteth out the desyre of myndes, purposes, and deedes, without anye greate outcryes, and rages. The thyrde kynde is a settyng oute of colde and mylde affections, that dooe not so greatelye trouble the mynde nor tosse it: as whe we goe aboute gentely to geat mennes loue and fauoure, or that the mynde is broughte into hope, myrthe, or laughter. Pathopoeia, that is an expression of vehemente affections and perturbations. Of this there be two kyndes. The fyrste is called Imagination, whereby, feare, sorowe, anger, furye, hatred, enuy, vnbrideled desyre, lust immoderate, hope, or gladnesse, and the passions of the mynde is described and styred vp. Exaumples of these bee euerye where in Tragedies. There is an other facion called Commiseration, whereby we make menne wepe, moue menne to mercye, or to pardon an offence. Readye exaumples of these are in the perorations of Cicero, & in Poetes, in their complaintes. Sermocination, is when we fayne a person, and make hym speake lytle or muche according to comlines. Suche be the Concions of Liuie, and sermones or orations made in other Historiographers. When the person that we feyn, speaketh all hym selfe: the figure is called Conformation. But when we now and then aunswere to demaundes that he putteth vnto vs, it is called, Sermocination. Mimisis, an imitation of speache or manours, whereby we counterfayte, not onelye what one sayde, but his gesture also. These foresayde sixe kyndes, Quintilian and other put vnder Prosopopoeia. Topographia, the discription of a place, as of Carthago in the fyrste of Eneidos. Hyther referre Cosmographie. Topothesia, the faynyng of a place, When a place is descrybed, as paraduenture suche none is. Exaumple of this is the Utopia of Syr Thomas Moore. Or elles is not suche a place as it is, fayned to bee. As, is hell, and heauen in the syxte of Eneidos. Hyther pertayneth the situacio of starres, in Aratus, Higinius, Manilius and Pontanus. Chronographia, the discription of tyme, as of nyght in the fowerth of Eneidos. Of the peace worlde in the fourth Egloge of Uirgil. Of the foure ages in the fyrste of Metamorphoseos. A great part of Eloquence standeth by increasing and diminishing. And all amplification is taken either of thinges or woordes: by wordes thus. When we chaunge the very woorde, and in stede thereof put a bygger, & say: Thou hast killed him: where peraduenture he gaue hym but a fewe stripes. An other kynde of Amplification is, when oure woordes increase one bygger then other, thus. It is offence to bynde a Citezin of Rome, haynous to beate hym, manslaughter to kyll hym. What shall I cal it to hang hym? We amplify also by heapyng thinges faste together. In the companye of the people of Rome, hauyng a common office, Mayster of the horse, there to caste vp thy stynkyng gobbettes, and to fyll thy lappe and the iudgemente seate, is not this a shame? This differeth fro the other, because it goeth a pace: and the other by steppes and distinctions. We amplifye by comparison: and see one exaumple to an other: or fayne as though such thyng had happened, thus: If my seruauntes dyd feare me in suche wyse as all the Citezins feare thee, I would think it good to leaue my house. By comparyng one exaumple to an other, thus, Cicero. Did I pray you that noble man Scipio beyng a priuate person kyl Tiberius Gracchus, which shaked the common wealth but a litle: and shal we being Cosuls suffer Catiline, ye goeth about to wast the whole world with murther and fyer? We amplify by coniecture thus Uirgil speaking of Polyphemus. He helde in his hande the bodye of a pyne tree. By this we coniecture what a greate body he had, when he had a pine tree for his staffe. A greater amplification of thynges. Which alwaies haue their circumstances with them. A person hath these. Nacion, countrey, kinde, age educatio, hauour of the body, fortune, condicion, nature of mind, forededes, and names, Examples. If a man despise any thing that properlye belongeth to his nation, it is more greuous, as. For if an English ma doe despise the feate of shooting. The countrey doth not alwayes cause amplification: but we may say of God. He would be borne in the goodliest part of the world, ye as it wer in an ope playing place, his might & power, myght shine more abrode kind. As filthy talke is a foule thing in a woma. Age. Lechery becometh not an old man, Educatio. Nero this first yeres was wel brought vp, it was therfore & more shame to degenerate afterwardes. The hauior of the bodi. Sith god hath made the a faire psonage, why dooest thou so filthily? Fortune. Thou art of low degree becu a noble ma, the worse is now thy pride. Codicio. Thou art a priuate man & darest thou resist the magistrates? The nature of the mind. God hath created ye of an high & noble heart, why the sekest thou for so small trifles. Fordedes. Now to be a sluggard which before hast done so goodly actes, is a stark shame. Name. To slepe in so gret a matter, & to be named waker, was this mete The circustances of thinges be these. Cause, place, time, instrument. Cause. Thou wast the first that moued to this murther, the fault therfore is the greter Place. He defiled ye virgin in ye teple. Time. The eate he flesh, whe ther was proclaimed ope fasting, Instrumet. The serpet killed Eue wt his tog worse than any sword. Thus now may you se what Amplificatio reseth by the circumstances belonging to persons, & thynges. Frequentatio is, whe the thinges that be dispersed through al the cause be gathered together into one place, that the oratio may be the moregraue, sharper, or rebukefuller, thus. What vice hath he not? Why should you deliuer hi you iudges? His own chastity he setteth forth cu whose wil, he lieth i wait for others, he is inteperate, wanton, proud, vnnatural to his parentes, vnkind to his frendes, troubleso to his kinsfolkes, stubberne to his betters, disdainful to his felowes, cruel to his inferiours, vntollerable to all men. Congeries, is a multiplication wordes, or sentences, as it wer beatyn in all one thing. It differeth fro ecreal in this point, because the oration ther groweth as it wer by degrees, and herby heapes. Cicero, Tubero, what dyd the drawe sweord in ye battail of Phaesalia? whose side did the point strike at? What was the meanyng of thine armour. What met thy mind, eyes, hades fury of mind? What diddest thou couet? What diddest thou wish? Howe manye wordes be there here signifying almost all one thing? as: sweorde, pointe of the sweord, weapons, sense, minde, entente, diddest couet, diddest desire. Further, how many sentences bee there tendyng to one point, as: to drawe thy sweord in the fielde, to runne at his side, meanyng of weapons. Of the same sort is, but hauyng a more milde affection, that is in Virgil in the .iii. of Eneid. Howe doeth the childe Ascanius, is be on the earth, doth he eate the breath Ethereal? doth he not yet lye belowe in the cruel dark places? He axeth nothing els, but whether Ascanius be aliue, but it is the affectio that expresseth one thing thrise. Diuision is, whiche remouyng one thing from another, endeth the both by shewing a reason, thus. Why should I nowe then lay any thyng to thy charge? If thou be good thou hast not deserued it: if thou be naught, thou carest not for it. Also, what should I nowe speake of myne owne proper merites. If you remember them I shal but trouble you: if you haue forgot them, when I haue done nothing by dede, what may I profite by wordes? Correction, whiche taketh awaye that that is spoken, and putteth a more meter thyng in his place, thus. That if he had prayed his frendes, yea had no more but beckte, this thyng myght easily haue been done. Difinition is, wherby the proper pith of any thyng is declared briefly & perfectly, thus. This is not diligence, but couetousnes: decause diligence is an hedy conseruation of that that is his own couetousnes is an iniurious desyer of other mennes goodes. Transition is, whereby we do briefly shew what is spoken, & what should folowe, thus. You haue heard how he hath behaued hymselfe to hys countrey now what he hath been to his parentes I wyll tell you. Exaumple is the rehearsal of a thing that is doone, and applying of it to our cause. So the grounde and matter of an exaumple is an acte done of any mauue thus. As Camillus restored ye Romain common wealth being brought into extreme ieopardye: So Laurence Ualla broughte agayne into the olde purenesse, the Latine toungue, whiche thorowe ignoraunce of the Babarians, was almoste quite loste. Further, Comparation sheweth the exaumple that is brought, either to be like, vnlike, or contrary. And agayne, equall, lesse, or bigger. Which thing is also done in parables, or similitudes. Similitude is a mete conferring of a dumme thyng or that hath no life, vnto oure purpose, as. A shippe lyftyng vp, taking downe, or turnyng his sayles on this side or that side as the windes bloweth, is a parable: whiche techeth a wise manne to serue the tyme, and doe as the worlde goeth. So than as an exaumple is taken of the dede of a manne, and of some person in an historie: So a similitude is taken of any thyng saue of man, or mans acte. Image very litle differeth fro similitude. As if thou say that Achilles came into the field in harneys glistryng like fyer, or the sunne beames: Or that one flew vpon his enemies, like a dragon or lion, it is an image or reseblance rather then similitude. And a reseblance is taken of the fourme of a beaste, as yf you wil paint out a rauening, or poysonous man like to a crested drago, which with burning eies, sharp teeth, croked nailes gapyng mouth, loking euery where, vpon whom he may blowe out his poyso who he may gape at, bite with his teeth poiso with his tog, teare wt his nayles. Unto exaumples is referred authoritie: that is a mete conferring of an other mannes saying or sentence to oure cause. The kindes be these. Sentence, is a saying pertayning to maners, or to common practises of the world which with proper briefnes, sheweth what is to bee done, or wont to bee done in this life, as. Continual labor ouercommeth al thing. And no man may hope for any thing against goddes wyl. Such be the setences of Salomo, & Cato. Enthymeme, a sentence made of contraries: as if it bee a greate prayse to please good menue: to be alowed of euil, is gret reproch. Also flattry getteth frendes, trueth hatred. Neither is it here a kind of argumetacion dialectical Epiphouema, is an acclamacion of any matter that is tolde, or alowed: that is to say, an amplifying of honestie, dignitie, profite, difficultie, or suche other like, put at the ende for the more merueiling, as. As so weightie a matter it was to sette vp the Romaine nacion. Here is an acclamacion of a matter told before. And so great it is to accustome our self from youth. An acclamation of a thing that is told thus, as for Ligarius. Cesar, whose perdon is praise of thy mercye, shall there woordes sharpen thee to crueltie? Noema, when we signifye priuilye, that which the hearer maye coniecture by himselfe. Or it is a taunt, spoken against any person, whose folye, and maners are reproued. Liuie hath suche an exaumple. The Athenians by letters & wordes fought agaynst Philip. Wherby, Liuius dyd secretely reproue the vnwarlike babling of the Grecians. dede or saying, with the autours name beyng recited. This is well handled of Cicero in the preface of the third boke of his Offices: that Scipio was wont to saye, he was neuer lesse ydle then whe he was voyde of the common wealthe matters, and neuer lesse alone, the whe he was alone. AEnos , a sayng or a sentence taken out of a tale, as are the Morals & Alligories interpretyng fables, & shewyng there vse. Oraculum any worde that is receyued at the mouth of God, or spoken by his commanndement, as are commonly all thynges thai are spoken and commaunded in the Bibles. Expolition is, when we tary still in one place, and yet seme to speake diuers thinges. So that it may be a very good ly expolition, which shal stand of many exornations of woordes, and sentences, thus. Wherfore as he is to be despised which beyng on the sea had rather haue himself safe the the ship, so is he to be rebuked which in the ieopardy of the comowealthe, prouideth more for hym selfe, then for the safety of the comonwealth Whiche thyngme thynketh Decius did wel perceiue, when he bente hymself to die, and for the sauing of his souldiours to haue runne into the middes of his enemis. Wherby he let his life go, but he lost it not. For with a smal thing & of litle: price he redemedathig of gret value he gaue his life, but he receiued his coutrey: he lette passe his life, but enioyed glory, which declared with great praise the elder it shall waxe, dayly the more and more it shall shine. Breuitie is, whe the matter is quickly tolde, with no more wordes but those that be necessary, thus. As he passed by, he toke Lemnum, then he left a garriso at Tharsus: after he toke a city in Bythinia, drieuen from thence, forthwith he wane Abydus. And these in maner be the figures of sentences, whereby the copye, bothe of wordes and matter, is wonderfully increased. Howbeit they bee called of the Rhetoricians by diuers names, as some where of Quintilian they be named argumentes, and maners of amplificatio, vertues also of an oration, and lightes, and colours, euen then in dede whe thei be not partes of the matter, but eyther may be taken out, or quite left of: that is to say, when they be not put in matters, to proue any thyng, but to garnish it. Cicero calleth them exornations of sentence. Other name them ornametes of matter, because by them, not only the oration and wordes, but the body of the matter groweth and is increased. But because names dooe serue to declare thinges, the matters declared, we nede not to take much thought touchyng the woordes. I know there be many other ornamentes also and figures of oracion But to my power I haue gathered the chief, and that wer thought most mete to bee noted. Now yt we haue shewed the precepts and figures of garnishing, & eloquutio, it is our office & duety, to shew in what kindes, al oratorie ought to be. For that there be thre sundry kindes called of the Grekes Characters, of vs, figures, in which euery oration not fawtie, is occupied, I trowe there is no man meanely learned, but he knoweth: namelye when we se so many writers of sciences, both Grecians, & Latines, which haue bene before time, to haue folowed for the most part sudry kindes of writing, one vnlike the other. And there hath been marked inespeciall three kindes of endighting. The great, the final, and the meane. The great, the noble, the mighty, & the ful kind of endighting, with an incredible, and a certein diuine power of oratio is vsed in weightye causes: for it hath with an ample maiestye, very garnyshed wordes: proper, translated, and graue setences, which are handled in amplificatio, & comiseratio: and it hath exornations both of woordes and seteces: wher vnto in orations they ascribe very gret strength and grauitie. And thee that vse this kind be vehemet, various, copious, graue, wel and throughly appointed, to moue and turne men to their purpose This kinde dyd Cicero vse in the oration for Aulus Cluencius, for Sylla, for Titus Annius Milo, for Caius Rabirius, against Catiline, against Uerres against Piso, but they that cannot skyll of this, oftentimes fal into fautes, when vnto the ye semeth a graue oratio, which swelleth and is puffed vp, which vseth strauge words, hardly traslated, or that be to old, and that be now long sythens lefte of from vse of daylye talke, or more graue then the thyng requireth. The small kynde of endightyng is in a subtile, pressed, and fyled oration, mere for causes that bee a litle sharper then are in the common vse of speaking. For it is a kynde of oration that is lette downe even to the most vsed custome of pure, and cleare speakyng. It hath fyue sentences, subtile, sharpe, teachyng all thynges, and makyng them more playn, not more ample. And in this same kind (as Cicero saieth in his oratour) some be crafty, but vnpolished, and of purpose like the rude and vnskilful. Other in ye leanes are trim, that is, mery coceited, florishing also, & a litle garnished, Cicero vsed this kind in his philosophical disputacions, in the oration for Quintius, for Roscius the comedie player: and Terence, and Plautus in their Comedies. Such as cannot handsomly vse themselfes in that mery conceited slendernes of wordes, fal into a drye, & feble kind of oration, which may be called aweake, and feble writig, thus. He came to the balenes: after he said vnto him. This thy seruant strake me. I will consider. After that he chode and cryed more and more manye beyng present. The meane and temperate kind of indighting standeth of the lower, and yet not of the lowest, and most como words and sentences. And it is rightly called ye temperate kind of speaking, because it is very nigh vnto the smal, and to the gret kynd, folowing a moderacion and temper betwixt them both. And it foloweth (as you would say) in one tenor distinguishing, all the oration with smal ornamentes both of wordes and setences. Cicero vseth this for the law or Manilius, for Aulus Cecinna, for Marcus Marcellus, and most of al in his bokes of Offices. In this is fawtye to come to the kind that is nie vnto it, called dissolute, because it waueth hyther & thyther, as it wer without synewes and iointes, stading surely in no point. And suche an Oration cannot cause the hearer to take anye hede, whe it goeth in and out, & coprehendeth not any thyng with perfecte woordes.
