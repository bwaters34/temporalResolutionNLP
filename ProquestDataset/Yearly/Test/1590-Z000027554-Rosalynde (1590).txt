Hauing with Capt: Clarke made a voyage to the Jlands of Terceras  & the Canaries , to beguile the time with labour, J writ this booke; rough, as hatcht in the stormes of the Ocean, and feathered in the surges of many perillous seas. But as it is the worke of a souldier and a scholler, J presumed to shrowde it vnder your Honors patronage, as one that is the fautor and fauourer of all vertuous actions; and whose honourable Loues growen from the generall applause of the whole Common wealth for your higher deserts, may keep it fro the mallice of euery bitter tung. Other reasons more particular (right Honorable) chalenge in me a speciall affection to your L. as being a scholler with your two noble sonnes, Master Edmond Carew & M. Robert Carew , (two siens worthie of so honorable a tree, and a tree glorious in such honourable fruite) as also being scholler in the Uniuersitie vnder that learned and vertuous Knight Sir Edward Hobbie , when he was Batcheler in Arts, a ma as well lettered as well borne, and after the Etymologie of his name soaring as high as the wings of knowledge can mount him, happie euerie way, & the more fortunate, as blessed in the honor of so vertuous a Ladie. Thus (right honourable) the duetie that J owe to the sonne, chargeth me that all my affection be placed on the father; for where the braunches are so precious, the tree of force must be most excellent. Commaunded and emboldened thus with the consideration of these forepassed reasons, to present my Booke to your Lordship; I humbly intreate, your Honour will vouch of my labours, and fauour a souldiers and a schollers pen with your gracious acceptance; who answeres in affection what he wants in eloquence; so deuoted to your Honour, as his onely desire is, to end his life vnder the fauour of so martiall and learned a Patron.

There dwelled adioyning to the citie of Bourdeaux a Knight of most honorable parentage, whom Fortune had graced with manie fauours, and Nature honored with sundrie exquisite qualities, so beautified with the excellence of both, as it was a question whether Fortune or Nature were more prodigall in deciphering the riches of their bounties. Wise hee was, as holding in his head a supreme conceipt of policie, reaching with Nestor into the depth of all ciuill gouernment: and to make his wisedome more gracious, he had that salem ingenij and pleasant eloquence that was so highlie commended in Vlisses: his valour was no lesse than his wit, nor the stroake of his Launce no lesse forcible, than the sweetnesse of his tongue was perswasiue: for he was for his courage chosen the principall of all the Knights of Malta . This hardie Knight thus enricht with Uertue and Honour, surnamed Sir Iohn of Bourdeaux , hauing passed the prime of his youth in sundrie battailes against the Turkes , at last (as the date of time hath his course) grew aged: his haires were siluer hued, and the map of age was figured on his forehead: Honour sat in the furrowes of his face, and many yeres were pourtraied in his wrinckled liniaments, that all men might perceiue his glasse was runne, and that Nature of necessity chalenged her due. Sir Iohn (that with the Phenix knewe the tearme of his life was now expyred, and could with the Swanne discouer his end by her songs) hauing three sonnes by his wife Lynida , the verie pride of all his forepassed yeres, thought now (seeing death by constraint would compell him to leaue them) to bestowe vpon them such a Legacie as might bewray his loue, and increase their ensuing amitie. Calling therefore these yong Gentlemen before him in the presence of all his fellowe Knights of Malta , he resolued to leaue them a memoriall of his fatherlie care, in setting downe a methode of their brotherlie dueties. Hauing therefore death in his lookes to mooue them to pitie, and teares in his eyes to paint out the depth of his passions, taking his eldest sonne by the hand, hee began thus. Oh my Sonnes, you see that Fate hath set a period of my yeares, and Destinies haue determined the finall ende of my daies: the Palme tree waxeth away ward, for he stoopeth in his height, and my plumes are full of sicke feathers touched with age. I must to my graue that dischargeth all cares, and leaue you to the world that encreaseth many sorowes: my siluer haires conteineth great experience, and in the number of my yeares are pend downe the subtilties of Fortune. Therefore as I leaue you some fading pelfe to counterchecke pouertie, so I will bequeath you infallible precepts that shall leade you vnto vertue. First therefore vnto thee Saladyne the eldest, and therefore the chiefest piller of my house, wherein should be ingrauen as well the excellence of thy fathers qualities, as the essentiall forme of his porportion, to thee I giue foureteene ploughlands, with all my Mannor houses and richest place. Next vnto Fernandyne I bequeath twelue ploughlands. But vnto Rosader the yongest I giue my Horse, my Armour and my Launce, with sixteene ploughlands: for if the inward thoughts be discouered by outward shadowes, Rosader will exceed you all in bountie and honour. Thus (my Sonnes) haue I parted in your portions the substance of my wealth, wherein if you bee as prodigall to spend, as I haue been carefull to get, your friends will grieue to see you more wastfull than I was bountifull, and your foes smile that my fall did begin in your excesse. Let mine honour be the glasse of your actions, and the fame of my vertues the Loadstarre to direct the course of your pilgrimage. Ayme your deedes by my honorable endeuours, and shewe your selues siens worthie of so florishing a tree: least as the birds Halcyones which exceede in whitenesse, I hatch yong ones that surpasse in blacknesse. Climbe not my sonnes; aspiring pride is a vapour that ascendeth hie, but soone turneth to a smoake: they which stare at the Starres, stumble vppon stones; and such as gaze at the Sunne (vnlesse they bee Eagle eyed) fall blinde. Soare not with the Hobbie, least you fall with the Larke; nor attempt not with Phaeton , least you drowne with Icarus . Fortune when she wils you to flie, tempers your plumes with waxe, and therefore either sit still and make no wing, or els beware the Sunne, and holde Dedalus axiome authenticall ( medium tenere tutissimum ). Low shrubbes haue deepe rootes, and poore Cottages great patience. Fortune lookes euer vpward, and enuie aspireth to nestle with dignitie. Take heede my sonnes, the meane is sweetest melodie; where strings high stretcht, either soone cracke, or quicklie growe out of tune. Let your Countries care be your hearts content, and thinke that you are not borne for your selues, but to leuell your thoughts to be loyall to your Prince, careful for the Common weale, and faithfull to your friends; so shall France say, these men are as excellent in vertues, as they be exquisite in features. Oh my sonnes, a friend is a precious Iewell, within whose bosome you may vnloade your sorowes and vnfolde your secretes, and hee either will releeue with counsaile, or perswade with reason: but take heede in the choyce, the outward shew makes not the inward man, nor are the dimples in the face the Calenders of trueth. When the Liquorice leafe looketh most drie, then it is most wet. When the shoares of Lepanthus are most quiet, then they forepoint a storme. The Baaran leafe the more faire it lookes, the more infectious it is, and in the sweetest words is oft hid the most trecherie. Therefore my sonnes, choose a friend as the Hiperborei do the mettals, seuer them from the ore with fire,  & let them not bide the stamp before they be currant; so trie and then trust, let time be touchstone of friendship, & then friends faithfull lay them vp for Iewells. Be valiant my sonnes, for cowardise is the enemie to honour; but not too rash, for that is an extreame. Fortitude is the meane, and that is limitted within bonds, and prescribed with circumstance. But aboue all, and with that he fetcht a deepe sigh, beware of Loue, for it is farre more perilous than pleasant, and yet I tell you it allureth as ill as the Syrens . Oh my sonnes, fancie is a fickle thing, and beauties paintings are trickt vp with times colours, which being set to drie in the Sunne, perish with the same. Venus is a wanton, & though her lawes pretend libertie, yet there is nothing but losse and glistering miserie. Cupids wings are plumed with the feathers of vanitie, and his arrowes where they pearce, inforce nothing but deadly desires: a womans eye as it is precious to behold, so it is preiudiciall to gaze vpon; for as it affoordeth delight, so it snareth vnto death. Trust not their fawning fauours, for their loues are like the breath of a man vpon steele, which no sooner lighteth on but it leapeth of, and their passions are as momentarie as the colours of a Polipe, which changeth at the sight of euerie obiect. My breath waxeth short and mine eyes dimme, the houre is come and I must away: therefore let this suffice, women are wantons, and yet men cannot want one: and therefore if you loue, choose her that hath her eyes of Adamant, that will turne only to one poynt; her heart of a Diamond, that will receiue but one forme; her tongue of a Sethin leafe, that neuer wagges but with a Southeast winde: and yet my sonnes, if she haue all these qualities, to be chast, obedient, and silent; yet for that she is a woman, shalt thou finde in her sufficient vanities to counteruaile her vertues. Oh now my sonnes, euen now take these my last words as my latest Legacie, for my thrid is sponne, and my foote is in the graue: keepe my precepts as memorialls of your fathers counsailes, and let them bee lodged in the secrete of your hearts; for wisedome is better than wealth, and a golden sentence worth a world of treasure. In my fall see & marke my sonnes the follie of man, that being dust climbeth with Biares to reach at the Heauens, and readie euerie minute to dye, yet hopeth for an age of pleasures. Oh mans life is like lightning that is but a flash, and the longest date of his yeares but as a bauens blaze. Seeing then man is so mortall, bee carefull that thy life bee vertuous, that thy death may be full of admirable honours; so shalt thou challenge fame to bee thy fautor, and put obliuion to exile with thine honorable actions. But my Sonnes, least you should forget your fathers axiomes, take this scroule, wherein reade what your father dying, wils you to execute liuing. At this hee shrunke downe in his bed and gaue vp the ghost. Iohn of Bourdeaux being thus dead, was greatlie lamented of his Sonnes and bewayled of his friends, especiallie of his fellowe Knights of Malta , who attended on his Funeralls, which were performed with great solemnitie. His Obsequies done, Saladyne caused next his Epitaph the contents of the scroule to be pourtraied out, which were to this effect. Sonnes.  I leaue you goods, but they are quicklie lost; J leaue aduice, to schoole you how to liue; I leaue you wit, but wonne with little cost: But keepe it well; for counsaile still is one, When Father, friends, and worldlie goods are gone. In choice of thrift let honour be thy gaine, Winne it by vertue and by manly might; In dooing good esteeme thy toyle no paine, Protect the fatherlesse and widowes right: Fight for thy faith, thy Countrie and thy King, For why? this thrift will prooue a blessed thing. In choice of wife, preferre the modest chast, Lillies are faire in shew, but foule in smell; The sweetest lookes by age are soone defast: Then choose thy wife by wit and liuing well. Who brings thee wealth and many faults withall, Presents thee honie, mixt with bitter gall. In choice of friends, beware of light beliefe, A painted tongue may shroud a subtill heart; The Syrens teares doo threaten mickle griefe, Foresee my sonne, for feare of sodaine smart: Chuse in thy wants: and he that friends thee then, When richer growne, befriend him thou agen. Learne of the Ant in sommer to prouide; Driue with the Bee the Droane from out thy hiue; Builde like the Swallowe in the sommer tide; Spare not too much (my sonne) but sparing thriue: Be poore in follie, rich in all but sinne: So by thy death thy glorie shall beginne. Saladine hauing thus set vp the Scedule, and hangd about his Fathers hearse many passionate Poems, that France might suppose him to be passing sorrowfull, he clad himselfe and his Brothers all in black, & in such sable sutes discoursed his griefe: but as the Hiena when she mournes is then most guilefull, so Saladine vnder this shew of griefe shadowed a heart full of contented thoughtes: the Tyger though hee hide his clawes, will at last discouer his rapine: the Lions lookes are not the mappes of his meaning, nor a mans phisnomie is not the display of his secrets. Fire cannot bee hid in the straw, nor the nature of man so concealed, but at last it will haue his course: nourture and art may doo much, but that Natura naturans which by propagation is ingrafted in the heart, will be at last perforce predominant according to the olde verse.  Naturam expellas furca licet, tamen usque recurret. So fared it with Saladyne , for after a months mourning was past, he fell to consideration of his Fathers testament, how he had bequeathed more to his younger brothers than himselfe, that Rosader was his Fathers darling, but now vnder his tuition, that as yet they were not come to yeres, & he being their gardin, might (if not defraud them of their due) yet make such hauock of their legacies and lands, as they should be a great deale the lighter: whereupon hee began thus to meditate with himselfe. world of restlesse passions, hauing thy minde troubled with the tenour of thy Fathers testament, and thy heart fiered with the hope of present preferment? by the one, thou art counsaild to content thee with thy fortunes; by the other, perswaded to aspire to higher wealth. Riches ( Saladyne ) is a great royalty, & there is no sweeter phisick tha store. Auicen like a foole forgot in his Aphorismes to say, that golde was the most precious restoratiue, and that treasure was the most excellent medecine of the minde. Oh Saladyne , what were thy Fathers precepts breathed into the winde? hast thou so soone forgotte his principles? did he not warne thee from coueting without honor, and climing without vertue? did hee not forbid thee to aime at any action that should not be honourable? and what will bee more preiudiciall to thy credit, than the carelesse ruine of thy brothers welfare? why, shouldst not thou bee the piller of thy brothers prosperitie; and wilt thou become the subuersion of their fortunes? is there any sweeter thing than concord, or a more precious Iewel then amity? are you not sons of one Father, siens of one tree, birds of one nest? and wilt thou become so vnnaturall as to rob them, whome thou shouldst relieue: No Saladyne , intreate them with fauours, and intertaine them with loue; so shalt thou haue thy conscience cleare and thy renowne excellent. Tush, what words are these base foole; farre vnfit (if thou be wise) for thy humour. What though thy Father at his death talked of many friuolous matters, as one that doated for age, and raued in his sicknesse: shal his words be axioms, and his talke be so authentical, that thou wilt (to obserue them) preiudice thy selfe? No no Saladyne , sick mens wills that are parole, and haue neither hand nor seale, are like the lawes of a Citie written in dust; which are broken with the blast of euerie winde. What man thy Father is dead, and hee can neither helpe thy fortunes, nor measure thy actions: therefore burie his words with his carkasse, and bee wise for thy selfe. What, tis not so olde as true:  Non sapit, qui sibi non sapit. Thy Brother is young, keepe him now in awe, make him not check mate with thy selfe: for  Nimia familiaritas contemptum parit. Let him knowe little, so shall he not be able to execute much; suppresse his wittes with a base estate, and though hee be a Gentleman by nature yet forme him a new, and make him a peasant by nourture: so shalt thou keepe him as a slaue, and raign thy selfe sole Lord ouer al thy Fathers possessions. As for Fernandyne thy middle brother he is a scholer, and hath no minde but on Aristotle , let him reade on Galen while thou riflest with gold, and pore on his booke til thou doost purchase lands: wit is great wealth, if hee haue learning it is enough; and so let all rest. In this humour was Saladyne making his brother Rosader his foote boy, for the space of two or three yeares, keeping him in such seruile subiection, as if hee had been the sonne of any countrie vassall. The yong Gentleman bare al with patience, til on a day walking in the garde by himself, he began to consider how he was the son of Iohn of Bourdeaux , a knight renowmed for many victories, & a Gentlema famozed for his vertues, how contrarie to the testament of his father, he was not only kept from his land, and intreated as a seruant, but smothered in such secret slauerie, as he might not attaine to any honourable actions. Ah quoth he to himselfe (nature working these effectuall passions) why should I that am a Gentleman borne, passe my time in such vnnaturall drudgerie? were it not better either in Paris to become a scholler, or in the court a courtier, or in the field a souldier, than to liue a foote boy to my own brother: nature hath lent me wit to coceiue, but my brother denied me arte to contemplate: I haue strength to performe any honorable exployte, but no libertie to accomplish my vertuous indeuours: those good partes that God hath bestowed vpon me, the enuie of my brother dooth smother in obscuritie: the harder is my fortune, and the more his frowardnesse. With that casting vp his hand he felt haire on his face, and perceiuing his beard to bud, for choler hee began to blush, and swore to himselfe he would bee no more subiect to such slauerie. As thus he was ruminating of his melancholie passions, in came Saladyne with his men, and seeing his brother in a browne studie, and to forget his wonted reuerence, thought to shake him out of his dumps thus. Sirha (quoth hee) what is your heart on your halfe penie, or are you saying a Dirge for your fathers soule? what is my dinner readie? At this question Rosader turning his head ascance, & bending his browes as if anger there had ploughed the furrowes of her wrath, with his eyes full of fire, he made this replie. Doest thou aske me ( Saladyne ) for thy Cates? aske some of thy Churles who are fit for such an office: I am thine equall by nature, though not by birth; and though thou hast more Cardes in the bunch, I haue as many trumps in my hands as thy selfe. Let me question with thee, why thou hast feld my Woods, spoyled my Manner houses, and made hauock of such vtensals as my father bequeathed vnto me? I tell thee Saladyne , either answere me as a brother, or I will trouble thee as an enemie. At this replie of Rosaders, Saladyne smiled as laughing at his presumption, & frowned as checking his follie: hee therefore tooke him vp thus shortlie. What sirha, well I see earlie prickes the tree that will prooue a thorne: hath my familiar conuersing with you made you coy, or my good lookes drawne you to be thus contemptuous? I can quickly remedie such a fault, and I will bende the tree while it is a wand: In faith (sir boy) I haue a snaffle for such a headstrog colt. You sirs lay holde on him and binde him, and then I will giue him a cooling carde for his choller. This made Rosader halfe mad, that stepping to a great rake that stood in the garden, he laide such loade vpon his brothers men that he hurt some of them, and made the rest of them run away. Saladyne seeing Rosader so resolute, and with his resolution so valiant, thought his heeles his best safetie, and tooke him to a loaft adioyning to the garden, whether Rosader pursued him hotlie. Saladyne afraide of his brothers furie, cried out to him thus. Rosader bee not so rash. I am thy brother and thine elder, and if I haue done thee wrong Ile make thee amends: reuenge not anger in bloud, for so shalt thou staine the vertue of olde Sir Iohn of Bourdeaux: say wherein thou art discontent and thou shalt be satisfied. Brothers frownes ought not to be periods of wrath: what man looke not so sowerlie, I knowe we shall be friends, and better friends than we haue been. For, Amantium ira amoris redintegratio est . These wordes appeased the choller of Rosader , (for hee was of a milde and courteous nature) so that he laide downe his weapons, and vpon the faith of a Gentleman assured his brother he would offer him no preiudice: wherevpon Saladyne came downe, and after a little parley they imbraced each other and became frends, and Saladyne promising Rosader the restitution of al his lands, and what fauour els (quoth he) any waies my abilitie or the nature of a brother may performe. Upon these sugred recociliations they went into the house arme in arme together, to the great content of all the old seruants of Sir Iohn of Bourdeaux . Thus continued the pad hidden in the strawe, till it chaunced that Torismond King of France had appoynted for his pleasure a day of Wrastling and of Tournament to busie his Commons heads, least being idle their thoughts should runne vpon more serious matters, and call to remembrance their old banished King; a Champion there was to stand against all commers a Norman , a man of tall stature and of great strength; so valiant, that in many such conflicts he alwaies bare away the victorie, not onely ouerthrowing them which he incountred, but often with the weight of his bodie killing them outright. Saladyne hearing of this, thinking now not to let the ball fall to the ground, but to take oportunitie by the forehead: first by secret meanes conuented with the Norman , and procured him with rich rewards to sweare, that if Rosader came within his clawes he should neuer more returne to quarrell with Saladyne for his possessions. The Norman desirous of pelfe, as ( Quis nisi mentis inops oblatum respuit aurum .) taking great gifts for little Gods, tooke the crownes of Saladyne to performe the stratagem. Hauing thus the Champion tied to his vilanous determination by oath, he prosecuted the intent of his purpose thus. Hee went to young Rosader , (who in all his thoughts reacht at honour, and gazed no lower than vertue commaunded him) and began to tell him of this Tournament and Wrastling, how the King should be there, and all the chiefe Peeres of France , with all the beautifull damosels of the Countrey: now brother (quoth he) for the honor of Sir Iohn of Bourdeaux our renowmed father, to famous that house that neuer hath been found without men approoued in Cheualrie, shewe thy resolution to be peremptorie. For my selfe thou knowest though I am eldest by birth, yet neuer hauing attempted any deedes of Armes, I am yongest to performe any Martiall exploytes, knowing better how to suruey my lands, than to charge my Launce: my brother Fernandyne he is at Paris poring on a fewe papers, hauing more insight into Sophistrie and principles of Philosophie, than any warlike indeuours: but thou Rosader the youngest in yeares, but the eldest in valour, art a man of strength and darest doo what honour allowes thee; take thou my fathers Launce, his Sword, and his Horse, and hie thee to the Tournament, and either there valiantlie crack a speare, or trie with the Norman for the palme of actiuitie. The words of Saladyne were but spurres to a free horse; for hee had scarce vttered them, ere Rosader tooke him in his armes, taking his proffer so kindly, that he promised in what he might to requite his courtesie. The next morowe was the day of the Tournament, and Rosader was so desirous to shew his heroycall thoughts, that he past the night with little sleepe: but assoone as Phoebus had vailed the Curteine of the night, and made Aurora blush with giuing her the bezoles labres in her siluer Couch, he gat him vp; and taking his leaue of his brother, mounted himselfe towards the place appoynted, thinking euery mile ten leagues till he came there. But leauing him so desirous of the iourney: to Torismond the King of France , who hauing by force banished Gerismond their lawfull King that liued as an outlaw in the Forrest of Arden , sought now by all meanes to keepe the French busied with all sportes that might breed their content. Amongst the rest he had appointed this solemne Tournament, whereunto he in most solemne manner resorted, accompanied with the twelue Peeres of France , who rather for feare than loue graced him with the shewe of their dutifull fauours: to feede their eyes, and to make the beholders pleased with the sight of most rare and glistring obiects, he had appoynted his owne daughter Alinda to be there,  & the faire Rosalynd daughter vnto Gerismond , with all the beautifull damosels that were famous for their features in all France . Thus in that place did Loue and Warre triumph in a simpathie: for such as were Martiall, might vse their Launce to bee renowmed for the excellence of their Cheualrie; and such as were amorous, might glut themselues with gazing on the beauties of most heauenly creatures. As euerie mans eye had his seuerall suruey, and fancie was partiall in their lookes, yet all in generall applauded the admirable riches that Nature bestowed on the face of Rosalynd: for vppon her cheekes there seemed a battaile betweene the Graces, who should bestow most fauours to make her excellent. The blush that gloried Luna when she kist the shepheard on the hills of Latmos was not tainted with such a pleasant dye, as the Uermilion flourisht on the siluer hue of Rosalynds countenance; her eyes were like those lampes that make the wealthie couert of the Heauens more gorgeous, sparkling fauour and disdaine; courteous and yet coye, as if in them Venus had placed all her amorets, and Diana all her chastitie. The tramells of her hayre, foulded in a call of golde, so farre surpast the burnisht glister of the mettall, as the Sunne dooth the meanest Starre in brightnesse: the tresses that foldes in the browes of Apollo were not halfe so rich to the sight; for in her haires it seemed loue had laide her selfe in ambush, to intrappe the proudest eye that durst gase vppon their excellence: what should I neede to decipher her particular beauties, when by the censure of all she was the paragon of all earthly perfection. This Rosalynd sat I say with Alinda as a beholder of these sportes, and made the Caualiers crack their lances with more courage: many deeds of Knighthoode that day were perfourmed, and many prizes were giuen according to their seuerall deserts: at last when the tournament ceased, the wrastling began; and the Norman presented himselfe as a chalenger against all commers; but he looked like Hercules when he aduaunst himselfe against Achelous ; so that the furie of his countenance amased all that durst attempt to incounter with him in any deede of actiuitie: till at last a lustie Francklin of the Countrie came with two tall men that were his Sonnes of good lyniaments and comely personage: the eldest of these dooing his obeysance to the King entered the lyst, and presented himselfe to the Norman , who straight coapt with him, and as a man that would triumph in the glorie of his strength, roused himselfe with such furie, that not onely hee gaue him the fall, but killed him with the weight of his corpulent personage: which the younger brother seeing, lept presently into the place, and thirstie after the reuenge, assayled the Norman with such valour, that at the first incounter hee brought him to his knees: which repulst so the Norman , that recouering himselfe, feare of disgrace doubling his strength, hee stept so stearnely to the young Francklin , that taking him vp in his armes he threw him against the ground so violently, that he broake his neck, and so ended his dayes with his brother. At this vnlookt for massacre, the people murmured, and were all in a deepe passion of pittie; but the Francklin , Father vnto these, neuer changed his countenance; but as a ma of a couragious resolution, tooke vp the bodies of his Sonnes without any shew of outward discontent. All this while stoode Rosader and sawe this tragedie: who noting the vndoubted vertue of the Francklins minde, alighted of from his horse, and presentlie sat downe on the grasse, and commaunded his boy to pull off his bootes, making him readie to trie the strength of this Champion; being furnished as he would, hee clapt the Francklin on the shoulder and saide thus. Bolde yeoman whose sonnes haue ended the tearme of their yeares with honour, for that I see thou scornest fortune with patience, and twhartest the iniurie of fate with content, in brooking the death of thy Sonnes: stand a while and either see mee make a third in their tragedie, or else reuenge their fall with an honourable triumph; the Francklin seeing so goodlie a Gentleman to giue him such courteous comfort, gaue him hartie thankes, with promise to pray for his happie successe. With that Rosader vailed bonnet to the King, and lightlie lept within the lists, where noting more the companie than the combatant, hee cast his eye vpon the troupe of Ladies that glistered there like the starres of heauen, but at last Loue willing to make him as amourous as he was valiant, presented him with the sight of Rosalynd , whose admirable beautie so inueagled the eye of Rosader , that forgetting himselfe, he stoode and fed his lookes on the fauour of Rosalynds face, which she perceiuing, blusht: which was such a doubling of her beauteous excellence, that the bashfull red of Aurora at the sight of vnacquainted Phaeton was not halfe so glorious: The Norman seeing this young Gentleman fettered in the lookes of the Ladies, draue him out of his memento with a shake by the shoulder; Rosader looking back with an angrie frowne, as if he had been wakened from some pleasant dreame, discouered to all by the furie of his countenance that he was a man of some high thoughts: but when they all noted his youth, and the sweetenesse of his visage, with a generall applause of fauours, they grieued that so goodly a young man should venture in so base an action: but seeing it were to his dishonour to hinder him from his enterprise, they wisht him to be graced with the palme of victorie. After Rosader was thus called out of his memento by the Norman , hee roughlie clapt to him with so fierce an incounter, that they both fell to the ground, and with the violence of the fall were forced to breathe: in which space the Norman called to minde by all tokens, that this was hee whom Saladyne had appoynted him to kil; which coniecture made him stretch euerie limb,  & trie euerie sinew, that working his death he might recouer the golde, which so bountifully was promised him. On the contrarie part, Rosader while he breathed was not idle, but still cast his eye vppon Rosalynd , who to incourage him with a fauour, lent him such an amorous looke, as might haue made the most coward desperate: which glance of Rosalynd so fiered the passionate desires of Rosader , that turning to the Norman hee ran vpon him and braued him with a strong encounter; the Norman receiued him as valiantly, that there was a sore combat, hard to iudge on whose side fortune would be prodigall. At last Rosader calling to minde the beautie of his new Mistresse, the fame of his Fathers honours, and the disgrace that should fall to his house by his misfortune, roused himselfe and threw the Norman against the ground, falling vpon his Chest with so willing a waight, that the Norman yeelded nature her due, and Rosader the victorie. The death of this Champion; as it highlie contented the Francklin , as a man satisfied with reuenge, so it drue the King and all the Peeres into a great admiration, that so young yeares and so beautifull a personage, should containe such martiall excellence: but when they knew him to be the yongest Sonne of Sir Iohn of Bourdeaux , the King rose from his seate and imbraced him, and the Peeres intreated him with al fauourable courtesie, commending both his valour and his vertues, wishing him to goe forward in such haughtie deedes, that he might attaine to the glorie of his Fathers honourable fortunes. As the King and Lordes graced him with embracing, so the Ladies fauored him with their lookes, especially Rosalynd , whome the beautie and valour of Rosader had alreadie touched; but she accounted loue a toye, and fancie a momentarie passion, that as it was taken in with a gaze, might bee shaken off with a winck; and therefore feared not to dallie in the flame, and to make Rosader knowe she affected him; tooke from hir neck a Iewell, and sent it by a Page to the young Gentleman. The Prize that Venus gaue to Paris was not halfe so pleasing to the Troian , as this Iemme was to Rosader: for if fortune had sworne to make him sole Monark of the world, he would rather haue refused such dignitie, than haue lost the iewell sent him by Rosalynd . To retourne her with the like he was vnfurnished, and yet that hee might more than in his lookes discouer his affection, he stept into a tent, and taking pen and paper writ this fancie.  Two Sunnes at once from one faire heauen there shinde, Ten branches from two boughes tipt all with roses, Pure lockes more golden than is golde refinde, Two pearled rowes that Natures pride incloses: Two mounts faire marble white, downe-soft and daintie, A snow died orbe; where loue increast by pleasure Full wofull makes my heart, and bodie faintie: Hir faire (my woe) exceedes all thought and measure. In lines confusde my lucklesse harme appeereth; Whom sorrow clowdes, whom pleasant smiling cleereth. This sonnet he sent to Rosalynd , which when she read, she blusht, but with a sweete content in that she perceaued loue had alotted her so amorous a seruant. Leauing her to her new intertayned fancies, againe to Rosader ; who triumphing in the glory of this conquest, accompanied with a troupe of young Gentlemen, that were desirous to be his familiars, went home to his brother Saladynes , who was walking before the gates, to heare what successe his brother Rosader should haue, assuring him self of his death, and deuising how wt dissimuled sorrow, to celebrate his funeralls; as he was in this thought, hee cast vp his eye, & sawe where Rosader returned with the garlande on his heade, as hauing won the prize, accompanied with a crew of boone companions; greeued at this, hee stepped in and shut the gate. Rosader seeing this, and not looking for such vnkinde intertaynement, blusht at the disgrace, and yet smothering his griefe with a smile, he turned to the Gentlemen, and desired them to holde his brother excused, for hee did not this vpon any malicious intent or niggardize, but being brought vp in the countrie, he absented him selfe, as not finding his nature fit for such youthfull companie. Thus hee sought to shadow abuses proffred him by his brother, but in vayne, for he could by no meanes be suffered to enter: whereupon hee ran his foote against the doore, and brake it open; drawing his sworde and entring bouldly into the Hall, where hee founde none (for all were fled) but one Adam Spencer an English man, who had been an olde and trustie seruant to Sir Iohn of Bourdeaux : he for the loue he bare to his deceased Maister, fauored the part of Rosader , and gaue him and his such intertaynement as he coulde. Rosader gaue him thankes, and looking about, seeing the hall empty, saide, Gentlemen, you are welcome, frolicke and be merie, you shall be sure to haue Wine enough, whatsoeuer your fare be, I tell you Caualiers my brother hath in his house, fiue tunne of wine, and as long as that lasteth, I beshrewe him that spares his liquor. With that he burst open the butterie dore, and with the helpe of Adam Spencer , couered the Tables, and set downe whatsoeuer he could finde in the house, but what they wanted in meate, Rosader supplied with drinke, yet had they royall cheere, and withall such a hartie welcome, as would haue made the coursest meates, seeme delicates. After they had feasted and frolickt it twise or thrise with an vpsey freeze, they all tooke their leaues of Rosader and departed. Assoone as they were gone Rosader growing impatient of the abuse, drewe his sworde, and swore to be reuenged on the discurteous Saladyne: yet by the meanes of Adam Spencer , who sought to continue friendship and amitie betwixt the brethren, and through the flattering submission of Saladyne , they were once agayne reconciled, & put vp all fore passed iniuries, with a peaceable agreement, liuing together for a good space in such brotherly loue, as did not onely reioyce the seruants, but made all the Gentlemen and bordring neighbours glad of such friendlie concord. Saladyne hiding fire in the straw, and concealing a poysoned hate in a peaceable countenance, yet deferring the intent of his wrath till fitter opportunitie, he shewed him selfe a great fauorer of his brothers vertuous endeuours: where leauing them in this happie league, let vs returne to Rosalynd . Rosalynd returning home from the triumph, after she waxed solitarie, loue presented her with the Idea of Rosaders perfection, and taking her at discouert, strooke her so deepe, as she felt her selfe grow passing passionate: she began to call to minde the comelinesse of his person, the honor of his parents, and the vertues that excelling both, made him so gracious in the eies of euerie one. Sucking in thus the hony of loue, by imprinting in her thoughtes his rare qualities, she began to surfit with the contemplation of his vertuous conditions, but when she cald to remembrance her present estate, & the hardnesse of her fortunes, desire began to shrink, & fancy to vale bonnet, that betweene a Chaos of confused thoughtes, she began to debate with her selfe in this manner. Infortunate Rosalynd , whose misfortunes are more than thy yeeres, and whose passions are greater than thy patience. The blossomes of thy youth, are mixt with the frostes of enuie, and the hope of thy ensuing frutes, perish in the bud. Thy father is by Torismond banisht from the crowne,  & thou the vnhappie daughter of a King detained captiue, liuing as disquieted in thy thoughts, as thy father disconteted in his exile. Ah Rosalynd what cares wait vpo a crown, what griefes are incident to dignitie? what sorrowes haunt royal Pallaces? The greatest seas haue the sorest stormes, the highest birth subiect to the most bale, and of al trees the Cedars soonest shake with the winde: small Currents are euer calme, lowe valleyes not scorcht in any lightnings, nor base men tyed to anye balefull preiudice. Fortune flies, & if she touch pouertie, it is with her heele, rather disdayning their want with a frowne, than enuying their wealth with disparagement. Oh Rosalynd , hadst thou been borne lowe, thou hadst not fallen so high; and yet being great of bloud, thine honour is more, if thou brookest misfortune with patience. Suppose I contrary fortune with content, yet Fates vnwilling to haue me any way happie, haue forced loue to set my thoughts on fire with fancie. Loue Rosalynd ? becommeth it women in distresse to thinke of loue? Tush, desire hath no respect of persons, Cupid is blinde and shooteth at randon, as soone hitting a rag, as a robe, and percing assoone the bosome of a Captiue, as the breast of a Libertine. Thou speakest it poore Rosalynd by experience, for being euerie way distrest, surcharged with cares, and ouergrowne with sorrowes, yet amidst the heape of all these mishaps, loue hath lodged in thy hart the perfection of young Rosader , a man euery way absolute as well for his inward life, as for his outward lyniaments, able to content the eye with beauty, and the eare with the report of his vertue. But consider Rosalind his fortunes, and thy present estate, thou art poore and without patrimonie, and yet the daughter of a Prince, he a younger brother, and voide of such possessions as eyther might maintayne thy dignities, or reuenge thy fathers iniuries. And hast thou not learned this of other Ladies, that louers cannot liue by lookes; that womens eares are sooner content with a dram of giue me, than a pound of heare me; that gould is sweeter than eloquence; that loue is a fire, & wealth is the fewell; that Venus Coffers should be euer full. Then Rosalynd , seeing Rosader is poore, thinke him lesse beautifull, because he is in want, and account his vertues but qualities of course, for that hee is not indued with wealth. Doth not Horace tell thee what methode is to be vsed in loue,  Querenda pecunia primum, post nummos virtus. Tush Rosalynd , be not ouer rash; leape not before thou looke; eyther loue such a one as may with his landes purchase thy liberty, or els loue not at all. Choose not a fayre face with an emptie purse, but say as most women vse to say,  Si nihil attuleris, ibis Homere foras. Why Rosalynd , can such base thoughtes harbour in such high beauties? Can the degree of a Princes, the daughter of Gerismond harbour such seruile conceites, as to prize gold more than honor, or to measure a Gentleman by his wealth, not by his vertues. No Rosalynd , blush at thy base resolution, and say if thou louest, either Rosader or none: and why? because Rosader is both beautifull and vertuous. Smiling to her selfe to thinke of her new entertayned passions, taking vp her Lute that lay by her, she warbled out this dittie.  Loue in my bosome like a Bee doth sucke his sweete: Now with his wings he playes with me, now with his feete. Within mine eies he makes his neast, His bed amidst my tender breast, My kisses are his daily feast; And yet he robs me of my rest. Ah wanton, will ye? And if J sleepe, then pearcheth he with pretie flight, And makes his pillow of my knee the liuelong night. Strike I my lute he tunes the string, He musicke playes if so I sing, He lends me euerie louelie thing; Yet cruell he my heart doth sting. Whist wanton still ye? Els I with roses euerie day will whip you hence; And binde you when you long to play, for your offence. Ile shut mine eyes to keepe you in, Ile make you fast it for your sinne, Ile count your power not worth a pinne; Ahlas what hereby shall I winne, Jf he gainsay me? What if J beate the wanton boy with manie a rod? He will repay me with annoy, because a God. Then sit thou safely on my knee, And let thy bowre my bosome be: Lurke in mine eyes J like of thee: Oh Cupid so thou pitie me. Spare not but play thee. Scarce had Rosalynde ended her Madrigale, before Torismond came in with his daughter Alinda , and manie of the Peeres of France , who were enamoured of her beautie: which Torismond perceiuing, fearing least her perfection might be the beginning of his preiudice, and the hope of his fruite ende in the beginning of her blossomes, hee thought to banish her from the Court: for quoth he to himselfe, her face is so full of fauour, that it pleades pitie in the eye of euerie man; her beautie is so heauenly and deuine, that she will prooue to me as Helen did to Priam: some one of the Peeres will ayme at her loue, ende the marriage, and then in his wiues right attempt the kingdome. To preuent therefore had I wist in all these actions, she tarries not about the Court, but shall (as an exile) either wander to her father, or els seeke other fortunes. In this humour, with a stearne countenance full of wrath, hee breathed out this censure vnto her before the Peeres, that charged hee that that night shee were not seene about the Court: for (quoth he) I haue heard of thy aspiring speaches, and intended treasons. This doome was strange vnto Rosalynde , and presently couered with the shield of her innocence, shee boldly brake out in reuerend tearmes to haue cleared her selfe: but Torismond would admit of no reason, nor durst his Lordes plead for Rosalynde , although her beautie had made some of them passionate, seeing the figure of wrath portraied in his brow. Standing thus all mute, and Rosalynde amazed, Alinda who loued her more than her selfe, with griefe in her heart, & teares in her eyes, falling downe on her knees, began to intreate her father thus: If (mightie Torismond ) I offende in pleading for my friend, let the law of amitie craue pardon for my boldnes; for where there is depth of affection, there friendship alloweth a priuiledge. Rosalynde and I haue beene fostered vp from our infancies, and nursed vnder the harbour of our conuersing together with such priuate familiarities, that custome had wrought an vnion of our nature, and the sympathie of our affections such a secrete loue, that we haue two bodies, and one soule. Then meruaile not (great Torismond ) if seeing my friend distrest, I finde my selfe perplexed with a thousand sorrowes: for her vertuous and honourable thoughts (which are the glories that maketh women excellent) they be such, as may challenge loue, and race out suspition: her obedience to your Maiestie, I referre to the censure of your owne eye, that since her fathers exile hath smothered all griefes with patience, and in the absence of nature, hath honoured you with all dutie, as her owne Father by nouriture: not in word vttering anie discontent, nor in thought (as farre as coniecture may reach) hammering on reuenge; onely in all her actions seeking to please you, & to winne my fauour. Her wisedome, silence, chastitie, and other such rich qualities, I need not decypher: onely it rests for me to conclude in one word, that she is innocent. If then, Fortune who triumphs in varietie of miseries, hath presented some enuious person (as minister of her intended stratagem) to taint Rosalynde with anie surmise of treason, let him be brought to her face, and confirme his accusation by witnesses; which prooued, let her die, and Alinda will execute the massacre. If none can auouch anie confirmed relation of her intent, vse Iustice my Lord, it is the glorie of a King, and let her liue in your wonted fauour: for if you banish her, my selfe as copartner of her hard fortunes, wil participate in exile some part of her extremities. Torismond (at this speach of Alinda ) couered his face with such a frowne, as Tyrannie seemed to sit triumphant in his forehead, and checke her vp with such taunts, as made the Lords (that onlie were hearers) to tremble. Proude girle (quoth he) hath my lookes made thee so light of tung, or my fauours incouraged thee to be so forward, that thou darest presume to preach after thy father? Hath not my yeares more experience than thy youth, and the winter of mine age deeper insight into ciuill policie, than the prime of thy florishing daies? The olde Lion auoides the toyles where the yong one leapes into the net: the care of age is prouident and foresees much: suspition is a vertue, where a man holds his enemie in his bosome. Thou fonde girle measurest all by present affection, & as thy heart loues thy thoughts censure: but if thou knewest that in liking Rosalynd thou hatchest vp a bird to pecke out thine owne eyes, thou wouldst intreate as much for her absence, as now thou delightest in her presence. But why do I alleadge policie to thee? sit you downe huswife and fall to your needle: if idlenesse make you so wanton, or libertie so malipert, I can quicklie tie you to a sharper taske: and you (maide) this night be packing either into Arden to your father, or whether best it shall content your humour, but in the Court you shall not abide. This rigorous replie of Torismond nothing amazed Alinda , for still she prosecuted her plea in the defence of Rosalynd , wishing her father (if his censure might not be reuerst) that he would appoint her partner of her exile; which if he refused to doo, either she would (by some secret meanes) steale out and followe her, or els end her daies with some desperate kinde of death. When Torismond heard his daughter so resolute, his heart was so hardned against her, that he set downe a definitiue and peremptorie sentence that they should both be banished: which presentlie was done. The Tyrant rather choosing to hazard the losse of his only child, than any waies to put in question the state of his kingdome: so suspicious and feareful is the conscience of an vsurper. Well, although his Lords perswaded him to retaine his owne daughter, yet his resolution might not bee reuerst, but both of them must away from the court without either more companie or delay. In he went with great melancholie, and left these two Ladies alone. Rosalynd waxed very sad, and sat downe and wept. Alinda she smiled, and sitting by her friende began thus to comfort her. Why how now Rosalynd , dismaide with a frowne of contrarie fortune? Haue I not oft heard thee say that high minds were discouered in fortunes contempt, and heroycall seene in the depth of extremities? Thou wert wont to tell others that complained of distresse, that the sweetest salue for miserie was patience; and the onlie medicine for want, that precious implaister of content: being such a good Phisition to others, wilt thou not minister receipts to thy selfe? But perchance thou wilt say:  Consulenti nunquam caput doluit. Why then, if the patients that are sicke of this disease can finde in themselues neither reason to perswade, nor arte to cure; yet ( Rosalynd ) admit of the counsaile of a friend, and applie the salues that may appease thy passions. If thou grieuest that beeing the daughter of a Prince, and enuie thwarteth thee with such hard exigents, thinke that royaltie is a faire marke; that Crownes haue crosses when mirth is in Cottages; that the fairer the Rose is, the sooner it is bitten with Catterpillers; the more orient the Pearle is, the more apt to take a blemish; and the greatest birth, as it hath most honour, so it hath much enuie. If then Fortune aimeth at the fairest, be patient Rosalynd ; for first by thine exile thou goest to thy father; nature is higher prised than wealth, & the loue of ones parents ought to bee more precious than all dignities: why then doth my Rosalynd grieue at the frowne of Torismond , who by offering her a preiudice, proffers her a greater pleasure? and more (mad lasse) to be melancholie, when thou hast with thee Alinda a frend, who will be a faithfull copartner of al thy misfortunes, who hath left her father to followe thee, and chooseth rather to brooke all extremities than to forsake thy presence. What Rosalynd:  Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris. Cheerelie woman, as wee haue been bedfellowes in royaltie, we will be fellowe mates in pouertie: I will euer bee thy Alinda , and thou shalt euer rest to me Rosalynd: so shall the world canonize our friendship, and speake of Rosalynd and Alinda , as they did of Pilades and Orestes . And if euer Fortune smile and wee returne to our former honour, then folding our selues in the sweete of our friendship, wee shall merelie say (calling to minde our forepassed miseries);  Olim haec meminisse inuabit. At this Rosalynd began to comfort her; and after shee had wept a fewe kind teares in the bosome of her Alinda , she gaue her heartie thanks, and then they sat them downe to consult how they should trauell. Alinda grieued at nothing but that they might haue no man in their companie: saying, it would be their greatest preiudice in that two women went wandring without either guide or attendant. Tush (quoth Rosalynd ) art thou a woman, and hast not a sodaine shift to preuent a misfortune? I (thou seest) am of a tall stature, and would very well become the person and apparell of a page, thou shalt bee my Mistris, and I will play the man so properly, that (trust me) in what company so euer I come I will not bee discouered; I will buy mee a suite, and haue my rapier very handsomely at my side, and if any knaue offer wrong, your page wil shew him the point of his weapon. At this Alinda smiled, and vpon this they agreed, and presentlie gathered vp all their Iewels, which they trussed vp in a Casket, and Rosalynd in all hast prouided her of roabes, and Alinda (from her royall weedes) put her selfe in more homelie attire. Thus fitted to the purpose, away goe these two friends, hauing now changed their names, Alinda being called Aliena , and Rosalynd Ganimede: they trauailed along the Uineyards, and by many by-waies; at last got to the Forrest side, where they trauailed by the space of two or three daies without seeing anie creature, being often in danger of wild beasts, and payned with many passionate sorrowes. Now the black Oxe began to tread on their feete, and Alinda thought of her wonted royaltie: but when she cast her eyes on her Rosalynd , she thought euerie danger a step to honour. Passing thus on along, about midday they came to a Fountaine, compast with a groue of Cipresse trees, so cunninglie and curiouslie planted, as if some Goddesse had intreated Nature in that place to make her an Arbour. By this Fountaine sat Aliena and her Ganimede , and foorth they pulled such victualls as they had, and fed as merilie as if they had been in Paris with all the Kings delicates: Aliena onely grieuing that they could not so much as meete with a shepheard to discourse them the way to some place where they might make their aboade. At last Ganimede casting vp his eye espied where on a tree was ingrauen certaine verses: which assoone as he espied, he cried out; bee of good cheere Mistris, I spie the figures of men; for here in these trees be ingrauen certaine verses of shepheards, or some other swaines that inhabite here about. With that Aliena start vp ioyfull to heare these newes; and looked, where they found carued in the barke of a Pine tree this passion.  Makes Tanais hard, and mountaines siluer old: Had I complain'd vnto a marble stone; Or to the flouds bewraide my bitter mone, I then could beare the burden of my griefe. But euen the pride of Countries at thy birth, Whil'st heauens did smile did new aray the earth with flowers chiefe. Yet thou the flower of beautie blessed borne, Hast pretie lookes, but all attir'd in scorne. Had J the power to weepe sweet Mirrhas teares; Or by my plaints to pearce repining cares; Hadst thou the heart to smile at my complaint; To scorne the woes that doth my heart attaint, I then could beare the burden of my griefe. But not my teares, but truth with thee preuailes, And seeming sowre my sorowes thee assailes: yet small reliefe. For if thou wilt thou art of marble hard; And if thou please my suite shall soone be heard. No doubt (quoth Aliena ) this poesie is the passion of some perplexed shepheard, that being enamoured of some faire and beautifull Shepheardesse, suffered some sharpe repulse, and therefore complained of the crueltie of his Mistris. You may see (quoth Ganimede ) what mad cattell you women be, whose hearts sometimes are made of Adamant that will touch with no impression; and sometime of waxe that is fit for euerie forme: they delight to be courted, and then they glorie to seeme coy; and when they are most desired then they freese with disdaine: and this fault is so common to the sex, that you see it painted out in the shepheards passions, who found his Mistris as froward as he was enamoured. And I pray you (quoth Aliena ) if your roabes were off, what mettall are you made of that you are so satyricall against women? Is it not a foule bird defiles the owne nest? Beware ( Ganimede ) that Rosader heare you not; if he doo, perchance you will make him leape so far from loue, that he wil anger euery vain in your hart. Thus (quoth Ganimede ) I keepe decorum, I speake now as I am Alienas page, not as I am Gerismonds daughter: for put me but into a peticoate, and I will stand in defiance to the vttermost that women are courteous, constant, vertuous, and what not. Stay there (quoth Aliena ) and no more words; for yonder be Caracters grauen vpon the barke of the tall Beech tree: let vs see (quoth Ganimede): and with that they read a fancie written to this effect.  First shall the heauens want starrie light; The seas be robbed of their waues; The day want sunne, and sunne want bright; The night want shade, the dead men graues; The Aprill, flowers and leafe and tree, Before I false my faith to thee. First shall the tops of highest hills By humble plaines be ouerpride; And Poets scorne the Muses quills, And fish forsake the water glide; And Iris loose her coloured weed. Before I faile thee at thy need. First direfull hate shall turne to peace, And loue relent in deepe disdaine; And death his fatall stroake shall cease, And enuie pitie euery paine; And pleasure mourne, and sorowe smile, Before I talke of any guile. First time shall stay his staylesse race, And winter blesse his browes with corne; And snow bemoysten Julies face; And winter spring, and sommer mourne, Before my pen by helpe of fame, Cease to recite thy sacred name. Montanus.  No doubt (quoth Ganimede ) this protestation grewe from one full of passions. I am of that mind too (quoth Aliena ) but see I pray, when poore women seeke to keepe themselues chast, how men woo them with many fained promises, alluring with sweet words as the Syrens , and after proouing as trothlesse as AEneas . Thus promised Demophoon to his Phillis , but who at last grewe more false? The reason was (quoth Ganimede ) that they were womens sonnes, and tooke that fault of their mother; for if man had growen from man, as Adam did from the earth, men had neuer been troubled with inconstancie. Leaue off (quoth Aliena ) to taunt thus bitterly, or els Ile pul off your pages apparell and whip you (as Venus doth her wantons) with nettles. So you will (quoth Ganimede ) perswade me to flattrie, and that needs not: but come (seeing we haue found heere by this Fount the trackt of Shepheards by their Madrigals and Roundelaies) let vs forward; for either we shall finde some foldes, sheepcoates, or els some cottages wherein for a day or two to rest. Cotent (quoth Aliena ) and with that they rose vp, and marched forward till towards the euen: and then comming into a faire valley (compassed with mountaines, whereon grewe many pleasant shrubbs) they might descrie where two flocks of sheepe did feede. Then looking about, they might perceiue where an old shepheard sat (and with him a yong swaine) vnder a couert most pleasantlie scituated. The ground where they sat was diapred with Floras riches, as if she ment to wrap Tellus in the glorie of her vestments: round about in the forme of an Amphitheater were most curiouslie planted Pine trees, interseamed with Limons and Citrons, which with the thicknesse of their boughes so shadowed the place, that Phoebus could not prie into the secret of that Arbour; so vnited were the tops with so thicke a closure, that Venus might there in her iollitie haue dallied vnseene with her deerest paramour. Fast by (to make the place more gorgeous) was there a Fount so Christalline and cleere, that it seemed Diana with her Driades and Hemadriades had that spring, as the secrete of all their bathings. In this glorious Arbour sat these two shepheards (seeing their sheepe feede) playing on their pipes many pleasant tunes, and from musick and melodie falling into much amorous chat: drawing more nigh wee might descrie the countenance of the one to be full of sorowe, his face to be the verie pourtraiture of discontent, and his eyes full of woes, that liuing he seemed to dye: wee (to heare what these were) stole priuilie behind the thicke, where we ouerheard this discourse.  Why leaues thy pipe his pleasure and delight? Yong are thy yeares, thy cheekes with roses dight: Then sing for ioy (sweet swaine) and sigh no more. This milke white Poppie and this climbing Pine Both promise shade; then sit thee downe and sing, And make these woods with pleasant notes to ring. Till Phoebus daine all Westward to decline. Ah ( Coridon ) vnmeet is melodie To him whom proud contempt hath ouerborne: Slaine are my ioyes by Phoebes bitter scorne, Farre hence my weale and nere my ieopardie. Loues burning brand is couched in my brest, Making a Phoenix of my faintfull hart: And though his furie doo inforce my smart, Ay blyth am I to honour his behest. Preparde to woes since so my Phoebe wills, My lookes dismaid since Phoebe will disdaine: I banish blisse and welcome home my paine; So streame my teares as showers from Alpine hills. Jn errours maske I blindfolde iudgements eye, J fetter reason in the snares of lust, J seeme secure, yet know not how to trust; J liue by that, which makes me liuing die. Deuoyd of rest, companion of distresse, Plague to my selfe, consumed by my thought; How may my voyce or pipe in tune be brought? Since I am reft of solace and delight. Ah Lorrell lad, what makes thee Herry loue? A sugred harme, a poyson full of pleasure, A painted shrine ful-fild with rotten treasure, A heauen in shew, a hell to them that proue. Againe, in seeming shadowed still with want, A broken staffe which follie doth vpholde, A flower that fades with euerie frostie colde, An orient rose sprong from a wythred plant. A minutes ioy to gaine a world of greefe, A subtill net to snare the idle minde, A seeing Scorpion, yet in seeming blinde, A poore reioyce, a plague without releefe. For thy Montanus follow mine arreede, (Whom age hath taught the traynes that fancie vseth) Leaue foolish loue; for beautie wit abuseth, And drownes (by follie) vertues springing seede. So blames the childe the flame, because it burnes; And bird the snare, because it doth intrap; And fooles true loue, because of sorrie hap; And saylers cursse the ship that ouerturnes: But would the childe forbeare to play with flame, And birdes beware to trust the fowlers ginne, And fooles foresee before they fall and sinne, And maisters guide their ships in better frame; The childe would praise the fire, because it warmes; And birds reioyce, to see the fowler faile; And fooles preuent, before their plagues preuaile; And saylers blesse the barke that saues from harmes. Ah Coridon , though manie be thy yeares, And crooked elde hath some experience left; Yet is thy minde of iudgement quite bereft In view of loue, whose power in me appeares. The ploughman little wots to turne the pen, Or bookeman skills to guide the ploughmans cart, Nor can the cobler count the tearmes of Art, Nor base men iudge the thoughts of mightie men; Nor wythered age (vnmeete for beauties guide, Vncapable of loues impression) Discourse of that, whose choyce possession May neuer to so base a man be tied. But I (whom nature makes of tender molde, And youth most pliant yeeldes to fancies fire) Doo builde my hauen and heauen on sweete desire, On sweete desire more deere to me than golde. Thinke I of loue, o how my lines aspire? How hast the Muses to imbrace my browes, And hem my temples in with lawrell bowes, And fill my braines with chast and holy fire? Then leaue my lines their homely equipage, Mounted beyond the circle of the Sunne; Amaz'd I read the stile when I haue done, And Herry Loue that sent that heauenly rage. Of Phoebe then, of Phoebe then I sing, Drawing the puritie of all the spheares, The pride of earth, or what in heauen appeares, Her honoured face and fame to light to bring. Jn fluent numbers and in pleasant vaines, J rob both sea and earth of all their state, To praise her parts: I charme both time and fate, To blesse the Nymph that yeeldes me loue sicke paines. My sheepe are turnd to thoughts, whom froward will Guides in the restlesse Laborynth of loue, Feare lends them pasture wheresoere they moue, And by their death their life renueth still, My sheephooke is my pen, mine oaten reede My paper, where my manie woes are written; Thus silly swaine (with loue and fancie bitten) J trace the plaines of paine in wofull weede. Yet are my cares, my broken sleepes, my teares, My dreames, my doubts, for Phoebe sweete to me: Who wayteth heauen in sorrowes vale must be, And glorie shines where danger most appeares. Then Coridon although I blythe me not, Blame me not man, since sorrow is my sweete; So willeth Loue, and Phoebe thinkes it meete, And kinde Montanus liketh well his lot. Oh staylesse youth, by errour so misguided; Where will prescribeth lawes to perfect wits, Where reason mournes, and blame in triumph sits, And follie poysoneth all that time prouided. With wilfull blindnesse bleard, preparde to shame, Prone to neglect Occasion when she smiles: Alas that Loue (by fond and froward guiles) Should make thee tract the path to endlesse blame. Ah (my Montanus ) cursed is the charme That hath bewitched so thy youthfull eyes: Leaue off in time to like these vanities; Be forward to thy good, and fly thy harme. As manie bees as Hibla daily shields, As manie frie as fleete on Oceans face, As manie heards as on the earth doo trace, As manie flowres as decke the fragrant fields, As manie starres as glorious heauen containes, As manie stormes as wayward winter weepes, As manie plagues as hell inclosed keepes; So manie greefes in loue, so manie paines. Suspitions, thoughts, desires, opinions, praiers, Mislikes, misdeedes, fond ioyes, and fained peace, Jllusions, dreames, great paines, and small increase, Vowes, hopes, acceptance, scornes, and deepe despaires, Truce, warre, and woe doo waite at beauties gate; Time lost, lament, reports, and priuie grudge, And last, fierce Loue is but a partiall Iudge, Who yeeldes for seruice shame, for friendship hate, All Adder-like I stop mine eares (fond swaine) So charme no more; for I will neuer change. Call home thy flockes in time that stragling range: For loe, the Sunne declineth hence amaine. Jn amore h aec omnia insunt vitia, induciae, inimicitiae, bellum, pax rursum: incerta haec si tu postules, ratione certa fieri nihilo plus agas, quam sides operam, vt cum ratione insanias.  The shepheards hauing thus ended their Eglogue, Aliena stept with Ganimede from behinde the thicket: at whose sodaine sight the shepheards arose, and Aliena saluted them thus; Shepheards all haile, (for such wee deeme you by your flockes) and Louers, good lucke; (for such you seeme by your passions) our eyes being witnesse of the one, and our eares of the other. Although not by Loue, yet by Fortune, I am a distressed Gentlewoman, as sorrowful as you are passionate, and as full of woes as you of perplexed thoughts: wandring this way in a forrest vnknowen, onely I and my Page, wearied with trauaile would faine haue some place of rest. May you appoint vs anie place of quiet harbour, (be it neuer so meane) I shall be thankfull to you, contented in my selfe, and gratefull to whosoeuer shall bee mine hoste. Coridon hearing the Gentlewoman speak so courteously returned her mildly and reuerentlie this aunswere. Faire Mistres, we returne you as heartie a welcome, as you gaue vs a courteous salute. A shepheard I am, & this a louer, as watchful to please his wench, as to feed his sheep: full of fancies, and therefore (say I) full of follies. Exhort him I may, but perswade him I cannot; for Loue admits neither of counsaile, nor reason. But leauing him to his passions, if you be distrest, I am sorrowfull such a faire creature is crost wt calamitie: pray for you I may, but releeue you I cannot: marry, if you want lodging, if you vouch to shrowd your selues in a shepheards cotage, my house (for this night) shalbe your harbour. Aliena thankt Coridon greatly, and presently sate her downe and Ganimede by her. Coridon looking earnestly vppon her, and with a curious suruey viewing all her perfections, applauded (in his thought) her excellence, and pitying her distresse, was desirous to heare the cause of her misfortunes, began to question with her thus. If I should not (faire Damosell) occasionate offence, or renue your griefes by rubbing the scarre, I would faine craue so much fauour, as to know the cause of your misfortune: and why, and whether you wander with your page in so dangerous a forrest. Aliena (that was as courteous as she was faire) made this reply; Shepheard, a friendlie demaund ought neuer to be offensiue, and questions of courtesie carrie priuiledged pardons in their forheads. Know therfore, to discouer my fortunes were to renue my sorrowes, and I should by discoursing my mishaps, but rake fier out of the cinders. Therefore let this suffice (gentle shepheard) my distresse is as great as my trauell is dangerous, and I wander in this forrest, to light on some cottage where I and my Page may dwell: for I meane to buy some farme, and a flocke of sheepe, and so become a shepheardesse, meaning to liue low, and content me with a countrey life: for I haue heard the swaynes say, that they drunke without suspition, & slept without care. Marry Mistres (quoth Coridon ) if you meane so you came in a good time, for my landslord intends to sell both the farme I till, and the flocke I keepe, & cheap you may haue them for readie money: and for a shepheards life (oh Mistresse) did you but liue a while in their content, you would saye the Court were rather a place of sorrowe, than of solace. Here (Mistresse) shall not Fortune thwart you, but in meane misfortunes, as the losse of a few sheepe, which, as it breedes no beggerie, so it can bee no extreame preiudice: the next yeare may mend al with a fresh increase. Enuie stirres not vs, wee couet not to climbe, our desires mount not aboue our degrees, nor our thoughts aboue our fortunes. Care cannot harbour in our cottages, nor doo our homely couches know broken slumbers: as we exceede not in diet, so we haue inough to satisfie: and Mistres I haue so much Latin, Satis est quod sufficit . By my troth shepheard (quoth Aliena ) thou makest me in loue with your countrey life, and therefore sende for thy Landslord, and I will buy thy farme and thy flockes,  & thou shalt still (vnder me) be ouerseer of them both: onely for pleasure sake I and my Page wil serue you, lead the flocks to the field, and folde them: thus will I liue quiet, vnknowen, and contented. This newes so gladded the hart of Coridon , that he should not be put out of his farme, that (putting off his shepheards bonnet) he did her all the reuerence that he might. But all this while sate Montanus in a muse thinking of the crueltie of his Phoebe , whom he woed long, but was in no hope to winne. Ganimede who still had the remembrance of Rosader in his thoughts, tooke delight to see the poore shepheard passionate, laughing at loue that in all his actions was so imperious. At last when shee had noted his teares that stole downe his cheekes, and his sighes that broake from the center of his heart, pittying his lament, she demaunded of Coridon why the young shepheard looked so sorrowfull? Oh sir (quoth he) the boy is in loue. Why (quoth Ganimede ) can shepheards loue? I (quoth Montanus ) and ouerloue, els shouldst not thou see mee so pensiue. Loue (I tell thee) is as precious in a shepheards eye as in the lookes of a King, and we countrey swaynes intertain fancie with as great delight, as the proudest courtier doth affection. Opportunitie (that is the sweetest freind to Venus ) harboureth in our cottages, and loyaltie (the chiefest fealtie that Cupid requires) is found more among shepheards than higher degrees. Then aske not if such silly swaynes can loue? What is the cause then, quoth Ganimede , that Loue being so sweete to thee, thou lookest so sorrowfull? Because, quoth Montanus , the partie beloued is froward: and hauing courtesie in her lookes, holdeth disdaine in her tongues ende. What hath she then quoth Aliena , in her heart? Desire (I hope Madame) quoth he: or els my hope lost, despaire in Loue were death. As thus they chatted, the Sunne being readie to set, and they not hauing folded their sheepe, Coridon requested she would sit there with her Page, till Montanus and he lodged their sheepe for that night. You shall goe quoth Aliena , but first I will intreate Montanus to sing some amorous Sonnet, that hee made when he hath been deeply passionate. That I will quoth Montanus: and with that he began thus.  Phoebe sate Sweete she sate, Sweete sate Phoebe when I saw her, White her brow, Coy her eye: Brow and eye how much you please me? Words J spent, Sighes J sent, Sighes and words could neuer draw her. Oh my loue Thou art lost, Since no sight could euer ease thee. Phoebe sat By a fount; Sitting by a fount J spide her: Sweet her touch, Rare her voyce; Touch and voice what may distaine you? As she sung, I did sigh, And by sighs whilst that I tride her. Oh mine eyes You did loose Her first sight whose want did paine you. Phoebes flocks White as wooll, Yet were Phoebes locks more whiter. Phoebes eyes Douelike mild, Douelike eyes both mild and cruell. Montan sweares In your lampes He will die for to delight her. Phoebe yeeld, Or I die; Shall true hearts be fancies fuell? Montanus had no sooner ended his sonnet, but Coridon with a lowe courtesie rose vp and went with his fellow and shut their sheepe in the foldes: and after returning to Aliena and Ganimede , conducted them home wearie to his poore Cottage. By the way there was much good chat with Montanus about his loues; he resoluing Aliena that Phoebe was the fairest Shepherdice in all France , and that in his eye her beautie was equall with the Nimphs. But (quoth her) as of all stones the Diamond is most cleerest, and yet most hard for the Lapidory to cut; as of all flowers the Rose is the fairest, and yet guarded with the sharpest prickles: so of all our Countrey Lasses Phoebe is the brightest, but the most coy of all to stoope vnto desire. But let her take heede quoth he, I haue heard of Narcissus , who for his high disdaine against Loue, perished in the follie of his owne loue. With this they were at Coridons cotage, where Montanus parted from them, and they went in to rest. Alinda and Ganimede glad of so contented a shelter, made merrie with the poore swayne: and though they had but countrey fare and course lodging, yet their welcome was so great, and their cares so litle, that they counted their diet delicate, and slept as soundly as if they had been in the court of Torismond . The next morne they lay long in bed, as wearied with the toyle of vnaccustomed trauaile: but assoone as they got vp, Aliena resolued there to set vp her rest, and by the helpe of Coridon swapt a bargane with his Landslord, and so became Mistres of the farme & the flocke: her selfe putting on the attire of a shepheardesse, and Ganimede of a yong swaine: euerie day leading foorth her flocks with such delight, that she held her exile happie, and thought no content to the blisse of a Countrey cottage. Leauing her thus famous amongst the shepheards of Arden , againe to Saladyne . When Saladyne had a long while concealed a secret resolution of reuenge, and could no longer hide fire in the flax, nor oyle in the flame; (for enuie is like lightning, that will appeare in the darkest fogge). It chaunced on a morning verie early he calde vp certaine of his seruaunts, and went with them to the chamber of Rosader , which being open, he entred with his crue, and surprised his brother beeing a sleepe, and bound him in fetters, and in the midst of his hall chained him to a poast. Rosader amazed at this straunge chaunce, began to reason with his brother about the cause of this sodaine extremitie, wherein he had wrongd? and what fault he had committed worthie so sharpe a penaunce. Saladyne answered him onely with a looke of disdaine, & went his way, leauing poore Rosader in a deepe perplexitie. Who (thus abused) fell into sundrie passions, but no meanes of releefe could be had: wherevpon (for anger) he grew into a discontented melancholy. In which humour he continued two or three dayes without meate: insomuch, that seeing his brother would giue him no foode, he fell into despaire of his life. Which Adam Spencer the olde seruaunt of Sir Iohn of Bourdeaux seeing, touched with the duetie and loue he ought to his olde Master, felt a remorse in his conscience of his sonnes mishap: and therefore, although Saladyne had giuen a generall charge to his seruaunts, that none of them vppon paine of death shoulde giue either meate or drinke to Rosader , yet Adam Spencer in the night arose secretely, and brought him such victualls as hee could prouide, and vnlockt him and set him at libertie. After Rosader had well feasted himselfe, and felt he was loose, straight his thoughts aymed at reuenge, and now (all being a sleepe) hee woulde haue quit Saladyne with the methode of his owne mischief. But Adam Spencer perswaded him to the contrarie, with these reasons; Sir quoth he, be content, for this night go againe into your olde fetters, so shall you trie the faith of friends, and saue the life of an olde seruant. To morrowe hath your brother inuited al your kindred and allyes to a solempne breakfast, onely to see you, telling them all, that you are mad, & faine to be tied to a poast. Assoone as they come, make complaint to them of the abuse profered you by Saladyne . If they redresse you, why so: but if they passe ouer your plaints sicco pede , and holde with the violence of your brother before your innocence, then thus: I will leaue you vnlockt that you may breake out at your pleasure, and at the ende of the hall shall you see stand a couple of good pollaxes, one for you, and another for me. When I giue you a wink, shake off your chaynes, and let vs play the men, and make hauocke amongst them, driue them out of the house and maintaine possession by force of armes, till the King hath made a redresse of your abuses. These wordes of Adam Spencer so perswaded Rosader , that he went to the place of his punishment, and stood there while the next morning. About the time appoynted, came all the guests bidden by Saladyne , whom he intreated with courteous and curious intertainment, as they al perceiued their welcome to be great. The tables in the hal where Rosader was tyed, were couered, and Saladyne bringing in his guests together, shewed them where his brother was bound, and was inchainde as a man lunaticke. Rosader made replie, and with some inuectiues made complaints of the wrongs proffered him by Saladyne , desiring they would in pitie seeke some meanes for his reliefe. But in vaine, they had stopt their eares with Vlisses , that were his words neuer so forceable, he breathed onely his passions into the winde. They carelesse, sat down with Saladyne to dinner, being verie frolicke and pleasant, washing their heads well with wine. At last, when the fume of the grape had entred peale meale into their braines, they began in satyrical speaches to raile against Rosader: which Adam Spencer no longer brooking, gaue the signe, and Rosader shaking off his chaines got a pollax in his hand, and flew amongst them with such violence and fury, that he hurt manie, slew some, and draue his brother and all the rest quite out of the house. Seeing the coast cleare, he shut the doores, and being sore an hungred, and seeing such good victuals, he sate him downe with Adam Spencer and such good fellows as he knew were honest men, and there feasted themselues with such prouision as Saladyne had prepared for his frieds. After they had taken their repast, Rosader rampierd vp the house, least vpon a sodaine his brother should raise some crue of his tenaunts, and surprise them vnawares. But Saladyne tooke a contrarie course, and went to the Sheriffe of the shyre and made complaint of Rosader , who giuing credite to Saladyne , in a determined resolution to reuenge the Gentlemans wrongs, tooke with him fiue and twentie tall men, and made a vowe, either to breake into the house and take Rosader , or els to coope him in till he made him yeelde by famine. In this determination, gathering a crue together he went forward to set Saladyne in his former estate. Newes of this was brought vnto Rosader , who smiling at the cowardize of his brother, brookt all the iniuries of Fortune with patience, expecting the comming of the Sheriffe. As he walkt vpon the battlements of the house, he descryed where Saladyne and he drew neare, with a troupe of lustie gallants. At this he smilde, and calde vp Adam Spencer , and shewed him the enuious treacherie of his brother, and the folly of the Sheriffe to bee so credulous: now Adam , quoth he, what shall I doo? It rests for me, either to yeelde vp the house to my brother and seeke a reconcilement, or els issue out, and breake through the companie with courage, for coopt in like a coward I will not bee. If I submit (ah Adam ) I dishonour my selfe, and that is worse than death; for by such open disgraces the fame of men growes odious: if I issue out amongst them, fortune may fauour me, and I may escape with life; but suppose the worst: if I be slaine, then my death shall be honourable to me, and so inequall a reuenge infamous to Saladyne . Why then Master forward and feare not, out amongst them, they bee but faint hearted lozells, and for Adam Spencer , if he die not at your foote, say he is a dastard. These words cheered vp so the hart of yong Rosader , that he thought himselfe sufficient for them all,  & therefore prepared weapons for him and Adam Spencer , and were readie to intertaine the Sheriffe: for no sooner came Saladyne and he to the gates, but Rosader vnlookt for leapt out and assailed them, wounded manie of them, and caused the rest to giue backe, so that Adam and hee broke through the prease in despite of them all, and tooke theyr way towards the forrest of Arden . This repulse so set the Sheriffes heart on fire to reuenge, that he straight raysed al the countrey, and made Hue and Crie after them. But Rosader and Adam knowing full well the secrete wayes that led through the vineyards, stole away priuely through the prouince of Bourdeaux , & escaped safe to the forrest of Arden . Being come thether, they were glad they had so good a harbour: but Fortune (who is like the Camelion) variable with euerie obiect, & constant in nothing but inconstacie, thought to make them myrrours of her mutabilitie, and therefore still crost them thus contrarily. Thinking still to passe on by the bywaies to get to Lions , they chaunced on a path that led into the thicke of the forrest, where they wandred fiue or sixe dayes without meat, that they were almost famished, finding neither shepheard nor cottage to relieue them: and hunger growing on so extreame, Adam Spencer (being olde) began first to faint, and sitting him downe on a hill, and looking about him, espied where Rosader laye as feeble and as ill perplexed: which sight made him shedde teares, and to fall into these bitter tearmes. Oh how the life of man may well be compared to the state of the Ocean seas, that for euerie calme hath a thousand stormes; resembling the Rose tree, that for a few faire flowers, hath a multitude of sharpe prickles: all our pleasures ende in paine, and our highest delights, are crossed with deepest discontents. The ioyes of man, as they are few, so are they momentarie, scarce ripe before they are rotten; and wythering in the blossome, either parched with the heate of enuie, or fortune. Fortune, oh inconstant friend, that in all thy deedes art froward and fickle, delighting in the pouertie of the lowest, and the ouerthrow of the highest, to decypher thy inconstancie. Thou standst vpon a gloabe, and thy wings are plumed with times feathers, that thou maist euer be restlesse; thou art double faced like Ianus , carying frownes in the one to threaten, and smiles in the other to betray; thou profferest an Eele, and perfourmest a Scorpion; and where thy greatest fauours be, there is the feare of the extreamest misfortunes; so variable are all thy actions. But why Adam doost thou exclaime against fortune? she laughs at the plaints of the distressed; and there is nothing more pleasing vnto her, than to heare fooles boast in her fading allurements, or sorrowfull men to discouer the sower of their passions. Glut her not Adam then with content, but thwart her with brooking all mishappes with patience. For there is no greater checke to the pride of fortune, than with a resolute courage to passe ouer her crosses without care. Thou art olde Adam , and thy haires wax white, the Palme tree is alreadie full of bloomes, and in the furrowes of thy face appeares the Kalenders of death? Wert thou blessed by fortune thy yeares could not be manie, nor the date of thy life long: then sith Nature must haue her due, what is it for thee to resigne her debt a little before the day. Ah, it is not this which grieueth mee, nor doo I care what mishaps Fortune can wage against me: but the sight of Rosader , that galleth vnto the quicke. When I remember the worships of his house, the honour of his fathers, and the vertues of himselfe; then doo I say, that fortune and the fates are most iniurious, to censure so hard extreames, against a youth of so great hope. Oh Rosader , thou art in the flower of thine age, and in the pride of thy yeares, buxsome and full of May. Nature hath prodigally inricht thee with her fauours, and vertue made thee the myrrour of her excellence: and now through the decree of the vniust starres, to haue all these good partes nipped in the blade, and blemisht by the inconstancie of Fortune. Ah Rosader , could I helpe thee, my griefe were the lesse, and happie should my death be, if it might be the beginning of thy reliefe: but seeing we perish both in one extreame, it is a double sorrowe. What shall I do? preuent the sight of his further misfortune, with a present dispatch of mine owne life. Ah, despaire is a mercilesse sinne. As he was readie to go forward in his passion, he looked earnestly on Rosader , and seeing him change colour, he rise vp and went to him,, and holding his temples, saide, What cheere master? though all faile, let not the heart faint: the courage of a man is shewed in the resolution of his death. At these words Rosader lifted vp his eye, and looking on Adam Spencer began to weepe. Ah Adam quoth he, I sorrowe not to die, but I grieue at the manner of my death. Might I with my launce encounter the enemie, and so die in the field, it were honour, and content: might I ( Adam ) combat with some wilde beast, and perish as his pray, I wer satisfied; but to die with hunger, O Adam , it is the extreamest of all extreames. Master (quoth hee) you see wee are both in one predicament, and long I cannot liue without meate, seeing therefore we can find no foode, let the death of the one preserue the life of the other. I am olde, and ouerworne with age, you are young, and are the hope of many honours: let me then die, I will presently cut my veynes, & master with the warme bloud relieue your fainting spirits: sucke on that till I ende, and you be comforted. With that Adam Spencer was readie to pull out his knife, when Rosader full of courage (though verie faint) rose vp, and wisht Adam Spencer to sit there till his retourne; for my minde giues me quoth he, I shall bring thee meate. With that, like a mad man he rose vp, and ranged vp and downe the woods, seeking to encounter some wilde beast with his rapier, that either he might carrie his friend Adam food, or els pledge his life in pawne of his loyaltie. It chaunced that day, that Gerismond the lawfull king of France banished by Torismond , who with a lustie crue of Outlawes liued in that forest, that day in honour of his Birth made a Feast to all his bolde yeomen, and frolickt it with store of wine and venison, sitting all at a long table vnder the shadowe of lymon trees. To that place by chance Fortune conducted Rosader , who seeing such a crue of braue men hauing store of that, for want of which he and Adam perished, he stept boldly to the boords end, and saluted the companie thus. Whatsoere thou bee that art master of these lustie squires, I salute thee as graciously, as a man in extreame distresse may; knowe that I and a fellow friend of mine, are heere famished in the forrest for want of foode: perish we must vnlesse relieued by thy fauours. Therefore if thou be a Gentleman, giue meate to men, and to such men as are euerie way worthie of life; let the proudest squire that sittes at thy table, rise & incounter with me in anie honourable point of actiuitie what soeuer, and if he and thou proue me not a man, send me a way comfortlesse. If thou refuse this, as a niggard of thy cates, I will haue amongst you with my sword; for rather will I die valiantly, than perish with so cowardly an extreame. Gerismond looking him earnestly in the face, and seeing so proper a Gentleman in so bitter a passion, was mooued with so great pitie; that rising from the table, he tooke him by the hand and bad him welcome, willing him to sit downe in his place, and in his roome not onely to eate his fill, but be Lord of the feast. Gramercie sir (quoth Rosader ) but I haue a feeble friend that lies heereby famished almost for food, aged and therfore lesse able to abide the extremitie of hunger than my selfe, and dishonour it were for me to taste one crum, before I made him partner of my fortunes: therefore I will runne and fetch him, and then I will gratefully accept of your proffer. Away hies Rosader to Adam Spencer , and tells him the newes, who was glad of so happie fortune, but so feeble he was hee could not goe: whereupon Rosader got him vp on his backe, and brought him to the place. Which when Gerismond & his men saw, they greatly applauded their league of friendship; & Rosader hauing Gerismonds place assigned him, would not sit there himselfe, but set downe Adam Spencer . Well to be short, those hungrie squires fell to their victualls, and feasted themselues with good delicates, and great store of wine. Assoone as they had taken their repast, Gerismond (desirous to heare what hard fortune draue them into those bitter extreames) requested Rosader to discourse, (if it wer not anie way preiudiciall vnto him) the cause of his trauell. Rosader (desirous anie way to satisfie the courtesie of his fauourable host, (first beginning his exordium with a volley of sighes, and a few luke warme teares) prosecuted his discourse, & told him fro point to point all his fortunes; how he was the yongest Sonne of Sir Iohn of Bourdeaux , his name Rosader , how his brother sundrie times had wronged him, and lastly, how for beating the Sheriffe, and hurting his men, he fled; and this olde man (quoth he) whome I so much loue and honour, is surnamed Adam Spencer , an old seruant of my fathers, and one (that for his loue) neuer fayled me in all my misfortunes. When Gerismond hearde this, hee fell on the necke of Rosader , and next discoursing vnto him, how he was Gerismond their lawfull King exiled by Torismond , what familiaritie had euer been betwixt his father Sir Iohn of Bourdeaux and him, how faithful a subiect he liued, and how honourably he died; promising (for his sake) to giue both him and his friend such courteous intertainment, as his present estate could minister: and vpon this made him one of his forresters. Rosader seeing it was the King, craude pardon for his boldnesse, in that he did not doo him due reuerence, and humbly gaue him thankes for his fauourable courtesie. Gerismond not satisfied yet with newes, began to enquire if he had been lately in the court of Torismond , and whether he had seene his daughter Rosalynde , or no? At this, Rosader fetcht a deep sigh, and shedding manie teares, could not answere: yet at last, gathering his spirites together, hee reuealed vnto the King, how Rosalynde was banished, and how there was such a simpathie of affections betweene Alinda and her, that shee chose rather to be partaker of her exile, than to part fellowshippe: whereupon the vnnaturall King banished them both; and now they are wandred none knowes whether, neither could anie learne since their departure, the place of their abode. This newes driue the King into a great melancholy, that presently he arose from all the companie, and went into his priuie chamber, so secret as the harbor of the woods would allow him. The companie was all dasht at these tidings, & Rosader and Adam Spencer hauing such opportunitie, went to take their rest. Where we leaue them, and returne againe to Torismond . The flight of Rosader came to the eares of Torismond , who hearing that Saladyne was sole heire of the landes of Sir Iohn of Bourdeaux , desirous to possesse such faire reuenewes, found iust occasion to quarrell with Saladyne , about the wrongs hee proffred to his brother: and therefore dispatching a Herehault, hee sent for Saladyne in all poast hast. Who meruailing what the matter should be, began to examine his owne conscience, wherein he had offended his Highnesse: but imboldened with his innocence, hee boldly went with the Herehault vnto the Court. Where assoone as hee came, hee was not admitted into the presence of the King, but presently sent to prison. This greatly amazed Saladyne , chiefly in that the Iayler had a straight charge ouer him, to see that he should be close prisoner. Manie passionate thoughts came in his head, till at last he began to fall into consideration of his former follies, & to meditate with himselfe. Leaning his head on his hand, and his elbowe on his knee, full of sorrow, griefe and disquieted passions, he resolued into these tearmes. Vnhappie Saladyne , whome folly hath led to these misfortunes, and wanton desires wrapt within the laborinth of these calamities. Are not the heauens doomers of mens deedes? And holdes not God a ballaunce in his fist, to reward with fauour, and reuenge with iustice? Oh Saladyne , the faults of thy youth, as they were fond, so were they foule; and not onely discouering little nourture, but blemishing the excellence of nature. Whelpes of one lytter are euer most louing, and brothers that are sonnes of one father, should liue in friendship without iarre. Oh Saladyne , so it should bee: but thou hast with the deere fedde against the winde, with the Crab stroue against the streame, and sought to peruert Nature by vnkindnesse. Rosaders wrongs, the wrongs of Rosader (Saladyne ) cries for reuenge, his youth pleades to God to inflict some penaunce vpon thee, his vertues are pleas that inforce writs of displeasure to crosse thee: thou hast highly abused thy kinde & naturall brother, and the heauens cannot spare to quite thee with punishment. There is no sting to the worme of conscience, no hell to a minde toucht with guilt. Euerie wrong I offered him (called now to remembrance) wringeth a drop of bloud from my heart, euerie bad looke, euerie frowne pincheth me at the quicke, and sayes Saladyne thou hast sind against Rosader . Be penitent, and assigne thy selfe some penaunce to discouer thy sorrow, and pacifie his wrath. In the depth of his passion, he was sent for to the King: who with a looke that threatned death entertained him, and demaunded of him where his brother was? Saladyne made aunswere, that vpon some ryot made against the Sheriffe of the shyre, he was fled from Bourdeaux , but he knew not whether. Nay villain (quoth he) I haue heard of the wrongs thou hast proffered thy brother since the death of thy father, and by thy meanes haue I lost a most braue and resolute Cheualier. Therefore, in Iustice to punish thee, I spare thy life for thy fathers sake, but banish thee for euer from the Court and Countrey of France , and see thy departure bee within tenne dayes, els trust me thou shalt loose thy head, & with that the King flew away in a rage, and left poore Saladyne greatly perplexed. Who grieuing at his exile, yet determined to beare it with patience, and in penaunce of his former follies to trauell abroade in euerie Coast, till hee had founde out his Brother Rosader . With whom now I begin. Rosader beeing thus preferred to the place of a Forester by Gerismond , rooted out the remembrance of his brothers vnkindnes by continual exercise, trauersing the groues and wilde Forrests: partly to heare the melodie of the sweete birdes which recorded, and partly, to shewe his diligent indeauour in his masters behalfe. Yet whatsoeuer he did, or howsoeuer he walked, the liuely Image of Rosalynde remained in memorie: on her sweete perfections he fedde his thoughts, proouing himselfe like the Eagle a true borne bird, since as the one is knowen by beholding the Sunne: so was he by regarding excellent beautie. One day among the rest, finding a fit oportunitie and place conuenient, desirous to discouer his woes to the woodes, hee engraued with his knife on the barke of a Myrtle tree, this pretie estimate of his Mistres perfection.  Of all chast birdes the Phoenix doth excell, Of all strong beasts the Lion beares the bell, Of all sweete flowers the Rose doth sweetest smell, Of all faire maides my Rosalynde is fairest. Of all pure mettals golde is onely purest, Of all high trees the Pine hath highest crest, Of all soft sweetes J like my Mistres brest, Of all chast thoughts my Mistres thoughts are rarest. Of all proud birds the Ægle pleaseth Ioue , Of pretie fowles kinde Venus likes the Doue, Of trees Minerua doth the Oliue loue, Of all sweete Nimphes I honour Rosalynde . Of all her gifts her wisedome pleaseth most, Of all her graces vertue she doth boast: For all these giftes my life and ioy is lost, If Rosalynde proue cruell and vnkinde. In these and such like passions, Rosader did euerie daye eternize the name of his Rosalynde : and this day especiallie when Aliena and Ganimede (inforced by the heate of the Sunne to seeke for shelter) by good fortune arriued in that place, where this amorous foorester registred his melancholy passions; they saw the sodaine change of his looks, his folded armes, his passionate sighes; they heard him often abruptly call on Rosalynde: who (poore soule) was as hotly burned as himselfe, but that she shrouded her paines in the cinders of honorable modestie. Whereupon, (gessing him to be in loue, and according to the nature of their sexe, being pitifull in that behalfe) they sodainly brake off his melancholy by their approach: and Ganimede shooke him out of his dumpes thus. What newes Forrester? hast thou wounded some deere, and lost him in the fall? Care not man for so small a losse, thy fees was but the skinne, the shoulder, and the hornes: tis hunters lucke, to ayme faire and misse: and a woodmans fortune to strike and yet goe without the game. Thou art beyond the marke Ganimede , quoth Aliena , his passions are greater, and his sighs discouers more losse; perhaps in trauersing these thickets, he hath seen some beautifull Nymph, and is growen amorous. It maye bee so (quoth Ganimede ) for heere he hath newly ingrauen some sonnet: come and see the discourse of the Foresters poems. Reading the sonnet ouer, and hearing him name Rosalynd, Aliena lookt on Ganimede and laught, and Ganimede looking backe on the Forrester, and seeing it was Rosader blusht, yet thinking to shroud all vnder hir pages apparell, she boldly returned to Rosader , and began thus. I pray thee tell me Forrester, what is this Rosalynde , for whom thou pinest away in such passions? Is shee some Nymph that waites vpon Dianaes traine, whose chastitie thou hast decyphred in such Epethites? Or is shee some shepheardesse, that haunts these plaines, whose beautie hath so bewitched thy fancie, whose name thou shaddowest in couert vnder the figure of Rosalynde , as Ouid did Iulia vnder the name of Corinna? Or say mee for sooth, is it that Rosalynde , of whome we shepheards haue heard talke, shee Forrester, that is the Daughter of Gerismond , that once was King, and now an Outlaw in this Forrest of Arden . At this Rosader fetcht a deepe sigh, and said, It is shee, O gentle swayne, it is she, that Saint it is whom I serue, that Goddesse at whose shrine I doo bend all my deuotions: the most fairest of all faires, the Phenix of all that sexe, and the puritie of all earthly perfection. And why (gentle Forrester) if she bee so beautifull and thou so amorous, is there such a disagreement in thy thoughts? Happely she resembleth the rose, that is sweete but full of prickles? or the serpent Regius that hath scales as glorious as the Sunne, & a breath as infectious as the Aconitum is deadly? So thy Rosalynde , may be most amiable, and yet vnkinde: full of fauour, and yet froward: coy without wit, and disdainefull without reason. O shepheard (quoth Rosader ) knewest thou her personage graced with the excellence of all perfection, beeing a harbour wherein the Graces shroude their vertues: thou wouldst not breathe out such blasphemie against the beauteous Rosalynde . She is a Diamond, bright but not hard, yet of most chast operation: a pearle so orient, that it can be stained with no blemish: a rose without prickles, and a Princesse absolute aswell in beautie, as in vertue. But I, vnhappie I, haue let mine eye soare with the Eagle against so bright a Sunne, that I am quite blinde; I haue with Apollo enamoured my selfe of a Daphne , not (as shee) disdainfull, but farre more chast than Daphne ; I haue with Ixion laide my loue on Iuno , and shall (I feare) embrace nought but a clowde. Ah shepheard, I haue reacht at a star, my desires haue mounted aboue my degree, & my thoughts aboue my fortunes. I being a peasant haue ventred to gaze on a Princesse, whose honors are too high to vouchsafe such base loues. Why Forrester (quoth Ganimede ) comfort thy selfe: be blythe and frolicke man, Loue sowseth as low as she soareth high: Cupide shootes at a ragge assoone as at a roabe, and Venus eye that was so curious sparkled fauor on pole footed Vulcan . Feare not man, womens lookes are not tied to dignities feathers, nor make they curious esteeme, where the stone is found, but what is the vertue. Feare not Forrester, faint heart neuer wonne faire Ladie. But where liues Rosalynde now, at the Court? Oh no (quoth Rosader ) she liues I knowe not where, and that is my sorrow; banisht by Torismond , and that is my hell: for might I but finde her sacred personage, & plead before the barre of her pitie the plaint of my passions, hope tells mee shee would grace me with some fauour; and that woulde suffice as a recompence of all my former miseries. Much haue I heard of thy Mistres excellence, and I know Forrester thou canst describe her at the full, as one that hast suruayd all her parts with a curious eye: then doo me that fauour, to tell mee what her perfections bee. That I will (quoth Rosader ) for I glorie to make all eares wonder at my Mistres excellence. And with that he pulde a paper forth his bosome, wherein he read this.  Like to the cleere in higest spheare Where all imperiall glorie shines, Of selfe same colour is her haire Whether vnfolded or in twines: Heigh he faire Rosalynde . Her eyes are Saphires set in snow, Refining heauen by euerie winke; The Gods doo feare when as they glow, And I doo tremble when I thinke. Heigh ho, would she were mine. Her cheekes are like the blushing cloude That beautefies Auroraes face, Or like the siluer crimson shrowde That Phoebus smiling lookes doth grace: Heigh ho, faire Rosalynde . Her lippes are like two budded roses, Whom rankes of lillies neighbour nie, Within which bounds she balme encloses, Apt to intice a Deitie: Heigh ho, would she were mine. Her necke like to a stately towre, Where Loue himselfe imprisoned lies, To watch for glaunces euerie howre, From her deuine and sacred eyes, Heigh ho, faire Rosalynde . Her pappes are centers of delight, Her pappes are orbes of heauenlie frame, Where Nature moldes the deaw of light, To feede perfection with the same: Heigh ho, would she were mine. With orient pearle, with rubie red, With marble white, with saphire blew, Her bodie euerie way is fed; Yet soft in touch, and sweete in view: Heigh ho, faire Rosalynde . Nature her selfe her shape admires, The Gods are wounded in her sight, And Loue forsakes his heauenly fires, And at her eyes his brand doth light: Heigh ho, would she were mine. Then muse not Nymphes though I bemoane The absence of faire Rosalynde: Since for her faire there is fairer none, Nor for her vertues so deuine. Heigh ho faire Rosalynde . Heigh ho my heart, would God that she were mine. Perijt, quia deperibat.  Beleeue me (quoth Ganimede ) either the Forrester is an exquisite painter, or Rosalynde faire aboue wonder: so it makes me blush, to heare how women should be so excellent, and pages so vnperfect. Rosader beholding her earnestly, answered thus. Truly (gentle page) thou hast cause to complaine thee, wert thou the substance: but resembling the shadow, content thy selfe: for it is excellence inough to be like the excellence of Nature. He hath aunswered you Ganimede (quoth Aliena ) it is inough for pages to waite on beautifull Ladies, & not to be beautifull themselues. Oh Mistres (quoth Ganimede ) holde you your peace, for you are partiall: Who knowes not, but that all women haue desire to tie souerein to their peticoats, and ascribe beautie to themselues, where if boyes might put on their garments, perhaps they would prooue as comely; if not as comely, it may be more curteous. But tell mee Forrester, (and with that shee turnde to Rosader ) vnder whom maintainest thou thy walkes? Gentle swaine vnder the King of Outlawes said he, the vnfortunate Gerismond: who hauing lost his kingdome, crowneth his thoughts with content, accompting it better to gouern among poore men in peace, than great men in daunger. But hast thou not said she, (hauing so melancholie opportunities as this Forrest affoordeth thee) written more Sonnets in commendations of thy Mistres? I haue gentle Swayne quoth he, but they be not about me: to morrow by dawne of daye, if your flockes feede in these pastures, I will bring them you: wherein you shall reade my passions, whilest I feele them; iudge my patience when you read it: till when I bid farewell. So giuing both Ganimede and Aliena a gentle good night, he resorted to his lodge: leauing Aliena and Ganimede to their prittle prattle. So Ganimede (said Aliena , the Forrester beeing gone) you are mightely beloued, men make ditties in your praise, spend sighes for your sake, make an Idoll of your beautie: beleeue me it greeues mee not a little, to see the poore man so pensiue, and you so pittilesse. Ah Aliena (quoth she) be not peremptorie in your iudgments, I heare Rosalynde praisde as I am Ganimede , but were I Rosalynde , I could answere the Forrester: If hee mourne for loue, there are medicines for loue: Rosalynde cannot be faire and vnkinde. And so Madame you see it is time to folde our flockes, or els Coridon will frowne, and say you will neuer prooue good huswife. With that they put their Sheepe into the coates, and went home to her friend Coridons cottage, Aliena as merrie as might be, that she was thus in the companie of her Rosalynde: but shee poore soule, that had Loue her load starre, and her thoughts set on fire with the flame of fancie, coulde take no rest, but being alone beganne to consider what passionate penaunce poore Rosader was enioyned to by loue and fortune: that at last she fell into this humour with her selfe. Ah Rosalynde , how the Fates haue set downe in their Synode to make thee vnhappie: for when Fortune hath done her worst, then Loue comes in to begin a new tragedie; shee seekes to lodge her sonne in thine eyes, and to kindle her fires in thy bosome. Beware fonde girle, he is an vnruly guest to harbour; for entring in by intreats, he will not be thrust out by force, and her fires are fed with such fuell, as no water is able to quench. Seest thou not how Venus seekes to wrap thee in her Laborynth, wherein is pleasure at the entrance, but within, sorrowes, cares, and discontent: she is a Syren , stop thine eares at her melodie; and a Basiliscke, shut thine eyes, and gaze not at her least thou perish. Thou art nowe placed in the Countrey content, where are heauenly thoughts, and meane desires: in those Lawnes where thy flockes feede Diana haunts: bee as her Nymphes, chaste, and enemie to Loue: for there is no greater honour to a Maide, than to accompt of fancie, as a mortall foe to their sexe. Daphne that bonny wench was not tourned into a Bay tree, as the Poets faine: but for her chastitie her fame was immortall, resembling the Lawrell that is euer greene. Follow thou her steps Rosalynde , and the rather, for that thou art an exile, and banished from the Court: whose distresse, as it is appeased with patience, so it woulde bee renewed with amorous passions. Haue minde on thy forepassed fortunes, feare the worst, and intangle not thy selfe with present fancies: least louing in hast thou repent thee at leasure. Ah but yet Rosalynde , it is Rosader that courts thee; one, who as hee is beautifull, so he is vertuous, and harboureth in his minde as manie good qualities, as his face is shadowed with gracious fauours: and therefore Rosalynde stoope to Loue, least beeing either too coy, or too cruell, Venus waxe wrothe, and plague thee with the reward of disdaine. Rosalynde thus passionate, was wakened from her dumpes by Aliena , who saide it was time to goe to bedde. Coridon swore that was true, for Charles Wayne was risen in the North. Whereuppon each taking leaue of other, went to their rest all, but the poore Rosalynde: who was so full of passions, that shee coulde not possesse anie content. Well, leauing her to her broken slumbers, expect what was perfourmed by them the nexte morning. The Sunne was no sooner stept from the bed of Aurora , but Aliena was wakened by Ganimede: who restlesse all night had tossed in her passions: saying it was then time to goe to the field to vnfold their sheepe. Aliena (that spied where the hare was by the hounds, and could see day at a little hole) thought to be pleasant with her Ganimede , & therfore replied thus; What wanton? the Sun is but new vp, & as yet Iris riches lies folded in the bosome of Flora, Phoebus hath not dried vp the pearled deaw, & so long Coridon hath taught me, it is not fit to lead the sheepe abroad: least the deaw being vnwholesome, they get the rot: but now see I the old prouerbe true, he is in hast whom the diuel driues, & where loue prickes forward, there is no worse death than delay. Ah my good page, is there fancie in thine eie, and passions in thy heart? What, hast thou wrapt loue in thy looks? and set all thy thoughts on fire by affection? I tell thee, it is a flame as hard to be quencht as that of Ætna . But nature must haue her course, womens eyes haue facultie attractiue like the ieat, and retentiue like the diamond: they dallie in the delight of faire obiects, til gazing on the Panthers beautifull skinne, repenting experience tell them hee hath a deuouring paunch. Come on (quoth Ganimede ) this sermon of yours is but a subtiltie to lie still a bed, because either you thinke the morning colde, or els I being gone, you would steale a nappe: this shifte carries no paulme, and therefore vp and away. And for Loue let me alone, Ile whip him away with nettles, and set disdaine as a charme to withstand his forces: and therefore looke you to your selfe, be not too bolde, for Venus can make you bend; nor too coy, for Cupid hath a piercing dart, that will make you crie Peccaui . And that is it (quoth Aliena ) that hath raysed you so early this morning. And with that she slipt on her peticoate, and start vp: and assoone as she had made her readie, and taken her breakfast, away goe these two with their bagge and bottles to the field, in more pleasant content of mind, than euer they were in the Court of Torismond . They came no sooner nigh the foldes, but they might see where their discontented Forrester was walking in his melancholy. Assoone as Aliena saw him, she smiled, and sayd to Ganimede ; wipe your eyes sweeting: for yonder is your sweet hart this morning in deepe praiers no doubt to Venus , that she may make you as pitifull as hee is passionate. Come on Ganimede , I pray thee lets haue a little sport with him. Content (quoth Ganimede ) and with that, to waken him out of his deepe memento , he began thus. Forrester, good fortune to thy thoughts, and ease to thy passions, what makes you so early abroad this morne, in cotemplation, no doubt of your Rosalynde . Take heede Forester, step not too farre, the foord may be deepe, and you slip ouer the shooes: I tell thee, flies haue their spleene, the ants choller, the least haires shadowes, & the smallest loues great desires. Tis good (Forrester) to loue, but not to ouerloue: least in louing her that likes not thee, thou folde thy selfe in an endlesse Laborynth. Rosader seeing the fayre shepheardesse and her pretie swayne, in whose companie he hee felt the greatest ease of his care, he returned them a salute on this manner. Gentle shepheards, all haile, and as healthfull bee your flockes, as you happie in content. Loue is restlesse, and my bedde is but the cell of my bane, in that there I finde busie thoughtes and broken slumbers: heere (although euerie where passionate) yet I brooke loue with more patience, in that euerie obiect feedes mine eye with varietie of fancies; when I looke on Floraes beauteous tapestrie, checkered with the pride of all her treasure, I call to minde the fayre face of Rosalynde , whose heauenly view exceedes the Rose and the Lilly in their highest excellence; the brightnesse of Phoebus shine, puts me in minde to thinke of the sparkling flames that flew from her eies, and set my heart first on fire; the sweet harmonie of the birds, puts me in remembrance of the rare melodie of her voyce, which like the Syren enchaunteth the eares of the hearer. Thus in contemplation I salue my sorrowes, with applying the perfection of euerie obiect to the excellence of her qualities. She is much beholding vnto you (quoth Aliena ) and so much, that I haue oft wisht with my selfe, that if I should euer prooue as amorous as Oenone , I might finde as faithfull a Paris as your selfe. How say you by this Item Forester, (quoth Ganimede ) the faire shepheardesse fauours you, who is mistresse of so manie flockes. Leaue of man the supposition of Rosalynds loue, when as watching at her, you roue beyond the Moone; and cast your lookes vpon my Mistres, who no doubt is as faire though not so royall; one birde in the hande is woorth two in the wood; better possesse the loue of Aliena , than catch friuouously at the shadow of Rosalynde . Ile tell thee boy (quoth Ganimede ) so is my fancie fixed on my Rosalynde , that were thy Mistres as faire as Laeda or Danae , whome Ioue courted in transformed shapes, mine eyes would not vouch to intertaine their beauties: and so hath Loue lockt mee in her perfections, that I had rather onely contemplate in her beauties, than absolutely possesse the excellence of anie other. Venus is too blame (Forrester) if hauing so true a seruant of you, she reward you not with Rosalynde , if Rosalynde were more fairer than her selfe. But leauing this prattle, nowe Ile put you in minde of your promise, about those sonnets which you saide were at home in your lodge. I haue them about me (quoth Rosader ) let vs sit downe, and then you shall beare what a Poeticall furie Loue will infuse into a man: with that they sate downe vpon a greene bank, shadowed with figge trees, and Rosader , fetching a deepe sigh read them this Sonnet.  In sorrowes cell I laid me downe to sleepe: But waking woes were iealous of mine eyes, They made them watch, and bend themselues to weepe: But weeping teares their want could not suffice: Yet since for her they wept who guides my hart, They weeping smile, and triumph in their smart. Of these my teares a fountaine fiercely springs, Where Venus baynes her selfe incenst with loue; Where Cupid bowseth his faire feathred wings: But I behold what paines I must approue. Care drinkes it drie: but when on her J thinke, Loue makes me weepe it full vnto the brinke. Meane while my sighes yeeld truce vnto my teares, By them the windes increast and fiercely blow: Yet when J sigh the flame more plaine appeares, And by their force with greater power doth glow: Amids these paines, all Phoenix like I thriue, Since Loue that yeelds me death, may life reuiue. Rosader en esperance.  Now surely Forrester (quoth Aliena ) when thou madest this sonnet, thou wert in some amorous quandarie, neither too fearfull, as despairing of thy Mistres fauours: nor too gleesome, as hoping in thy fortunes. I can smile (quoth Ganimede ) at the Sonettoes, Canzones, Madrigales, rounds and roundelayes, that these pensiue patients powre out, when their eyes are more ful of wantonnesse, than their hearts of passions. Then, as the fishers put the sweetest baite to the fairest fish: so these Ouidians (holding Amo in their tongues, when their thoughtes come at hap hazarde, write that they be wrapt in an endlesse laborynth of sorrow, when walking in the large leas of libertie, they onely haue their humours in their inckpot. If they finde women so fond, that they will with such painted lures come to theyr lust, then they triumph till they be full gorgde with pleasures: and then fly they away (like ramage kytes) to their owne content, leauing the tame foole their Mistres full of fancie, yet without euer a feather. If they misse (as dealing with some wary wanton, that wats not such a one as themselues, but spies their subtiltie) they ende their amors with a few fained sighes: and so there excuse is, their Mistres is cruell, and they smoother passions with patience. Such gentle Forrester we may deeme you to bee, that rather passe away the time heere in these Woods with writing amorets, than to bee deepely enamoured (as you saye) of your Rosalynde . If you bee such a one, then I pray God, when you thinke your fortunes at the highest, and your desires to bee most excellent, then that you may with Ixion embrace Iuno in a clowde, and haue nothing but a marble Mistres to release your martyrdome: but if you be true and trustie, ey-paind and hart sicke, then accursed bee Rosalynde if shee prooue cruell: for Forrester (I flatter not) thou art woorthie of as faire as shee. Aliena spying the storme by the winde, smiled to see how Ganimede flew to the fist without anie call: but Rosader who tooke him flat for a shepheards Swayne made him this answere. Trust me Swayne (quoth Rosader ) but my Canzon was written in no such humour: for mine eye  & my heart are relatiues, the one drawing fancie by sight, the other entertaining her by sorrowe. If thou sawest my Rosalynde , with what beauties Nature hath fauoured her, with what perfection the heauens hath graced her, with what qualities the Gods haue endued her; then wouldst thou say, there is none so fickle that could be fleeting vnto her. If she had ben Aeneas Dido , had Venus and Iuno both scolded him from Carthage , yet her excellence despite of them, woulde haue detained him at Tyre . If Phillis had been as beauteous, or Ariadne as vertuous, or both as honourable and excellent as she; neither had the Philbert tree sorrowed in the death of despairing Phillis , nor the starres haue been graced with Ariadne: but Demophoon and Theseus had been trustie to their Paragons. I will tell thee Swaine, if with a deepe insight thou couldst pearce into the secrets of my loues, and see what deepe impressions of her Idea affection hath made in my heart: then wouldst thou confesse I were passing passionate, and no lesse indued with admirable patience. Why (quoth Aliena ) needes there patience in Loue? Or els in nothing (quoth Rosader ) for it is a restlesse soare, that hath no ease, a cankar that still frets, a disease that taketh awaie all hope of sleepe. If then so manie sorrowes, sodain ioies, momentarie pleasures, continuall feares, daylie griefes, and nightly woes be found in Loue, then is not he to be accompted patient, that smoothers all these passions with silence? Thou speakest by experience (quoth Ganimede ) and therefore wee holde all thy words for Axiomes: but is Loue such a lingring maladie? It is (quoth he) either extreame or meane, according to the minde of the partie that entertaines it: for as the weedes growe longer vntouchte than the pretie flowers, and the flint lies safe in the quarrie, when the Emeraulde is suffering the Lapidaries coole: so meane men are freed from Venus iniuries, when kings are enuyroned with a laborynth of her cares. The whiter the Lawne is, the deeper is the moale, the more purer the chrysolite the sooner stained; and such as haue their hearts ful of honour, haue their loues full of the greatest sorrowes. But in whomsoeuer (quoth Rosader ) he fixeth his dart, hee neuer leaueth to assault him, till either hee hath wonne him to follie or fancie: for as the Moone neuer goes without the starre Lunisequa , so a Louer neuer goeth without the vnrest of his thoughts. For proofe you shall heare another fancie of my making. Now doo gentle Forrester (quoth Ganimede ) and with that he read ouer this Sonetto .  Turne I my lookes vnto the Skies, Loue with his arrowes wounds mine eies: Jf so I gaze vpon the ground, Loue then in euerie flower is found. Search J the shade to flie my paine, He meetes me in the shade againe: Wend J to walke in secrete groue, Euen there I meete with sacred Loue. Jf so I bayne me in the spring, Euen on the brinke I heare him sing: Jf so I meditate alone, He will be partner of my moane. Jf so I mourne, he weepes with mee, And where I am, there will he bee. When as I talke of Rosalynde , The God from coynesse waxeth kinde, And seemes in selfe same flames to frie, Because he loues as well as I. Sweete Rosalynde for pitie rue, For why, then Loue I am more true: He if he speede will quicklie flie, But in thy loue I liue and die. How like you this Sonnet, quoth Rosader? Marrie quoth Ganimede , for the penne well, for the passion ill: for as I praise the one; I pitie the other, in that thou shouldest hunt after a clowde, and loue either without rewarde or regarde. Tis not her frowardnesse, quoth Rosader , but my hard fortunes, whose Destenies haue crost me with her absence: for did shee feele my loues, she would not let me linger in these sorrowes. Women, as they are faire, so they respect faith, and estimate more (if they be honourable) the wil than the wealth, hauing loyaltie the obiect whereat they ayme their fancies. But leauing off these interparleyes, you shall heare my last Sonnetto , and then you haue heard all my Poetrie: and with that he sight out this.  Of vertuous Loue my selfe may boast alone, Since no suspect my seruice may attaint: For perfect faire shee is the onely one, Whom I esteeme for my beloued Saint: Thus for my faith J onely beare the bell, And for her faire she onely doth excell. Then let fond Petrarch shrowde his Lawraes praise, And Tasso cease to publish his affect; Since mine the faith confirmde at all assaies, And hers the faire, which all men doe respect: My lines her faire, her faire my faith assures; Thus J by Loue, and Loue by me endures. Thus quoth Rosader , heere is an ende of my Poems, but for all this no release of my passions: so that I resemble him, that in the deapth of his distresse hath none but the Eccho to aunswere him. Ganimede pittying her Rosader , thinking to driue him out of this amorous melancholie, said, that now the Sunne was in his Meridionall heat, and that it was high noone, therefore we shepheards say, tis time to goe to dinner: for the Sunne and our stomackes, are Shepheards dialls. Therefore Forrester, if thou wilt take such fare as comes out of our homely scrippes, welcome shall aunswere whatsoeuer thou wantst in delicates. Aliena tooke the entertainment by the ende, and told Rosader he should be her guest. He thankt them heartely, and sate with them downe to dinner: where they had such cates as Countrey state did allow them, sawst with such content, and such sweete prattle, as it seemed farre more sweete, than all their Courtly iunckets. Assoone as they had taken their repast, Rosader giuing them thankes for his good cheere, would haue been gone: but Ganimede , that was loath to let him passe out of her presence, began thus; Nay Forrester quoth he, if thy busines be not the greater, seeing thou saist thou art so deeply in loue, let me see how thou canst wooe: I will represent Rosalynde , and thou shalt bee as thou art Rosader ; see in some amorous Eglogue, how if Rosalynde were present, how thou couldst court her: and while we sing of Loue, Aliena shall tune her pipe, and playe vs melodie. Content, quoth Rosader . And Aliena , shee to shew her willingnesse, drewe foorth a recorder, and began to winde it. Then the louing Forrester began thus.  J pray thee Nymph by all the working words, By all the teares and sighes that Louers know, Or what or thoughts or faltring tongue affords, J craue for mine in ripping vp my woe. Sweete Rosalynd my loue (would God my loue) My life (would God my life) ay pitie me; Thy lips are kinde, and humble like the doue, And but with beautie pitie will not be. Looke on mine eyes made red with rufull teares, From whence the raine of true remorse descendeth, All pale in lookes, and J though young in yeares, And nought but loue or death my daies befrendeth. Oh let no stormie rigour knit thy browes, Which Loue appointed for his mercie seate: The tallest tree by Boreas breath it bowes, The yron yeelds with hammer, and to heate. Oh Rosalynde then be thou pittifull, For Rosalynde is onely beautifull. Loues wantons arme their traitrous sutes with teares, With vowes, with oathes, with lookes, with showers of golde: But when the fruite of their affects appeares, The simple heart by subtill sleights is solde. Thus suckes the yeelding eare the poysoned bait, Thus feedes the hart vpon his endlesse harmes, Thus glut the thoughts themselues on selfe deceipt, Thus blinde the eyes their sight by subtill charmes. The louely lookes, the sighs that storme so sore, The deaw of deepe dissembled doublenesse: These may attempt, but are of power no more, Where beautie leanes to wit and soothfastnesse. Oh Rosader then be thou wittifull, For Rosalynde scornes foolish pitifull. J pray thee Rosadlyne by those sweete eyes That staine the Sunne in shine, the morne in cleare; By those sweete cheekes where Loue incamped lies To kisse the roses of the springing yeare. J tempt thee Rosalynde by ruthfull plaints, Not seasoned with deceipt or fraudfull guile, But firme in paine, farre more than tongue depaints, Sweete Nymph be kinde, and grace me with a smile. So may the heauens preserue from hurtfull food Thy harmelesse flockes, so may the Summer yeeld The pride of all her riches and her good, To fat thy sheepe (the Citizens of field). Oh leaue to arme thy louely browes with scorne: The birds their beake, the Lion hath his taile, And Louers nought but sighes and bitter mourne, The spotlesse fort of fancie to assaile. Oh Rosalynde then be thou pitifull: For Rosalynde is onely beautifull. The hardned steele by fire is brought in frame: And Rosalynde my loue than anie wooll more softer; And shall not sighes her tender heart inflame? Were Louers true, maides would beleeue them often. Truth and regard, and honour guide my loue. Faine would I trust, but yet I dare not trie. Oh pitie me sweete Nymph, and doo but proue. I would resist, but yet I know not why. Oh Rosalynde be kinde, for times will change, Thy lookes ay nill be faire as now they be, Thine age from beautie may thy lookes estrange: Ah yeelde in time sweete Nymph, and pitie me. Oh Rosalynde thou must be pitifull. For Rosader is yong and beautifull. Oh gaine more great than kingdomes, or a crowne. Oh trust betraid if Rosader abuse me. First let the heauens conspire to pull me downe, And heauen and earth as abiect quite refuse me. Let sorrowes streame about my hatefull bower, And restlesse horror hatch within my breast, Let beauties eye afflict me with a lowre, Let deepe despaire pursue me without rest; Ere Rosalynde my loyaltie disproue, Ere Rosalynde accuse me for vnkinde. Then Rosalynde will grace thee with her loue, Then Rosalynde will haue thee still in minde. Then let me triumph more than Tithons deere, Since Rosalynde will Rosader respect: Then let my face exile his sorrie cheere, And frolicke in the comfort of affect: And say that Rosalynde is onely pitifull, Since Rosalynde is onely beautifull.  When thus they had finished their courting Eglogue in such a familiar clause, Ganimede as Augure of some good fortunes to light vpon their affections, beganne to be thus pleasant; How now Forrester, haue I not fitted your turn? haue I not plaide the woman handsomely, and shewed my selfe as coy in graunts, as courteous in desires, and been as full of suspition, as men of flatterie? And yet to salue all, iumpt I not all vp with the sweete vnion of loue? Did not Rosalynde content her Rosader? The Forrester at this smiling, shooke his head, and folding his armes made this merrie replie. Truth gentle Swaine, Rosader hath his Rosalynde: but as Ixion had Iuno , who thinking to possesse a goddesse, onely imbraced a clowde: in these imaginarie fruitions of fancie, I resemble the birds that fed themselues with Zeuxis painted grapes; but they grewe so leane with pecking at shaddowes, that they were glad with Aesops Cocke to scrape for a barley cornell: so fareth it with me, who to feede my selfe with the hope of my Mistres fauours, sooth my self in thy sutes, and onely in conceipt reape a wished for content: but if my food be no better than such amorous dreames, Venus at the yeares ende, shall finde mee but a leane louer. Yet doo I take these follies for high fortunes, and hope these fained affections doo deuine some vnfained ende of ensuing fancies. And thereupon (quoth Aliena ) Ile play the priest, from this day forth Ganimede shall call thee husband, and thou shalt call Ganimede wife, and so weele haue a marriage. Content (quoth Rosader ) and laught. Content (quoth Ganimede ) and changed as redde as a rose: and so with a smile and a blush, they made vp this iesting match, that after prooude to a marriage in earnest; Rosader full little thinking he had wooed and wonne his Rosalynde . But all was well, hope is a sweete string to harpe on: and therefore let the Forrester a while shape himselfe to his shaddow, and tarrie Fortunes leasure, till she may make a Metamorphosis fit for his purpose. I digresse, and therefore to Aliena: who said, the wedding was not worth a pinne, vnles there were some cheere, nor that bargaine well made that was not striken vp with a cuppe of wine: and therefore she wild Ganimede to set out such cates as they had, and to drawe out her bottle, charging the Forrester as hee had imagined his loues, so to conceipt these cates to be a most sumptuous banquet, and to take a Mazer of wine and to drinke to his Rosalynde: which Rosader did; and so they passed awaye the day in manie pleasant deuices. Till at last Aliena perceiued time would tarrie no man, and that the Sunne waxed verie lowe, readie to set: which made her shorten their amorous prattle, and ende the Banquet with a fresh Carrowse; which done, they all three rose, and Aliena broke off thus. Now Forrester, Phoebus that all this while hath been partaker of our sports; seeing euerie Woodman more fortunate in his loues, than hee in his fancies; seeing thou hast wonne Rosalynde , when he could not wooe Daphne , hides his head for shame, and bids vs adiew in a clowde; our sheep they poore wantons wander towards their foldes, as taught by Nature their due times of rest: which tells vs Forrester, we must depart. Marrie, though there were a marriage, yet I must carrie (this night) the Bryde with me, and tomorrow morning if you meete vs heere, Ile promise to deliuer her as good a maide as I finde her. Content quoth Rosader , tis enough for me in the night to dreame on loue, that in the day am so fond to doate on loue: and so till to morrow you to your Foldes, and I will to my Lodge; and thus the Forrester and they parted. He was no sooner gone, but Aliena and Ganimede went and folded their flockes, and taking vp their hookes, their bagges, and their bottles, hied homeward. By the waye, Aliena to make the time seeme short, began to prattle with Ganimede thus; I haue heard them say, that what the Fates forepoint, that Fortune pricketh downe with a period, that the starres are flickers in Venus Court, and desire hangs at the heele of Destenie; if it be so, then by all probable coniectures, this match will be a marriage: for if Augurisme be authenticall, or the deuines doomes principles, it cannot bee but such a shaddowe portends the issue of a substaunce, for to that ende did the Gods force the conceipt of this Eglogue, that they might discouer the ensuing consent of your affections: so that eare it bee long, I hope (in earnest) to daunce at your Wedding. Tush (quoth Ganimede ) al is not malte that is cast on the kill, there goes more words to a bargaine than one, loue feeles no footing in the aire, and fancie holdes it slipperie harbour to nestle in the tongue: the match is not yet so surely made but he may misse of his market; but if Fortune be his friend, I will not be his foe: and so I pray you (gentle Mistresse Aliena ) take it. I take all things well (quoth shee) that is your content, and am glad Rosader is yours: for now I hope your thoughts will be at quiet; your eye that euer looked at Loue, will nowe lende a glaunce on your Lambes: and then they will proue more buxsome and you more blythe, for the eyes of the Master feedes the Cattle. As thus they were in chat, they spied olde Coridon where hee came plodding to meete them: who tolde them supper was readie: which newes made them speede them home. Where we leaue them to the next morrow, and returne to Saladyne . All this while did poore Saladyne (banished from Bourdeaux and the Court of France by Torismond ) wander vp and downe in the Forrest of Arden , thinking to get to Lions , and so trauell through Germanie into Italy: but the Forrest being full of by-pathes, and he vnskillfull of the Countrey coast, slipt out of the way, and chaunced vp into the Desart, not farre from the place where Gerismond was, and his brother Rosader. Saladyne wearie with wandring vp and downe, and hungrie with long fasting; finding a little caue by the side of a thicket, eating such frute as the Forrest did affoord, and contenting himselfe with such drinke as Nature had prouided, and thirst made delicate, after his repast he fell in a dead sleepe. As thus he lay, a hungrie Lion came hunting downe the edge of the groue for pray, and espying Saladyne began to ceaze vpon him: but seeing he lay still without anie motion, he left to touch him, for that Lions hate to pray on dead carkasses: and yet desirous to haue some foode, the Lion lay downe and watcht to see if hee would stirre. While thus Saladyne slept secure, fortune that was careful ouer her champion, began to smile, and brought it so to passe, that Rosader (hauing striken a Deere that but lightly hurt fled through the thicket) came pacing downe by the groue with a Boare speare in his hand in great hast, he spied where a man lay a sleepe, and a Lion fast by him: amazed at this sight, as hee stood gazing, his nose on the sodaine bled; which made him coniecture it was some friend of his. Whereuppon drawing more nigh, hee might easely discerne his visage, and perceiued by his phisnomie that it was his brother Saladyne: which draue Rosader into a deepe passion, as a man perplexed at the sight of so vnexpected a chaunce, maruelling what shoulde driue his brother to trauerse those secrete Desarts without anie companie in such distresse and forlorne sort. But the present time craued no such doubting ambages: for either he must resolue to hazard his life for his reliefe, or els steale awaye, and leaue him to the crueltie of the Lion. In which doubt, he thus briefly debated with himselfe. Now Rosader , Fortune that long hath whipt thee with nettles, meanes to salue thee with roses; and hauing crost thee with manie frownes, now she presents thee with the brightnesse of her fauours. Thou that didst count thy selfe the most distressed of all men, maist accompt thy selfe now the most fortunate amongst men; if fortune can make men happie, or sweete reuenge be wrapt in a pleasing content. Thou seest Saladyne thine enemie, the worker of thy misfortunes, and the efficient cause of thine exile, subiect to the crueltie of a mercilesse Lion: brought into this miserie by the Gods, that they might seeme iust in reuenging his rigour, and thy iniuries. Seest thou not how the starres are in a fauourable aspect, the plannets in some pleasing coniunction, the fates agreeable to thy thoughtes, and the destenies perfourmers of thy desires, in that Saladyne shall die, and thou free of his bloud; he receiue meede for his amisse, and thou erect his Tombe with innocent hands. Now Rosader shalt thou returne to Bourdeaux , and enioye thy possessions by birth, and his reuenewes by inheritaunce: now maist thou triumph in loue, and hang Fortunes Altares with garlandes. For when Rosalynde heares of thy wealth, it will make her loue thee more willingly: for womens eyes are made of Chrisecoll, that is euer vnperfect vnlesse tempred with golde: and Iupiter soonest enioyed Danae , because he came to her in so rich a shower. Thus shall this Lion ( Rosader ) end the life of a miserable man, and from distresse raise thee to bee most fortunate. And with that casting his Boare speare on his neck, away he began to trudge. But hee had not stept backe two or three paces, but a new motion stroke him to the very hart, that resting his Boare speare against his breast, hee fell into this passionate humour. Ah Rosader , wert thou the sonne of Sir Iohn of Bourdeaux , whose vertues exceeded his valour, and yet the most hardiest Knight in all Europe? Should the honour of the father shine in the actions of the sonne? and wilt thou dishonour thy parentage, in forgetting the nature of a Gentleman? Did not thy father at his last gaspe breathe out this golden principle; Brothers amitie is like the drops of Balsamum , that salueth the most dangerous sores? Did hee make a large exhort vnto concord, and wilt thou shewe thy selfe carelesse? Oh Rosader , what though Saladyne hath wronged thee, and made thee liue an exile in the Forrest? shall thy nature be so cruell, or thy nurture so crooked, or thy thoughts so sauage, as to suffer so dismall a reuenge? what, to let him be deuoured by wilde beasts? Non sapit, qui non sibi sapit is fondly spoken in such bitter extreames. Loose not his life Rosader to winne a world of treasure: for in hauing him thou hast a brother, and by hazarding for his life, thou gettest a friend, and reconcilest an enemie: and more honour shalt thou purchase by pleasuring a foe, than reuenging a thousand iniuries. With that his Brother began to stirre, and the Lion to rowse himselfe: whereupon Rosader sodainely charged him with the Boare speare, and wounded the Lion verie sore at the first stroake. The beast feeling himselfe to haue a mortall hurt, leapt at Rosader , and with his pawes gaue him a sore pinch on the breast that he had almost faln: yet as a man most valiant, in whom the sparkes of Sir Iohn of Bourdeaux remained, he recouered himselfe, and in short combat slew the Lion: who at his death roared so lowde, that Saladyne awaked, and starting vp was amazed at the sodayne sight of so monstrous a beast lie slaine by him, and so sweete a Gentleman wounded. He presently (as hee was of a ripe conceipt) began to coniecture, that the Gentleman had slain him in his defence. Whereuppon (as a man in a traunce) he stood staring on them both a good while, not knowing his Brother beeing in that disguise: at last hee burst into these tearmes. Sir whatsoeuer thou bee, (as full of honour thou must needs be, by the view of thy present valure) I perceiue thou hast redrest my fortunes by thy courage, and saued my life with thine owne losse: which ties me to be thine in all humble seruice. Thankes thou shalt haue as thy due, and more thou canst not haue: for my abilitie denies to perfourme a deeper debt. But if anie wayes it please thee to commaund me, vse me as farre as the power of a poore Gentleman may stretch. Rosader seeing hee was vnknowen to his brother, wondred to heare such courteous words come from his crabbed nature; but glad of such reformed nourture, hee made this aunswere. I am sir (whatsoeuer thou art) a Forrester and Ranger of these walkes: who following my Deere to the fall, was conducted hether by some assenting Fate, that I might saue thee, and disparage my selfe. For comming into this place, I sawe thee asleepe, and the Lion watching thy awake, that at thy rising hee might prey vppon thy carkasse. At the first sight, I coniectured thee a Gentleman, (for all mens thoughts ought to be fauourable in imagination) and I counted it the part of a resolute man to purchase a strangers reliefe, though with the losse of his owne bloud: which I haue perfourmed (thou seest) to mine owne preiudice. If therefore thou be a man of such worth as I valew thee by thy exteriour liniaments, make discourse vnto mee what is the cause of thy present fortunes. For by the furrowes in thy face thou seemest to be crost with her frowns: but whatsoeuer or howsoeuer, let me craue that fauour, to heare the tragicke cause of thy estate. Saladyne sitting downe, and fetching a deepe sigh, began thus. Although the discourse of my fortunes, be the renewing of my sorrowes, and the rubbing of the scar, will open a fresh wound; yet that I may not prooue ingratefull to so courteous a Gentleman, I will rather sitte downe and sigh out my estate, than giue anie offence by smoothering my griefe with silence. Know therefore (sir) that I am of Bourdeaux , and the sonne and heire of Syr Iohn of Bourdeaux , a man for his vertues and valour so famous, that I cannot thinke, but the fame of his honours, hath reacht farther than the knowledge of his Personage. The infortunate sonne of so fortunate a Knight am I, my name Saladyne: Who succeeding my Father in possessions but not in qualities, hauing two Brethren committed by my Father at his death to my charge, with such golden principles of brotherly concord, as might haue pierst like the Syrens melodie into anie humane eare. But I (with Vlysses became deafe against his Philosophicall harmony, and made more value of profite than of vertue, esteeming golde sufficient honour, and wealth the fittest title for a gentlemans dignitie: I set my middle brother to the Uniuersitie to be a Scholler, counting it enough if he might pore on a booke, while I fed vpon his reuenewes and for the yongest (which was my fathers ioye) yong Rosader . And with that, naming of Rosader, Saladyne sate him downe and wept. Nay forward man (quoth the Forrester) teares are the vnfittest salue that anie man can applie for to cure sorowes, and therefore cease from such feminine follies, as shoulde droppe out of a Womans eye to deceiue, not out of a Gentlemans looke to discouer his thoughts, and forward with thy discourse. Oh sir (quoth Saladyne ) this Rosader that wringes teares from mine eyes, and bloud from my heart, was like my father in exteriour personage and in inward qualities: for in the prime of his yeares he aimed all his acts at honor, and coueted rather to die, than to brooke anie iniurie vnworthie a Gentlemans credite. I, whom enuie had made blinde, and couetousnesse masked with the vaile of selfe loue, seeing the Palme tree grow straight, thought to suppresse it being a twig: but Nature will haue her course, the Cedar will be tall, the Diamond bright, the Carbuncle glistering, and vertue will shine though it be neuer so much obscured. For I kept Rosader as a slaue, and vsed him as one of my seruile hindes, vntil age grew on, and a secrete insight of my abuse entred into his minde: insomuch, that hee could not brooke it, but coueted to haue what his father left him, and to liue of himselfe. To be short sir, I repined at his fortunes, and he countercheckt me not with abilitie but valour, vntill at last by my friends and aid of such as followed golde more than right or vertue, I banisht him from Bourdeaux , and he pore Gentleman liues no man knowes where in some distressed discontent. The Gods not able to suffer such impietie vnreuenged, so wrought, that the King pickt a causeles quarrell against me, in hope to haue my lands, and so hath exiled me out of France for euer. Thus, thus sir, am I the most miserable of all men, as hauing a blemish in my thoughtes for the wrongs I proffered Rosader , and a touche in my estate to be throwen from my proper possessions by iniustice. Passionate thus with manie griefes, in penaunce of my former follies, I goe thus pilgrime like to seeke out my Brother, that I may reconcile my selfe to him in all submission, and afterward wend to the holy Land, to ende my yeares in as manie vertues, as I haue spent my youth in wicked vanities. Rosader hearing the resolution of his brother Saladyne began to compassionate his sorrowes, and not able to smother the sparkes of Nature with fained secrecie, he burst into these louing speaches. Then know Saladyne (quoth he) that thou hast met with Rosader ; who grieues as much to see thy distresse, as thy selfe to feele the burden of thy miserie. Saladyne casting vp his eye, and noting well the phisnomie of the Forrester, knew that it was his brother Rosader: which made him so bash and blush at the first meeting, that Rosader was faine to recomfort him. Which he did in such sort, yt he shewed how highly he held reuenge in scorne. Much a doo there was betweene these two Brethren, Saladyne in crauing pardon, and Rosader in forgiuing and forgetting all former iniuries; the one submisse, the other curteous; Saladyne penitent and passionate, Rosader kinde & louing; that at length Nature working an vnion of theyr thoughts, they earnestly embraced, and fell from matters of vnkindnesse, to talke of the Countrey life, which Rosader so highly commended, that his brother began to haue a desire to taste of that homely content. In this humour Rosader conducted him to Gerismonds Lodge, and presented his brother to the King; discoursing the whole matter how all had happened betwixt them. The King looking vppon Saladyne , found him a man of a most beautifull personage, and saw in his face sufficient sparkes of ensuing honours, gaue him great entertainment, and glad of their friendly reconcilement, promised such fauour as the pouertie of his estate might affoord: which Saladyne gratefully accepted. And so Gerismond fell to question of Torismonds life? Saladyne briefly discourst vnto him his iniustice and tyrannies: with such modestie (although hee had wronged him) that Gerismond greatly praised the sparing speach of the yong Gentleman. Manie questions past, but at last Gerismond began with a deepe sigh, to inquire if there were anie newes of the welfare of Alinda or his daughter Rosalynde? None sir quoth Saladyne , for since their departure they were neuer heard of. Iniurious Fortune (quoth the King) that to double the Fathers miserie, wrongst the Daughter with misfortunes. And with that (surcharged with sorrowes) he went into his Cel, & left Saladyne and Rosader , whom Rosader streight conducted to the sight of Adam Spencer . Who seeing Saladyne in that estate, was in a browne studie: but when hee heard the whole matter, although he grieued for the exile of his Master, yet hee ioyed that banishment had so reformed him, that from a lasciuious youth hee was prooued a vertuous Gentleman. Looking a longer while, and seeing what familiaritie past betweene them, and what fauours were interchanged with brotherly affection, he said thus; I marrie, thus should it be, this was the concord that olde Sir Iohn of Bourdeaux wisht betwixt you. Now fulfill you those precepts he breathed out at his death, and in obseruing them, looke to liue fortunate, and die honourable. Wel said Adam Spencer quoth Rosader , but hast anie victualls in store for vs? A peece of a red Deere (quoth he) and a bottle of wine. Tis Forresters fare brother, quoth Rosader : and so they sate downe and fell to their cates. Assoone as they had taken their repast, and had well dined, Rosader tooke his brother Saladyne by the hand, and shewed him the pleasures of the Forrest, and what content they enioyed in that meane estate. Thus for two or three dayes he walked vp and down with his brother, to shewe him all the commodities that belonged to his Walke. In which time hee was mist of his Ganimede , who mused greatly (with Aliena ) what should become of their Forester. Some while they thought he had taken some word vnkindly, and had taken the pet: then they imagined some new loue had withdrawen his fancie, or happely that he was sicke, or detained by some great businesse of Gerismonds , or that he had made a reconcilement with his brother, and so returned to Bourdeaux . These coniectures did they cast in their heads, but especially Ganimede: who hauing Loue in her heart prooued restlesse, and halfe without patience, that Rosader wronged hir with so long absence: for Loue measures euerie minute, and thinkes howers to be dayes, and dayes to be months, till they feed their eyes with the sight of their desired obiect. Thus perplexed liued poore Ganimede: while on a day sitting with Aliena in a great dumpe, she cast vp her eye, and saw where Rosader came pacing towards them with his forrest bill on his necke. At that sight her colour chaungde, and she said to Aliena ; See Mistresse where our iolly Forrester comes. And you are not a little glad thereof (quoth Aliena ) your nose bewrayes what porredge you loue, the winde can not bee tied within his quarter, the Sunne shaddowed with a vaile, Oyle hidden in water, nor Loue kept out of a Womans lookes: but no more of that, Lupus est in fabula . As soone as Rosader was come within the reach of her tungs ende, Aliena began thus: Why how now gentle Forrester, what winde hath kept you from hence? that beeing so newly married, you haue no more care of your Rosalynde , but to absent your selfe so manie dayes? Are these the passions you painted out so in your Sonnets and roundelaies? I see well hote loue is soone colde, and that the fancie of men, is like to a loose feather that wandreth in the aire with the blast of euerie winde. You are deceiued Mistres quoth Rosader , twas a coppie of vnkindnesse that kept me hence, in that I being married, you carried away the Bryde: but if I haue giuen anie occasion of offence by absenting my selfe these three dayes, I humblie sue for pardon: which you must graunt of course, in that the fault is so friendly confest with penaunce. But to tell you the truth (faire Mistresse, and my good Rosalynde ) my eldest Brother by the iniurie of Torismond is banished from Bourdeaux , and by chaunce hee and I met in the Forrest. And heere Rosader discourst vnto them what had hapned betwixt them: which reconcilement made them gladde, especially Ganimede . But Aliena hearing of the tyrannie of her Father, grieued inwardly, and yet smothred all things with such secrecie, that the concealing was more sorrow than the conceipt: yet that her estate might be hid still, shee made faire weather of it, and so let all passe. Fortune, that sawe how these parties valued not her Deitie, but helde her power in scorne, thought to haue about with them, and brought the matter to passe thus. Certaine Rascalls that liued by prowling in the Forrest, who for feare of the Prouost Marshall had caues in the groues and thickets, to shrowde themselues from his traines; hearing of the beautie of this faire Shepheardesse Aliena , thought to steale her away, and to giue her to the King for a present; hoping, because the King was a great lechour, by such a gift to purchase all their pardons: and therfore came to take her and her Page away. Thus resolued, while Aliena and Ganimede were in this sad talk, they came rushing in, and laid violent hands vpon Aliena and her Page, which made them crie out to Rosader: who hauing the valour of his father stamped in his heart, thought rather to die in defence of his friends, than anie way be toucht with the least blemish of dishonour; and therfore dealt such blowes amongst them with his weapon, as he did witnesse well vpon their carcasses, that he was no coward. But as Ne Hercules quidem contra duos , so Rosader could not resist a multitude, hauing none to backe him; so that hee was not onely rebatted, but sore wounded, and Aliena and Ganimede had been quite carried away by these Rascals, had not Fortune (that ment to turne her frowne into a fauour) brought Saladyne that way by chaunce; who wandring to finde but his Brothers Walke, encountred this crue: and seeing not onely a shepheardesse and her boy forced, but his brother wounded, hee heaued vp a forrest bill he had on his necke, and the first hee stroke had neuer after more neede of the Phisition: redoubling his blowes with such courage, that the slaues were amazed at his valour. Rosader espying his brother so fortunately arriued, and seeing how valiantly he behaued himselfe, though sore wouded, rushed amongst them, and laid on such load, that some of the crue were slaine, and the rest fled, leauing Aliena  & Ganimede in the possession of Rosader and Saladyne . Aliena after she had breathed a while and was come to her selfe from this feare, lookt about her, and saw where Ganimede was busie dressing vp the wounds of the Forrester: but she cast her eye vpon this courteous champion that had made so hote a rescue, and that with such affection, that shee began to measure euerie part of him with fauour, and in her selfe to commend his personage and his vertue, holding him for a resolute man, that durst assaile such a troupe of vnbridled villaines. At last gathering her spirites together, she returned him these thankes. Gentle sir, whatsoeuer you be that haue aduentured your flesh to relieue our fortunes, as we holde you valiant, so we esteeme you courteous, and to haue as manie hidden vertues, as you haue manifest resolutions. Wee poore Shepheards haue no wealth but our flockes, and therefore can we not make requitall with anie great treasures: but our recompence is thankes, and our rewardes to our friendes without faining. For ransome therefore of this our rescue, you must content your selfe to take such a kinde gramercie, as a poore Shepheardesse and her Page may giue: with promise (in what wee may) neuer to prooue ingratefull. For this Gentleman that is hurt, yong Rosader , he is our good neighbour and familiar acquaintance, weele pay him with smiles, and feede him with loue-lookes: and though he bee neuer the fatter at the yeares ende, yet wele so hamper him that he shall holde himselfe satisfied. Saladyne hearing this Shepheardesse speake so wisely began more narrowly to prie into her perfection, and to suruey all her liniaments with a curious insight; so long dallying in the flame of her beautie, that to his cost he found her to be most excellent: for Loue that lurked in all these broiles to haue a blowe or two, seeing the parties at the gaze, encountred them both with such a venie, that the stroke pierst to the heart so deepe, as it could neuer after be raced out. At last after he had looked so long, till Aliena waxt red, he returned her this answere. Faire Shepheardesse, if Fortune graced mee with such good hap, as to doo you anie fauour, I holde my selfe as contented, as if I had gotten a great conquest: for the reliefe of distressed women is the speciall point, that Gentlemen are tied vnto by honour: seeing then my hazarde to rescue your harmes, was rather dutie than curtesie, thaks is more than belongs to the requitall of such a fauour. But least I might seeme either too coye or too carelesse of a Gentlewomans proffer, I wil take your kinde gramercie for a recompence. All this while that he spake, Ganimede lookt earnestly vpon him, and said; Trulie Rosader , this Gentleman fauours you much in the feature of your face. No meruaile (quoth hee, gentle Swaine) for tis my eldest brother Saladyne . Your brother quoth Aliena? (& with that she blusht) he is the more welcome, and I holde my selfe the more his debter: and for that he hath in my behalfe done such a peece of seruice, if it please him to doo me that honour, I will call him seruant, and he shall call me Mistresse. Content sweet Mistresse quoth Saladyne , and when I forget to call you so, I will be vnmindfull of mine owne selfe. Away with these quirkes and quiddities of loue quoth Rosader , and giue me some drinke, for I am passing thirstie, and then wil I home for my wounds bleede sore, and I will haue them drest. Ganimede had teares in her eyes, and passions in her heart to see her Rosader so pained, and therefore stept hastely to the bottle, and filling out some wine in a Mazer, shee spiced it with such comfortable drugs as she had about her, and gaue it him; which did comfort Rosader: that rising (with the helpe of his brother) he tooke his leaue of them, and went to his Lodge. Ganimede assoone as they were out of sight, ledde his flockes downe to a vale, and there vnder the shaddow of a Beech tree sate downe, and began to mourne the misfortunes of her sweete heart. And Aliena (as a woman passing discontent) seuering her selfe from her Ganimede , sitting vnder a Lymon tree, began to sigh out the passions of her newe Loue, and to meditate with her selfe on this manner. Ay me , now I see, and sorrowing sigh to see that Dianaes Lawrells are harbours for Venus Doues, that there trace as well through the Lawnes, wantons as chast ones; that Calisto be she neuer so charie, will cast one amorous eye at courting Ioue: that Diana her self will change her shape, but shee will honour Loue in a shaddow: that maidens eyes be they as hard as Diamonds, yet Cupide hath drugs to make them more pliable than waxe. See Alinda , howe Fortune and Loue haue interleagued themselues to be thy foes: and to make thee their subiect or els an abiect, haue inueigled thy sight with a most beautiful obiect. Alace thou didst holde Venus for a giglot, not a goddesse; and now thou shalt be forst to sue suppliant to her Deitie, Cupide was a boy and blinde, but alas his eye had aime inough to pierce thee to the heart. While I liued in the Court, I helde Loue in contempt, and in high seates I had small desires. I knewe not affection while I liued in dignitie, nor could Venus counterchecke me, as long as my fortune was maiestie, and my thoughtes honour: and shall I nowe bee high in desires, when I am made lowe by Destenie? I haue hearde them saye, that Loue lookes not at low cottages, that Venus settes in Roabes not in ragges, that Cupide flyes so high, that hee scornes to touche pouertie with his heele. Tush Alinda , these are but olde wiues tales, and neither authenticall precepts, nor infallible principles: for Experience tells thee, that Peasaunts haue theyr passions, as well as Princes, that Swaynes as they haue their labours, so they haue theyr amours, and Loue lurkes assoone about a Sheepcoate, as a Pallaice. Ah Alinda , this day in auoiding a preiudice thou art fallen into a deeper mischiefe; being rescued from the robbers, thou art become captiue to Saladyne: and what then? Women must loue, or they must cease to liue: and therefore did Nature frame them faire, that they might be subiects to fancie. But perhaps Saladynes eye is leuelde vpon a more seemelier Saint. If it be so, beare thy passions with patience, say Loue hath wrongd thee, that hath not wroong him; and if he be proud in contempt, bee thou rich in content; and rather die than discouer anie desire: for there is nothing more precious in a woman, than to conceale Loue, and to die modest. He is the sonne and heire of Sir Iohn of Bourdeaux , a youth comely enough: oh Alinda , too comely, els hadst not thou been thus discontent; valiant, and that fettered thine eye; wise, els hadst thou not been nowe wonne: but for all these vertues, banished by thy father; and therefore if hee know thy parentage, he will hate the fruite for the tree, and condempne the yong sien for the olde stocke. Well, howsoeuer, I must loue: and whomsoeuer, I will: and whatsoeuer betide, Aliena will thinke well of Saladyne : suppose he of me as he please. And with that fetching a deepe sigh, she rise vp, and went to Ganimede: who all this while sate in a great dumpe, fearing the imminent danger of her friend Rosader ; but now Aliena began to comfort her, her selfe beeing ouer growen with sorrowes, and to recall her from her melancholie with manie pleasaunt perswasions. Ganimede tooke all in the best part, and so they went home together after they had folded their flockes, supping with olde Coridon , who had prouided there cates. He after supper, to passe away the night while bedde time, began a long discourse, how Montanus the yong Shepheard that was in loue with Phoebe , could by no meanes obtaine anie fauour at her hands: but still pained in restlesse passions, remained a hapelesse and perplexed Louer. I would I might (quoth Aliena ) once see that Phoebe , is shee so faire, that she thinkes no shepheard worthie of her beautie: or so froward, that no loue nor loyaltie will content hir: or so coye, that she requires a long time to be wooed: or so foolish that she forgets, that like a fop she must haue a large haruest for a little corne? I cannot distinguish (quoth Coridon ) of these nice qualities: but one of these dayes Ile bring Montanus and her downe, that you may both see their persons, and note theyr passions: and then where the blame is, there let it rest. But this I am sure quoth Coridon , if all maidens were of her minde, the world would growe to a madde passe; for there would be great store of wooing and little wedding, manie words and little worship, much follie and no faith. At this sad sentence of Coridon so solempnlie brought foorth, Aliena smiled: and because it waxt late, she and her page went to bed, both of them hauing fleas in their eares to keep the awake, Ganimede for the hurt of her Rosader , and Aliena for the affection she bore to Saladyne . In this discontented humor they past away the time, til falling on sleep, their senses at rest, Loue left them to their quiet slumbers: which were not long. For assoone as Phoebus rose from his Aurora , and began to mount him in the Skie, summoning the Plough- swaines to their handie labour, Aliena arose; and going to the couche where Ganimede laye, awakened her page, and said the morning was farre spent, the deaw smal, and time called them awaye to their foldes. Ah, ah, (quoth Ganimede ) is the winde in that doore? then in faith I perceiue that there is no Diamond so harde but will yeelde to the file, no Cedar so strong but the winde will shake, nor anie minde so chaste but Loue will change. Well Aliena , must Saladyne be the man, and will it be a match? Trust me he is faire and valiant, the sonne of a worthie Knight; whome if hee imitate in perfection as hee represents him in proportion, he is worthie of no lesse than Aliena . But he is an exile: what then? I hope my Mistres respects the vertues not the wealth, and measures the qualities not the substance. Those dames that are like Danae , that like Ioue in no shape but in a shower of golde; I wish them husbandes with much wealth and little wit; that the want of the one may blemish the abundance of the other. It should (my Aliena ) staine the honour of a Shepheardes life to set the end of passions vpon pelfe. Loues eyes looks not so low as gold, there is no fees to be paid in Cupids Courtes: and in elder time (as Coridon hath tolde me) the Shepheards Loue-gifts were apples and chestnuts, & then their desires were loyall and their thoughts constant. But now  Quaerenda pecunia primum, post nummos virtus. And the time is growen to that which Horace in his Satyres wrote on:  omnis enim res Uirtus fama decus diuina humanaque pulchris Diuitijs parent: quas qui constrinxerit ille Clarus erit, fortis, iustus, sapiens, etiam & rex Et quicquid volet. But Aliena let it not be so with thee in thy fancies, but respect his faith, and there an ende. Aliena hearing Ganimede thus forward to further Saladyne in his affections, thought she kist the childe for the nurses sake, and wooed for him that she might please Rosader , made this replie; Why Ganimede , whereof growes this perswasion? Hast thou seene Loue in my lookes? Or are mine eyes growen so amorous, that they discouer some new entertained fancies? If thou measurest my thoughtes by my countenance, thou maist prooue as ill a Phisiognomer as the Lapidarie, that aymes at the secrete vertues of the Topace, by the exterior shadow of the stone. The operation of the Agate is not knowen by the strakes, nor the Diamond prized by his brightnesse, but by his hardnesse. The Carbuncle that shineth most, is not euer the most precious: and the Apothecaries choose not flowers for their coulours, but for their vertues. Womens faces are not alwaies Kalenders of fancie, nor doo their thoughtes and their lookes euer agree: for when their eyes are fullest of fauors, then they are oft most emptie of desire: and when they seeme to frown at disdaine, then are they most forwarde to affection. If I bee melancholie, then Ganimede tis not a consequence that I am entangled with the perfection of Saladyne . But seeing fire cannot be hid in the straw, nor Loue kept so couert but it will bee spied, what should friends conceale fancies? Know my Ganimede , the beautie and valour, the wit and prowesse of Saladyne hath fettered Aliena so farre, as there is no obiect pleasing to her eyes, but the sight of Saladyne: and if loue haue done me iustice, to wrap his thoughts in the foldes of my face, and that he be as deeply enamoured as I am passionate; I tell thee Ganimede , there shall not be much wooing, for she is alreadie wonne, and what needes a longer batterie. I am glad quoth Ganimede that it shall be thus proportioned, you to match with Saladyne , and I with Rosader: thus haue the Destenies fauoured vs with some pleasing aspect, that haue made vs as priuate in our loues, as familiar in our fortunes. With this Ganimede start vp, made her readie, & went into the fields with Aliena: where vnfolding their flockes, they sate them downe vnder an Oliue tree, both of them amorous, and yet diuerslie affected; Aliena ioying in the excellence of Saladyne , and Ganimede sorrowing for the wounds of her Rosader , not quiet in thought till she might heare of his health. As thus both of them sate in theyr dumpes, they might espie where Coridon came running towards them (almost out of breath with his hast). What newes with you (quoth Aliena ) that you come in such post? Oh Mistres (quoth Coridon ) you haue a long time desired to see Phoebe the faire Shepheardesse whom Montanus loues: so nowe if it please you and Ganimede but to walke with me to yonder thicket, there shall you see Montanus and her sitting by a Fountaine; he courting with his Countrey ditties, and she as coye as if she helde Loue in disdaine. The newes were so welcome to the two Louers, that vp they rose, and went with Coridon . Assoone as they drew nigh the thicket, they might espie where Phoebe sate, (the fairest Shepheardesse in all Arden , and be the frolickst Swaine in the whole Forrest) she in a peticoate of scarlet, couered with a greene mantle; and to shrowde her from the Sunne, a chaplet of roses: from vnder which appeared a face full of Natures excellence, and two such eyes as might haue amated a greater man than Montanus . At gaze vppon this gorgeous Nymph sat the Shepheard, feeding his eyes with her fauours, wooing with such piteous lookes, & courting with such deep straind sighs, as would haue made Diana her selfe to haue been compassionate. At last, fixing his lookes on the riches of her face, his head on his hande, and his elbow on his knee, he sung this mournefull Dittie.  A Turtle sate vpon a leauelesse tree, Mourning her absent pheare With sad and sorrie cheare: About her wondring stood The citizens of Wood, And whilest her plumes she rents And for her loue laments, The stately trees complaine them, The birdes with sorrow paine them: Each one that doth her view Her paine and sorrowes rue, But were the sorrowes knowen That me hath ouerthrowen, Oh how would Phoebe sigh, if she did looke on me? The loue sicke Polypheme that could not see, Who on the barraine shore His fortunes doth deplore, And melteth all in mone For Galatea gone: And with his piteous cries Afflicts both earth and Skies: And to his woe betooke Doth breake both pipe and hooke; For whom complaines the Morne, For whom the Sea Nymphs mourne. Alas his paine is nought: For were my woe but thought, Oh how would Phoebe sigh, if she did looke on mee? Beyond compare my paine yet glad am I, Jf gentle Phoebe daine to see her Montan die. After this, Montanus felt his passions so extreame, that he fell into this exclamation against the iniustice of Loue. Helas Tirant plein de rigueur, Modere vn peu ta violence: Que te sert si grande despense? C'est trop de flammes pour vn cueur. Esparguez en vne estin celle, Puis fay ton effort d'esmouoir, La fiere qui ne veut point voir, En quel fu je brusle pour elle. Execute Amour ce dessein, Et rabaisse vn peu son audace, Son cuer ne doit estre de glace. Bien que elle ait de Niege le sein. Montanus ended his Sonet with such a volley of sighs, and such a streame of teares, as might haue mooued any but Phoebe to haue graunted him fauour. But she measuring all his passions with a coye disdaine, and triumphing in the poore Shepheardes patheticall humours, smiling at his martyrdome, as though loue had been no maladie, scornefully warbled out this Sonnet.  Downe a downe. Thus Phillis sung by fancie once distressed: Who so by foolish Loue are stung, are worthely oppressed. And so sing I. With a downe, downe, &c. When Loue was first begot, And by the moouers will Did fall to humane lot His solace to fulfill. Deuoid of all deceipt, A chast and holy fire Did quicken mans conceipt, And womens breast inspire. The Gods that saw the good That mortalls did approue, With kinde and holy mood Began to talke of Loue. Downe a downe, Thus Phillis sung by fancie once distressed, &c. But during this accord, A wonder strange to heare: Whilest Loue in deed and word Most faithfull did appeare. False semblance came in place By iealozie attended, And with a double face Both loue and fancie blended. Which made the Gods forsake, And men from fancie flie, And maidens scorne a make; Forsooth and so will I. Downe a downe. Thus Phillis sung by fancie once distressed; Who so by foolish Loue are stung are worthely oppressed. And so sing I. with downe a downe, a downe downe, a downe a, Montanus hearing the cruel resolution of Phoebe , was so ouergrowen with passions, that from amorous Ditties he fell flat into these tearmes; Ah Phoebe quoth he, whereof art thou made, that thou regardest not my maladie? Am I so hatefull an obiect, that thine eyes condempne me for an abiect? or so base, that thy desires cannot stoope so lowe as to lende mee a gracious looke? My passions are manie, my loues more, my thoughts loyaltie, and my fancie faith: all deuoted in humble deuoire to the seruice of Phoebe: & shal I reape no reward for such fealties. The Swaines daylie labours is quit with the euenings hire, the Ploughmans toyle is eased with the hope of corne, what the Oxe sweates out at the plough he fatneth at the cribbe: but infortunate Montanus hath no salue for his sorrowes, nor anie hope of recopence for the hazard of his perplexed passions. If Phoebe , time may plead the proofe of my truth, twice seuen winters haue I loued faire Phoebe: if constancie bee a cause to farther my sute, Montanus thoughtes haue beene sealed in the sweete of Phoebes excellence, as farre from chaunge as she from loue: if outward passions may discouer inward affections, the furrowes in my face may decypher the sorrowes of my heart, and the mappe of my lookes the griefes of my minde. Thou seest ( Phoebe ) the teares of despayre haue made my cheekes full of wrinkles, and my scalding sighes haue made the aire Eccho her pitie conceiued in my plaints: Philomele hearing my passions, hath left her mournfull tunes to listen to the discourse of my miseries. I haue pourtraied in euerie tree the beautie of my Mistresse, & the despaire of my loues. What is it in the woods cannot witnes my woes? and who is it would not pitie my plaints? Onely Pooebe . And why? Because I am Montanus , and she Phoebe ; I a worthlesse Swaine, and shee the most excellent of all faires. Beautifull Phoebe , oh might I say pitifull, then happie were I though I tasted but one minute of that good hap. Measure Montanus not by his fortunes but by his loues; and ballaunce not his wealthe, but his desires, and lend but one gracious looke to cure a heape of disquieted cares: if not, ah if Phoebe can not loue, let a storme of frownes ende the discontent of my thoughts, and so let me perish in my desires, because they are aboue my deserts: onely at my death this fauour cannot be denied me, that all shall say, Montanus died for loue of harde hearted Phoebe . At these words she fild her face full of frownes, and made him this short and sharpe replie. Importunate Shepheard, whose loues are lawlesse, because restlesse: are thy passions so extreame that thou canst not conceale them with patience? Or art thou so folly-sick, that thou must needes be fancie-sicke? and in thy affection tied to such an exigent, as none serues but Phoebe . Well sir, if your market may be made no where els, home again, for your Mart is at the fairest. Phoebe is no lettice for your lippes, and her grapes hangs so high, that gaze at them you may, but touch them you cannot. Yet Montanus I speake not this in pride, but in disdaine; not that I scorne thee, but that I hate Loue: for I count it as great honour to triumph ouer Fancie, as ouer Fortune. Rest thee content therefore Montanus , cease from thy loues, and bridle thy lookes; quench the sparkles before they grow to a further flame: for in louing me thou shalt liue by losse, & what thou vtterest in words, are all written in the winde. Wert thou ( Montanus ) as faire as Paris , as hardie as Hector , as constant as Troylus , as louing as Leander; Phoebe could not loue, because she cannot loue at all: and therefore if thou pursue me with Phoebus , I must flie with Daphne . Ganimede ouer-hearing all these passions of Montanus , could not brooke the crueltie of Phoebe , but starting from behinde the bush said; And if Damzell you fled from me, I would transforme you as Daphne to a bay, and then in contempt trample your branches vnder my feete. Phoebe at this sodaine replie was amazed, especially when she saw so faire a Swaine as Ganimede ; blushing therefore, shee would haue been gone: but that he held her by the hand, and prosecuted his replie thus. What Shepheardesse, so fayre and so cruell? Disdaine beseemes not cottages, nor coynes maides: for either they be condempned to bee too proude, or too froward. Take heede (faire Nymph) that in despising Loue, you be not ouer-reacht with Loue, and in shaking off all, shape your selfe to your own shaddow: and so with Narcissus prooue passionate & yet vnpitied. Oft haue I heard, and sometimes haue I seene, high disdaine turnd to hot desires. Because thou art beautifull, be not so coye: as there is nothing more faire, so there is nothing more fading, as momentary as the shadowes which growes from a clowdie Sunne. Such (my faire Shepheardesse) as disdaine in youth desire in age, and then are they hated in the winter, that might haue been loued in the prime. A wrinkled maide is like to a parched Rose, that is cast vp in coffers to please the smell, not worne in the hand to content the eye. There is no follie in Loue to had I wist: and therefore be rulde by me, Loue while thou art young, least thou be disdained when thou art olde. Beautie nor time cannot bee recalde, and if thou loue, like of Montanus : for as his desires are manie, so his deserts are great. Phoebe all this while gazed on the perfection of Ganimede , as deeplie enamoured on his perfection, as Montanus inueigled with hers: for her eye made suruey of his excellent feature, which she found so rare, that she thought the ghost of Adonis had been leapt from Elizium in the shape of a Swaine. When she blusht at her owne follie to looke so long on a stranger, she mildlie made aunswere to Ganimede thus. I cannot denie sir but I haue heard of Loue, though I neuer felt Loue; and haue read of such a Goddesse as Venus , though I neuer saw anie but her picture: & perhaps, and with that she waxed red and bashful, and with all silent: which Ganimede perceiuing, commended in her selfe the bashfulnesse of the maide, and desired her to goe forward. And perhaps sir (quoth she) mine eye hath ben more prodigall to day than euer before: and with that she staid againe, as one greatly passionate and perplexed. Aliena seeing the hare through the maze, bade her forwarde with her prattle: but in vaine, for at this abrupt periode she broke off, and with her eyes full teares, and her face couered with a vermillion die, she sate downe and sightht. Whereuppon, Aliena and Ganimede seeing the Shepheardesse in such a strange plight, left Phoebe with her Montanus , wishing her friendly that shee would be more pliant to Loue, least in penaunce Venus ioyned her to some sharpe repentaunce. Phoebe made no replie, but fetcht such a sigh, that Eccho made relation of her plaint: giuing Ganimede such an adieu with a piercing glaunce, that the amorous Girle-boye perceiued Phoebe was pincht by the heele. But leauing Phoebe to the follies of her new fancie, and Montanus to attend vpon her; to Saladyne , who all this last night could not rest for the remembrance of Aliena: insomuch that he framed a sweete conceipted sonnet to content his humour, which he put in his bosome: being requested by his brother Rosader to go to Aliena and Ganimede , to signifie vnto them that his wounds were not daungerous. A more happie message could not happen to Saladyne , that taking his Forrest bil on his necke, he trudgeth in all hast towards the plaines, where Alienaes flockes did feede: comming iust to the place when they returned from Montanus and Phoebe . Fortune so conducted this iollie Forrester, that he encountred them and Coridon , whom he presently saluted in this manner. Faire Shepheardesse, and too faire, vnlesse your beautie be tempred with courtesie, & the liniaments of the face graced with the lowlinesse of minde: as manie good fortunes to you and your Page, as your selues can desire, or I imagine. My brother Rosader (in the griefe of his greene wounds) still mindfull of his friends, hath sent me to you with a kind salute, to shew that he brookes his paines with the more patience, in that he holds the parties precious in whose defence he receiued the preiudice. The report of your welfare, will bee a great comfort to his distempered bodie and distressed thoughts, and therefore he sent mee with a strict charge to visite you. And you (quoth Aliena ) are the more welcome in that you are messenger from so kind a Gentleman, whose paines we compassionate with as great sorrowe, as hee brookes them with griefe; and his wounds breedes in vs as manie passions, as in him extremities: so that what disquiet hee feeles in bodie, wee partake in heart. Wishing (if wee might) that our mishap might salue his maladie. But seeing our wills yeelds him little ease, our orizons are neuer idle to the Gods for his recouerie. I pray youth (quoth Ganimede with teares in his eies) when the Surgeon searcht him, helde he his wounds dangerous? Dangerous (quoth Saladyne ) but not mortall: andd the sooner to be cured, in that his patient is not impatient of anie paines: whereuppon my brother hopes within these ten dayes to walke abroad and visite you himselfe. In the meane time (quoth Ganimede ) say his Rosalynde commends her to him and bids him be of good cheere. I know not (quoth Saladyne ) who that Rosalynde is, but whatsoeuer she is, her name is neuer out of his mouth: but amidst the deepest of his passions he vseth Rosalynde as a charme to appease all sorrows with patience. Insomuch that I coniecture my brother is in loue, and she some Paragon that holdes his hart perplexed: whose name he oft records with sighs, sometimes with teares, straight with ioy, then with smiles; as if in one person Loue had lodged a Chaos of confused passions. Wherein I haue noted the variable disposition of fancie, that like the Polype in colours, so it changeth into sundrie humours: being as it should seeme a combate mixt with disquiet, and a bitter pleasure wrapt in a sweete preiudice, like to the Sinople tree, whose blossomes delight the smell, and whose fruite infects the tast. By my faith (quoth Aliena ) sir, you are deepe read in loue, or growes your insight into affection by experience? Howsoeuer, you are a great Philosopher in Venus principles, els could you not discouer our secrete aphorismes. But sir our countrey amours are not like your courtly fancies, nor is our wooing like your suing: for poore shepheards neuer plaine them till Loue paine them, where the Courtiers eyes is full of passions when his heart is most free from affection: they court to discouer their eloquence, we wooe to ease our sorrowes: euerie faire face with them must haue a new fancie sealed with a forefinger kisse and a farre fetcht sigh; we heere loue one, and liue to that one so log as life can maintain loue, vsing few ceremonies because we know fewe subtilties, and little eloquence for that wee lightly accompt of flatterie: only faith and troth thats shepheards wooing, and sir howe like you of this? So (quoth Saladyne ) as I could tie my selfe to such loue. What, and looke so low as a Shepheardesse, being the Sonne of Sir Iohn of Bourdeaux: such desires were a disgrace to your honours. And with that surueying exquisitely euerie part of him, as vttering all these words in a deepe passion, she espied the paper in his bosome: whereupon growing iealous that it was some amorous Sonnet, shee sodainly snatcht it out of his bosome, and asked if it were any secret? She was bashfull, and Saladyne blusht: which she perceiuing sayd; Nay then sir, if you waxe redde, my life for yours tis some Loue matter: I will see your Mistresse name, her praises, and your passions. And with that she lookt on it: which was written to this effect.  Jf it be true that heauens eternall course With restlesse sway and ceaselesse turning glides, If aire inconstant be, and swelling sourse Turne and returnes with many fluent tides, If earth in winter summers pride estrange, And Nature seemeth onely faire in change. Jf it be true that our immortall spright Deriude from heauenly pure, in wandring still In noueltie and strangenesse doth delight, And by discouerent power discerneth ill, And if the bodie for to worke his best Doth with the seasons change his place of rest: Whence comes it that (inforst by furious Skies) I change both place and soyle, but not my hart? Yet salue not in this change my maladies? Whence growes it that each obiect workes my smart? Alas J see my faith procures my misse, And change in loue against my nature is. Et florida pungunt.  Aliena hauing read ouer his sonnet, began thus plesantly to descant vpon it. I see Saladyne (quoth shee) that as the Sunne is no Sunne without his brightnesse, nor the diamond accounted for precious vnlesse it be hard: so men are not men vnlesse they be in loue; and their honours are measured by their amours not their labours, counting it more commendable for a Gentleman to be full of fancie, than full of vertue. I had thought  Otia si tollas periere Cupidinis arcus, Contemptaeque iacent, & sine luce faces: But I see Ouids axiome is not authenticall, for euen labor hath her loues, and extremitie is no pumice stone to race out fancie. Your selfe exiled from your wealth, friends & countrey by Torismond , (sorrowes enough to suppresse affections) yet amidst the depth of these extreamities, Loue will be Lord, and shew his power to bee more predominant than Fortune. But I pray you sir (if without offence I maye craue it) are they some new thoughts, or some olde desires? Saladyne (that now saw opportunitie pleasaunt) thought to strike while the yron was hote, and therefore taking Aliena by the hand sate downe by her; and Ganimede to giue them leaue to their Loues, founde her selfe busie about the foldes, whilest Saladyne fell into this prattle with Aliena . Faire Mistres, if I bee blunt in discouering my affections, and vse little eloquence in leuelling out my loues: I appeale for pardon to your owne principles that say, Shepheards vse few ceremonies, for that they acquaint theselues with fewe subtilties: to frame my selfe therefore to your countrey fashion with much faith and little flatterie, knowe beautifull Shepheardesse, that whilest I liued in the court I knew not Loues cumber, but I held affection as a toy, not as a maladie; vsing fancie as the Hiperborei do their flowers, which they weare in their bosome all day, and cast them in the fire for fuell at night. I liked al because I loued none, and who was most faire on her I fed mine eye: but as charely as the Bee, that assoone as shee hath suckt honnie from the rose, flies straight to the next Marigold. Liuing thus at mine owne list, I wondred at such as were in loue, & when I read their passions, I tooke them only for poems that flowed from the quicknesse of the wit not the sorrowes of the heart. But nowe (faire Nymph) since I became a Forrester, Loue hath taught me such a lesson that I must confesse his deitie and dignitie, and saye as there is nothing so precious as beautie, so there is nothing more piercing than fancie. For since first I arriued in this place, and mine eie tooke a curious suruey of your excellence, I haue been so fettered with your beautie and vertue, as (sweet Aliena) Saladyne without further circumstance loues Aliena . I coulde paint out my desires with long ambages, but seeing in manie words lies mistrust, and that trueth is euer naked; let this suffice for a countrey wooing, Saladyne loues Aliena , and none but Aliena . Although these words were most heauenly harmonie in the eares of the Shepheardesse: yet to seeme coye at the first courting, and to disdaine Loue howsoeuer shee desired Loue, she made this replie. Ah Saladyne , though I seeme simple, yet I am more subtile than to swallow the hook because it hath a painted bait: as men are wilie so women are warie, especially if they haue that wit by others harmes to beware. Doo wee not knowe Saladyne , that mens tongues are like Mercuries pipe, that can inchaunt Argus with an hundred eies; and their words as preiudiciall as the charmes of Circes , that transfourme men into monsters. If such Syrens sing, wee poore Women had neede stoppe our eares, least in hearing we proue so foolish hardie as to beleeue them, and so perrish in trusting much, and suspecting little. Saladyne , Piscator ictus sapit , he that hath been once poysoned  & afterwards feares not to bowse of euerie potion, is woorthie to suffer double pennaunce. Giue me leaue then to mistrust, though I doo not condempne. Saladyne is now in loue with Aliena , he a Gentleman of great Parentage, she a Shepheardesse of meane Parents; he honourable, and shee poore? Can Loue consist of contrarieties? Will the Fawlcon pearch with the Kistresse, the Lion harbour with the Woolfe? Will Venus ioyne roabes and rags together? Or can there be a simpathie betweene a King and a begger. Then Saladyne how can I beleeue thee that loue should vnite our thoughts, when Fortune hath set such a difference betweene our degrees? But suppose thou likest of Alienaes beautie, men in their fancie resemble the waspe, which scornes that flower from which she hath fetcht her waxe; playing like the inhabitants of the Ilande Tenerifa , who when they haue gathered the sweete spices, vse the trees for fuel: so men when they haue glutted themselues with the faire of womens faces, holde them for necessarie euills; and wearied with that which they seemed so much to loue, cast away fancie as children doo their rattles; and loathing that which so deepelie before they likte, especially such as take loue in a minute, & haue their eyes attractiue like ieate apt to entertaine anie obiect, are as readie to let it slip againe. Saladyne hearing howe Aliena harpt still vppon one string, which was the doubt of mens constancie, hee broke off her sharp inuectiue thus. I graunt Aliena (quoth hee) manie men haue doone amisse in proouing soone ripe and soone rotten, but particular instances inferre no generall conclusions: and therefore I hope what others haue faulted in shall not preiudice my fauours. I will not vse sophistrie to confirme my loue, for that is subtiltie; nor long discourses, least my words might bee thought more than my faith: but if this will suffice, that by the honour of a Gentleman I loue Aliena , and wooe Aliena not to crop the blossomes and reiect the tree, but to consummate my faithfull desires, in the honourable ende of marriage. At this word marriage: Aliena stood in a maze what to answere: fearing that if she were too coye to driue him away with her disdaine; and if she were too courteous to discouer the heate of her desires. In a dilemma thus what to doo, at last this she said. Saladyne euer since I saw thee, I fauoured thee, I cannot dissemble my desires, because I see thou doost faithfully manifest thy thoughtes, and in liking thee I loue thee so farre as mine honour holdes fancie still in suspence: but if I knew thee as vertuous as thy father, or as well qualified as thy brother Rosader , the doubt shoulde be quicklie decided: but for this time to giue thee an answere, assure thy selfe this, I will either marrie with Saladyne , or still liue a virgine: and with this they strained one anothers hand. Which Ganimede espying, thinking he had had his Mistres long enough at shrift, said; what, a match or no? A match (quoth Aliena ) or els it were an ill market. I am glad (quoth Ganimede ) I would Rosader were well here to make vp a messe. Well remembred (quoth Saladyne ) I forgot I left my brother Rosader alone: and therefore least being solitarie he should increase his sorrowes I will hast me to him. May it please you then to commaund me anie seruice to him, I am readie to be a duetifull messenger. Onely at this time commend me to him (quoth Aliena ) & tell him, though wee cannot pleasure him we pray for him. And forget not (quoth Ganimede ) my commendations: but say to him that Rosalynde sheds as manie teares from her heart, as he drops of bloud from his wounds, for the sorrow of his misfortunes; feathering all her thoughtes with disquiet, till his welfare procure her content: say thus (good Saladyne ) and so farewell. He hauing his message, gaue a courteous adieu to them both, especially to Aliena: and so playing loath to depart, went to his brother. But Aliena , she perplexed and yet ioyfull, past away the day pleasauntly still praising the perfection of Saladyne , not ceasing to chat of her new Loue, till euening drew on; and then they folding their sheepe, went home to bed. Where we leaue them and returne to Phoebe . Phoebe fiered with the vncouth flame of loue, returned to her fathers house; so galled with restlesse passions, as now she began to acknowledge, that as there was no flower so fresh but might bee patched with the Sunne, no tree so strong but might bee shaken with a storme; so there was no thought so chast, but Time armde with Loue could make amorous: for shee that helde Diana for the Goddesse of her deuotion, was now faine to flie to the Altare of Venus ; as suppliant now with prayers, as she was froward afore with disdaine. As she lay in her bed, she called to minde the seuerall beauties of yong Ganimed ; first his locks, which being amber hued, passeth the wreathe that Phoebus puts on to make his front glorious; his browe of yuorie, was like the seate where Loue and Maiestie sits inthronde to enchayne Fancie; his eyes as bright as the burnishing of the heauen, darting foorth frownes with disdaine, and smiles with fauor, lightning such lookes as would enflame desire, were shee wrapt in the Circle of the frozen Zonne; in his cheekes the vermilion reiniure of the Rose flourished vpon naturall Alabaster, the blush of the Morne and Lunaes siluer showe were so liuely portrayed, that the Troyan that fils out wine to Iupiter was not halfe so beautifull; his face was full of pleasance, and all the rest of his liniaments proportioned with such excellence, as Phoebe was fettred in the sweetnes of his feature. The Idea of these perfections tumbling in her minde, made the poore Shepheardesse so perplexed, as feeling a pleasure tempred with intollerable paines, and yet a disquiet mixed with a content, she rather wished to die, than to liue in this amorous anguish. But wishing is little worth in such extreames, and therefore was she forst to pine in her maladie, without anie salue for her sorrowes. Reueale it she durst not, as daring in such matters to make none her secretarie; and to conceale it, why it doubled her griefe: for as fire supprest growes to the greater flame, and the Current stopt to the more violent streame; so Loue smothred wrings the heart with the deeper passions. Perplexed thus with sundrie agonies, her foode began to faile, and the disquiet of her minde began to worke a distemperature of her bodie, that to be short Phoebe fell extreame sicke, and so sicke, as there was almost left no recouerie of health. Her father seeing his faire Phoebe thus distrest, sent for his friends, who sought by medicine to cure, and by counsaile to pacifie, but all in vaine: for although her bodie was feeble through long fasting, yet she did magis agrotare animo quam corpore . Which her friends perceiued and sorrowed at, but salue it they could not. The newes of her sicknesse was bruted abroad thorough all the Forrest: which no sooner came to Montanus care, but he like a madde man came to visite Phoebe . Where sitting by her bedde side, he began his Exordium with so manie teares and sighes, that she perceiuing the extremitie of his sorrowes, began now as a louer to pitie them, although Ganimede helde her from redressing them. Montanus craued to knowe the cause of her sicknesse, tempred with secrete plaints: but she aunswered him (as the rest) with silence, hauing still the forme of Ganimede in her minde, & coniecturing how shee might reueale her loues. To vtter it in words she found her selfe too bashfull, to discourse by anie friend shee would not trust anie in her amours, to remayne thus perplexed still and conceale all, it was a double death. Whereuppon for her last refuge she resolued to write vnto Ganimede: and therefore desired Montanus to absent him selfe a while, but not to depart: for she would see if she could steale a nappe. He was no sooner gone out of the chamber, but reaching to her standish, she tooke penne and paper, and wrote a letter to this effect. Faire Shepheard (and therefore is Phoebe infortunate because thou art so faire) although hetherto mine eies were adamants to resist Loue, yet I no sooner saw thy face but they became amorous to intertaine Loue: more deuoted to fancie than before they were repugnant to affection, addicted to the one by Nature, and drawen to the other by beautie; which being rare, and made the more excellent by manie vertues, hath so snared the freedome of Phoebe , as she rests at thy mercie, either to bee made the most fortunate of all Maidens, or the most miserable of all Women. Measure not Ganimede my loues by my wealth, nor my desires by my degrees: but thinke my thoughts are as full of faith, as thy face of amiable fauours. Then as thou knowest thy selfe most beautifull, suppose me most constant. If thou deemest me hard hearted because I hated Montanus , thinke I was forst to it by Fate & if thou saist I am kinde hearted because so lightly I loue thee at the first looke, thinke I was driuen to it by Destenie, whose influence as it is mightie, so it is not to be resisted. If my fortunes were anie thing but infortunate Loue, I woulde striue with Fortune: but he that wrests against the will of Venus , seekes to quench fire with oyle, and to thrust out one thorne by putting in another. If then Ganimede , Loue enters at the eie, harbours in the heart, and will neither bee driuen out with Phisicke nor reason: pitie me, as one whose maladie hath no salue but from thy sweete selfe, whose griefe hath no ease but through thy graunt, and thinke I am a Uirgine, who is deepely wrongd, when I am forst to wooe: and coniecture Loue to bee strong, that is more forceable than Nature. Thus distressed vnlesse by thee eased, I expect either to liue fortunate by thy fauour, or die miserable by thy deniall. Liuing in hope. Farewell. She that must be thine, or not be at all. Phoebe . To this Letter she annexed this Sonnet.  My boate doth passe the straights of seas incenst with fire, Filde with forgetfulnesse: amidst the winters night, A blinde and carelesse boy (brought vp by fonde desire) Doth guide me in the sea of sorrow and despight. For euerie oare, he sets a ranke of foolish thoughts, And cuts (in stead of waue) a hope without distresse; The windes of my deepe sighs (that thunder still for noughts) Haue split my sayles with feare, with care, with heauinesse. A mightie storme of teares, a blacke and hideous cloude, A thousand fierce disdaines doo slacke the haleyards oft: Till ignorance doo pull and errour hale the shrowdes, No starre for safetie shines, no Phoebe from aloft. Time hath subdued arte, and ioy is slaue to woe: Alas (Loues guide) be kinde; what shall I perish so? This Letter and the Sonnet being ended, she could find no fitte messenger to sende it by; and therefore shee called in Montanus , and intreated him to carrie it to Ganimede . Although poore Montanus saw day at a little hole, and did perceiue what passion pincht her: yet (that he might seeme dutifull to his Mistres in all seruice) he dissembled the matter, and became a willing messenger of his owne Martyrdome. And so (taking the letter) went the next morne verie early to the Plaines where Aliena fed her flockes, and there hee found Ganimede sitting vnder a Pomegranade tree sorrowing for the hard fortunes of her Rosader. Montanus saluted him, and according to his charge deliuered Ganimede the letters, which (he said) came from Phoebe . At this the wanton blusht, as beeing abasht to thinke what newes should come from an vnknowen Shepheardesse, but taking the letters vnript the seales, and read ouer the discourse of Phoebes fancies. When shee had read and ouerread them, Ganimede began to smile, & looking on Montanus fell into a great laughter: and with that called Aliena , to whom she shewed the writings. Who hauing perused them, conceipted them verie pleasantly, and smiled to see how Loue had yoakt her, who before disdained to stoupe to the lure, Aliena whispering Ganimede in the eare, and saying; Knewe Phaebe what want there were in thee to perfourme her will, and how vnfit thy kinde is to bee kinde to her, she would be more wise and lesse enamoured: but leauing that, I pray thee let vs sport with this Swaine. At that worde, Ganimede tourning to Montanus , began to glaunce at him thus. I pray thee tell me Shepheard, by those sweet thoughts and pleasing sighes that grow from my Mistresse fauours, art thou in loue with Phoebe? Oh my Youth, quoth Montanus , were Phoebe so farre in loue with me, my Flockes would be more fat and their Master more quiet: for through the sorrowes of my discontent growes the leannesse of my sheepe. Alas poore Swaine quoth Ganimede , are thy passions so extreame or thy fancie so resolute, that no reason will blemish the pride of thy affection, and race out that which thou striuest for without hope? Nothing can make me forget Phoebe , while Montanus forget himselfe: for those characters which true Loue hath stamped, neither the enuie of Time nor Fortune can wipe awaye. Why but Montanus quoth Ganimede , enter with a deepe insight into the despaire of thy fancies, and thou shalt see the depth of thine owne follies: for (poore man) thy progresse in loue is a regresse to losse, swimming against the streame with the Crab, and flying with Apis Indica against winde and weather. Thou seekest with Phoebus to winne Daphne , and shee flies faster than thou canst followe: thy desires soare with the Hobbie, but her disdaine reacheth higher than thou canst make wing. I tell thee Montanus , in courting Phoebe thou barkest with the Wolues of Syria against the Moone, and roauest at such a marke with thy thoughtes, as is beyond the pitch of thy bow, praying to Loue when Loue is pitilesse, and thy maladie remedilesse. For proofe Montanus read these letters, wherein thou shalt see thy great follies and little hope. With that Montanus tooke them and perused them, but with such sorrow in his lookes, as they bewrayed a sourse of confused passions, in his heart: at euerie line his coulour changed, and euerie sentence was ended with a periode of sighes. At last, noting Phoebes extreame desire toward Ganimede , and her disdaine towards him, giuing Ganimede the letter, the Shepheard stoode as though hee had neither wonne nor lost. Which Ganimede perceiuing, wakened him out his dreame thus; Now Montanus , doost thou see thou vowest great seruice and obteinest but little reward: but in lieu of thy loyaltie, she maketh thee as Bellephoron carrie thine owne bane. Then drinke not willinglie of that potion wherein thou knowest is poyson, creepe not to her that cares not for thee. What Montanus , there are manie as faire as Phoebe , but most of all more courteous than Phoebe . I tell thee Shepheard, fauour is Loues fuell: then since thou canst not get that, let the flame vanish into smoake, and rather sorrow for a while than repent thee for euer. I tell thee Ganimede (quoth Montanus ) as they which are stung with the Scorpion, cannot be recouered but by the Scorpion, nor hee that was wounded with Achilles lance be cured but with the same trunchion: so Apollo was faine to crie out, that Loue was onely eased with Loue, and fancie healed by no medecin but fauor. Phoebus had hearbs to heale all hurts but this passion, Cyrces had charmes for all chaunces but for affection, and Mercurie subtill reasons to refell all griefes but Loue. Perswasions are bootlesse, Reason lendes no remedie, Counsaile no comfort, to such whome Fancie hath made resolute: and therefore though Phoebe loues Ganimede , yet Montanus must honor none but Phoebe . Then quoth Ganimede , may I rightly tearme thee a despayring Louer, that liuest without ioy, & louest without hope: but what shall I doo Montanus to pleasure thee? Shall I despise Phoebe as she disdaines thee? Oh (quoth Montanus ) that were to renew my griefes, and double my sorrowes: for the sight of her discontent were the censure of my death. Alas Ganimede , though I perish in my thoughtes, let not her die in her desires. Of all passions, Loue is most impatient: then let not so faire a creature as Phoebe sinke vnder the burden of so deepe a distrsse. Being loue sicke, she is prooued heart sicke, and all for the beautie of Ganimede . Thy proportion hath entangled her affection, and she is snared in the beautie of thy excellence. Then sith she loues thee so deere, mislike not her deadly. Bee thou paramour to such a paragon: shee hath beautie to content thine eye, and flockes to enrich thy store. Thou canst not wish for more than thou shalt winne by her: for she is beautifull, vertuous and wealthie, three deepe perswasions to make loue frolicke. Aliena seeing Montanus cut it against the haire, and plead that Ganimede ought to loue Phoebe , when his onely life was the loue of Phoebe : answered him thus. Why Montanus doost thou further this motion? seeing if Ganimede marrie Phoebe thy market is clean mard. Ah Mistres (quoth he) so hath Loue taught mee to honour Phoebe , that I would preiudice my life to pleasure her, and die in despaire rather than she should perish for want. It shal suffice me to see him contented, and to feed mine eye on her fauour. If she marrie though it be my Martyrdome: yet if shee bee pleased I will brooke it with patience, and triumph in mine owne starres to see her desires satisfied. Therefore if Ganimede bee as courteous as hee is beautifull, let him shew his vertues, in redressing Phoebes miseries. And this Montanus pronounst with such an assured countenance, that it amazed both Aliena and Ganimede to see the resolution of his loues: so that they pitied his passions and commended his patience; deuising how they might by anie subtiltie, get Montanus the fauour of Phoebe . Straight (as Womens heads are full of wyles) Ganimede had a fetch to force Phoebe to fancie the Shepheard Malgrado the resolution of her minde hee prosecuted his policie thus. Montanus (quoth he) seeing Phoebe is so forlorne least I might bee counted vnkinde, in not saluing so faire a creature, I will goe with thee to Phoebe , and there heare her selfe in worde vtter that which she hath discourst with her penne, and then as Loue wills me, I will set downe my censure. I will home by our house, and send Coridon to accompanie Aliena. Montanus seemed glad of this determination, and away they goe towards the house of Phoebe . When they drew nigh to the Cottage, Montanus ranne afore, & went in and tolde Phoebe that Ganimede was at the dore. This word Ganimede sounding in the eares of Phoebe , draue her into such an extasie for ioy, that rising vp in her bed she was halfe reuiued, and her wan colour began to waxe red: and with that came Ganimede in, who saluted Phoebe with such a curteous looke, that it was halfe a salue to her sorrowes. Sitting him downe by her bed side, hee questioned about her disease, and where the paine chiefly helde her? Phoebe looking as louely as Venus in her night geere, tainting her face with as ruddie a blush as Clitia did when when shee bewrayed her Loues to Phoebus: taking Ganimede by the hand began thus. Faire shepheard, if loue were not more strong then nature, or fancie the sharpest extreame; my immodesty were the more, and my vertues the lesse: for nature hath framed womens eyes bashfull, their hearts full of feare, and their tongues full of silence: But Loue, that imperious Loue, where his power is predominant, then he peruerts all and wresteth the wealth of nature to his owne will: an Instance in my selfe fayre Ganimede , for such a fire hath hee kindled in my thoughts, that to finde ease for the flame, I was forced to passe the bounds of modestie and seeke a salue at thy handes for my secret harmes: blame mee not if I bee ouer bolde for it is thy beautie, and if I be too forward it is fancie, & the deepe insight into thy vertues that makes me thus fond. For let me say in a word, what maybe contayned in a volume, Phoebe loues Ganimede: at this she held downe her head and wept, and Ganimede rose as one that would suffer no fish to hang on his fingers made this replie. Water not thy plants Phoebe , for I doe pitie thy plaintes, nor seeke not to discouer thy Loues in teares: for I coniecture thy trueth by thy passions: sorrow is no salue for loues, nor sighes no remedie for affection. Therefore frolick Phoebe , for if Ganimede can cure thee, doubt not of recouerie. Yet this let me say without offence, that it greeues me to thwart Montanus in his fancies, seeing his desires haue ben so resolute, and his thoughts so loyall: But thou alleadgest that thou art forst from him by fate; so I tell thee Phoebe either some starre or else some destinie fits my minde rather with Adonis to die in chase, than be counted a wanton in Venus knee. Although I pittie thy martyrdome, yet I can grant no mariage; for though I held thee faire, yet mine eye is not fettered, Loue growes not like the hearb Spattanna to his perfection in one night but creepes with the snaile, and yet at last attaines to the top Festina Lente especially in Loue: for momentarie fancies are oft times the fruites of follies: If Phoebe I should like thee as the Hiperborei do their Dates, which banquet with them in the morning and throw them awaie at night, my folly should be great, and thy repentance more, Therefore I will haue time to turne my thoughts, and my Loues shall growe vp as the water Cresses , slowly but with a deepe roote. Thus Phoebe thou maist see I disdaine not though I desire not, remaining indifferent till time and loue makes me resolute. Therefore Phoebe seeke not to suppresse affection, and with the Loue of Montanus quench the remembrance of Ganimede , striue thou to hate me as I seeke to like of thee, and euer haue the duties of Montanus in thy minde, for I promise thee thou mayst haue one more welthie but not more loyall. These wordes were corasiues to the perplexed Phoebe , that sobbing out sighes and strayning out teares shee blubbered out these wordes. And shall I then haue no salue of Ganimede , but suspence, no hope but a doubtfull hazard, no comfort, but bee posted off to the will of time? iustly haue the Gods ballanst my fortunes, who beeing cruell to Montanus found Ganimede , as vnkinde to my selfe: so in forcing him perish for loue, I shall die my selfe with ouermuch loue. I am glad (quoth Ganimede ) you looke into your owne faults, and see where your shooe wrings you, measuring now the paines of Montanus by your owne passions. Truth quoth Phoebe , and so deeply I repent me of my frowardnesse toward the Shepheard, that could I cease to loue Ganimede , I would resolue to like Montanus . What if I can with reason perswade Phoebe to mislike of Ganimede , will she then fauour Montanus? When reason (quoth she) doth quench that loue that I owe to thee, then will I fancie him: conditionallie, that if my loue can bee supprest with no reason, as beeing without reason, Ganimede wil onely wed himselfe to Phoebe . I graunt it faire Shepheardesse quoth he: and to feede thee with the sweetnesse of hope, this resolue on: I will neuer marrie my selfe to woman but vnto thy selfe: and with that Ganimede gaue Phoebe a fruitelesse kisse & such words of comfort, that before Ganimede departed she arose out of her bed, and made him and Montanus such cheere, as could be found in such a Countrey cottage. Ganimede in the midst of their banquet rehearsing the promises of either in Montanus fauour, which highly pleased the Shephearde. Thus all three content, and soothed vp in hope, Ganimede tooke his leaue of his Phoebe & departed, leauing her a contented woman, and Montanus highly pleased. But poore Ganimede , who had her thoughtes on her Rosader , when she calde to remembrance his wounds, filde her eyes full of teares, and her heart full of sorrowes, plodded to finde Aliena at the Foldes, thinking with her presence to driue away her passions. As she came on the Plaines, she might espie where Rosader and Saladyne sate with Aliena vnder the shade: which sight was a salue to her griefe, and such a cordiall vnto her heart, that she tript alongst the Lawnes full of ioy. At last Coridon who was with them spied Ganimede , and with that the Clowne rose, and running to meete him cried, Oh sirha, a match, a match, our Mistres shall be maried on Sunday. Thus the poore peasant frolickt it before Ganimede , who comming to the crue saluted them all, and especially Rosader , saying that hee was glad to see him so well recouered of his wounds. I had not gone abroade so soone quoth Rosader , but that I am bidden to a marriage, which on Sunday next must bee solempnized betweene my brother and Aliena . I see well where Loue leades delay is loathsome, and that small wooing serues, where both the parties are willing. Truth quoth Ganimede: but a happie day should it be, if Rosader that day might be married to Rosalynde . Ah good Ganimede (quoth he) by naming Rosalynde renue not my sorrowes: for the thought of her perfections, is the thrall of my miseries. Tush, bee of good cheere man quoth Ganimede , I haue a friend that is deeply experienst in Negromancie and Magicke, what arte can doo shall bee acted for thine aduantage: I will cause him to bring in Rosalynde , if either France or anie bordering Nation harbour her; and vppon that take the faith of a young Shepheard. Aliena smilde to see how Rosader frownde, thinking that Ganimede had iested with him. But breaking off from those matters, the Page (somewhat pleasant) began to discourse vnto them what had past betweene him and Phoebe: which as they laught, so they wondred at; all confessing, that there is none so chast but Loue will change. Thus they past away the day in chat, and when the Sunne began to set, they tooke their leaues and departed: Aliena prouiding for their marriage day such solempne cheere and handsome roabes as fitted their countrey estate, & yet somewhat the better, in that Rosader had promised to bring Gerismond thether as a guest. Ganimede (who then meant to discouer her selfe before her father, had made her a gowne of greene, and a kirtle of the finest sendall, in such sort that she seemed some heauenly Nymph harboured in Countrey attire. Saladyne was not behind in care to set out the nuptials, nor Rosader vnmindfull to bid guests, who inuited Gerismond and all his Followers to the Feast: who willinglye graunted; so that there was nothing but the daye wanting to this marriage. In the meane while, Phoebe being a bidden guest, made her selfe as gorgeous as might be to please the eye of Ganimede ; and Montanus suted himselfe with the cost of many of his flocks to be gallant against that day; for then was Ganimede to giue Phoebe an answere of her loues, and Montanus either to heare the doome of his miserie, or the censure of his happinesse. But while this geare was a bruing, Phoebe past not one day without visiting hir Ganimede , so farre was shee wrapt in the beauties of this louely Swaine. Much prattle they had, and the discourse of manie passions, Phoebe wishing for the daye (as shee thought) of her welfare, and Ganimede smiling to thinke what vnexpected euents would fall out at the wedding. In these humours the weeke went away, that at last Sundaye came. No sooner did Phoebus Hench man appeare in the Skie, to giue warning that his masters horses shoulde bee trapt in his glorious couch, but Coridon in his holiday sute meruailous seemely, in a russet iacket welted with the same, and faced with red worsted, hauing a paire of blew chamlet sleeues, bound at the wrests with foure yeolow laces, closed afore verie richly with a dossen of pewter buttons: his hose was of gray karsie, with a large slop bard ouerthwart the pocket holes with three fair gards, stitcht of either side with red thred, his stock was of the own sewed close to his breech, and for to beautefie his hose, he had trust himself round with a dosen of new thredden points of medley coulour: his bonnet was greene whereon stood a copper brooch with the picture of Saint Denis: and to want nothing that might make him amorous in his olde dayes, he had a fayre shyrt band of fine lockram, whipt ouer with Couentrey blew, of no small cost. Thus attired, Coridon bestird himselfe as chiefe stickler in these actions, and had strowed all the house with flowers, that it seemed rather some of Floraes choyce bowers, than anie Countrey cottage. Thether repaired Phoebe with all the maides of the forrest to set out the bride in the most seemeliest sort that might be: but howsoeuer she helpt to pranke out Aliena , yet her eye was still on Ganimede , who was so neate in a sute of gray, that he seemed Endymion when hee won Luna with his lookes, or Paris when he plaide the Swaine to get the beautie of the Nymph Oenone, Ganimede like a prettie Page waited on his Mistresse Aliena , and ouerlookt that al was in a readinesse against the Bridegroome shoulde come. Who attired in a Forresters sute came accompanied with Gerismond and his brother Rosader early in the morning; where arriued, they were solempnlie entertained by Aliena and the rest of the Countrey Swaines, Gerismond verie highly commending the fortunate choyce of Saladyne , in that had chosen a Shepheardesse, whose vertues appeared in her outward beauties, being no lesse faire than seeming modest. Ganimede comming in and seeing her Father began to blush, Nature working affects by her secret effects: scarce could she abstaine from teares to see her Father in so lowe fortunes: he that was wont to sit in his royall Pallaice, attended on by twelue noble peeres, now to be contented with a simple Cottage, and a troupe of reuelling Woodmen for his traine. The consideration of his fall, made Ganimede full of sorrowes: yet that shee might triumph ouer Fortune with patience, and not anie way dash that merrie day with her dumpes, shee smothered her melancholy with a shaddow of mirth: and verie reuerently welcommed the King, not according to his former degree, but to his present estate, with such diligence, as Gerismond began to commend the Page for his exquisite person, and excellent qualities. As thus the King with his Forresters frolickt it among the shepheards, Coridon came in with a faire mazerfull of Sidar, and presented it to Gerismond with such a clownish salute, that he began to smile, and tooke it of the old shepheard verie kindly, drinking to Aliena and the rest of her faire maides, amongst whom Phoebe was the formost. Aliena pledged the King, and drunke to Rosader: so the carrowse went round from him to Phoebe , &c. As they were thus drinking and readie to goe to Church, came in Montanus apparailed all in tawney, to signifie that he was forsaken; on his head he wore a garland of willowe, his bottle hanged by his side wheron was painted despaire, and on his sheephooke hung two sonnets as labels of his loues & fortunes. Thus attired came Montanus in, with his face as full of griefe, as his heart was of sorrowes, shewing in his countenance the map of extremities. Assoone as the Shepheards saw him, they did him all the honour they could, as being the flower of all the Swaines in Arden: for a bonnier boy was there not seene since the wanton Wag of Troy that kept sheep in Ida . He seeing the king, and gessing it to be Gerismond , did him all the reuerence his countrey curtesie could affoord. Insomuch that the King wondring at his attire, began to question what he was. Montanus ouerhearing him made this replie. I am sir quoth he Loues Swaine, as full of inward discontents as I seeme fraught with outward follies. Mine eyes like Bees delight in sweete flowers, but sucking their full on the faire of beautie, they carrie home to the Hiue of my heart farre more gall than honnie, and for one droppe of pure deaw, a tunne full of deadly Aconiton . I hunt with the Flie to pursue the Eagle, that flying too nigh the Sunne, I perish with the Sunne: my thoughts are aboue my reach, and my desires more than my fortunes; yet neither greater than my Loues. But daring with Phaeton , I fall with Irarus , and seeking to passe the meane, I dye for being so meane my nights sleepes are waking slumbers, as full of sorrowes as they be farre from rest, and my dayes labours are fruitelesse amours, staring at a starre and stumbling at a strawe, leauing reason to follow after repentance, yet euerie passion is a pleasure though it pinch, because loue hides his wormeseede in figs, his poysons in sweet potions, and shadowes preiudize with the maske of pleasure. The wisest counsaylors are my deepe discontents, & I hate that which should salue my harme, like the patient which stung with the Tarantula loathes musicke, and yet the disease incurable but by melodie. Thus (Sir) restlesse I holde my selfe remediles, as louing without either reward or regard, and yet louing, because there is none worthie to bee loued, but the Mistresse of my thoughts. And that I am as full of passions as I haue discourst in my playnts, Sir if you please see my Sonnets, and by them censure of my sorrowes. These wordes of Montanus brought the King into a great wonder, amazed asmuch at his wit as his attyre: insomuch that he tooke the papers off his hooke, and read them to this effect.  Alas how wander I amidst these woods, Whereas no day bright shine doth finde accesse: But where the melancholie fleeting floods (Darke as the night) my night of woes expresse, Disarmde of reason, spoylde of natures goods, Without redresse to salue my heauinesse I walke, whilest thought (too cruell to my harmes) With endlesse griefe my heedlesse iudgement charmes. My silent tongue assailde by secrete feare, My traitrous eyes imprisoned in their ioy, My fatall peace deuourd in fained cheere, My heart inforst to harbour in annoy, My reason robde of power by yeelding eare, My fond opinions slaue to euerie ioy. Oh Loue thou guide in my vncertaine way, Woe to thy bow, thy fire, the cause of my decay. Et florida pungunt.  When the King had read this Sonnet, hee highly commended the deuice of the Shepheard, that could so wittely wrap his passions in a shadow, and so couertly conceale that which bred his chiefest discontent: affirming, that as the least shrubs haue their tops, the smallest haires their shaddowes; so the meanest Swaines had their fancies, and in their kind were as charie of Loue as a King. Whetted on with this deuice, he tooke the second and read it: the effects were these.  When the Dog Full of rage, With his irefull eies Frownes amidst the Skies. The Shepheard to asswage The furie of the heate, Himselfe doth safely seate By a fount Full of faire, Where a gentle breath (Mounting from beneath) Tempreth the aire. There his flockes Drinke their fill, And with ease repose Whilest sweete sleepe doth close Eies from toylsome ill. But I burne Without rest, No defensiue power Shields from Phoebes lower: Sorrow is my best. Gentle Loue Lowre no more, Jf thou wilt inuade, In the secret shade, Labour not so sore. J my selfe And my flockes They their loue to please, J my selfe to ease, Both leaue the shadie oakes: Content to burne in fire Sith Loue doth so desire. Et florida pungunt.  Gerismond seeing the pythie vaine of those Sonnets, began to make further enquirie what he was? Whereuppon Rosader discourst vnto him the loue of Montanus to Phoebe , his great loyaltie and her deepe crueltie: and how in reuenge the Gods had made the curious Nymph amorous of yong Ganimede . Upon this discourse, the King was desirous to see Phoebe: who being brought before Gerismond by Rosader , shadowed the beautie of her face with such a vermilion teinture, that the Kings eyes bgan to dazle at the puritie of her excellence. After Gerismond had fed his lookes awhile vpon her faire, he questioned with her, why she rewarded Montanus loue with so little regard, seeing his desertes were manie, and his passions extreame. Phoebe to make replie to the Kings demaund, aunswered thus; Loue (sir) is charie in his lawes, and whatsoeuer he sets downe for iustice (bee it neuer so vniust) the sentence cannot be reuerst: womens fancies lend fauours not euer by desert, but as they are inforst by their desires: for fancie is tied to the wings of Fate, and what the Starres Decree stands for an infallible doome. I know Montanus is wise, & womens eares are greatly delighted with wit, as hardlie escaping the charme of a pleasant tongue, as Vlisses the melodie of the Syrens. Montanus is beautifull, and womens eyes are snared in the excellence of obiectes, as desirous to feede their lookes with a faire face, as the Bee to sucke on a sweete flower. Montanus is wealthie, and an ounce of giue mee perswades a woman more than a pound of heare mee. Danae was won with a golden shower, when she could not be gotten with all the intreates of Iupiter: I tell you sir, the string of a womans heart reacheth to the pulse of her hand, and let a man rub that with golde, and tis hard but she will prooue his hearts golde. Montanus is yong, a great clause in fancies court; Montanus is vertuous, the richest argument that Loue yeelds: and yet knowing all these perfections I praise them, and wonder at them, louing the qualities, but not affecting the person, because the Destenies haue set downe a contrarie censure. Yet Venus to adde reuenge, hath giuen me wine of the same grape, a sippe of the same sawce, and firing me with the like passion, hath crost me with as ill a penaunce: for I am in loue with a Shepheards swaine, as coy to me as I am cruell to Montanus , as peremptorie in disdaine as I was peruerse in desire, and that is (quoth she) Alienaes Page, yong Ganimede . Gerismond desirous to prosecute the ende of these passions, called in Ganimede: who knowing the case, came in graced with such a blush, as beautefied the Christall of his face with a ruddie brightnesse. The King noting well the phisnomie of Ganimede , began by his fauours to call to minde the face of his Rosalynde , and with that fetche a deep sigh. Rosader that was passing familiar with Gerismond , demaunded of him why he sightht so sore? Because Rosader (quoth he) the fauour of Ganimede puts me in minde of Rosalynde . At this word, Rosader sight so deepely as though his heart would haue burst. And whats the matter (quoth Gerismond ) that you quite mee with such a sigh? Pardon mee sir (quoth Rosader ) because I loue none but Rosalynde . And vppon that condition (quoth Gerismond ) that Rosalynde were heere, I woulde this day make vp a marriage betwixt her and thee. At this Aliena turnde her head and smilde vpon Ganimede , and she could scarce keep countenaunce. Yet shee salued all with secrecie, and Gerismond to driue away such dumpes, questioned with Ganimede , what the reason was hee regarded not Phoebes loue, seeing she was as faire as the wanton that brought Troy to ruine. Ganimede mildly answered, If I shoulde affect the faire Phoebe , I shuld offer poore Montanus great wrong to win that from him in a moment, that he hath laboured for so manie monts. Yet haue I promised to the beautifull shepheardesse, to wed my selfe neuer to woman except vnto her: but with this promise, that if I can by reason suppres Phoebes loue towards me, she shal like of none but of Montanus . To that quoth Phoebe I stand, for my loue is so far beyond reason, as it will admit no perswasion of reason. For iustice quoth hee, I appeale to Gerismond: and to his censure wil I stand quoth Phoebe . And in your victorie quoth Moranus stands the hazard of my fortunes: for if Ganimede go away with conquest, Montanus is in conceipt Loues Monarch; if Phoebe win, then am I in effect most miserable. We will see this controuersie quoth Gerismond , & then we will to Church: therefore Ganimede let vs heare your argument. Nay, pardon my absence a while (quoth she) and you shall see one in store. In went Ganimede and drest her selfe in womans attire, hauing on a gowne of greene, with kirtle of ritch sandall, so quaint, that she seemed Diana triumphing in the Forrest: vpon her head she wore a chaplet of Roses, which gaue her such a grace, that she looked like Flora pearkt in the pride of all her flowers. Thus attired came Rosalynde in, and presented her selfe at her fathers feete, with her eyes full of teares, crauing his blessing, and discoursing vnto him all her fortunes, how she was banished by Torismond , and how euer since she liued in that Countrey disguised. Gerismond seeing his daughter, rose from his seate and fell vpon her necke, vttring the passions of his ioy in watrie plaints driuen into such an extasie of content, that he could not vtter one word. At this sight, if Rosader was both amazed and ioyfull, I referre my selfe to the iudgement of such as haue experience in loue, seeing his Rosalynde before his face whom so long and deeplie he had affected. At last Gerismond recouered his spirits, and in most fatherlie tearmes entertained his daughter Rosalynde , after many questions demaunding of her what had past betweene her and Rosader . So much sir (quoth she) as there wants nothing but your Grace to make vp the mariage. Why then (quoth Gerismond) Rosader take her, she is thine, and let this day sollemnise both thy brothers and thy nuptialls. Rosader beyond measure content, humblie thanked the King & imbraced his Rosalynd: who turning towards Phoebe , demaunded if she had shewen sufficient reason to suppresse the force of her loues. Yea quoth Phoebe , and so great a perswasiue, that please it you Madame and Aliena to giue vs leaue, Montanus and I will make this day the third couple in mariage. She had no sooner spake this word, but Montanus threw away his garland of willow, his bottle, where was painted dispaire, and cast his sonnets in the fire, shewing himselfe as frolicke as Paris when he hanseled his loue with Helena . At this Gerismond and the rest smiled and concluded that Montanus and Phoebe should keepe their wedding with the two brethren. Aliena seeing Saladyne stand in a dumpe, to wake him from his dreame began thus. Why how now my Saladyne , all a mort , what melancholy man at the day of mariage? perchaunce thou art sorowfull to thinke on thy brothers high fortunes, and thine owne base desires to choose so meane a shepheardize. Cheere vp thy heart man, for this day thou shalt bee married to the daughter of a King: for know Saladyne , I am not Aliena , but Alinda the daughter of thy mortall enemie Torismond . At this all the companie was amazed, especiallie Gerismond , who rising vp tooke Alinda in his armes, and sayd to Rosalynde ; is this that faire Alinda famous for so many vertues, that forsooke her fathers Court to liue with thee exilde in the Countrey? The same quoth Rosalynd . Then quoth Gerismond , turning to Saladyne , iollie Forrester be frolick, for thy fortunes are great, and thy desires excellent, thou hast got a Princesse as famous for her perfection as exceeding in proportion. And she hath with her beautie wonne (quoth Saladyne ) an humble seruant as full of faith as she of amiable fauour. While euery one was amazed with these Comicall euents, Coridon came skipping in and told them that the Priest was at Church and tarried for their comming. With that Gerismond led the way and the rest followed, where to the admiration of all the countrey swaines in Arden their mariages were solemnely solemnised. As soone as the Priest had finished, home they went with Alinda , where Coridon had made al things in readinesse. Dinner was prouided, and the tables beeing spread, and the Brides set downe by Gerismond, Rosader, Saladyne and Montanus that day were seruitors: homely cheere they had such as their countrey could affoord; but to mend their fare they had mickle good chat and many discourses of their loues and fortunes. About mid dinner, to make them merie Coridon came in with an olde crowde, and plaide them a fit of mirth, to which he sang this pleasant song.  A blythe and bonnie countrey Lasse, heigh ho the bonnie Lasse: Sate sighing on the tender grasse, and weeping said, will none come woo me. A smicker boy a lither Swaine heigh ho a smicker Swaine, That in his loue was wanton faine, with smiling lookes straight came vnto her. When as the wanton wench espide, heigh ho when she espide The meanes to make her selfe a bride, she simpred smooth like bonnie bell: The Swaine that saw her squint eied kinde, heigh ho so squint eid kinde, His armes about her bodie twinde and said faire Lasse, how fare ye, well? The countrey kit said well forsooth. heigh ho well forsooth, But that I haue a longing tooth a longing tooth that makes me crie: Alas said he what garres thy griefe? heigh ho what garres thy griefe? A wound quoth she without reliefe, J feare a maide that J shall die. Jf that be all the Shepheard said heigh ho the shepheard said, Ile make thee wine it gentle maide, And so recure thy maladie. Hereon they kist with manie a oath, Heigh ho with manie a oath, And fore God Pan did plight their troath, and to the Church they hied them fast. And God send euerie pretie peate heigh ho the pretie peate That feares to die of this conceate, so kinde a friend to helpe at last. Coridon hauing thus made them merrie: as they were in the midst of all their iollitie, word was brought in to Saladyne and Rosader , that a brother of theirs, one Fernandyne was arriued, and desired to speake with them. Gerismond ouer hearing this newes, demaunded who it was? It is sir (quoth Rosader ) our middle brother, that lyues a Scholler in Paris: but what fortune hath driuen him to seek vs out I know not. With that Saladyne went and met his brother, whom he welcommed with all curtesie, and Rosader gaue him no lesse friendly entertainment: brought hee was by his two brothers into the parlour where they al sate at dinner. Fernandyne as one that knewe as manie manners as he could points of sophistrie, & was aswell brought vp as well lettered, saluted them all. But when hee espied Gerismond , kneeling on his knee he did him what reuerence belonged to his state: and with that burst foorth into these speaches, Although (right mightie Prince) this day of my brothers mariage be a day of mirth, yet time craues another course; and therefore from daintie cates rise to sharpe weapons. And you the sonnes of Sir Iohn of Bourdeaux , leaue off your amors & fall to armes, change your loues into lances, and now this day shewe your selues as valiant, as hethertoo you haue been passionate. For know Gerismond , that hard by at the edge of this forrest the twelue Peeres of France are vp in Armes to recouer thy right; and Torismond troupt with a crue of desperate runnagates is ready to bid them battaile. The Armies are readie to ioyne: therfore shew thy selfe in the field to encourage thy subiects: and you Saladyne & Rosader mount you, and shewe your selues as hardie souldiers as you haue been heartie louers: so shall you for the benefite of your Countrey, discouer the Idea of your fathers vertues to bee stamped in your thoughts, and proue children worthie of so honourable a parent. At this alarum giuen by Fernandyne. Gerismond leapt from the boord, and Saladyne and Rosader betook themselues to their weapons. Nay quoth Gerismond , goe with me I haue horse and armour for vs all, and then being well mounted, let vs shew that we carrie reuenge and honour at our fawchions points. Thus they leaue the Brides full of sorrow, especially Alinda , who desired Gerismod to be good to her father: he not returning a word because his hast was great, hied him home to his Lodge, where he deliuered Saladyne and Rosader horse and armour, and himselfe armed royally led the way: not hauing ridden two leagues before they discouered where in a Ualley both the battailes were ioyned. Gerismond seeing the wing wherein the Peeres fought, thrust in there, and cried Saint Denis Gerismond laying on such loade vppon his enemies, that hee shewed how highly he did estimate of a Crowne. When the Peeres perceiued that their lawfull King was there they grewe more eager: and Saladyne and Rosader so behaued themselues, that none durst stand in their way, nor abide the furie of their weapons. To be short, the Peeres were conquerours, Torismonds armie put to flight, & himselfe slaine in battaile. The Peeres then gathered themselues together, and saluting their king, conducted him royallie into Paris , where he was receiued with great ioy of all the citizens. Assoone as all was quiet and he had receiued againe the Crowne, hee sent for Alinda and Rosalynde to the Court, Alinda being verie passionate for the death of her father: yet brooking it with the more patience, in that she was contented with the welfare of her Saladyne . Well, assoone as they were come to Paris, Gerismond made a royall Feast for the Peeres and Lords of his Lande, which continued thirtie dayes, in which time summoning a Parliament, by the consent of his Nobles he created Rosader heire apparant to the kingdom he restored Saladyne to all his fathers lande, and gaue him the Dukedome of Nameurs , he made Fernandyne principall Secretarie to himselfe: and that Fortune might euerie way seeme frolicke, he made Montanus Lord ouer all the Forrest of Arden: Adam Spencer Captaine of the Kings Gard, and Coridon Master of Alindas Flocks. Heere Gentlemen may you see in Euphues golden Legacie , that such as neglect their fathers precepts, incurre much preiudice; that diuision in Nature as it is a blemish in nurture, so tis a breach of good fortunes; that vertue is not measured by birth but by action; that yonger brethren though inferiour in yeares, yet may be superiour to honours; that concord is the sweetest conclusion, and amitie betwixt brothers more forceable than fortune. If you gather any frutes by this Legacie, speake well of Euphues for writing it, and me for fetching it. If you grace me with that fauour, you encourage me to be more forward: and assoone as I haue ouerlookt my labours, expect the Sailers Kalender . T. Lodge.
