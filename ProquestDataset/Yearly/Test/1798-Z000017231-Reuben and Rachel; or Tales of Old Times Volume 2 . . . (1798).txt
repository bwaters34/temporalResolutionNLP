To attempt to delineate tho[s]e feelings, might with equal ju[s]tice be called pre[s]umption. The fir[s]t year of our hero and heroine's exi[s]tence mu[s]t therefore be pa[s][s]ed over in [s]ilence. At the end of that period we behold their father combating, by the efforts of rea[s]on and con[s]tant employment, the barbed [s]hafts of affliction. The very attempt to repel them weakened their force; by repeated re[s]i[s]tance they became entirely harmle[s]s, and fell, totally bereaved of point or power, to the ground. Reuben Dudley regained his [s]erenity; his affections, his hopes, his fonde[s]t wi[s]hes were now centred in his children. Regret for the mother was [s]wallowed up in expectation of the children's future virtues and happiness. Aunt Rachel pre[s]ided over the hou[s]ehold, and [s]uperintended the nur[s]ery. Reuben and Rachel were by no means [s]uperior to the generality of children of their age and condition. Rachel was a lively brown girl, and both [s]he and her brother very [s]oon di[s]covered, that by crying vociferously they could obtain almo[s]t any thing. Aunt [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-183.jpg) \- external link  - Page 174. ] Rachel would not [s]uffer the dear creatures to be crossed, and papa thought them, without exception, the [s]weete[s]t, mo[s]t charming children in the univer[s]e. Alas! cries affected wi[s]dom, how fooli[s]h the [s]uppo[s]ition; but rea[s]on, unbia[s][s]ed by prejudice, declares it is only nature, pure, undi[s]gui[s]ed nature. Nature! dear godde[s]s! how beautiful thou art, when, cha[s]te and unadorned, thou appeare[s]t in the ve[s]tments of [s]implicity; when the undeviating features portray but the feelings of the heart; when the tongue, uncontaminated by vice, unver[s]ed in the practice of deception, gives utterance only to what tho[s]e feelings dictate; then, who can re[s]i[s]t thy eloquence? then, who can li[s]ten to thy voice, or behold thy beauties unmoved? The philo[s]opher gazes at thee with rapture; the [s]toic cannot inve[s]tigate thy charms and retain his apathy; forgetting his affected in[s]en[s]ibility, he beholds with wonder, admiration and love, thy in obtru[s]ive excellence, and joins involuntarily in the exclamation of the enthu[s]ia[s]t, Oh Nature! dear goddess! how beautiful throu art. The children were neither [s]trikingly beautiful, or remarkably brilliant. Health, cheerfulne[s]s, and dispositions naturally good, rendered them engaging; but their minds, like the minds of mo[s]t infants, were perfect blanks, on which the hand of education might impre[s]s whatever characters the in[s]tructor plea[s]ed. As they were educated in the [s]tricte[s]t principles of Quakeri[s]m, neither trouble nor expen[s]e was be[s]towed on the ornamental parts, though every thing u[s]eful was attended to with the utmo[s]t care. As they advanced in years, their characters naturally developed them[s]elves. Reuben was open, generous, un[s]u[s]pecting, and po[s][s]e[s][s]ed a firmne[s]s of temper, almo[s]t approaching to ob[s]tinacy. Enthu[s]ia[s]tic in his attachment to his [s]i[s]ter, from earlie[s]t infancy his actions had declared, that to [s]ee her contented and happy, made him [s]o. Rachel was mode[s]t, una[s][s]uming, meek, timid and affectionate. Po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of a good under[s]tanding, a quick and clear perception, and a [s]trong memory, the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-184.jpg) \- external link  - Page 175. ] ta[s]k of in[s]tructing her was mo[s]t delightful. Daily, nay, almo[s]t hourly did her mind unfold [s]ome new, [s]ome unexpected beauty. Her love of literature, and the rapid progre[s]s [s]he made in every [s]tudy in which [s]he engaged, at once charmed and a[s]toni[s]hed her aunt and father. But her extreme diffidence prevented her excellencies from being univer[s]ally known, and it was only by a long and intimate acquaintance her intrinsic worth could be di[s]covered. Yet Rachel was not faultle[s]s. The meekne[s]s of her temper was [s]uch, that re[s]entment was a [s]tranger to her bo[s]om. An injury was no more remembered than as it had given pain to her heart, and that heart, moulded by the hand of pure innocence, was credulous in the extreme. Her exce[s][s]ive anxiety to [s]ee others happy, made her inattentive to the means of promoting or pre[s]erving her own happine[s]s; and if any one profe[s][s]ed to love her, though but a moment before they had held a dagger to her brea[s]t, [s]he would have forgot the intended injury, and never doubting their [s]incerity, admitted them to her confidence and friend[s]hip. Her affection for her brother was equal to his for her. To [s]eparate them, though but for an hour, was to give them the [s]evere[s]t unea[s]ine[s]s. They were parted with tears, and met again with [s]uperlative [s]atisfaction. Such were Reuben and Rachel at ten years of age. Their father doted on them with the tendere[s]t affection, and aunt Rachel thought they were the mo[s]t superior beings in the whole univer[s]e. She would sometimes talk to them about America, de[s]cribe the va[s]t woods, boundle[s]s plains, maje[s]tic rivers, and exten[s]ive lakes of that great continent. Reuben would li[s]ten with rapture, and [s]ay, "When I am a man, aunt, I will go there." "I [s]hould like to go too," Rachel would [s]ay, "but I am [s]ure I [s]hould be afraid to go to [s]ea." It was on a winter's evening, as their father was overlooking [s]ome papers, old deeds, &c. that had lain mouldy in an old trunk for many years, (intending to de[s]troy tho[s]e that were u[s]ele[s]s) that Reuben e[s]pied a fearlet plume, or rather coronet of feathers, which had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-185.jpg) \- external link  - Page 176. ] been thrown with [s]ome other rubbi[s]h in a heap, in order to be burned. He [s]eized it, examined it with attention, and at length, conceiving the purpo[s]e for which it had been made, tied it round his head, and marching up to his father, cried, "Look at me, Sir." "Upon my word, Sir," replied his father, [s]miling, "why you look like a [s]achem indeed now." "Why, father, did the [s]achems of the Indians wear [s]uch things on their heads?" a[s]ked Reuben. "Yes," replied his father, "that was your grandfather's coronet." "My grandfather, Sir!" "Yes, child; he became a [s]achem by marrying the daughter of an Indian chief; but I thought your aunt had told you that long ago." "No indeed, Sir; will you tell us all about it, how it came to happen, now?" "No; it is a long [s]tory, and I am bu[s]y." Curio[s]ity is perhaps the [s]tronge[s]t impul[s]e of the human mind. In extreme youth its power is irre[s]i[s]tible. The children felt theirs awakened, and [s]oftly opening the door of their father's [s]tudy, they [s]lipped out, and ran into the parlour to aunt Rachel. Aunt Rachel was, it is true, an old maid. Full fifty winters, as they pa[s]s'd, had [s]hed Their [s]ilver honours on her rev'rend head; But [s]till her heart its pri[s]tine warmth retain'd; The days were pa[s]t, but mem'ry [s]till remain'd. Still the lov'd form of the lamented youth, His faith, his love, his con[s]tancy, his truth, Were trea[s]ur'd there. The coronet that bound the brows of Reuben, recalled a thou[s]and tender recollections. Her dear brother William [s]eemed to [s]tand in miniature before her. The form of Yankoo aro[s]e to her remembrance. Oberea too [s]eemed pre[s]ent; and when the boy a[s]ked her if [s]he knew who[s]e crown that was, her feelings were [s]o powerful as for a moment to [s]u[s]pend her an[s]wer. "It was my brother's," [s]aid [s]he in a mournful tone, taking it from the child's head and laying it on her own knee; "I have [s]een him wear it often." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-186.jpg) \- external link  - Page 177. ] "He was a great man in America, aunt," [s]aid Reuben. "He was more than great, my love, he was good." "Pray, aunt," [s]aid Rachel, "do you remember my grandmother?" "Perfectly." "Was [s]he an Indian?" "Yes." "What, quite a wild [s]avage?" "No, my dear, [s]he was what is in general erroneously termed [s]o; but her heart was as gentle, as compassionate, as full of virtue and piety, as that of the mo[s]t enlightened Chri[s]tian." "Was [s]he black, aunt?" "No; dark brown, or rather copper. But the complexion of her face was like that of her mind. Its charms and imperfections were di[s]coverable at one glance, and it was ever beautiful, becau[s]e invariable." "But was my grandfather a [s]achem?" "He was." "What is a [s]achem?" "It is a title given to a chief among[s]t the Indians, and is the [s]ame as governor with us." "How came he to be a chief of the [s]avages, aunt?" "I will tell you," replied aunt Rachel. It was a [s]ubject on which [s]he delighted to expatiate. She [s]tirred up the fire, folded up her work, and placing the attentive children on each [s]ide of her, began.--- But my readers already know the whole [s]tory, and repetitions are ever tedious and unintere[s]ting. Aunt Rachel was minute in her recital. At the account of her capture, Rachel wept; but Reuben [s]tarted from his [s]eat, his countenance glowing with re[s]entment, and cried, "I wi[s]h I had been there." "And what could you have done, my love?" [s]aid his aunt. "Have re[s]cued you, or died," replied our hero. "Charming, undaunted [s]pirit," exclaimed his aunt, and then continued her narrative. When [s]he recounted the death of Otooganoo, and the [s]olemn manner in which he recommended their [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-187.jpg) \- external link  - Page 178. ] father (then an infant) to the care of the chiefs, "Good old man," [s]aid Rachel, in the mo[s]t expre[s][s]ive accent of affection, "what a pity he [s]hould die." "Then my father is a [s]achem," [s]aid Reuben; and the [s]eeds of ambition which nature had implanted, but which till that moment had lain dormant in his bo[s]om, [s]tarted into life. At the account of their grandfather's death, the children both [s]obbed audibly. "I will! I am determined I will! go to America," [s]aid Reuben, fir[s]t [s]uppre[s][s]ing his emotions. "What, without me, brother?" a[s]ked Rachel, in a mournful voice. "No, no," he replied, "not without you, but when I am a man we will go together; we will find out our grandfather's government, and di[s]cover our[s]elves to his people; I dare [s]ay they would be glad to [s]ee us, [s]ince they loved him [s]o well." "But what [s]hould we go there for, brother? I am [s]ure we are very happy here, and papa would not be willing to part with us, and aunt Rachel too would mi[s]s us." "Well, then, I will go, and leave you with them, and when I have [s]ettled my[s]elf in my government, I will [s]end for you all. Oh! what a fine hou[s]e I will have, and then what a number of [s]ervants, and hor[s]es, and coaches." Aunt Rachel [s]miled, to hear how eagerly the fancy of youth catches at the hope of future greatne[s]s, and how readily they connect the ideas of grandeur, affluence, and numerous attendants, to the po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of a title. She gazed for a moment with plea[s]ure on his intelligent countenance, which the emotions of his little [s]welling heart had lighted up with uncommon animation; and pau[s]ed, unwilling to throw a damp on tho[s]e delightful [s]en[s]ations he appeared to enjoy. At length, "What would you [s]ay," cried [s]he, "if I were to tell you that your grandfather had no attendants except a few warriors, who, from voluntary attachment to his per[s]on, followed to protect him from danger; that he had neither hor[s]e nor carriage; that his palace was chiefly compo[s]ed of the bark of trees; that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-188.jpg) \- external link  - Page 179. ] his bed was the [s]kins of wild bea[s]ts, and his [s]eat of [s]tate the trunk of an old tree, hewn into [s]omething resembling a chair, covered with beaver and other [s]kins, and its ornaments the teeth of tygers, poli[s]hed [s]hells and fi[s]h bones?" "But he was good," [s]aid Rachel, "and consequently happy." "And he was brave and wi[s]e," [s]aid Reuben exultingly, "and every body loved him." "Sweet children," [s]aid aunt Rachel, "tho[s]e are con[s]equences which ought ever to follow goodne[s]s, bravery and wi[s]dom. But, alas! they are not always certain. "What, then, are not all good per[s]ons happy?" "Not always in their outward circum[s]tances; but they enjoy internal peace." "And are not the brave and the wi[s]e always esteemed?" "By tho[s]e who have [s]en[s]e and di[s]cernment they in general are; but unfortunately, great and [s]hining qualifications, of either mind or per[s]on, excite in general more envy than love." "What is envy, aunt?" "A pa[s][s]ion, my dear Rachel, to which I hope you will ever remain a [s]tranger." With this wi[s]h the good old lady ki[s][s]ed the children, and di[s]mi[s][s]ed them to bed. Education may poli[s]h the Manners, but Human Nature will be [s]till the [s]ame. Though the father of our hero and heroine was a man moderate in his wi[s]hes, and of that rea[s]onable ca[s]t of mind that preferred mediocrity to affluence; yet he conceived it an indi[s]pen[s]able duty to endeavour to improve his fortune for the [s]ake of his children. He had retained [s]ome faint idea of the beauty and fertility of the American continent; he al[s]o [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-189.jpg) \- external link  - Page 180. ] felt an irre[s]i[s]tible impul[s]e to vi[s]it once more the place of his nativity; and a number of families, of his own per[s]ua[s]ion, about this period emigrating to the colony of Penn[s]ylvania, among[s]t whom were [s]ome of his wife's neare[s]t relations, he collected together all the ready money he was ma[s]ter of, and turning it into [s]uch merchandize as was mo[s]t likely to be productive of emolument, embarked with a de[s]ign of purcha[s]ing land, building a hou[s]e, and putting the whole in [s]uch a [s]tate of cultivation, as might render it at once a plea[s]ant and profitable habitation for his children, when arrived to the age of maturity. How naturally do we expect our children, or tho[s]e in who[s]e welfare we are intere[s]ted, to adopt the sentiments mo[s]t congenial to our own feelings, without con[s]idering that nature is as various in the formation of the minds of men, as of their faces; and tho[s]e pursuits and acquirements, which to one will give the mo[s]t [s]uperlative delight, to another would bring only mi[s]ery. Thus the father of Rachel and Reuben, being him[s]elf a man of peace, fond of retirement and the [s]tudy of agriculture, thought he could not render them a more acceptable [s]ervice, than to prepare them a habitation, where they might enjoy uninterrupted quiet; where plenty would pre[s]ide at the board, and the [s]tudy of nature, in all her varieties and beauties, enliven [s]olitude. He placed his [s]on at a public [s]chool to fini[s]h his education, and making proper arrangements for the [s]upport of his family during his ab[s]ence (which he imagined would be about two years) he entru[s]ted Rachel to the care of her aunt, with in[s]tructions, that in ca[s]e of death [s]he [s]hould remove to the hou[s]e, and submit to the direction of her maternal uncle, Hezekiah Penn. Reuben and Rachel were in their thirteenth year when this [s]eparation took place. Their tears fell at the idea of being parted from their father; but when the brother and [s]i[s]ter were informed that, during a period of two years, they mu[s]t not expect to meet [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-190.jpg) \- external link  - Page 181. ] only at each returning Chri[s]tmas, their grief was beyond expre[s][s]ion. When the carriage came to the door that was to convey Reuben from her, Rachel bur[s]t into an agony of tears. "My brother! my dear, dear brother!" [s]he cried, hanging round his neck. "God ble[s]s you, my charming [s]i[s]ter! my dear, amiable [s]i[s]ter!" cried he. Aunt Rachel drew her niece from the door, from the parting embrace of her brother (who was led to the carriage by his father) and by degrees compo[s]ed and con[s]oled her. It cannot be [s]uppo[s]ed that their father was an unmoved [s]pectator of this affecting [s]cene. No! he felt and compa[s][s]ionated their [s]ufferings; but he knew that a maiden aunt and [s]eque[s]tered man[s]ion, would in no wi[s]e prepare his [s]on for the active [s]cenes of life in which (however contrary to his own wi[s]hes) he would mo[s]t likely hereafter engage. His family concerns being now [s]ettled to his satisfaction, he embarked for Penn[s]ylvania. His commercial plans were executed with great [s]ucce[s]s, his intended purcha[s]e made on very advantageous terms, and at the clo[s]e of the third year from his fir[s]t arrival, he prepared again to vi[s]it England. Mr. Dudley had taken from Europe with him a di[s]tant relation of his wife's, a young man, of whom, as he will make a considerable figure in the en[s]uing pages, it may not be thought an unnece[s][s]ary digre[s][s]ion to give [s]ome account. The mother of Jacob Holmes was niece to the father of Ca[s][s]iah Penn. She had been left an orphan in early infancy; but the lo[s]s of parents was amply supplied by her benevolent uncle and aunt. She was nearly of the [s]ame age with their own daughter, and, brought up with her, received the [s]ame benefit of education. When Ca[s][s]iah married the father of our hero and heroine, Mary Holmes continued with her aunt, and by tendera[s][s]iduity endeavoured to prevent her feeling too acutely the privation of her daughter's [s]ociety. Mary was naturally [s]incere and artle[s]s; but Mary was hand[s]ome, and loved to be told of her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-191.jpg) \- external link  - Page 182. ] beauty. She po[s][s]e[s][s]ed what is in general termed one of the be[s]t di[s]po[s]itions in the world, becau[s]e [s]he [s]eldom took the trouble to contradict any one. Her ea[s]ine[s]s might, without much exaggeration, have been termed indolence; and her extreme good-nature, folly and want of feeling. To prai[s]e her beauty, was to win her heart; and being often extolled for her [s]weetne[s]s and evenne[s]s of temper, [s]he conceived, that to be perfectly pa[s][s]ive was to be perfectly amiable; and Mary, with a face extremely lovely, and a form captivating, po[s][s]e[s][s]ed neither expre[s][s]ion of countenance, nor sensibility of heart; but like [s]ome kinds of tropical fruits, which, when ripe, are [s]o [s]weet as to be in[s]ipid, and, though beautiful to the eye, have neither poignancy or flavour to delight the ta[s]te. She had loved her cou[s]in Ca[s][s]iah with as much tenderne[s]s as her nature was capable of; [s]he thought her the mo[s]t perfect of human beings; and whil[s]t Ca[s][s]iah was her con[s]tant companion, Mary was free from error. In the neighbourhood of the dwelling of Obadiah Penn, was the ancient [s]eat of the family of the Fitzgeralds. Arthur Fitzgerald was an only child; his father had been dead many years; his mother's indulgence had been unbounded; and at the age of twenty-five, Arthur had [s]carcely ever known what it was ro be contradicted. Heir at once to the e[s]tates of his father and the hereditary honours of his mother; a de[s]cendant of the hou[s]e of Aumerle, of which he was the la[s]t male branch, Arthur thought the chief end of his exi[s]tence was plea[s]ure; and though po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of a good under[s]tanding, and a not naturally corrupt heart, he often performed actions which did honour to humanity; yet unlimited indulgence and unclouded pro[s]perity, by degrees rendered tho[s]e divine impul[s]es of nature, compa[s][s]ion and benevolence, weaker and weaker, till at length his heart cea[s]ed to be influenced by either. His mother, lady Allida, chiefly re[s]ided at the Pinery, the name the [s]eat had taken from its being surrounded by a deep wood of pine trees. Mrs. Pinup was lady Allida's chief attendant, and [s]uperintendant [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-192.jpg) \- external link  - Page 183. ] of her hou[s]ehold in general. Though it might be [s]uppo[s]ed, that the va[s]t di[s]tance pride places between the family of a woman of quality in actual po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of eight thou[s]and pounds a year, and expectant of twice the [s]um, and that of a [s]imple country gentleman, who[s]e whole annual income did not exceed eight hundred, did not allow of any intercour[s]e between lady Allida Fitzgerald, and the wife of Obadiah Penn; but the [s]ervants of tho[s]e families [s]ometimes met, and Mrs. Pinup, in the extreme conde[s]cen[s]ion of her heart, and likewi[s]e having her mind fixed on [s]ome excellent ra[s]pberry brandy (which the old lady kept as a wholesome [s]tomachic) [s]ometimes paid a vi[s]it to dame Prue, upper [s]ervant in Mr. Penn's family. In [s]ome of the[s]e vi[s]its, Mrs. Pinup had often [s]een both Ca[s][s]iah and Mary; but there was always a modest dignity in the manner of the former, that repelled any approach to familiarity from per[s]ons who[s]e education, manners and [s]tation rendered them unfit companions; yet it was a dignity no ways tinctured with haughtine[s]s. She was ever gentle and affable, [s]o much [s]o as to be a univer[s]al favourite, from the highe[s]t to the lowe[s]t. But Mary would laugh with the maids; and though re[s]pect for her as their ma[s]ter's niece, kept the menservants in [s]ome awe, [s]he endured from them familiar prai[s]es of her beauty, not only without re[s]entment, but even with [s]uch an apparent degree of [s]atisfaction as encouraged, rather than repelled their freedom. Sometimes, when Mrs. Pinup was there, [s]he would go down [s]tairs purpo[s]ely to chat with her, a[s]k a thou[s]and que[s]tions about lady Allida, the hou[s]e, the pleasuregrounds, and other more in[s]ignificant [s]ubjects, [s]uch as her dre[s]s, the fa[s]hion of it; for Mary Holmes was no Quaker in her heart, and would often pull off her clo[s]e mob, and let her hair, which was very fine, fall loo[s]ely over her [s]houlders. But if the more [s]edate Ca[s][s]iah ever beheld any of the[s]e [s]igns of vanity, [s]he would mildly reprove them, and as Mary feared to offend her, the would ever re[s]train them in her pre[s]ence. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-193.jpg) \- external link  - Page 184. ] Mrs. Pinup, ever communicative, and wonderfully eloquent in the prai[s]e of lady Allida, would expatiate for hours on her grandeur, her rich clothes, her hou[s]e, her plate, and jewels; nay, [s]he often a[s]ked dame Prue to come and bring the young ladies to [s]ee all the[s]e fine things. Ca[s][s]iah uniformly refu[s]ed the[s]e invitations, but Mary, though [s]ubmi[s][s]ive to the [s]uperior wi[s]dom of her cou[s]in, [s]ecretly wi[s]hed to accept them. On the marriage of Ca[s][s]iah, her mother accompanied her home, and remained with her as a vi[s]itor nearly a month. During this time, the heedle[s]s Mary, unable to combat her inclinations, though [s]he knew they were wrong, yielded to the [s]olicitations of dame Prue, and accompanied her to the Pinery. Lady Allida was ab[s]ent for the day. Mrs. Pinup led her gue[s]ts through the antique and [s]uperbly furni[s]hed apartments. The rich velvet canopies, the [s]tately beds, the ma[s][s]y [s]ilver cups, large marble tables with burni[s]hed [s]upporters, China va[s]es, large looking-glasses, and beautiful tape[s]try, were gazed on by Mary with wonder and delight. Plenty, unre[s]trained by parsimony, pre[s]ided over every department of the household economy of Obadiah Penn. His furniture was excellent in its kind, but it was plain. The wardrobe was next di[s]played. The rich ti[s][s]ue, brocaded or velvet [s]uits were in turns the object of her admiration and de[s]ire. The fine lace pinners, the diamond earings, necklace, and other ornaments---Oh! how fine! how beautiful! how elegant! was repeated a hundred times. "Well," [s]aid Mary, "I wonder how I [s]hould look, dre[s][s]ed in [s]ome of this finery?" "Look! why like an angel, I'm [s]ure," [s]aid Mrs. Pinup. "Oh! there is nothing like dre[s]s, to [s]et off a pretty face; and if you look [s]o hand[s]ome in that brown padu[s]uoy gown and plain mu[s]lin cap, how do you think you would look in a full dre[s]s [s]uit?" Mary was holding a rich blue [s]ilk robe in her hand at the moment; [s]he held it up again[s]t her [s]ide. The delicacy of the colour was exactly [s]uited to her complexion; the effect it had gave an additional flu[s]h to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-194.jpg) \- external link  - Page 185. ] her cheek. It was a loo[s]e robe, made with open [s]leeves, and fa[s]tened at the bo[s]om with a diamond cla[s]p. The ground was blue, but it was [s]uperbly embroidered with [s]ilver, and round the neck and [s]leeves was a net of [s]ilver thread. "Put it on," [s]aid Mrs. Pinup. The fa[s]hion of the dre[s]s was [s]uch as partly to expose the neck. The neck of Mary was covered with a fine cambrick handkerchief. Mrs. Pinup took it off; and then, [s]lipping the robe over her other clothes, fa[s]tened it at the bo[s]om, relea[s]ed her luxurious flaxen hair from the confinement of the cap, and turning her to the gla[s]s, [s]aid, "What do you think of your[s]elf now?" Dame Prue [s]at by, a [s]ilent [s]pectatre[s]s of this [s]cene. She was too good-natured to condemn, and too wi[s]e wholly to approve. Mary gazed and [s]miled, walked along the room to admire her[s]elf at full length in the gla[s]s, and [s]aid, in a tone expre[s][s]ive of mortification, "Well, I [s]hall never like my[s]elf in my Quaker dre[s]s again." "With this expre[s][s]ion, [s]he turned with a de[s]ign of throwing off her borrowed plumes, when [s]he beheld a young man, who[s]e dre[s]s be[s]poke him of con[s]equence, entering the apartment. He [s]topped for a moment; he looked unutterable admiration; then exclaimed, in an accent of wonder, "Angel! godde[s]s! bright divinity!" Covered with confu[s]ion, Mary would have e[s]caped through the oppo[s]ite door; but he [s]aw her de[s]ign, and [s]eizing her hand, be[s]ought her not to be alarmed. "Compo[s]e your[s]elf, lovely creature," [s]aid he, "I meant not to frighten you." "I did not know you were in the hou[s]e, Sir," [s]aid Pinup, in evident confu[s]ion. "I have not been in ten minutes," [s]aid he. "I intended to dre[s]s and join my mother at lord Aumerle's, but while Le Beau was [s]ettling my peruke, he informed me, if I would come up into my mother's dressingroom, I [s]hould [s]ee, one of the prettie[s]t Quakers in the world. But I [s]ee a cele[s]tial being. A Quaker! what! [s]hall tho[s]e lovely tre[s][s]es be concealed, that enchanting [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-195.jpg) \- external link  - Page 186. ] form be di[s]figured by their puritanical, formal dre[s]s? Forbid it, all ye loves and graces." Mary had neither [s]en[s]ibility nor di[s]cernment sufficient to comprehend the in[s]ult to which [s]he had exposed her[s]elf, in thus a[s][s]ociating with the [s]ervants of a family, who, if her [s]uperior in point of fortune, was not of a more elevated de[s]cent. But the feelings of Mary were never very trouble[s]ome to her, and the Lethean draught of flattery her ears had drank, intoxicated her [s]en[s]es and perverted her under[s]tanding. Instead of re[s]enting the freedom of Fitzgerald's addre[s]s, [s]he was [s]ilent, and her heart [s]ecretly exulted at having excited his admiration. In[s]tead of in[s]i[s]ting on going immediately home, [s]he threw a[s]ide her [s]umptuous and imprudently a[s][s]umed ornaments, and in her own [s]imple attire de[s]cended to the hou[s]ekeeper's apartment, where refre[s]hments were [s]erved, of which Arthur partook. The evening approached. Dame Prue aro[s]e to depart. "I will [s]ee you [s]afe through the Pinery," [s]aid Arthur. The moon was ri[s]ing in full, unclouded majesty. The evening was calm, mild and inviting. "My lady will not return till late," [s]aid Pinup; "I think I will go a little way with them my[s]elf, and not trouble you, Sir." "I thought you knew, Pinup," [s]aid Arthur, "that I never do any thing that I conceive a trouble. You [s]hall accompany the old gentlewoman, and I will offer my arm to the young divinity." "How [s]ilver-[s]weet found lovers' tongues by night,' [s]ays our immortal Shake[s]peare; and who [s]o well understood human nature, its weakne[s]s, its virtues, its pa[s][s]ions; who [s]o well delineate?" The extent of the Pinery was a mile and a half; yet the meadow, the [s]tream that watered it, and the hill on the [s]ide of which [s]tood the man[s]ion of Obadiah, appeared to view before they thought they had walked half way. For Arthur Fitzgerald talked of love, and Mary Holmes, though incapable of [s]eeling a real pa[s][s]ion, li[s]tened in delighted [s]ilence to the voice of adulation. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-196.jpg) \- external link  - Page 187. ] Dame Prue was confident Mrs. Dudley would not greatly approve her own vi[s]it to the Pinery, much more, that [s]he [s]hould have taken her niece with her. She therefore de[s]ired Mary to be [s]ilent on the [s]ubject. Mary was not inclined to [s]peak upon it to any one. Had Arthur taken no methods to [s]ee this weak girl again, in all probability, the tran[s]ient liking [s]he had conceived for him would have died away; but Arthur, unaccustomed to put any re[s]traint on his pa[s][s]ions, and being greatly charmed with the beauty of the fair Quaker, without once con[s]idering the con[s]equence of [s]educing [s]o young, [s]o lovely a creature from the paths of rectitude, wrote to her in a [s]tyle of [s]ubmi[s][s]ive adoration, and implored her, if [s]he wi[s]hed to [s]ave him from de[s]pair, to meet him at the margin of the brook in the meadow. Mary complied; repeated interviews en[s]ued, and [s]he fell a victim, not to [s]en[s]ibility or pa[s][s]ion---No; Mary Holmes was the victim of vanity and too great pliability of temper. Con[s]cious of her deviation from virtue, the pre[s]ence of her virtuous aunt became painful to her; yet did [s]he not experience the laudable kind of unea[s]ine[s]s which leads to repentance and amendment. Indifference is the lethargy of the [s]oul; it is the grave of virtue and excellence. Indifference acts upon the mental faculties, as indolence does on the body; for as the man who indulges in inactivity can never expect to ri[s]e into notice, [s]ecure or amend his fortune, [s]o the [s]oul incru[s]ted in indifference is incapable of inciting one great or glorious action. It conceives not the beauty of virtue, nor the real deformity of vice. Its affections are cold; its plea[s]ures [s]o languid, they [s]carce de[s]erve the name. Its pains are few indeed. But then what [s]atisfaction does the po[s][s]e[s][s]or lo[s]e! The beauties of creation are unfolded to him in vain; in vain the gorgeous canopy of heaven di[s]plays ten thou[s]and thou[s]and moving worlds, that, as they roll in the expanse of ether, contribute to embelli[s]h, cheer and warm the globe which we inhabit; in vain the teeming earth brings forth her fruit; nor field of ripened grain, nor opening flower, nor flock, nor herd, afford one joy for [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-197.jpg) \- external link  - Page 188. ] him. He gazes at them all with [s]tupid vacuity of thought, and wonders at the grateful tear that [s]prings to the eye from the heart of [s]en[s]ibility. The hi[s]tory of poor Mary is [s]oon fini[s]hed. She left the protection of her uncle, and accompanied Fitzgerald to London. Di[s][s]pation of every kind was ru[s]hed into with avidity. Her pur[s]e was liberally supplied by her [s]educer; her hou[s]e was elegant; her equipage gay; her dre[s]s always [s]plendid, and not seldom capriciou[s]ly extravagant. But though beauty may fa[s]cinate the [s]en[s]es, prudence, virtue, and a good under[s]tanding, are nece[s][s]ary to make the charm powerful and la[s]ting. Fitzgerald grew weary of her folly and profu[s]ion; he for[s]ook her; yet not ungenerou[s]ly. He [s]ettled [s]ufficient on her to procure all the comforts and [s]ome of the elegancies of life. But, alas! Mary was [s]till young, [s]till lovely, and [s]till indifferent. The opinion of the world was of little con[s]equence to her; nor [s]carcely one individual in it was more regarded than another. Adulation [s]he [s]ought, and it was poured in upon her from every quarter. She regretted not the de[s]ertion of Fitzgerald; another and another [s]poiler came; and Mary Holmes [s]unk into the lowe[s]t aby[s]s of guilt and [s]hame. " We all know what we are, but we know not what we may be  ." That mi[s]ery is ever the certain concomitant of guilt, is univer[s]ally allowed an incontrovertible fact. Mary Holmes, with as little reflection or feeling as it is po[s][s]ible for a rational being to po[s][s]e[s]s, was a proof of the truth of this a[s][s]ertion. Di[s][s]ipation, whil[s]t it had the charms of novelty, intoxicated her [s]en[s]es, and kept her mind in [s]uch continued employment, that her generous uncle Obadiah, her affectionate cou[s]in Ca[s][s]iah, home, the brook, the meadow, and the Pinery, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-198.jpg) \- external link  - Page 189. ] were all forgotten in the con[s]tant vortex of folly. But the [s]ame [s]cene, however fa[s]cinating at fir[s]t, by continual repetition lo[s]es its charms, and becomes in[s]ipid and disgusting. So Mary, often in the mid[s]t of noi[s]y mirth and tumultuous plea[s]ure, would ca[s]t a wi[s]hful, though transient thought, towards her uncle's quiet parlour, and the tranquil happine[s]s that was ever her companion there. Seven years had pa[s][s]ed, and Mary was no longer followed, courted and admired. She had lo[s]t her mo[s]t powerful charm. Her cheek was no longer [s]uffu[s]ed with the crim[s]on of timidity, nor her manners attractive from that feminine ba[s]hfulne[s]s, which renders even a plain woman agreeable; and a beautiful woman on who[s]e brow [s]its mode[s]t ba[s]hfulne[s]s, enthroned in native purity, ever is, ever will be, irre[s]i[s]tible. But, alas! when virtue has for[s]aken the heart, the vermillion of cha[s]tity cea[s]es to vi[s]it the cheek, and beauty without it, however exqui[s]ite, can catch even the eye but for a moment. Charmed with the mo[s]t fini[s]hed workmanship of nature, we look for the [s]oul that [s]hould inform it. But we find it blotted! di[s]graced! lo[s]t! Admiration cea[s]es; pity [s]ucceeds; and whil[s]t we wi[s]h to reform, we cannot but de[s]pi[s]e. Mary had arrived at this la[s]t [s]tage. For[s]aken by the men, her vanity was no longer gratified; and to enliven her home, where could [s]he find, among[s]t the unhappy females with whom [s]he had been accu[s]tomed to a[s][s]ociate, one who[s]e conver[s]ation could either amu[s]e or in[s]tru[s]t her. Unaccu[s]tomed, even in her happie[s]t days, to [s]eek amu[s]ement within her[s]elf, it cannot be supposed, when "[s]in and [s]hame had laid all wa[s]te," [s]he could find plea[s]ure in reflection. The life of Mary was a continued blank; unloving, unloved. Joyle[s]s pa[s][s]ed her days; nor wi[s]h, nor hope, nor fear diver[s]ified it; all was inanimation. At this period [s]he found her[s]elf in the mo[s]t interesting [s]ituation a female can experience. She was about to become a mother. If Mary ever was [s]en[s]ible of any thing like remor[s]e, it was on this occa[s]ion. She wished [s]he had not [s]werve from the path of rectitude; [s]he wi[s]hed her child had not been the offspring of [s]hame. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-199.jpg) \- external link  - Page 190. ] It was about the middle of April. The meadows began to a[s][s]ume a cheerful appearance; the fruit trees, rich in blu[s]hing [s]weets, [s]cented the air with per[s]ume, more grateful to the [s]en[s]e than the mo[s]t co[s]tly compound of art. Mary's health had been impaired, by midnight vigils, riot and intemperance. She [s]ought, from the fre[s]hne[s]s of the country air, a rein[s]tatement of it, and a relief from that la[s][s]itude and inanity which weighed upon her [s]pirits; a neat cottage but a few miles from London became her refidence. Late one evening, as [s]he was preparing to retire to re[s]t, the [s]ound of a carriage driving ha[s]tily by, attracted her attention. In a moment the noi[s]e of the wheels cea[s]ed; a [s]udden [s]hriek was heard, and then all was [s]ilent. "Why, as [s]ure as can be, ma'am," [s]aid the [s]ervant who was helping her to undre[s]s, "the carriage is either broke down or over[s]et." "I hope not, Dolly," [s]he replied, going to the window to li[s]ten. Before [s]he had time to unbar the shutters and rai[s]e the [s]a[s]h, a loud ring at the gate announced an unexpected vi[s]itor. It was the per[s]on who drove the carriage; it had been overturned; a lady in it was hurt, and her hu[s]band had [s]ent him to reque[s]t they might be permitted to repo[s]e for the night in her hou[s]e, as the carriage had been [s]o damaged as to render it impo[s][s]ible for them to proceed on their journey. Mary was not deficient in the knowledge, nor backward in the performance of the rites of ho[s]pitality. "The [s]trangers [s]hall be welcome, "[s]aid [s]he, "to every accommodation my humble man[s]ion affords." The lady had fainted; for her arm was di[s]located, and the pain had overcome her natural fortitude. A gentleman, a[s][s]i[s]ted by his [s]ervant, bore her into the hou[s]e; their dre[s]s [s]truck on the heart of Mary. She went to the [s]ofa on which the fair in[s]en[s]ible was laid, with a de[s]ign of admini[s]tering volatiles and a restorative cordial. She rai[s]ed her head, which was reclined on her hu[s]band's [s]houlder, and beheld the features of Ca[s][s]iah. Her hands trembled, her cheek turned pale. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-200.jpg) \- external link  - Page 191. ] "My cou[s]in!" [s]aid [s]he. Mr. Dudley looked at her with attention, and, though decorated in the habiliments of vanity, recognized the conntenance of Mary Holmes. But little now remains to be told. The hurt Cassiah had received, confined her above a week, during which time Mary was delivered of a [s]on. The advice and admonitions of her friends determined her to abjure a way of life, into which [s]he had been fir[s]t seduced by want of re[s]olution, and in which, want of resolution alone could have induced her to continue. Bu[s]ine[s]s of importance had brought Dudley from the country; and, prompted at once by affection for her hu[s]band, and a wi[s]h to [s]ee the capital, Ca[s][s]iah was induced to accompany him. The de[s]ired ends fully accompli[s]hed, they prepared to return. "Come, Mary," [s]aid Ca[s][s]iah, "throw off the[s]e trappings of vanity; they become not the penitent. Assume the dre[s]s of [s]implicity and purity, in which thou wert wont to appear. Return with a noble firmne[s]s, to the man who [s]educed thee, the wages of thy guilt, the price of thy di[s]honour. I pray thee, Mary Holmes, return to the bo[s]om of thy friends, to the paths of innocence and virtue. Albeit thy good uncle Obadiah is no more, yet I and my brother Hezekiah are his repre[s]entatives. Had he been living, and thou had[s]t returned repentant, he would have exceedingly rejoiced; would have killed the [s]atted calf, and have bid his friends and neighbours to come and welcome thee. And [s]hall not we perform the will of our decea[s]ed father? Yea, verily will we, [s]ince in [s]o doing we [s]hall al[s]o perform the will of our Father who is in heaven. Dear Mary, turn not a deaf ear to my prayer; for the ways of truth are the ways of plea[s]antne[s]s, and where innocence dwells, dwells al[s]o peace forevermore. Mary mu[s]t have been in[s]en[s]ible indeed to have rejected the earne[s]t [s]olicitations of her amiable relation. Every feeling of the force and beauty of virtue was now powerfully awakened and called into action. She returned the [s]ettlement [s]he had received from [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-201.jpg) \- external link  - Page 192. ] Fitzgerald, and accompanied Dudley and Ca[s][s]iah into Lancashire, where a few years put a period to her existence. Mr. Dudley had from his birth adopted her [s]on Jacob Holmes; and when he embarked for America, Jacob accompanied him, was witne[s]s to every tran[s]action on that [s]ide the Atlantic, enjoyed his unlimited confidence, and when he propo[s]ed returning to Europe, Jacob was entru[s]ted with a copy of his will, the title-deeds of the newly purcha[s]ed e[s]tate, and left in po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of it, with directions to [s]pare neither co[s]t nor pains to improve, cultivate and beautify it. Things as they were, as they are, and as they ever will be. Reuben and Rachel had, during the ab[s]ence of their father, increa[s]ed in [s]tature, and improved in mental acquirements. Their per[s]ons were much altered for the better. Rachel was now approaching womanhood; tall, [s]traight, and well-proportioned. An intelligent animation lighted up her countenance, which prepo[s][s]e[s][s]ed the beholder, at fir[s]t [s]ight, in her favour. It was that kind of hone[s]t countenance in which you might read every emotion of the heart, and [s]eemed to [s]ay, "I cannot deceive you, if I would." Reuben almo[s]t idolized his [s]i[s]ter, and when the holidays permitted his annual vi[s]it, never were three human beings more [s]uperlatively happy, than the brother, [s]i[s]ter, and aunt Rachel. It was in one of the[s]e vi[s]its, as they were [s]ocially [s]eated round their fire, their family party enlivened by the company of a Mi[s]s Oliver, who was pa[s][s]ing the winter with her grandmother, in the neighbourhood, when a letter was brought. "It is from your father," [s]aid aunt Rachel; "take it, Reuben, and read it." Reuben broke the [s]eal, and read as follows. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-202.jpg) \- external link  - Page 193. ] "IT is with [s]atisfaction of the pure[s]t kind, that I take up my pen to inform my dear aunt Rachel and my beloved children, that the bu[s]ine[s]s which brought me to this place is at length fini[s]hed, and the completion of it is equal to my mo[s]t [s]anguine expectations. "The purcha[s]e of the land, (which is delightfully [s]ituated on the banks of the Schuylkill, within a pleasant ride of Philadelphia) the building of the hou[s]e, barn, [s]table, &c. in [s]uch a [s]tyle as might unite a degree of [s]imple elegance with convenience, the stocking the farm, and other contingencies, have led me rather to exceed the [s]um I fir[s]t [s]at out with, though that was greatly augmented by trade; and I have been nece[s][s]itated to give bills on England for five hundred pounds; but they are at [s]uch a date as will enable me to reach home before they become due, or [s]hould I not, I have given my agent, Mr. Atkins, instructions to [s]ell part of the Lanca[s]hire e[s]tate, if he has not in his hands money [s]ufficient to pay the bills without. You will, therefore, without he[s]itation, acquiesce in whatever arrangements he may make for that purpo[s]e. "I intend embarking for England about the end of October, and hope to [s]ee you all before the new year commences. "I [s]uppo[s]e my darlings, Reuben and Rachel, are almo[s]t grown out of knowledge. I would have an[s]wered their letters, but time pre[s][s]es. I am plea[s]ed with their evident improvement in writing and orthography. Tell Reuben here will be an ample field for his a[s]piring and inqui[s]itive genius. Tell him, at the [s]ame time, I wi[s]h him ever to a[s]pire to be eminently good; for that only can render him eminently great. Tell my deare[s]t Rachel, that if [s]he emulates the virtues and perfections of her [s]ainted mother, [s]he will be every thing that is amiable. Fare thee well. May the Creator and Pre[s]erver of the univer[s]e guard, protect, and keep you all. R. DUDLEY. "P. S. I [s]hall leave Jacob Holmes in care of my e[s]tate here. I [s]hall al[s]o leave him a trifle to put him [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-203.jpg) \- external link  - Page 194. ] in a little way of bu[s]ine[s]s, that by prudence and industry he may render him[s]elf independent. The man who depends for the nece[s][s]aries of life on a patron, can never a[s][s]ert that freedom of [s]pirit which is the natural prerogative of every human being. Jacob is [s]erious, a[s][s]iduous, and [s]erupulou[s]ly con[s]cientious in all his dealings. I have placed an unlimited confidence in him, and am firm in the belief that he will never abu[s]e it. Once more, God ble[s]s you." "So then," [s]aid Reuben, his fine eyes beaming with plea[s]ure, "[s]o then, my father intends that we [s]hall all go to America. Well, I always earne[s]tly wi[s]hed to go, and I find I [s]hall be gratified." "But brother," [s]aid Rachel, "look at the date of my father's letter, and remember what he [s]aid about [s]ailing in October: why, my dear brother, he will be home very [s]oon." "He may arrive in a few days," [s]aid aunt Rachel. "A few days!" cried Reuben eagerly, "why he may arrive this very night." "Oh dear! dear Reuben, do you think [s]o?" "Yes; and perhaps in [s]ix weeks or two months time we may be all on the Atlantic ocean. Ble[s]s me! Mi[s]s Oliver, are you not well?" This que[s]tion and exclamation, which Reuben addressed to their fair vi[s]itor, was extorted by [s]udden surprise. He had ca[s]ually glanced his eye towards her as he was [s]peaking, and beheld her intere[s]ting countenance pale as a[s]hes. "What is the matter, Je[s][s]y Oliver?" [s]aid Rachel, who[s]e attention was awakened by her brother's question; "is the room too warm?" "No! no! my dear," [s]aid Je[s][s]y in tremulous accents; "only! only! indeed I don't know what ails me; but I was [s]eized--- "With a [s]udden [s]ickne[s]s at the mention of the Atlantic ocean," [s]aid Hezekiah Penn, who had been [s]moking his pipe in one corner of the room. The dry manner in which he [s]poke, the look he ca[s]t towards her, recalled the ro[s]es to the cheeks of Je[s][s]y. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-204.jpg) \- external link  - Page 195. ] She affected to laugh at the idea; but it was not the laugh of nature. Her heart was full, and her eyes had nearly betrayed its feelings. Reuben was at fir[s]t [s]urpri[s]ed; but he looked on the confu[s]ed fair one, and an idea cro[s][s]ed his mind which gave birth to a [s]entiment which could not be extingui[s]hed but with life. Je[s][s]y Oliver was two years older than our hero and heroine; extremely lovely in her per[s]on, accompli[s]hed in her manners, and endowed with an under[s]tanding far [s]uperior to the generality of her [s]ex. She was sedate beyond her years; but that [s]edatene[s]s was the offspring of [s]orrow, occa[s]ioned by the lo[s]s of her mother when [s]he was about twelve years old; [s]oon after which, her father unthinkingly united him[s]elf with a young, volatile woman of quality, who, though [s]he brought him a very ample fortune, yet by her extravagance, threatened him with ruin, and by her levty, with di[s]honour. Je[s][s]y had a brother, one year younger than her[s]elf. Archibald Oliver was cla[s][s]mate with Reuben, and had twice invited him to his father's country-hou[s]e, which was in Oxford[s]hire, to pa[s]s a few days in the midsummer vacation. This friend[s]hip between the young men naturally led to an intimacy with the [s]i[s]ter; and Je[s][s]y, without a thought which [s]he would blu[s]h to own, was tenderly attached to Reuben. Her [s]ituation at home became di[s]agreeable in the extreme. Fond of reading, drawing, needle-work, and every elegant dome[s]tic employment; without affectation; delicate in her manners and conver[s]ation, and [s]incerely pious; it cannot be imagined that Je[s][s]y could find plea[s]ure in the [s]ociety of a woman, ignorant, di[s][s]ipated and irreligious. To her maternal grandmother [s]he wrote, in confidence, the mi[s]eries of her [s]ituation, and received from her an invitation to pa[s]s the winter with her in Lancashire. Perhaps the vi[s]it was not anticipated with le[s]s [s]atisfaction becau[s]e in the neighbourhood of the family of Reuben Dudley. Not that Je[s][s]y was conscious of being too partial to him; but that [s]he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-205.jpg) \- external link  - Page 196. ] expected much plea[s]ure from the [s]ociety of his [s]i[s]ter and aunt, of whom [s]he had often heard him [s]peak with enthusiasm. She was charmed with the unaffected naivette of Rachel, and the more [s]he knew of her the more [s]he loved her; and though unperceived by her[s]elf, the friend[s]hip [s]he conceived for the [s]i[s]ter [s]trengthened her partiality for the brother. Their per[s]ons were alike, as much [s]o as it was po[s][s]ible for a face truly feminine, [s]trikingly to re[s]emble one who[s]e features are more marked, more manly, more expre[s][s]ive of character. Je[s][s]y looked at Rachel with admiration. "How much you are like your brother," [s]he would [s]ay. Alas! poor Je[s][s]y; [s]he was uncon[s]cious, that it was that resemblance which chiefly drew her heart, with irresistible power, towards her new friend. The mind of Jessy was as pure as the cha[s]te dew which glitters in an April morn upon the bo[s]om of a half-blown snowdrop; and when with undi[s][s]embled joy [s]he flew to meet him on his arrival in Lanca[s]hire, and pre[s]ented her hand and [s]miling mouth to greet him, it was with the [s]en[s]ations of a [s]eraph who welcomes a kindred [s]pirit to the man[s]ions of the ble[s]t. Oh why! why! is this pure, this unimpa[s][s]ioned intercourse between the [s]exes, [s]o rare, as to be almo[s]t incredible? Alas! it is a humiliating truth to own; but human nature is [s]o weak, [s]o liable to error, that its pure[s]t emotions may be con[s]trued into guilt, and, con[s]cious of our own imbecility, we tremble for the firmne[s]s of another. Be[s]ides, wherever beauty, [s]en[s]e, or merit dwells, there envy hovers round, with haggard eye, and pale, di[s]torted brow; the poi[s]on falling from her baleful tongue di[s]colours every object, and ca[s]ts on even innocence it[s]elf a [s]allow, doubtful hue. Oh! how happy, how [s]uperlatively happy, is the youthful, inexperienced, yet [s]u[s]ceptible bo[s]om! Charm'd with each object that it meets, Blythe as the vernal morn, It from the ro[s]e inhales the [s]weets, Nor feels nor dreads the thorn; When hope, unfetter'd, pure as light, Free as the pa[s][s]ing wind, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-206.jpg) \- external link  - Page 197. ] Bounds forward [s]till with cha[s]te delight, Nor [s]ees the [s]torm, nor heeds the night, That threatens clo[s]e behind. Thus pure, thus [s]u[s]ceptible, thus fearle[s]s of evil, were the hearts of Reuben, Rachel, and their fair friend Je[s][s]y Oliver; when on the evening ju[s]t mentioned, the reception of the letter, the eagerne[s]s Reuben expre[s][s]ed to embark for America, and the remark uncle Hezekiah made on the [s]udden [s]ickne[s]s of Je[s][s]y, awakened new ideas in the brea[s]ts of all. Reuben had folded up his father's letter, returned it to his aunt, and [s]eated him[s]elf be[s]ide Je[s][s]y, took her pa[s][s]ive hand, and [s]eemed for a moment bu[s]ied in counting over and over again, the beautifully white and finely tapering fingers. Rachel [s]eated her[s]elf on the other [s]ide, and a[s]ked, with innocent earne[s]tne[s]s, "if [s]he was not better now." "Yes," replied Je[s][s]y, almo[s]t uncon[s]cious that [s]he [s]poke at all. "I thought you were," [s]aid Rachel, with the greatest [s]implicity; "for the colour is returned to your lips and cheeks." The remark did not make her paler. And when uncle Hezekiah, adju[s]ting his broad-brimmed beaver, and putting on his great coat, bade Reuben talk no more of the Atlantic ocean, America, and [s]uch frightful things, the lily was entirely exchanged for the carnation. Hezekiah went to the door, with a de[s]ign to go home; his hor[s]e had been previou[s]ly brought out. But he opened the door, and ordering the poor bea[s]t back to the [s]table, returned to the parlour, and protested that it [s]tormed tremendou[s]ly. "Does the wind blow very hard uncle?" [s]aid Rachel. "Yes," replied Hezekiah, deliberately [s]eating himself, and filling another pipe. "And does it blow on [s]hore?" [s]aid aunt Rachel, who, having experienced the dangers of the [s]ea herself, felt more [s]en[s]ibly the perils to which her nephew [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-207.jpg) \- external link  - Page 198. ] might be expo[s]ed, [s]hould he be coming near the land on [s]uch a [s]tormy night. "It blows [s]trongly from the [s]ea," [s]aid Hezekiah, drawing in a va[s]t quantity of [s]moke, and then suffering it gradually to evaporate, as it e[s]caped in [s]mall curling clouds from his mouth. As he [s]poke, a [s]udden gu[s]t ru[s]hed impetuou[s]ly by the hou[s]e, and [s]hook the apartment in which they were [s]itting. "Does it [s]now or rain, brother?" [s]aid Rachel. "It [s]nows," [s]aid Hezekiah, not giving Reuben time to reply; "it [s]nows, and is very dark indeed." At that moment, the di[s]charge of a di[s]tant cannon was heard; and Hezekiah, da[s]hing his pipe on the hearth, [s]tarted from his [s]eat, and exclaimed, "There is [s]ome [s]hip in di[s]tre[s]s." Before any one could reply, another and another gun was heard, and the [s]ervant and carriage arriving for Mi[s]s Oliver, they were informed that a [s]hip had been [s]een in the offing, before dark, as it was [s]uppo[s]ed, endeavouring to make the port of Liverpool; but that [s]he appeared much di[s]abled in her ma[s]ts, yards and rigging, and it was imagined [s]he was now on [s]hore, or in imminent danger. It was not the remon[s]trances or entreaties of his friends, that could now re[s]train the impetuo[s]ity of Reuben. He was prepo[s][s]e[s][s]ed with the idea that his father was in the ve[s][s]el, and he would [s]et off immediately for Liverpool. He might be enabled to [s]end relief to the di[s]tre[s][s]ed mariners. "Oh! my dear brother, it is impo[s][s]ible," [s]aid Rachel; "only hear how the wind roars." "I do hear it," he replied mournfully, "and every bla[s]t [s]eems to [s]ay, Reuben, thy father is peri[s]hing." A momentary [s]ilence now en[s]ued, when Hezekiah propo[s]ed going with his nephew. "I do not think," [s]aid he, "that we can render them any [s]ervice; but suspense is painful, and we may at lea[s]t learn earlier intelligence of the fate of the ve[s][s]el and her unfortunate crew; di[s]cover from whence [s]he came, and what passengers were on board." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-208.jpg) \- external link  - Page 199. ] "Then promi[s]e you will not attempt to go off in a boat, my dear Reuben," [s]aid Rachel. "Oh heavens! he will not [s]urely think of [s]uch a thing," exclaimed Mi[s]s Oliver. "Silly children," [s]aid Hezekiah, "do not rai[s]e imaginary mi[s]eries to afflict your[s]elves with. If he was [s]o mad as to wi[s]h to do [s]o, he would not find any one mad enough to carry him." The hor[s]es were now at the door. Reuben handed Mi[s]s Oliver to her carriage, and then, accompanied by Hezekiah, made all po[s][s]ible [s]peed to Liverpool; whil[s]t aunt Rachel and her niece pa[s][s]ed the night in traversing the apartment, li[s]tening to the [s]torm, and ejaculating fervent prayers for the pre[s]ervation of the unhappy [s]ailors, who[s]e perils (they were a[s][s]ured by the repeated di[s]charge of guns) [s]till continued. Neither of them attempted to re[s]t; they [s]poke but little, but each in [s]ilence indulged her own melancholy thoughts. Aunt Rachel had, added to the anxiety [s]he felt for her nephew's [s]afety, a pre[s]entiment that, [s]hould any thing happen to him, his children would be involved in very di[s]agreeable circum[s]tances. Mr. Dudley had not entru[s]ted her with the exact [s]ituation of his affairs previous to his leaving England. He had told her [s]he might draw on his agent, Atkins, for two hundred pounds each year, and that Atkins had al[s]o orders to pay for Reuben's education, and defray all his expenses; but [s]he knew that the la[s]t half year of Reuben's board remained unpaid, and [s]he had her[s]elf received a letter, recommending prudence to her, and hinting, [s]hould Mr. Dudley extend his [s]tay abroad another [s]ix months, he, Atkins, [s]hould not be able to [s]upply the money nece[s][s]ary for hou[s]e-keeping. This had previou[s]ly given birth to many unea[s]y reflections; and now that [s]he found he had drawn for [s]o large a [s]um, and given Atkins unlimited power to [s]ell or mortgage part of the Lanca[s]hire e[s]tate, [s]he feared, [s]hould any fatal accident prevent his reaching England, Reuben and Rachel might be [s]evere sufferers, in more ways than the lo[s]s of a father. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-209.jpg) \- external link  - Page 200. ] For her[s]elf, [s]he had no fears; and though the half of that e[s]tate con[s]tituted the whole of her worldly possessions, yet [s]uch was the native philanthropy of her mind, [s]o little was [s]elf regarded, and with [s]uch enthusiasm did [s]he regard the offspring of her lamented brother William, that to [s]upply the [s]malle[s]t of their wants, [s]he would have cheerfully dive[s]ted her[s]elf of even the common nece[s][s]aries of life. Aunt Rachel was now nearly approaching her sixty-fifth year; but temperance, cheerfulne[s]s, and a decent competence, joined to a con[s]titution firm by nature, had given even to this advanced period, [s]trength of intellect, hilarity of [s]pirits, and uncommon per[s]onal vigour. In reflections like tho[s]e ju[s]t mentioned on her part, and earne[s]t prayers for her father's [s]afety and her brother's return on the part of Rachel, was the wearisome night pa[s][s]ed. Towards morning the [s]torm abated, and the [s]un aro[s]e in a clear, unclouded horizon; but the ravages of the tempe[s]t were to be [s]een; several trees were lying on the ground, torn from their roots by the violence of the wind. A barn had been unroofed during the night, and the chimney of a neighbouring cottage blown down. "I wonder my brother don't return," [s]aid Rachel. "I wi[s]h he may bring us good news when he does come," replied her aunt. From the ri[s]ing of the [s]un, till it pa[s][s]ed the meridian, Rachel [s]carcely for a moment quitted the window that looked towards the road. At length, about three o'clock, [s]he [s]aw her brother [s]lowly winding down the hill. "Ah! my dear aunt, here comes Reuben," cried [s]he. "But he comes not like the me[s][s]enger of joy," replied aunt Rachel. "He is weary, aunt." The affectionate [s]i[s]ter ran to open the door, and receive her brother. "What news, my dear Reuben?" [s]aid [s]he eagerly, as he led her into the parlour. "The ve[s][s]el is lo[s]t!" he replied. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-210.jpg) \- external link  - Page 201. ] "And the crew?" "All peri[s]hed." "Did you learn where [s]he is [s]uppo[s]ed to be from?" [s]aid aunt Rachel. "A pilot boat, that pa[s][s]ed her ye[s]terday morning, brought intelligence [s]he was from America, but not what particular port." "Had they no pilot on board?" "Yes, and he has peri[s]hed with them." The tears [s]tarted into Renben's eyes as he [s]poke; Rachel wept audibly. Their aunt took a hand from each. "Weep not, my children," [s]aid [s]he, "but tru[s]t in God. If it has plea[s]ed him to deprive you of your father, he is able to [s]upply his place. Look up to him, my children; wor[s]hip him, [s]erve him, obey him, in [s]incerity of heart. He may of his infinite wi[s]dom afflict; but remember, and let it fill your [s]ouls with humble hope and comfort, that his cha[s]ti[s]ements are but temporal, but his rewards to tho[s]e who love him, eternal." "Then you think we are orphans?" [s]aid Rachel. "I think," replied her aunt, "that it is more than probable your father was in the [s]hip which was la[s]t night lo[s]t." Two days from this pa[s][s]ed, and no certain intelligence could be procured. Sometimes they encouraged a dawn of hope, and then again relap[s]ed into de[s]pair. Rachel was the earlie[s]t ri[s]er in the family; [s]he had been up above an hour when the new[s]paper was brought, as it was cu[s]tomary twice a week from Liverpool. She took it from the [s]ervant, and as [s]he held it to the fire to dry, the following paragraph met her eyes.---"We are at length certain, that the large [s]hip which was lo[s]t on Monday night la[s]t, endeavouring to get into this harbour, was the Aurora, of London, from Philadelphia. Two men, who providentially e[s]caped, brought the melancholy intelligence of the captain, mate, ten hands and fourteen pa[s][s]engers having peri[s]hed; among[s]t the latter was Mr. Reuben Dudley." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-211.jpg) \- external link  - Page 202. ] Rachel read no more. The paper fell from her hands, and [s]en[s]e, feeling, almo[s]t life it[s]elf, was for a while [s]u[s]pended. She [s]unk on the floor, her head re[s]ted on the elbow of her aunt's ea[s]y chair, her eyes were open, but [s]he was as devoid of [s]peech and motion as a [s]tatue. In this [s]ituation her brother found her. "My [s]i[s]ter! my dear Rachel!" he exclaimed, eagerly rai[s]ing her. His voice recalled her fleeting [s]en[s]es. She threw her arms round his neck, faintly articulated, "Our father! our beloved father!" and nature relieved her bur[s]ting heart by a violent gu[s]h of tears. Aunt Rachel was prepared for the intelligence; her heart had pre[s]aged it from the fir[s]t. She bore it with the fortitude of a Chri[s]tian, though [s]he felt it as acutely as her niece. But [s]he had learnt to repre[s]s her feelings, and to bow with re[s]ignation to the will of an all-wife Providence. "Soft as the [s]ilver dews that re[s]t On flow'rs that [s]cent the morning air; So [s]oft, [s]o [s]weet, to [s]orrow's brea[s]t, Is Friend[s]hip's [s]mile and Pity's tear." It may naturally be [s]uppo[s]ed, that when the heavy misfortune Reuben and Rachel had [s]u[s]tained was univer[s]ally known, condolements of form and fa[s]hion poured in upon them, and [s]ome few offered consolation with [s]incerity, and participated in their afflictions with feelings truly philanthropic. Among[s]t the latter cla[s]s was Mi[s]s Oliver. She wass [s]o [s]en[s]ibly affected by the lo[s]s they had experienced in the death of their father, that nearly a week elap[s]ed before [s]he could [s]ummon fortitude [s]ufficient to enable her to pay them a vi[s]it. At length, her wi[s]h to admini[s]ter comfort triumphed over the fear [s]he had entertained of the anguish [s]he mu[s]t nece[s][s]arily encounter in the interview. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-212.jpg) \- external link  - Page 203. ] She aro[s]e with a re[s]olution of pa[s][s]ing the day with Rachel, took an early breakfa[s]t, and by nine o'clock was at her habitation. Angui[s]h of heart had [s]o enervated the mental faculties of our heroine, that [s]he no longer aro[s]e with the lark, [s]ought employment with avidity, or pur[s]ued it with alacrity. "Why [s]hould I work?" [s]he would [s]ay; "I have no expectation now to cheer me; no fond hope of a returning father's [s]miles and approbation rewarding my labours." Her mind occupied by reflections [s]uch as the[s]e, Rachel gave more hours to her pillow than was her u[s]ual cu[s]tom; not that [s]he found there the re[s]t [s]he [s]ought; but there [s]he could weep unre[s]trained, there [s]he could uninterruptedly indulge in contemplation. And if haply [s]leep for a few hours [s]teeped her [s]en[s]es in forgetfulne[s]s, [s]he ble[s][s]ed the [s]weet oblivion, and courted its return. She was seated at the breakfa[s]t table when Mi[s]s Oliver entered. "Je[s][s]y!" [s]aid the mournfully, and half ri[s]ing to present her hand; but overcome by the [s]en[s]ations which ru[s]hed on her [s]oul, [s]he [s]unk again on her [s]eat. Mi[s]s Oliver took the proffered hand, pre[s][s]ed it tenderly, [s]eated her[s]elf be[s]ide her, but was [s]ilent. Yet her [s]peaking eye met the glance of Rachel's; its expression conveyed more than was in the power of words; it [s]aid, in the mo[s]t intelligent language, Dear Rachel, I feel, I participate your [s]orrows. It was the con[s]olation mo[s]t congenial to the [s]oul it meant to addre[s]s. Rachel felt its [s]incerity, its energy, and was relieved. Oh! [s]aid [s]he mentally, how far preferable is this to the profu[s]ion of words, with which the unfeeling attempt to con[s]ole me. She returned the pre[s][s]ure of Je[s][s]y's hand; a few tears escaped from her eyes; Reuben ki[s][s]ed them off, and seating him[s]elf oppo[s]ite the two charming young women, contemplated them till his own eyes were [s]uffu[s]ed; and the [s]uffu[s]ion did honour to his heart, to nature, to rea[s]on, to manhood! How long this [s]ilence might have continued, is uncertain; but it was abruptly interrupted by aunt Rachel, who entered the apartment, followed by a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-213.jpg) \- external link  - Page 204. ] diminutive figure habited in a grey coat, black waistcoat and breeches, an immen[s]e and not very fashionable peruke, high boots, a very deep pair of ruffles, and a long neckcloth twi[s]ted through the fourth button-hole of his wai[s]tcoat. This extraordinary per[s]onage appeared to be about fifty years old. His black eyes, which were not the le[s]s penetrating for being extremely [s]mall, darted their glances at the three intere[s]ting figures that pre[s]ented them[s]elves in the per[s]ons of Reuben, Rachel, and Mi[s]s Oliver. He bowed profoundly on entering. Rachel ro[s]e from her [s]eat. Her [s]orrows [s]eemed to retire within her heart, and a dignified compo[s]ure took po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of her features, as [s]he received and returned his compliments. "This gentleman comes from Mr. Atkins," [s]aid aunt Rachel, as pointing to the [s]ofa on which Reuben had [s]at, [s]he motioned for him to be [s]eated. "His name, I under[s]tand, is ---" "Allibi, at your [s]ervice," [s]aid he, bowing again, and recovering him[s]elf with an air of con[s]equence; as if he had [s]aid, I believe I am pretty univer[s]ally known. "Mr. Dudley, I pre[s]ume," turning toward Reuben, "and Mi[s]s Dadley, his charming [s]i[s]ter, (bowing to Rachel) if I may judge from your mourning habits. Give me leave to condole with you on the unfortunate cata[s]trophe of our mutual friend. But man is born to die; [s]o regret is u[s]ele[s]s. Permit me, therefore, to congratulate you on your acce[s][s]ion to his fortune." The mention of her father had called forth the [s]mothered [s]en[s]ibility of Rachel; but the conclu[s]ion repelled it by rou[s]ing her indignation. "Congratulate?" [s]aid [s]he, in a voice [s]carcely articulate. "Congratulate?" echoed Reuben, and his fine countenance glowed, his eyes darted re[s]entment. "Sir, we are the children of Mr. Dudley, his natural offspring, reared by his care, nurtured by his love, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-214.jpg) \- external link  - Page 205. ] taught by his wi[s]dom. Who then [s]hall dare in[s]ult us?" And he ro[s]e from his [s]eat, laid one hand on his brea[s]t, and with the other motioned as though brandi[s]hing a weapon. "Who [s]hall dare in[s]ult us by congratulation for his death? Oh! my father!" "My dear, lo[s]t father!" repeated Rachel. "My afflicted friends," [s]aid Mi[s]s Oliver, [s]oftly. It was a [s]cene [s]o new, the manners and [s]entiments of the young trio were [s]o elevated, as to be almo[s]t unintelligible to Allibi. He figetted on his [s]eat, hemmed at lea[s]t half a dozen times, and at length he began with he[s]itation--- "I beg pardon. I prote[s]t I did not mean---that is, I did not know. But as I was [s]aying, young Mr. Reuben Dudley, and his [s]i[s]ter Mi[s]s Rachel Dudley, being twin brother and [s]i[s]ter, and in the eye of the law joint heirs of the po[s][s]e[s][s]ions and e[s]tates, of what kind [s]oever, that is to [s]ay, of money, plate, jewels, landed property, hou[s]es, merchandize, or what not, belonging or appertaining to their late father, Reuben Dudley, decea[s]ed---" "Oh heavens!" [s]aid Rachel, folding her hands acro[s]s her brea[s]t, as if to accelerate her breathing, which was evidently laboured. "My dear creature!" [s]aid Mi[s]s Oliver, in the accent of commi[s]eration. "Good Sir, be expeditious in explaining the nature of your bu[s]ine[s]s," [s]aid Reuben; and he walked to the other end of the room to conceal his own emotions. Allibi with the [s]ame [s]ang froid proceeded.---"You being, as I have before [s]aid, co-heirs, do thereby [s]tand an[s]werable for all debts contracted by, or owing from the [s]aid Reuben Dudley, decea[s]ed." "Granted," [s]aid Reuben, ha[s]tily. "Pray come to your conclu[s]ion. "The conclu[s]ion is," [s]aid Allibi, deliberately drawing forth his pocket-book, "that you mu[s]t of consequence pay this bill of five hundred pounds, which your father drew previous to his leaving America, on my client Andrew Atkins. Now he, Andrew Atkins, having no property whatever in his hands wherewith [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-215.jpg) \- external link  - Page 206. ] to di[s]charge this demand, and being empowered by your father before the late fatal cata[s]trophe to [s]ell, mortgage, or otherwi[s]e di[s]po[s]e of the Lanca[s]hire estate, in order to liquidate this and other debts he had contracted, I am [s]ent by him, my client, the [s]aid Andrew Atkins, to inquire when it will be convenient for you to di[s]charge the bill; or in ca[s]e of non-ability on your part, I am empowered to take po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of the [s]aid e[s]tates on the part of my client, the [s]aid Andrew Atkins, in order that he may mortgage, [s]ell, or otherwi[s]e di[s]po[s]e of it, to enable him to an[s]wer this and other demands which may be made on him." "I [s]uppo[s]e," [s]aid aunt Rachel, "you know that half the e[s]tate is mine." "Pardon me, madam," [s]aid the man of law, "I know no [s]uch thing. The late Mr. Reuben Dudley inherited from his grandmother, the lady Arrabella Ruthven, wife to Edward Dudley, who went to America in the year 1645; and as the [s]aid Reuben was the only male de[s]cendant of the [s]aid Arrabella, and [s]he dying inte[s]tate---" "Sir," [s]aid Reuben ha[s]tily, "the e[s]tate is half my aunt's; we wi[s]h not to conte[s]t it. It is, it mu[s]t be her's, by all the rules of ju[s]tice." "I know nothing of ju[s]tice," [s]aid Allibi; "the law, the law, Sir, is my profe[s][s]ion." I thought, Sir, law and equity were [s]ynonimous terms." "You are a very young man, Mr. Dudley, very young, very inexperienced; when you are older, you will be wi[s]er." Reuben could not an[s]wer; a look of pointed contempt fully expre[s][s]ed his [s]entiments. Allibi continued: "And [s]o, Sir, your[s]elf and [s]i[s]ter being minors, it is nece[s][s]ary to throw the e[s]tate into Chancery, when, after your father's debts are di[s]charged, the re[s]idue will be paid to you when of age." "And in the mean time how are we to live," [s]aid Rachel. "Oh! my dear young lady, you have friends, wealthy relations. You have al[s]o youth, beauty, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-216.jpg) \- external link  - Page 207. ] may command a home in twenty different families, and in [s]o doing confer a favour. Well, Mr. Dudley, I pre[s]ume from your [s]ilence that you cannot pay the[s]e five hundred pounds?" Reuben bowed his head. "I imagined it would be [s]o, and have brought down people to take po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of the hou[s]e, plate, [s]tock, farming uten[s]ils, &c. and mu[s]t beg you will remove as [s]oon as may be convenient. With your leave, (ri[s]ing and putting on his hat) I will take an inventory of the family plate which I [s]aw in the beaufet in the next room." He drew forth his pen, ink, and folded paper, and without waiting for the leave he had reque[s]ted, walked into the adjoining apartment. "Alas! alas!" cried Rachel, "whither [s]hall we go? Who will receive us? Where [s]hall we find either home or [s]upport?" "Had I a home I could call my own," [s]aid Je[s][s]y Oliver, "you [s]hould not have occa[s]ion to repeat the que[s]tion." "And poor aunt Rachel too, what will become of her?" [s]aid Rachel, tenderly taking her hand, which hung pa[s][s]ively over the arm of her chair, as lo[s]t in painful thought [s]he leaned her head again[s]t the [s]ide of it. "What will become of her?" [s]aid Reuben with energy, "why I will labour to [s]upport you both. Yes," continued he, fervently cla[s]ping his hands, and dropping on his knees before them; "yes, here in the [s]ight of Heaven, I vow to dedicate my life to her and you. I will cheerfully work to procure you [s]u[s]tenance. Indu[s]try [s]hall [s]upply our wants, innocence and content make our dwelling, however humble, the abode of plea[s]ure; and I will protect you from the [s]corn and in[s]ults of the world at the hazard of my life." As Reuben aro[s]e and folded his [s]i[s]ter in his arms, Hezekiah Penn entered the room. He was [s]oon informed of their di[s]agreeable [s]ituation. But Hezekiah knew [s]o very little of the world and its concerns, that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-217.jpg) \- external link  - Page 208. ] he could not offer advice; all he could do was to bid them cheer up, and hope for better times. "In truth, my dear kin[s]man, [s]aid he, "I do commiserate your [s]ufferings much; but I know not how, young as you are, you can extricate your[s]elves from your pre[s]ent difficulty. Come, then, home to my hou[s]e; abide there till we can fix on [s]ome fea[s]ible plan for your future well-doing. I am not overcharged with the good things of this world; but come and partake of [s]uch as I have, and take with it a hearty welcome. I pray thee, Rachel Dudley, be not down hearted, but come to my man[s]ion; bring the[s]e children with thee, and He who feedeth the young ravens will provide the means of [s]ub[s]i[s]tence." The heart of Hezekiah overflowed with the "milk of human kindne[s]s;" he meant all he [s]aid, and felt more, much more, than he could find words to express. His friendly offers, and the endearing kindness of Mi[s]s Oliver, healed the bleeding hearts of Reuben and Rachel, and even aunt Rachel was revived by their influence. That very night they removed from their own habitation to that of the benevolent Hezekiah, and left the loquacious Mr. Allibi in full possession of the premi[s]es, in behalf of his client Mr. Andrew Atkins. Death of old Friend---Acqui[s]ition of a Lover---Formality per[s]onified. Soon after this arrangement took place, Mi[s]s Oliver was recalled home. With many tears [s]he took leave of our heroine, told her, if ever fortune [s]hould put it in her power to offer her an a[s]ylum, [s]he might freely command her pur[s]e, her hou[s]e, her unbounded friend[s]hip in every particular. When [s]he had again embraced Rachel, [s]he turned towards Reuben. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-218.jpg) \- external link  - Page 209. ] "Mr. Dudley," [s]aid [s]he, "the friend[s]hip of a girl like me is an offering of [s]o trifling a nature, I hardly know whether you will think it worth accepting. You are advi[s]ed by your friends to vi[s]it America, to look after and [s]ecure the property your father po[s][s]e[s][s]ed there. It will probably be many years before we meet again; and what changes may take place during this [s]eparation, it is impo[s][s]ible now to determine. Accept my mo[s]t ardent wi[s]hes for your pro[s]perity. I know you will often write to my brother; in tho[s]e letters perhaps you will [s]ometimes remember me." "Oh! doubt it not, charming Mi[s]s Oliver," [s]aid he, pre[s][s]ing her hand to his lips; while [s]he, fearful that [s]he had [s]aid more than the exact line of propriety [s]he had pre[s]cribed to her[s]elf rendered allowable, hurried to her carriage, to hide emotions [s]he found it impo[s][s]ible to [s]tifle. Atkins having now taken the management of the e[s]tate eutirely into his own hands, pretended to advance money him[s]elf for the liquidation of Mr. Dudley's debts, and at the end of three months laid before Hezekiah Penn, Reuben and aunt Rachel, a [s]tatement of accounts, which, to the minds of the[s]e three inexperienced, hone[s]t children of [s]implicity, made it appear as [s]o involved, that it would be a long term of years before it could even clear it[s]elf. In the mean time, how were the orphans and their venerable relation to be [s]upported? Letters were written to Jacob Holmes, a proper time allowed, and no an[s]wer being returned, Hezekiah per[s]uaded Reuben, who was now nearly eighteen, to vi[s]it that continent and make inquiry him[s]elf concerning his father's effects. "Your [s]i[s]ter," [s]aid Hezekiah, "[s]hall [s]tay with me till you return. She [s]hall not want a home nor a father whil[s]t I live." A voyage to the we[s]tern continent had ever been the primary wi[s]h of Reuben's heart; he hoped he knew not what, but that hope led him on; and even to part with his [s]i[s]ter was thought of with more composure, [s]ince, if he amended his own fortune, [s]he was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-219.jpg) \- external link  - Page 210. ] to be the partaker of it. Je[s][s]y Oliver too was foremo[s]t in the happy group his [s]anguine imagination portrayed as eagerly flying to welcome his return to England. Nay, fancy would [s]o powerfully take po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of his mind, that [s]he would [s]ometimes carry him a [s]econd time acro[s]s the Atlantic ocean, and place him tranquilly in the habitation his father had de[s]cribed, surround him with a blooming offspring, and give them Je[s][s]y Oliver for a mother, his [s]i[s]ter too heightening by partaking their felicity; and even provide a [s]nug corner and ea[s]y chair for aunt Rachel. "Uncle Hezekiah," he would [s]ay, "will not be persuaded to quit Old England, or el[s]e what a charming family party we [s]hould make." Oh! how delightful are tho[s]e day-dreams of youth; like the [s]hadows of a magic lantern, that pa[s]s before the admiring eye in quick [s]ucce[s][s]ion, each one as it comes forward more plea[s]ing than the la[s]t. But sorrow, di[s]appointment, poverty, throw a damp upon the fire of youth, which had given brightne[s]s to the picture; the brilliant tints grow pale; the figures are [s]carcely perceptible; they pa[s]s before us almo[s]t unnoticed; when age entirely extingui[s]hes the flame, and all is darkne[s]s, undi[s]tingui[s]hable chaos. Spurred on by the native impul[s]e of his mind, which incited him to activity, and in[s]pired him with the mo[s]t [s]anguine pre[s]entiments of future pro[s]perity, Reuben took leave of his friends in Lanca[s]hire, and embarked for Philadelphia. Previous to his departure, he had thrown off both the habit and manners of a Quaker. Hezekiah remonstrated, but Reuben would reply, "Nay, uncle, can you believe it is of any con[s]equence to our eternal welfare, whether we wear a plain drab coat or a scarlet one? or do you not think I [s]hould commit more [s]in in continuing the habit, when I cannot [s]ubmit to the tenets of the Friendly [s]y[s]tem? I admire their primitive manners, and the [s]implicity of their language; but I am a young man, uncle, and have to make my way through the world. Be[s]ides, I feel that within me that tells me, [s]hould my king or country [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-220.jpg) \- external link  - Page 211. ] require my a[s][s]i[s]tance, I [s]hould readily draw a [s]word in their defence. What, my dear uncle, if we were all men of peace, who would protect us from the encroachments of our enemies? No; you [s]hall pray for peace, and if the haughty foe is not inclined to grant it, I will a[s][s]i[s]t my brave countrymen to force them to it." Perhaps Hezekiah did not [s]ay [s]o much as he might have done, had he not recollected that Reuben's father had only become one of the [s]ect in compliance with the wi[s]h of his wife; and Hezekiah had charity enough to think that a man might be a very good Chri[s]tian, though he wore a button to his hat, and ruffles to his [s]hirt. From the time of Mr. Dudley's unfortunate death, aunt Rachel's [s]pirits flagged. She was no longer the life of every [s]ociety in which [s]he mixed. The lo[s]s of her little independence, the being obliged to the hand of charity for her daily bread, depre[s][s]ed her generous mind. The de[s]titute [s]ituation too of her darlings, Reuben and Rachel, was a heavy affliction. Re[s]t and appetite for[s]ook her. Reuben's departure for America was the fini[s]hing blow. The anxiety [s]he [s]uffered for his [s]afety brought on a [s]low nervous fever, and gradually undermined her con[s]titution. Rachel watched over her with unremitting tenderne[s]s and attention; admini[s]tered every medicine; read to her, prayed by her; endeavoured to cheer her by affected serenity when [s]he was awake, and wept over her with agony when [s]he [s]lept. But care, affection, prayers and tears were alike ineffectual. Aunt Rachel departed this life, and our heroine felt, as the la[s]t breath lingered on the lips of her maternal friend, that in lo[s]ing her [s]he [s]hould become forlorn, unconnected, and be left to [s]truggle through a world with which [s]he was totally unacquainted, without a comforter, advi[s]er, or protector. Reuben [s]till lived, to be [s]ure, but Reuben was far, very far from her; and [s]hould [s]he [s]tand in need of advice or protection, [s]he might be lo[s]t, and Reuben [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-221.jpg) \- external link  - Page 212. ] not even hear of her di[s]tre[s]s till [s]he was pa[s]t the reach of relief or a[s][s]i[s]tance. Occupied by reflections [s]uch as the[s]e, Rachel would often [s]trey into the rural church-yard, where, re[s]ting on the "lap of earth," lay the remains of her mother and her lamented aunt. It was mid[s]ummer. The days were extremely long, and at half-pa[s]t eight o'clock in the evening, ju[s]t enough of the twilight remained, as threw over the face of nature that mode[s]t, du[s]ky veil, [s]o congenial to the contemplative mind. Rachel [s]eated her[s]elf on the fragment of a broken tomb-[s]tone, and ca[s]ting her eyes upon a new-made grave, where that very afternoon a youth had been interred, the only [s]on of a farmer in the neighbourhood, [s]he, almo[s]t unknown to her[s]elf, audibly repeated the following [s]tanzas. Re[s]t, gentle youth, here re[s]t in peace, Secure from vanity and noi[s]e; For here thy earthly [s]orrows cea[s]e, From hence commence thy heavenly joys. Short was thy [s]pan; 'tis pa[s]t! 'tis gone! Early thou'[s]t reach'd the appointed goal; Freed from its clog, and upwards flown, Angels receiv'd thy [s]potle[s]s [s]oul. Here in thy quiet man[s]ion re[s]t, Safe from all angui[s]h, pain or care; Light fit the turf upon thy brea[s]t, Nor weed nor briar flouri[s]h there. And when the chilling arms of death Shall [s]old this fragile frame of mine, May my la[s]t [s]igh of parting breath Pa[s]s tranquil and re[s]ign'd as thine. "My lovely morali[s]t," [s]aid a voice, as Rachel finished the la[s]t [s]entence, "if you [s]it here much longer, you will [s]tand a chance of [s]oon being as tranquil as that poor youth. His di[s]order was a cold, and you are taking the right method to catch one." Rachel ro[s]e, turned her head, and beheld the apothecary of the village. Dr. Lenient was a man nearly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-222.jpg) \- external link  - Page 213. ] fifty years old, very humane, very learned, very skilful in his profe[s][s]ion; but with regret it mu[s]t be added, not very rich. For if he attended a family who[s]e wants were great and means [s]mall, when the journeyman inquired if he [s]hould make out the bill, as was cu[s]tomary, at Chri[s]tmas, he would [s]ay, Pho, pho, tear out the account and burn it; if I [s]end it in, they can't pay it. It is only my own time lo[s]t; and the few drugs---what did they co[s]t me? Nothing worth talking of. Oh! burn it! burn it! If the poor man has got a trifle beforehand, why he wants it, in this [s]ea[s]on of hilarity, to provide a good large plumb-pudding for his little ones." With [s]entiments [s]uch as the[s]e, though the Doctor's practice daily increa[s]ed, yet it did not greatly augment his revenue. However, he [s]upported his family with comfort and [s]omething more than decency. Our heroine was a great favourite with the good man. Studious from her infancy, of an inquiring genius, eager in the pur[s]uit of knowledge, and attentive to the conver[s]ation of tho[s]e who had the power to impart it, Rachel at the age of twelve had prefered a conver[s]ation with the doctor, to a ride or a ramble with her young companions. Charmed by her ardent thir[s]t for in[s]truction, the old gentleman would an[s]wer her que[s]tions, correct her errors, direct her [s]tudies, and labour to give her an unaffected turn for literature and the polite arts. When Rachel painted or worked flowers, the Doctor would a[s][s]i[s]t her in arranging her [s]hades with propriety; de[s]cribing, as he [s]at be[s]ide her while [s]he worked, the natures, properties and u[s]e of every plant, [s]hrub or flower. If [s]he read, he corrected her pronunciation, and taught her how to convey the full [s]en[s]e of what [s]he read to her auditors, by a plea[s]ing modulation of voice. If [s]he wrote, he would point out the errors in her [s]tyle, and often has been heard to [s]ay, It was a great pity [s]he could not [s]peak and read Latin. "Come, my good girl," [s]aid he, "you [s]hall go home with me. You are too melancholy of late, and indulge too much in [s]olitary walks and gloomy [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-223.jpg) \- external link  - Page 214. ] contemplations. And let me tell you, my young friend, you are in[s]en[s]ibly falling into an error, which, if indulged, will increa[s]e and grow upon you, till it becomes guilt." Rachel [s]tarted. "What mean you, Sir?" [s]aid [s]he. "I mean," replied the Doctor, "that you are sinking into torpor and inactivity; you are [s]uffering the functions of your [s]oul to be entirely locked up by grief, and you are di[s]tru[s]ting the power of a Divine Providence, in giving way to immoderate affliction." "Alas! my dear Sir," [s]aid Rachel, "have I not cau[s]e to be afflicted? am I not a mo[s]t unhappy creature? My parents dead, my brother at an immen[s]e di[s]tance from me, my good uncle Hezekiah in a very infirm [s]tate, and the only [s]ource from whence I could look for [s]upport entangled in the law!" "All this is true, I mu[s]t allow," [s]aid the Doctor gravely, "but yet, Mi[s]s Dudley, you have a firm, unalterable friend, who has [s]aid, (and his word is truth it[s]elf) "Though thy father and thy mother for[s]ake thee, yet will not I for[s]ake thee." And this friend, my dear, has endowed you with wonderful qualifications of both mind and per[s]on; he has given you good [s]en[s]e, genius, and the benefit of improving tho[s]e qualities by education; and all he requires of you is, not ungratefully to bury the talent entru[s]ted to your keeping, but exert your[s]elf to improve it to the utmost, depending on him to [s]econd your endeavours, and he will amply reward your faith, patience and indu[s]try." Cheered and comforted by conver[s]ation [s]uch as this, the melancholy cloud began to di[s]per[s]e from the brow of Rachel. Her features a[s][s]umed a [s]weet, an interesting compo[s]ure; and, arrived at the dwelling of the good Doctor, [s]he con[s]ented to go in and partake of his [s]upper. For the hou[s]e of Hezekiah Penn was within five minute's walk of the Doctor's, and a lad was dispatched to inform him that Rachel was [s]afe, but would [s]up out. This little nece[s][s]ary bu[s]ine[s]s was [s]ettled in the garden that fronted the hou[s]e, where the lad was bu[s]ied [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-224.jpg) \- external link  - Page 215. ] in watering [s]ome pots of curious flowers; and the Doctor then led his fair companion through the [s]hop into a back parlour, where they u[s]ually [s]at. "I have brought you a welcome vi[s]itor, [s]i[s]ter," [s]aid he, as he opened the door. Mrs. Auberry ro[s]e from her [s]eat, and taking the hand of Rachel, cried, "Welcome indeed." Then turning to an elegant young man in military uniform, [s]he continued, "My dear Hamden, give me leave to pre[s]ent you to Mi[s]s Dudley. This, Mi[s]s Dudley, is my [s]on Hamden Auberry, of whom you have often heard me [s]peak." The majectic figure, the [s]oft, melancholy countenance of Rachel, rendered more [s]triking by her deep mourning habit, (for Rachel was not Quaker enough to neglect that outward token of re[s]pect to the memory of departed friends) made her appear in the eyes of the young [s]oldier almo[s]t divine. She bowed her head, and pre[s]ented her hand with a grace peculiar to herself. There was [s]omething in the action nouvelle , and irre[s]i[s]tibly charming in the eyes of Hamden. He took the [s]nowy pledge of amity, and bowed low upon it; and if his fingers did contract clo[s]er than the frigid rules of politene[s]s render admi[s][s]ible, [s]urpri[s]e and admiration mu[s]t plead his excu[s]e. Rachel was [s]en[s]ible of the pre[s][s]ure, and life's warm fluid, ru[s]hing impetuously to her heart, from thence [s]prang to her cheeks, and gave uncommon animation to her expre[s][s]ive countenance. Dr. Lenient was an old bachelor. Him[s]elf and [s]i[s]ter were nearly of an age. She had, in her youth, united her[s]elf to a young man, who, being a younger [s]on though of the united families of Hamden and Auberry, had nothing but a commi[s][s]ion and the intere[s]t of his father to depend on. Joanna Lenient was poor in every thing, [s]ave per[s]onal beauty and a good heart. Young Auberry [s]aw her, loved her, and bidding defiance to every [s]ugge[s]tion of prudence, in direct oppo[s]ition to the will of his father, married her. His father renounced him, and he never ro[s]e above the rank of captain. He [s]ought preferment in the field of action, fought bravely under the gallant Marlborough, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-225.jpg) \- external link  - Page 216. ] and fell in the memorable battle on the plains of Bleinhem. His wife had never been acknowledged by his family, and after his death [s]he retired, with her infant [s]on, then only fifteen months old, to the village where her brother re[s]ided. He had ju[s]t entered upon the bu[s]y [s]cenes of life, had a plea[s]ant hou[s]e, a con[s]iderable degree of employment; but no [s]ocial companion to render the fire[s]ide cheerful, or pre[s]ide at the temperate meal. He invited his [s]i[s]ter to come and increa[s]e his comforts by [s]haring them. She complied, and his home from that hour became her's. Her pen[s]ion was devoted to the education of young Hamden, and the [s]upply of her own pocket expen[s]es; and the Doctor found him[s]elf [s]o happy in her [s]i[s]terly affection, her economy in managing his family, her good humour, [s]incerity, and [s]tudy to plea[s]e, that every other woman of his acquaintance lo[s]t [s]omething in his opinion, when compared with his [s]i[s]ter Auberry. It happened that when Hamden was about [s]even years old, the maid-[s]ervant of Dr. Lenient reque[s]ted leave to go to a neighbouring fair, and take little master with her. Hamden joined his [s]olicitations with Su[s]an's, and was permitted to go. The brother of Su[s]an was the head-waiter of an inn, in the town to which they went, and thither the girl (after having paraded through the fair with [s]ome of her companions, and purcha[s]ed for Ma[s]ter Auberry a gun and a drum) repaired, in order to procure [s]ome refre[s]hment. Hamden, [s]atiated with cakes, fruit and [s]ugar-plumbs, left her to take her repa[s]t in quiet, whil[s]t, taking his little mu[s]ket on his [s]houlder, and [s]linging his drum before him, he paraded in the court before the front of the hou[s]e, [s]upporting his gun with his left hand, and beating the drum with his right. Hamden was a remarkably hand[s]ome boy; his complexion at once fair and florid, his eyes large and expre[s][s]ive, of the fine[s]t [s]apphire hue, and his forehead [s]haded by innumerable ringlets of beautiful flaxen hair; tall of his age, and [s]ufficiently robu[s]t to prevent an appearance of effeminacy. Such a boy [s]o [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-226.jpg) \- external link  - Page 217. ] employed, could not fail to attract notice. A lady, who in pa[s][s]ing to her country-[s]eat had [s]topped to take dinner in this place, had ob[s]erved his martial air and [s]tep, as he marched before the windows, and throwing up the [s]a[s]h, called him to her. "So you have been to the fair, I [s]ee, my pretty boy," [s]aid [s]he. "Yes, ma'am, and Su[s]an gave me this gun; a'nt it a pretty one? and the drum too; only hear how loud I can beat it. She wanted to give me a fiddle and a coach, but I cho[s]e the gun, and next fair I will have a [s]word." "You [s]hall have a [s]word now, my [s]weet boy; here is a [s]hilling to buy one." "No, thank you, ma'am," [s]aid Hamden; "mamma gave me money enough, and [s]he would be angry if I took any from [s]trangers." "You are a charming fellow; will you go with me?" "If mamma plea[s]es, and you will promi[s]e to make me a [s]oldier." "Why do you wi[s]h to be a [s]oldier?" "Becau[s]e papa was a [s]oldier. He was killed at the battle of Bleinhem, and I [s]hould like to know how to fight, that I might kill the man that killed my father." The lady felt her eyes fill with tears; the undaunted [s]pirit of the boy delighted her. "What is your name, my love?" [s]aid [s]he. "Hamden Auberry," he replied; "'tis a great name, my mamma [s]ays, and for the [s]ake of my father's relations I mu[s]t be careful not to di[s]grace it, though they never owned me, nor noticed me." At the name of Auberry, the lady had [s]unk agitated on the window-[s]eat. "Come into the room, my dear," [s]aid [s]he. Hamden obeyed, and was in[s]tantly folded in her arms, while her tears bedewed his face, as [s]he tenderly [s]aluted him. It was lady Anne Auberry, the elde[s]t [s]i[s]ter of Hamden's father. Struck by the innocent reproach his natural and [s]pirited replies had given, not only to herself, but all the family, for their wilful neglect of [s]o [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-227.jpg) \- external link  - Page 218. ] promi[s]ing a branch of it, [s]he made inquiries concerning the [s]ituation of his mother, ordered her carriage, took the child home, and from that moment adopted him as her own [s]on. At that period [s]he was verging upon forty, was [s]till unmarried, and remained [s]o at the time Hamden, returned from a tour he had been making on the continent, was introduced to our heroine. Lady Anne had [s]pared no co[s]t in completing his education. She never forgot the promi[s]e he had innocently extorted from her at the moment [s]he fir[s]t conver[s]ed with him, and before he was [s]ixteen purchased for him an en[s]igncy in a regiment upon the home e[s]tabli[s]hment. He was now only twenty-two, but what cannot intere[s]t and money procure? Hamden Auberry, without once having been in actual service, was advanced to the rank of Major. When lady Anne thus lavi[s]hly poured upon her nephew every advantage which wealth could be[s]tow, [s]he in her mind purpo[s]ed making him her heir; indeed, [s]he looked upon him as the heir of the family. Her elde[s]t brother's children were all puny beings, and her [s]econd brother had never married. She therefore looked forward with the hope of one day [s]eeing Hamden one of the fir[s]t men in the kingdom. One of the preliminaries [s]he had [s]ettled for his advancement was a marriage with [s]ome woman of splendid rank and fortune. Perhaps lady Anne was not quite [s]o anxious about beauty, grace, good [s]en[s]e, and good humour, as Hamden him[s]elf thought was absolutely nece[s][s]ary; for [s]he had pointed out three [s]everal women of quality, who, [s]he a[s][s]ured him, would be happy to receive his devoirs, and who[s]e alliance would do him infinite honour. But unfortunately one was upwards of forty years old, another had a hump on her back, coar[s]e, unmeaning features, and a disposition that was the very counterpart of her form; and the third, though formed by the tendere[s]t care of young love, yet [s]o vacant, [s]o totally devoid of mental endowments, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-228.jpg) \- external link  - Page 219. ] And when the beauteous idiot [s]poke, Forth from her coral lips [s]uch non[s]en[s]e broke, That Hamden, though an enthu[s]ia[s]t in his admiration of female beauty, could [s]carcely command patience [s]ufficient to li[s]ten with an appearance of common civility. His heart had remained untouched, and it was for our heroine alone to call its tender [s]entiments into action. The artle[s]s, unaffected manner of Rachel, afforded him the mo[s]t delicate plea[s]ure, whil[s]t beholding and conver[s]ing with her; for it was [s]o apparent in every word, look, [s]mile of her's, that [s]he was unconscious of her own charms, that tho[s]e charms became the more [s]triking, the more fa[s]cinating. About half pa[s]t ten, he waited on Rachel to the door of her uncle's man[s]ion, and then returned to tell his mother [s]he was the only woman he had ever [s]een, who in the lea[s]t appeared to him in every particular what a woman ought to be. Hezekiah had been married very early in life, but his wife lived only a few years; and from the time of her decea[s]e, his hou[s]ehold concerns had been superintended by a di[s]tant relation of his mother's, who[s]e tall, thin figure, and au[s]tere vi[s]age, attired in the clo[s]e mob black hood, and other plain habiliments u[s]ually worn by the [s]ect, looked, as much as it is po[s][s]ible to conceive any thing to look, like formality per[s]onified. Nor was her dre[s]s and per[s]on more [s]tiff and forbidding than was her manners. Ignorant in the highe[s]t degree, [s]he valued her[s]elf on that ignorance; [s]he understood nothing of polite literature; and whenever [s]he [s]aw our heroine engaged in any book, whether of in[s]truction or amu[s]ement it mattered not, by her they were all termed vanity and vexation of [s]pirit. The productions of the be[s]t poets were called bla[s]phemy. Hi[s]tory was of no u[s]e; for of what con[s]equence was it to her what was done in the world before [s]he was born? And works of fancy, however excellent in their kind, were all a pack of non[s]en[s]e, and [s]erved only to fill young people's heads with proclamations. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-229.jpg) \- external link  - Page 220. ] To be [s]een with a book on any day except Sunday, was highly again[s]t her creed. For in her opinion needle-work, [s]pinning, and attending to the culinary concerns of the family, were [s]ufficient to occupy every hour of the day. Her pickles and pre[s]erves were excellent in their kind, and for good [s]ub[s]tantial roa[s]t and boiled di[s]hes, with [s]olid plumb-puddings, and large family mince-pies, Tabitha would not give place to any woman in England. Hezekiah thought, with all her oddities, [s]he had his intere[s]t [s]incerely at heart, and therefore continued pa[s][s]ive, and [s]uffered Tabitha to rule the family as [s]he plea[s]ed. But the maidens of the hou[s]ehold unanimou[s]ly declared, that [s]he ruled with a rod of iron. Journey to London. When Hamden Auberry had [s]een Rachel to her uncle's door and rapped at it, politene[s]s obliged him to wait till it was opened, which it was by Tabitha her[s]elf. She glanced her eye at the scarlet coat and the lace which decorated it, nor did [s]he entirely overlook the hand[s]ome form and face of him who wore it. But when, without noticing Tabitha, Hamden bowed to our heroine, and ki[s][s]ing her hand with an air of gallantry, wi[s]hed her a good night, [s]he became troubled in [s]pirit that Rachel [s]hould have submitted to [s]uch an abomination quietly. With upright head, her long, [s]craggy neck stretching to its utmo[s]t extent, from a con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of her own purity, in [s]ilent [s]olemnity Tabitha [s]talked into the parlour, where [s]at Hezekiah almo[s]t dozing in his ea[s]y chair. She depo[s]ited the candle on the table, and [s]eated her[s]elf on his right hand. Rachel [s]at down on the other, [s]ide, and affectionately bending over the chair, a[s]ked her uncle how he was. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-230.jpg) \- external link  - Page 221. ] "Why tired almo[s]t to death, thou maye[s]t be [s]ure," [s]aid Tabitha, not giving Hezekiah time to reply. "Then it was a pity my uncle did not go to bed," [s]aid Rachel innocently. "Thou art both an unthinking and an unfeeling girl, Rachel Dudley, el[s]e woulde[s]t thou know that anxiety for thy [s]afety kept him up. But he has had [s]o many of tho[s]e unea[s]y hours [s]ince thou ha[s]t been in his dwelling, that I can fore[s]ee it will hurry him to his grave. Oh! Rachel! Rachel! thou art turned to vanity, to folly, to abomination. Thou art wilfully running into the [s]nares of the wicked one. Thou do[s]t love to con[s]ort with the children of di[s]obedience; thou delighte[s]t to behold their ve[s]tments, [s]hining with gold, and red in the blood of Jezebel." "Ble[s]s me," [s]aid Rachel, "what can you mean? Uncle, pray [s]peak to me. I hope I have not given you any cau[s]e for unea[s]ine[s]s. I [s]ent word that I [s]hould [s]up at Dr. Lenient's; had you [s]ent by the boy for me to come home, I [s]hould have returned in[s]tantly." Hezekiah had taken her hand, which in her earnestness [s]he had laid on his knee, gave it a gentle pre[s][s]ure, and was beginning to [s]peak; but Tabitha interrupted him, and he knew it would be in vain to attempt being heard, when [s]he was inclined to talk. So he relinqui[s]hed his intention, leaned back in his chair, [s]hut his eyes, and inwardly wi[s]hed he could [s]hut his ears al[s]o. "Thou did[s]t [s]end word, it is true," [s]aid the persecuting Tabitha, "but thou did[s]t not [s]end word that a [s]tranger would walk with thee; that thou woulde[s]t lean on his arm, and [s]uffer him to ki[s]s thy hand, in a manner not becoming a maiden who wi[s]heth to preserve her reputation. And this [s]tranger was clothed in [s]carlet and gold, and eats the bread that is purchased by murdering his fellow-creatures. Verily, I [s]ay, my [s]pirit waxeth wroth when I think the daughter of Ca[s][s]iah Penn turneth from the wor[s]hip of her father's hou[s]e, and runneth after [s]trange gods, and delighteth to dwell in the tents of idolaters." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-231.jpg) \- external link  - Page 222. ] "I beg your pardon," [s]aid Rachel tartly; "my father de[s]pi[s]ed both formality and hypocri[s]y." "Oh thou offspring of a generation of vipers," cried Tabitha, "do[s]t thou call our pure and undefiled faith hypocri[s]y?" "No! Heaven forbid I [s]hould," replied our heroine mildly; "it is only the uncharitable and insensate wretch, who, having neither heart to conceive, nor under[s]tanding to enjoy, the innocent plea[s]ures with which a bountiful Creator has enriched the world, proudly arrogate to them[s]elves the right to judge and contemn their fellow-creatures; and [s]urely it is the height of hypocri[s]y to pretend to de[s]erve the divine appellation of Chri[s]tian, and yet harbour in the bo[s]om envy, hatred and malice." "Rachel! Rachel! child of folly, daughter of disobedience," exclaimed Tabitha vociferou[s]ly, her meagre features flaming with rage, as though the fire within [s]hone through her [s]kinny cheeks and hollow eyes; "child of darkne[s]s, hear me; thou art going blindfold into the pit; thou art walking barefoot over burning plough[s]hares; but the [s]oles of thy feet, like thine eternal [s]oul, is callous and in[s]en[s]ible to the danger that [s]urrounds thee. Had thy mother lived unto this day---" "Oh! would to Heaven [s]he had!" cried Rachel, her [s]pirits no longer able to [s]upport her again[s]t the ab[s]urd accu[s]ations of Tabitha. "Oh that [s]he were alive at this moment; [s]he would not [s]uffer her innocent child to be thus gro[s]sly in[s]ulted." Here [s]he gave way to an involuntary gu[s]h of tears; but [s]uppre[s][s]ing them as quick as [s]he could, [s]he ki[s][s]ed her uncle with affection, "Good-night! God ble[s]s you, my dear Sir," [s]aid [s]he; "the unhappy Rachel will not long be a trouble to you." "God ble[s]s you, my love," [s]aid Hezekiah, "and grant us both patience according to the burthens it may plea[s]e him to lay upon us." "Amen," [s]aid Rachel [s]ervently, darting an indignant look at Tabitha; then ri[s]ing and taking the candle from the table, [s]he went towards the door; but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-232.jpg) \- external link  - Page 223. ] the natural philanthropy of her mind would not [s]uffer her to part in enmity with any one. She turned towards Tabitha. "Good-night," [s]aid [s]he in a [s]oftened accent, "and Heaven forgive us both as we forgive each other." Tabitha was [s]ullenly [s]ilent, and Rachel retired to her [s]olitary apartment, wept a few moments, knelt, and commended her[s]elf to the protection of Heaven; was compo[s]ed and comforted by the action, retired to bed, and [s]unk into the arms of repo[s]e. Sweet, heavenly [s]weet, are the [s]lumbers of the innocent. Rachel's heart was uncontaminated; envy, hatred, jealou[s]y, were equal [s]trangers to it. Her [s]leep was undi[s]turbed and refre[s]hing; her dreams the visitation of mini[s]tering angels. When Rachel left the parlour, Tabitha began speaking to Hezekiah, but he aro[s]e from his [s]eat. "My head aches," [s]aid he, "I can [s]it up no longer." Then taking his own candle, which [s]tood ready on the table, he bade Tabby good-night and retired to his apartment. "I will alter my will to-morrow," [s]aid Hezekiah, as he laid his head on the pillow; (for, [s]ome years previous to the death of Mr. Dudley, this will had been made highly in Tabitha's favour) "I will alter my will," [s]aid he, "it will not be right to leave my fair and good kin[s]woman Rachel, dependent on a person who[s]e under[s]tanding is weak, and who[s]e heart is contracted." In the morning he aro[s]e with the [s]ame determination, and di[s]patched a per[s]on for the mo[s]t eminent attorney of the neighbouring market town. He walked him[s]elf to Dr. Lenient's, wi[s]hing to con[s]ult with him, and to have him a witne[s]s to his new will. But unfortunately the attorney was gone to London on particular bu[s]ine[s]s, and Dr. Lenient had been called to Liverpool to vi[s]it a patient, who, having found benefit from his pre[s]criptions whil[s]t on a vi[s]it in the country, wi[s]hed to have tho[s]e pre[s]criptions continued. At dinner, Hezekiah ate le[s]s than u[s]ual, complained of an acute pain acro[s]s his temples, and a coldne[s]s down the [s]pine of his back. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-233.jpg) \- external link  - Page 224. ] "Why do[s]t thou not partake of that boiled [s]oal?" [s]aid Tabitha; "the [s]hrimp [s]auce is good, I can a[s][s]ure thee, for I made it my[s]elf." "I have no appetite for fi[s]h," he replied, pu[s]hing the plate gently from him. "Let me change your plate, dear uncle," [s]aid Rachel, removing the one before him and [s]etting one in its place on which [s]he had previou[s]ly laid the wing of a chicken. Hezekiah drew the plate towards him, cut a mouthful and rai[s]ed it to his lips. But the effort was vain; his countenance changed; he [s]unk back. It was a kind of paralytic affection. He [s]truggled to [s]peak, but could not articulate. By the order of Tabitha, he was put into a warm bed, and Dr. Lenient being ju[s]t returned, attended on the fir[s]t [s]ummons. He ordered the u[s]ual applications, and waited to ob[s]erve their effects. All the night he continued [s]peechle[s]s; but towards morning, by a violent exertion, he [s]poke [s]o as to be under[s]tood. De[s]iring to be rai[s]ed in the bed, he in faltering accents thus began: "I called on you, my good friend, this morning, to a[s]k your advice and opinion." "I wi[s]h I had been at home," [s]aid the Doctor, "we might perhaps have prevented this [s]evere attack." "That is not my meaning," [s]aid Hezekiah. "My time is come, and, [s]kilful as you are, my good Doctor, I do not think you can ward off the [s]troke of death." "I do not think I could," [s]aid the Doctor gravely. "Tabitha," [s]aid the [s]ick man, reaching out his hand towards her, "I am much indebted to you for the unwearied attention you have for many years [s]hewn me, and the care you have taken of my temporal intere[s]t. It has grieved me to [s]ee the little di[s][s]en[s]ions which have of late taken place between you and my niece Rachel, who, though younger, livelier, more free from prejudice than your[s]elf, is neverthele[s]s one of the be[s]t and mo[s]t unoffending creatures in the world. Let me [s]ee you friends," continued he, taking Rachel's hand and joining it with Tabitha's. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-234.jpg) \- external link  - Page 225. ] Rachel could not [s]peak, Tabitha would not, and Hezekiah continued: "You will find on the opening of my will, Dr. Lenient, that I have not forgot the [s]ervices I have received from my ancient kin[s]woman; but I am [s]orry--- I meant to alter---I wi[s]h her to give---" His voice again faultered---"to give her---" [s]aid he with extreme difficulty. "Fifty or [s]ixty guineas," cried Tabitha, interrupting him. "No," exclaimed the dying man; then [s]truggling violently, he at length articulated, "Give her half." They were his la[s]t words. In a few moments he [s]unk again into in[s]en[s]ibility, and before evening expired. Now the good-hearted Doctor fully comprehended what Hezekiah meant when he [s]aid, "Give her half." But Tabitha wilfully mi[s]con[s]trued the expre[s][s]ion; and when the will was read, which gave the hou[s]e, land, cattle, plate, furniture, &c. to Tabitha Holdfa[s]t, in con[s]ideration of her more than [s]i[s]terly kindne[s]s," Dr. Lenient intimating, that he expected [s]he would make a fair and equitable divi[s]ion of the whole with Rachel, in compliance with what he under[s]tood to be the intention of the te[s]tator from his la[s]t words, [s]he calmly replied. "Friend Lenient, I am not accountable for what thou maye[s]t have under[s]tood. I am certain our dear departed brother Hezekiah---" And here the handkerchief vi[s]ited her eyes; but it returned Dry as the chaff, which, flitting in the wind, Too light to be depre[s]s'd by trifling [s]howers, Defies the bla[s]t, and flutters o'er the heath; Or, like the downy plumage of the [s]wan, White and un[s]ullied.--- "I am certain," [s]he continued, "he meant not the participation thou woulde[s]t in[s]inuate; for when (ever eager to interpret and prevent his wi[s]hes) I mentioned giving her fifty or [s]ixty guineas, he [s]aid, "Give her half;" and by his dying words I [s]hall mo[s]t [s]urely abide." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-235.jpg) \- external link  - Page 226. ] "He meant to [s]ay," cried the Doctor vehemently, "that you [s]hould give her half of all he died po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of." "It may be to thy advantage, friend, ([s]aid [s]he sneeringly) to have his la[s]t will [s]o under[s]tood. The singular attentions of one of thy relatives to Rachel has not pa[s][s]ed unnoticed; and I think thy family is remarkable for promoting its own intere[s]t at the expen[s]e of others." It was a reproach too pointed to be mi[s]under[s]tood; but it [s]prung from a mind [s]o deba[s]ed, that it was beneath notice. The Doctor took his hat, and wi[s]hed Tabitha a good night. Rachel aro[s]e to light him to the door. "My good, dear girl," [s]aid he, "I would [s]ain have procured from this woman a [s]mall independence for you; but it is in vain to flatter you with the idea. But this give me leave to [s]ay, Should you not hear from your brother, and your re[s]idence with dame Tabitha becomes painful, I have a home. My [s]i[s]ter and myself both po[s][s]e[s]s hearts, which I thank God are not yet quite petri[s]ied." Saying which, he [s]hook her hand and left her. Rachel [s]oon perceived the full extent of her unhappy [s]ituation. The morning after the interment of her uncle, Tabitha paid her thirty guineas, and from that moment [s]he found that [s]he was looked upon as an intruder in the family. Rachel was not of a [s]pirit to brook the cold hauteur of Tabitha. Nor could [s]he think of availing her[s]elf of the kind offer of Dr. Lenient. For, be[s]ides that [s]he [s]hrunk from the weight of obligation, [s]he al[s]o felt there would be an impropriety in her [s]eeking an a[s]ylum in the family of Hamden Auberry. She was not insensible to his merit, nor had [s]he li[s]tened unmoved to the expre[s][s]ions of attachment that had [s]ometimes accidentally e[s]caped his lips. For Hamden knew he [s]hould have many ob[s]tacles to encounter, [s]hould he give way to a pa[s][s]ion for a woman in the [s]tate of life in which fortune had placed Rachel. Lady Anne would never [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-236.jpg) \- external link  - Page 227. ] be brought to approve of his allying him[s]elf to a per[s]on, who had neither rank or wealth to recommend her. Rachel [s]aw the [s]truggle of his mind, and, attributing that to pride which was only the effect of caution, resolved never to intrude her[s]elf into a family which would look upon her connexion as degrading to its principal branch. Having therefore formed a plan for her future conduct, Rachel took an affectionate leave of the worthy Doctor and his [s]i[s]ter, and a very cool one of Tabitha, and departed in the [s]tage-coach for London, re[s]olving to con[s]ult and advi[s]e with her friend Jeffy Oliver, in regard to her executing the [s]cheme [s]he had thought of for her [s]ub[s]i[s]tence till [s]he [s]hould hear from Reuben. Mrs. Auberry gave her a letter to a reputable family, with whom [s]he propo[s]ed to board. Hamden was ab[s]ent at the time of Rachel's departure on a fi[s]hing party, and on his return, his mother merely informed him that Mi[s]s Dudley was gone to London; but wishing to put a [s]top to any further intimacy between them, [s]he did not mention with whom [s]he would re[s]ide, or how long her [s]tay might probably be in the metropolis; and as he was engaged to pa[s]s the autumn with lady Anne in Scotland, he was not [s]o inqui[s]itive as he might otherwi[s]e have been. Rachel got [s]afe to the end of her journey without meeting with any adventure on the road. But unaccustomed to travelling, [s]he was greatly fatigued; and when [s]he entered the bu[s]y [s]treets of London, the noi[s]e, confu[s]ion and hurry made her head giddy; the disagreeable effluvia too, which a[s][s]ailed her olfactory herves as [s]he alighted from the coach in a very clo[s]e lane in the city, turned her extremely [s]ick, and [s]he would have fallen, had not a [s]pruce young man, who was waiting for another coach to arrive, caught her by the arm, and led her into the hou[s]e, where a few drops and water revived her, and [s]he began to inquire for a conveyance in which [s]he might proceed to her lodgings. A hackney-coach was [s]ent for, and while [s]he waited for it, the young man re-entered the parlour where [s]he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-237.jpg) \- external link  - Page 228. ] was [s]itting, introducing a middle-aged woman, dressed to the extremity of the fa[s]hion. "Walk in and [s]it down, Mi[s]s La Varone," [s]aid he, "I will order the negus immediately." Then turning to our heroine, he continued, "And how do you find your[s]elf now, ma'am?" "Much better, Sir, I thank you," [s]aid Rachel. "Have you been [s]ick, ma'am?" [s]aid Mi[s]s La Varone. "I am not u[s]ed to travelling, and was rather faint when I fir[s]t alighted; but it was only fatigue, and the air of London is not quite [s]o pure as that I have been accu[s]tomed to from my infancy." "Oh dear me! I don't wonder, ma'am, if you never were in London before, that it made you [s]ick. Then this lane is [s]o clo[s]e; and I prote[s]t it made me as [s]ick as could be. But pray, ma'am, to what part of the town are you going? Perhaps one coach will [s]erve us both." Rachel looked at the direction in her memorandum book, and Mi[s]s La Varone exclaimed, "Well, as I'm alive, we are both going to the [s]ame place. Mr. Spriggins, this young lady is going to your aunt's." Rachel knew but little of the world in general, and le[s]s of London than almo[s]t any other place; yet there was a [s]omething within her, a kind of native rectitude, that told her not to be too ea[s]y in agreeing to the proposal of the [s]trangers who [s]aid they would all go to Mrs. Web[s]ter's together. Yet her politene[s]s and good-nature was [s]uch, as would not [s]uffer her to repul[s]e them rudely. Be[s]ides, there was [s]omething in the appearance of La Varone, however familiar her addre[s]s had been, that prepo[s][s]e[s][s]ed her in her favour. She was a [s]mall, delicate woman; her pale countenance, the features of which were extremely regular, was ornamented by an animated pair of black eyes, and long, dark eye-la[s]hes. Her dre[s]s, it is true, was in Rachel's opinion rather too gay; but [s]he was totally unacquainted with the [s]tyle of dre[s]s that might be fashionable in London, and therefore pa[s][s]ed this circum[s]tance the more ea[s]ily over. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-238.jpg) \- external link  - Page 229. ] Finding it impo[s][s]ible to [s]eparate her[s]elf from her new acquaintances, [s]he contented her[s]elf with giving the hackney-coachman particular in[s]tructions where to carry her, and in le[s]s than half an hour found herself at Mrs. Web[s]ter's, in Dartmouth-[s]treet, Westminster. Mr. Spriggins, (who was [s]hopman to a [s]ilk mercer in the vicinity of St. James's Park) boarded with his aunt, and Mi[s]s La Varone occupied the [s]econd floor of the hou[s]e. Rachel begged an early cup of tea, and then retired to the apartment prepared for her; where wearied nature was refre[s]hed by [s]everal hours of profound [s]leep. But the fatigue which had accelerated her repo[s]e, gradually giving way to its effects, her [s]lumbers became lighter, and about three o'clock, [s]he became sensible of the (to her) unu[s]ual noi[s]es that [s]urrounded her. The hollow voices of the watchmen, the rattling of coaches and carts, the riotous mirth of intemperate wretches of both [s]exes, who, under the black veil of night, prowled through the [s]treets in [s]earch of prey; all together [s]truck on the a[s]toni[s]hed ears of our heroine, who, not immediately recollecting where [s]he was, [s]prang out of bed, exclaiming, "Heavens! what is the matter?" However, as Rachel was not troubled with weak nerves, and had in general great pre[s]ence of mind, [s]he pre[s]ently grew collected, remembered [s]he was in London, returned to her bed, and endeavoured to obtain another vi[s]it from the leadenwinged god. He li[s]tened, and was propitious to her entreaties, and at eight o'clock the following morning [s]he continued [s]till locked in his embraces. Vi[s]its---Curio[s]ities. The [s]cene of life into which Rachel had now entered was every way new to her. Her intentions in avoiding the family of Dr. Lenient on account [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-239.jpg) \- external link  - Page 230. ] of young Auberry were laudable; but her open and ingenuous nature, fearle[s]s of guile, becau[s]e intending none, was not competent to the ta[s]k [s]he had undertaken. Humane, generous, and credulous in the extreme, [s]he felt that every human being had a claim upon her affection; and willingly allowing that claim to others, [s]he readily believed every profe[s][s]ion of friendship made to her[s]elf. Mrs. Web[s]ter was a woman of moderate understanding, devoid of knowledge, and with a very [s]mall [s]hare of curio[s]ity, and being a widow with three girls, the elde[s]t of which was but [s]ixteen, [s]he had to work extremely hard at her bu[s]ine[s]s, which was that of a hoop-petticoat maker, to [s]upport her family. From [s]uch a woman, Rachel had nothing either to hope or apprehend. She enjoyed from the effects of her care a very neat apartment, and regular decent meals; but as to any idea of a companion, it was entirely out of the que[s]tion. The daughters were young, and their minds totally uninformed; they were of con[s]equence unfit [s]ociety for her. To whom therefore could [s]he look to enliven her [s]olitude by cheerful conver[s]ation? Mi[s]s La Varone had read a great deal, though not in mo[s]t in[s]tructive authors. She had a con[s]iderable degree of [s]uperficial knowledge, was chatty, good-humoured, and [s]tudious to render her[s]elf agreeable. She became the con[s]tant companion of Rachel, and was unfortunately the mo[s]t improper companion [s]he could have cho[s]en. Mi[s]s La Varone was the daughter of a Swi[s]s valet, who, having [s]aved a con[s]iderable [s]um of money in the [s]ervice of a nobleman, and received a legacy at his death, married the lady's maid, and opened a perfumery and toy-[s]hop, in which he [s]ucceeded extremely well; e[s]pecially when his daughter grew old enough to attend the cu[s]tomers, her pretty face and lively manner acting as a tali[s]man to draw young men of fa[s]hion thither. But human happine[s]s is futile! A fire broke out in the neighbourhood, and their hou[s]e was con[s]umed among[s]t a number of others, and as their property [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-240.jpg) \- external link  - Page 231. ] was not in[s]ured, a few hours reduced them from a [s]tate of competence to ab[s]olute beggary. The old man received a hurt, in endeavouring to [s]ave part of his [s]tock, which he did not long [s]urvive. The mother again went to [s]ervice, and procured employment for her daughter in the [s]ame family. The elde[s]t [s]on of this family was plea[s]ed with her; offered her a settlement; and at the age of eighteen, La Varone quitted the protection of her mother, to accept that of a libertine. Her mother had perhaps a higher [s]en[s]e of virtue than per[s]ons in her [s]ituation are in general supposed to po[s][s]e[s]s. She remon[s]trated, entreated, endeavoured by every po[s][s]ible means to reclaim her; but finding all equally ineffectual, renounced her. And though [s]he had, without murmuring, returned to her original way of life, and [s]ubmitted patiently to the privation of tho[s]e comforts [s]he had many years enjoyed, and which had been the fruits of her own industry, yet [s]he could not meet [s]hame without repining. Her child's di[s]honour [s]unk deep into her heart, and in a very [s]hort time put a period to her exi[s]tence. La Varone continued with her admirer till he married; [s]he then removed from all her former connexions, into the hou[s]e where our heroine was now become an inmate. She had been an ea[s]y conque[s]t; her [s]ettlement was con[s]equently not large. However, [s]he kept up a genteel appearance, and frequently received vi[s]its from an elderly gentleman, a cou[s]in, who was a member of parliament. She [s]aw but little company be[s]ides; but [s]he would expatiate for an hour on the charms of retirement; [s]o her living [s]o reclu[s]e was not [s]urpri[s]ing. Her favourite amu[s]ement was a play, and [s]ometimes little excur[s]ions in the country, where [s]he would [s]tay four or five days at a time. The day after Rachel's arrival in London was devoted to re[s]t. Mi[s]s La Varone was extremely attentive, invited her to take tea in her apartment, where Mr. Spriggins al[s]o attended, and the elder Mi[s]s Webster. Here they talked of the many curio[s]ities to be [s]een in London. We[s]tmin[s]ter Abbey, St. Paul's Cathedral, the Monument, the Tower, the Palace; all [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-241.jpg) \- external link  - Page 232. ] which Mi[s]s La Varone [s]aid they mu[s]t po[s]itively vi[s]it, and the gentleman offered very politely to be their gallant. Rachel was not devoid of curio[s]ity. She had come up to the metropolis with the be[s]t re[s]olutions in the world, and Mrs. Auberry, when [s]he recommended her to Mrs. Web[s]ter's to board, thought [s]he had rendered her young friend a very acceptable piece of service. But [s]he never reflected, that twenty-five years make a mo[s]t amazing difference in the manners and di[s]po[s]ition of a per[s]on, e[s]pecially if in that period they have [s]uffered much affliction, and from narrow circumstances being unavoidably thrown into the [s]ociety of people, who[s]e educations having been circumscribed, are often the [s]laves of contracted, low ideas and illiberal prejudices; and it frequently happens, that tho[s]e who are obliged to work ince[s][s]antly for the support of their families, being wholly occupied in the hope of bettering their fortune, become inattentive to appearances, and overlook actions, which earlier in life would have [s]truck them with horror. This was literally the ca[s]e with Mrs. Web[s]ter. The Mrs. Webster whom Mrs. Auberry knew [s]o many years [s]ince, and [s]he to who[s]e care [s]he now recommended her young friend, were as oppo[s]ite in per[s]on, manner, and way of thinking, as if it had not been the [s]ame, but two di[s]tinct people. The [s]econd morning, Rachel took a hackney-coach, and drove to the hou[s]e of Mr. Oliver, in the vicinity of St. James's. She was [s]till in mourning; a grey tabby night-gown, with black cuffs and robins, a plain lawn cap, apron, handkerchief, and ruffles, was the dre[s]s in which [s]he prepared to vi[s]it her friend Je[s][s]y. But a woman thus habited and in a hackney-coach was not likely to challenge much attention from the gay lackeys who waited in the hall of Mr. Oliver. "Is Mi[s]s Oliver at home, friend?" [s]aid [s]he to the footman who came to the door. A [s]urly No! was all the an[s]wer [s]he received, and the man was again [s]hutting the door. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-242.jpg) \- external link  - Page 233. ] "Is [s]he expected home [s]oon?" [s]aid [s]he, putting her hand out to prevent it from clo[s]ing. "I know nothing about it," [s]aid the fellow. Rachel had de[s]cended from the carriage before the coachman had knocked for admittance, and was standing on the upper [s]tep of a flight of [s]tone [s]tairs which led up on each [s]ide from the [s]treet. Her figure had attracted the eyes of Archibald, who was at home at this time, and [s]eated in a front parlour window, killing time with a political pamphlet. Hearing her voice at the door, and under[s]tanding from the tone of the servant's voice that he was not an[s]wering in a very civil manner, he opened the parlour door ju[s]t as [s]he was turning to de[s]cend the [s]teps. "You were inquiring for Mi[s]s Oliver, madam," [s]aid he; "[s]he is at pre[s]ent out of town, but I expect to [s]ee her to-morrow. Who [s]hall I tell her did her the honour to call?" "My name is Dudley," [s]aid Rachel. "Dudley! is it po[s][s]ible; the [s]i[s]ter of my friend Reuben?" "The [s]ame!" "How happy I am, Mi[s]s Dudley! Give me leave to wait on you to your place of re[s]idence. I wi[s]h to a[s]k after your brother; I have al[s]o [s]ome intere[s]ting intelligence to communicate to you concerning my [s]i[s]ter." He [s]aid this as he handed her to the coach. Then calling for his hat, before Rachel could collect her[s]elf [s]ufficiently to refu[s]e or accept his propo[s]al, he was [s]eated in the carriage be[s]ide her, and inquired where he [s]hould order it to be driven. "Perhaps, my dear Mi[s]s," [s]aid young Oliver as the coach drove off, "you may think it particular that I did not pre[s]s you to enter my father's hou[s]e. But to confe[s]s a mortifying truth, neither Je[s][s]y nor my[s]elf are allowed to take any more liberties there than we [s]hould be in the hou[s]e of an entire [s]tranger. My poor father is ruled entirely by Mrs. Oliver, and his children have but a [s]econdary place in his affections." "Pray make no apologies, Mr. Oliver," [s]aid Rachel, having a little recovered from the flutter into [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-243.jpg) \- external link  - Page 234. ] which his apparently odd conduct had thrown her; "apologies are quite needle[s]s. I had no wi[s]h to enter the hou[s]e except my dear Je[s][s]y had been an inmate of it. But you [s]aid you had [s]ome intere[s]ting intelligence." "True, but before I enter on it, tell me, when did you hear from your brother?" "I have not received the lea[s]t intelligence from him [s]ince he left England; and [s]ometimes I fear---" Rachel's eyes filled; her bo[s]om heaved. "Oh do not fear," [s]aid Oliver, re[s]pectfully taking her hand: "Letters may mi[s]carry; you will no doubt hear [s]oon. But apropos of Je[s][s]y; has [s]he not written to you lately? I under[s]tood you corre[s]ponded." "We did; but I have not received a letter from her for nearly two months pa[s]t." "Poor Je[s][s]y, [s]he had nothing plea[s]ant to employ her pen, and [s]he always had an aver[s]ion to endeavouring to lighten her own [s]orrows by impo[s]ing a recital of them on the attention of others." He then proceeded to inform her, that his [s]i[s]ter had unfortunately (as it proved) been [s]ingled out by a nobleman of elevated rank and [s]plendid fortune, as the per[s]on with whom he wi[s]hed to [s]hare tho[s]e advantages. He [s]olicited her hand, was encouraged by both Mr. and Mrs. Oliver, but re[s]olutely rejected by Je[s][s]y her[s]elf. "My father," continued he, "who (as I mentioned before) has no will but his wife's, has [s]ent the poor girl into the country, debarring her of all [s]ociety, and declaring [s]he [s]hall [s]tay there till [s]he accepts his Lordship; and I, who know her di[s]po[s]ition, think that sentence is tantamount to [s]aying [s]he [s]hall [s]tay there as long as [s]he lives." "She is right to per[s]evere in rejecting him," [s]aid Rachel, "if [s]he does not feel her heart [s]ufficiently attached to him to incline her to [s]hare his pains and plea[s]ures through life. For of all the mi[s]eries that can be endured by a human being, [s]ure none can be [s]o severe as being obliged to [s]ubmit to the whims and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-244.jpg) \- external link  - Page 235. ] caprices (for we all have them) of a per[s]on to whom we are perfectly indifferent." Oliver gazed at her, as [s]he thus, with unaffected freedom, delivered her [s]entiments on a [s]ubject, which the generality of tho[s]e young women with whom he was acquainted would have blu[s]hed only to have heard mentioned. But Rachel was entirely free from affectation of every kind; [s]he had no idea, but that a woman might [s]peak on the [s]ubjects of love and marriage, without [s]impering, blu[s]hing, and fifty other little fooli[s]h prettine[s][s]es. Nor did [s]he feel the lea[s]t embarrassed in conver[s]ing with a per[s]on of the oppo[s]ite [s]ex; for it had never entered her head, that every man who [s]aw her mu[s]t fall in love with her, or that they could not pa[s]s an hour in her company without entertaining her with prai[s]es of her wit and beauty, and complaints of their own hopele[s]s pa[s][s]ion. When the coach therefore [s]topped, and Rachel asked him to walk in, he eagerly availed him[s]elf of the invitation; and after [s]itting with her till [s]he was summoned to dinner, left her, impre[s][s]ed with [s]o high an opinion of her under[s]tanding, that he thought her the mo[s]t [s]uperior woman he had ever known. She had promi[s]ed to entru[s]t him with a letter to her friend Jessy, and he was determined to call for it him[s]elf, that he might enjoy another half hour of her [s]ociety. But in this he was di[s]appointed; for immediately after dinner, Rachel wrote her letter, and leaving it with Mrs. Web[s]ter in ca[s]e it [s]hould be [s]ent for before her return, [s]he took one of the little girls with her, and walked to the hou[s]e of Mr. Andrew Atkins, in Lincoln's-Inn, hoping to hear [s]ome tidings of Reuben, and al[s]o to inquire how long it would be before [s]he might expect to receive any money on account of the e[s]tate in Lanca[s]hire. Being [s]hewn into a parlour, and having [s]ent up her name, the was de[s]ired to wait till Mr. Atkins had dined, when he would wait on her immediately. In about an hour, he appeared, accompanied by the identical [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-245.jpg) \- external link  - Page 236. ] Mr. Allibi who had vi[s]ited her[s]elf and brother in the country. Rachel ro[s]e from her [s]eat. "Servant, Mi[s]s," [s]aid Mr. Atkins, [s]lightly bowing, and without a[s]king her to re[s]ume her [s]eat. "Pray what may be your commands with me?" "I wi[s]h to know whether you have had any intelligence from my brother [s]ince his departure from England." "Intelligence? No indeed! I wonder you [s]hould think of my hearing from him; his going to America was a wild-goo[s]e [s]cheme. What does he expect to get there?" "He expects to take po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of his father's e[s]tate, which he purcha[s]ed in Penn[s]ylvania." "P[s]haw! p[s]haw! Dudley made no purcha[s]e there worth inquiring after. An uncultivated tract of land, with a paltry hou[s]e upon it, which my very good friend and corre[s]pondent, Mr. Jacob Holmes, has informed me is entirely fallen down." "Jacob Holmes, did you [s]ay?" cried Rachel in breathle[s]s agitation. "Why that is the very man my father mentions in his letter to have left in charge of his e[s]tate. He was brought up in my father's hou[s]e. Can he advance [s]uch an untruth, when he mu[s]t be conscious---?" "Come, come, Mi[s]s Dudley, don't [s]peak again[s]t Mr. Holmes; he is a very worthy, hone[s]t man. Your father lived in a very expen[s]ive [s]tyle in Philadelphia, [s]pent a great deal of money, more a great deal than he ought. Even the trifling purcha[s]e he did make of land was not half paid for." "Sir! Sir!" cried Rachel, waving her hand with dignity, "I mu[s]t not hear the memory of my father treated with di[s]re[s]pect. You may have been taught to believe what you now a[s][s]ert; or, perhaps, (darting an indignant look at him) your profe[s][s]ion accu[s]toms you confidently to a[s][s]ert what you do not believe to be true. Be that as it may, I [s]ee my brother and my[s]elf are two unprotected orphans." Here her cheeks assumed a pallid hue, her lips trembled, and [s]he was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-246.jpg) \- external link  - Page 237. ] unable to proceed; and though the unfeeling Atkins had kept her [s]tanding while he [s]poke to her, her agitation was now [s]o great, that [s]he was obliged to [s]it down, or [s]he would have fallen. "As I would wi[s]h to [s]ave you the unnece[s][s]ary trouble of calling on me again, I have brought Mr. Allibi, who fortunately was dining with me, to give you any information you may require concerning the Lancashire bu[s]ine[s]s." "I am [s]orry, my fair lady," [s]aid Allibi, "that it is not in my power to give you [s]uch information as you may perhaps expect; but [s]o many unexpected demands have been made, that I hardly think the e[s]tate will ever be able to recover it[s]elf. I have here (drawing a memorandum book from his pocket) [s]ome few memorandums of the [s]tate of the affairs at pre[s]ent. Whenever you [s]hall require it, Mi[s]s Dudley, I will lay a regular [s]tatement of the accounts before you, and [s]ubmit the whole of our proceedings to your investigation." Rachel felt that this [s]eeming integrity was an in[s]ult to her under[s]tanding. A[s][s]uming, therefore, an appearance of fortitude that [s]he was far from feeling, [s]he exerted her[s]elf to ri[s]e from her [s]eat. "Good Mr. Allibi," [s]aid [s]he, conveying as much acrimony into her looks and manner, as it was po[s][s]ible for her voice and features to expre[s]s, "of what service will it be for me to examine or inve[s]tigate tho[s]e accounts? Did you, or your re[s]pectable client, Mr. Andrew Atkins, imagine me competent to the ta[s]k, you would never have [s]o readily offered it. But I am a woman---an orphan; young, inexperienced, unprotected; and even [s]uppo[s]ing I could di[s]cover errors, who is there to [s]upport my a[s][s]ertions? I am poor, and I can plainly perceive, you have inclination as well as rea[s]ons for keeping me [s]o. Oh that my injured brother were but here!" "You [s]peak pointedly, Mi[s]s Dudley," [s]aid Atkins. "I [s]peak as I feel," replied Rachel. "But you are too warm, my fair lady," [s]aid Allibi. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-247.jpg) \- external link  - Page 238. ] "Pardon me," cried Rachel, "I do not think I am warm enough. Oh! that I could find words adequate to the indignation of my [s]oul! Do not misunderstand me; for my[s]elf I am but little concerned. I have an innocent mind that can be humble when required, and hands that are not u[s]ele[s]s. But my brother is in a [s]trange land; for him I feel a thou[s]and fears. My father's memory has been traduced; on that subject, my feelings are too powerful for utterance. If my ra[s]h judgment wrongs you, gentlemen, Heaven pardon the error. For I leave you in the full persuasion, that on whichever [s]ide the wrong is, the great Redre[s][s]er of injuries, the righteous Father of the oppressed, will impartially judge between us. By his [s]entence we mu[s]t abide, and to him in humble confidence I [s]ubmit my cau[s]e." As [s]he fini[s]hed [s]peaking, [s]he hurried out of the hou[s]e, to prevent their being witne[s]s to emotions which [s]he was unable longer to [s]uppre[s]s; and [s]he found herself in the [s]quare oppo[s]ite Newca[s]tle hou[s]e, before [s]he was [s]ufficiently collected to remember to what part of the town [s]he was going. Polly Web[s]ter, who had [s]hewn her the way to Atkins's, had left her at the door, as [s]he had [s]ome errands to execute for her mother in the Strand. Our heroine had imagined [s]he [s]hould ea[s]ily find her way home again; but when [s]he found her[s]elf in a place with which [s]he was wholly unacquainted, and endeavoured in vain to recover recollection [s]ufficient to guide her to the right road, [s]he began to be unea[s]y. She wi[s]hed for a coach, but there was not one came near her but what was previou[s]ly occupied. She walked [s]traight forward through a narrow pa[s][s]age, which [s]he imagined [s]he had pa[s][s]ed through before; it took her into High-Holborn. The throng of people, the multitude of carriages, and appearance of the [s]hops, led her to think [s]he was in the Strand; and turning to the right hand, [s]he pur[s]ued her way, expecting every moment to reach Charing-Cro[s]s. But as [s]he proceeded, [s]he began to perceive the difference of the [s]urrounding objects, and became [s]eriou[s]ly alarmed. A heavy [s]hower appeared threatening in the air, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-248.jpg) \- external link  - Page 239. ] and even at Holborn-Bars, Rachel could not procure a coach. The lightning had for [s]ome time gleamed in the horizon; the thunder which had rolled distantly now came nearer, and an univer[s]al war of elements [s]eemed approaching. Rachel looked round with increasing apprehen[s]ion. The tempe[s]t now bur[s]t forth at once; wind, thunder, hail, and [s]heets of liquid fire, rendered the [s]cene tremendous. To avoid the fury of the [s]torm, Rachel ran up an entry which led to a large old-fa[s]hioned man[s]ion, and though not ea[s]ily terrified, the late incidents had [s]o oppre[s][s]ed her [s]pirits, that [s]he [s]at down on the [s]teps, and bur[s]t into an hy[s]terical flood of tears. "What is the matter, woman?" [s]aid a man who was coming from the hou[s]e. The brutal tone of this addre[s]s, the ferocious appearance of the fellow that uttered it, was an additional cau[s]e of terror. She ro[s]e, endeavoured to [s]peak, but could not; and when [s]he attempted to walk, her limbs failed her, and [s]he [s]unk again upon the [s]tep. "Why, mi[s]tre[s]s, you have taken a little too much cordial to-day," [s]aid the [s]ame man; "but come, I'll lead you down the pa[s][s]age, and then you mu[s]t go on as well as you can; for you can't [s]tay here." Rachel, though overcome with terror, was perfectly [s]en[s]ible. She heard the remark made on her apparent helple[s][s]ne[s]s, endeavoured to repel the violence of her emotions, and exert that fortitude of which [s]he was po[s][s]e[s][s]ed. "I merely came here for [s]helter from the [s]torm," [s]aid [s]he; "and if I could procure a coach---" "Well, mi[s]tre[s]s," [s]aid a dirty, ragged boy, "if you will give me a [s]hilling, I will call you one." Rachel readily agreed to the propo[s]al, and was putting her hand to her pocket, when there was a cry in the crowd that was now gathered, that a pick-pocket was among[s]t them. A young naval officer [s]aid he had lo[s]t his watch and pur[s]e. `Keep all in, keep all in,' was the cry, and the throng ru[s]hed up the pa[s][s]age, [s]o that Rachel found her[s]elf in an in[s]tant [s]urrounded by a motley group of people, the chief part of which but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-249.jpg) \- external link  - Page 240. ] to have been obliged to [s]peak to, would have filled her at once with terror and di[s]gu[s]t. But what were her sensations, when, putting her hand again to her pocket, [s]he found a [s]trange pur[s]e hanging partly out, and felt a watch actually within it. Before [s]he could [s]peak, a woman [s]eized her arm, and holding her hand [s]o that [s]he could not withdraw it, [s]he cried that [s]he had found the thief, Rachel's [s]trength and [s]pirits now at once for[s]ook her; [s]he fetched a deep [s]igh, and fell [s]en[s]ele[s]s into the arms of the per[s]on who had been robbed. "The poor creature is ill," [s]aid he; "[s]tand away, ruffians, and let her have air." Then carrying her to the entrance of the pa[s][s]age, he pu[s]hed back her hat, and untied her cloak. Her extreme youth, her beauty, the neatne[s]s of her apparel, all con[s]pired to prepo[s][s]e[s]s him in her favour. "Had you not better [s]end for a con[s]table?" [s]aid the wretch who had pretended to detect her. "No," [s]aid the officer; "I do not think [s]he can be guilty; or if [s]he is, extreme nece[s][s]ity alone could have driven her to [s]uch an expedient. How are you, ma'am?" [s]eeing Rachel begin to revive. She looked wildly round her, put her hand to her head as though endeavouring to recollect why or how [s]he came there. At length the circum[s]tances recurring to her memory, [s]he looked [s]tedfa[s]tly on the officer, and then on her accu[s]er. "You have been robbed, Sir," [s]aid [s]he, "and your property found in my po[s][s]e[s][s]ion. How it came there, Heaven knows; but as I [s]tand in the [s]ight of Him who rules the heavens, I do prote[s]t I am innocent." The [s]olemnity of the appeal, the con[s]cious innocence of her heart, which beamed from her eyes and informed every feature of her face, rendered the truth of her a[s][s]ertion indi[s]putable. "I do believe you," [s]aid the officer; "but even had I thought you guilty, what is the in[s]ignificant value of the[s]e trifles, when put in competition with the life of a fellow-creature, whom di[s]tre[s]s urges to actions from which the [s]oul recoils." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-250.jpg) \- external link  - Page 241. ] The [s]torm was by this time much abated, and Rachel having [s]ent again to procure a coach, the officer [s]aid he would not leave her till he delivered her in [s]afety to her friends. He was [s]tanding at the entrance of the pa[s][s]age, holding the hand of our heroine, when a po[s]t chariot, that was driving ha[s]tily through Holborn, being for a moment impeded by a number of carts and carriages, [s]topped directly oppo[s]ite where they [s]tood. The gla[s]s was let down, and Rachel [s]aw di[s]tinctly Hamden Auberry, [s]eated be[s]ide an elderly lady. She al[s]o was certain, that he both [s]aw and recognized her. The blood for a moment for[s]ook her cheeks, and then returned with impetuo[s]ity, dying them of the deepe[s]t crim[s]on. Scarcely was there time to exchange the glance of recognition, before the chariot moved forward again, and a hackney-coach drawing up to the door, [s]he [s]tepped into it, and, accompanied by her protector, drove towards Dartmouth-street. On their arrival at Mrs. Web[s]ters, Rachel found the family in great con[s]ternation at her long ab[s]ence (for Polly having returned without her, had been dispatched again by her mother, who [s]eared Rachel might lo[s]e her way; and learning that [s]he had been gone [s]ome time from Atkins's, had returned as quick as [s]he could, in the hope of finding her [s]afe at home). Mi[s]s La Varone welcomed her with tears of joy, and Mrs. Web[s]ter [s]aid [s]he was glad to [s]ee her [s]afe. Courtney, (the name of the young officer) without particularly mentioning the circum[s]tances, [s]aid [s]he had been di[s]agreeably [s]ituated, and he had been fortunate enough to be of [s]ervice to her. But Rachel would explain the whole; her new friend, Mi[s]s La Varone, [s]ympathized with her, trembled with terror, glowed with indignation, or melted with gratitude, as the recital proceeded; and in the end, [s]aid [s]o many obliging things to Lieutenant Courtney, that he began to think her more than agreeable; and overlooking the charms of our heroine, which had nothing but nature and [s]implicity to recommend them, he was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-251.jpg) \- external link  - Page 242. ] powerfully attracted by the artful lures thrown out by La Varone. The [s]ituation of Rachel, in regard to reputation, was now as dangerous as it was po[s][s]ible; for Courtney claimed the privilege of vi[s]iting her; and Archibald Oliver, when he returned from the country, and his [s]i[s]ter, called to deliver the an[s]wer to the letter he had taken, and one vi[s]it led to another, till [s]carcely a day elap[s]ed without his pa[s][s]ing [s]ome hours in her company. Rachel's intentions, when [s]he fir[s]t came to London, were to apprentice her[s]elf to [s]ome per[s]on who could in[s]truct her in [s]ome laudable employment, whereby [s]he might render her[s]elf independent. For in her opinion, the per[s]on who by the exertion of any talent, or the exerci[s]e of indu[s]try, could [s]upport them[s]elves, was in every [s]en[s]e of the word as independent as they who inherited wealth or titles from their ance[s]tors. But the[s]e prai[s]eworthy re[s]olutions were from time to time put off, and her attention diverted to other objects, till [s]he began to perceive the [s]mall [s]um of money [s]he brought with her to London was very vi[s]ibly dimini[s]hed, and yet no plan put in execution, by which it could be repleni[s]hed. `I mu[s]t do [s]omething to-morrow,' [s]aid Rachel every night as [s]he laid her head on her pillow. But to-morrow came, and La Varone had ever [s]ome new [s]cheme of plea[s]ure to propo[s]e. Juvenile indi[s]cretion united with curiosity, and a love of amu[s]ement, natural to youth, led her on from one day to another, till the la[s]t ten pound note was broken in upon. Forbear, ye rigid, ye experienced matrons, to blame our heroine; it is the particular ble[s][s]ing of youth to be enabled to enjoy the pre[s]ent moment, forgetful of the pa[s]t, nor fearing the future. Then cen[s]ure not tho[s]e who eagerly gather the ro[s]es, unmindful of the briars that [s]urround them, or who, delighted with their beauty and fragrance, forget, in the enjoyment of their [s]weets, the pain they [s]uffered in gathering them. Je[s][s]y Oliver had written to her, had endeavoured to advi[s]e and comfort her; but Je[s][s]y [s]tood in need of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-252.jpg) \- external link  - Page 243. ] advice and comfort her[s]elf; and our heroine, though con[s]cious that [s]he was not acting exactly right, could not [s]ummon re[s]olution [s]ufficient to combat inclination; but one party of plea[s]ure [s]ucceeded another, till [s]he almo[s]t lo[s]t the de[s]ire of employment, or the wi[s]h for independence. Variety---Court[s]hip---Elopement---Letters. When Hamden Auberry fir[s]t [s]aw Rachel at the entrance of the pa[s][s]age in Holborn, he hardly could tru[s]t his [s]en[s]es; but on letting down the gla[s]s and looking intently, he perceived it was no illusion, but in reality the woman whom he had thought the mo[s]t faultle[s]s, the mo[s]t perfect of her [s]ex. His heart [s]huddered; he dared not [s]top the chariot in which was his aunt, or he would have immediately jumped out, and learnt from her own lips the rea[s]on of her being in [s]uch a place; but before he could form any plau[s]ible pretext for quitting the carriage, it moved forward again with rapidity, and looking out of the open window, he [s]aw her go into the hackney-coach, accompanied by Courtney. If he at fir[s]t had imagined Rachel had voluntarily deviated from the path of rectitude, a moment's serious reflection made him reject the idea; and he began to be apprehen[s]ive that her innocence and inexperience might have betrayed her into [s]ociety and places, not altogether proper for a woman of character. But how could he [s]atisfy him[s]elf? Or [s]hould [s]he be [s]urrounded with danger, how could he di[s]cover her? how advi[s]e, or, if nece[s][s]ity required, protect her? Had he known where to find her, he would have ventured even to entreat his aunt to take her under her protection; but he had not the lea[s]t clue by which to trace her place of re[s]idence. He thought of writing to his mother, for information; but lady Anne [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-253.jpg) \- external link  - Page 244. ] purposed [s]taying in London but two days, and it was impossible to obtain an an[s]wer in that time. However, he did write, mentioning what he had [s]een, and requesting to be informed under who[s]e protection Mi[s]s Dudley was, hinting that he feared it was not what it ought to be, or [s]he could never have been in the situation in which he [s]aw her. On the day appointed, he accompanied his aunt into Scotland; where, [s]ituated on the fertile banks of the Clyde, was an antique family man[s]ion of lord Montmorill, her elder brother. Whil[s]t there, he received a letter from his mother, which [s]lightly mentioned that our heroine was well, and that the circum[s]tance he had observed, proceeded from her [s]tanding up to avoid a [s]hower. She hurried over the [s]ubject as lightly as po[s][s]ible; for [s]he [s]aw the growing pa[s][s]ion of Hamden, and knowing from experience the implacable tempers of the family, wi[s]hed to di[s]courage hopes which [s]he [s]aw he entertained, though again[s]t his own better rea[s]on. Rachel her[s]elf was far from being ea[s]y when [s]he thought of the incident, on the fir[s]t night after [s]eeing. Hamden; (for [s]he [s]eldom was allowed a moment for thought, except in the hours devoted to re[s]t) [s]he felt a plea[s]ure in reflecting he was in town. "I can [s]ee him now," [s]aid [s]he, "without incurring the illiberal reproofs of Tabitha." The heart of Rachel harboured not a wi[s]h or thought but what might have been made public to the whole world; and while [s]he was con[s]cious of its rectitude, [s]he felt proudly [s]uperior to the little prejudices of vulgar minds. She could not under[s]tand why [s]he might not conver[s]e with or entertain a friend[s]hip for per[s]ons of an oppo[s]ite [s]ex, as well as with tho[s]e of her own. She therefore indulged the hope, that Hamden would vi[s]it her during his [s]tay in London; but when day after day pa[s][s]ed on, and he did not appear, [s]he again thought pride had prompted the neglect, and calling all her own [s]elf-con[s]equence to her aid, [s]he endeavoured to think as little of him as he apparently thought of her. Young Courtney, the officer who under [s]uch favourable circum[s]tances was introduced to the reader [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-254.jpg) \- external link  - Page 245. ] in the preceding chapter, was the only [s]on of his mother, and [s]he was a widow. He had two [s]i[s]ters al[s]o, lovely, innocent and helple[s]s; their father had been a veteran [s]ailor, commander of a fir[s]t-rate man of war, in defending which from the enemy he lo[s]t his life. The pen[s]ion of a captain's widow at that period was very precarious, and at the be[s]t but trifling, to maintain three women who had been accu[s]tomed to ea[s]e and elegance. Courtney gave them all the a[s][s]i[s]tance in his power, and had often thought he would never marry until his [s]i[s]ters were [s]ettled in the world; and then if he could meet with a woman who could and would supply their place in attention to his mother. But unfortunately, a few days acquaintance with Mi[s]s La Varone, made him waver in his re[s]olutions. She could a[s][s]ume any character [s]he plea[s]ed. She di[s]covered that her per[s]onal charms had attracted the inexperienced [s]ailor. She wi[s]hed to marry, that [s]he might with impunity launch into extravagancies, which at pre[s]ent the fear of a jail alone debarred her from. La Varone, with a heart extremely depraved, possessed one virtue in an eminent degree. She was what the world in general calls extremely prudent , careful to pre[s]erve appearances, and where her own per[s]onal [s]afety or intere[s]t was concerned, cautious not to incur the [s]malle[s]t degree of danger. By nature fond of luxury, [s]how, and expen[s]ive plea[s]ures, [s]he had the art to [s]eem frugal, retired, and [s]tudious. She was [s]en[s]ible that at thirty years old, the [s]ea[s]on for conque[s]t was pa[s]t, and though [s]he did not own to more than five and twenty, and by particular attention to her complexion and dre[s]s, was not [s]u[s]pected to be more; yet [s]he thought if [s]he could [s]ecure a permanent establishment for her[s]elf before old age and neglect overtook her, it would be the wi[s]e[s]t [s]tep [s]he could po[s][s]ibly take. The name of Courtney was honourable, his per[s]on hand[s]ome, his manners agreeable, and his family unexceptionable. It was a conque[s]t worth [s]ome pains. La Varone artfully drew forth his [s]entiments in regard to the woman he might prefer for a wife, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-255.jpg) \- external link  - Page 246. ] appeared the very character his warm imagination and unadulterated heart had conceived as mo[s]t charming. She [s]poke of his mother with re[s]pectful affection, of his [s]i[s]ters with all the [s]ervour of enthu[s]ia[s]tic friend[s]hip; but if he mentioned her vi[s]iting them previous to their marriage, [s]he contrived to evade his solicitation; yet with [s]uch mode[s]ty, alleging [s]uch delicate motives for her re[s]u[s]al, that whil[s]t it oppo[s]ed his wi[s]hes increa[s]ed his love. Our heroine was equally with Courtney the dupe of La Varone, and rejoiced in the affection that subsisted between them; looking forward to their union, as a period that would at once in[s]ure their felicity, and [s]ecure to her[s]elf two [s]incere friends, in who[s]e protection [s]he [s]hould feel her[s]elf perfectly [s]afe till the arrival of her brother. During this interval of time, Rachel was frequently vi[s]ited by Archibald Oliver. He had at fir[s]t beheld her with admiration, li[s]tened to her with delight, and every en[s]uing interview had heightened tho[s]e sensations to a degree which almo[s]t might be termed adoration. But Archibald po[s][s]e[s][s]ed not a doit independent of his father, and that father he knew was, by his wife's extravagance, nearly ruined. Though volatile in his temper, eccentric in his ideas, and violent in his pa[s][s]ions, young Oliver was scrupulously honourable; and he would have deemed it the height of cruelty to engage the affections of a woman he could not with prudence marry, or to marry her when he could neither provide for her [s]upport, or for tho[s]e helple[s]s innocents of which he might become the father. And fearing to for[s]eit the highly valued privilege of vi[s]iting her, he confined his feelings within his own bo[s]om. "She loves me now," he would [s]ay, "like a brother; [s]hall I then, by claiming more, lo[s]e even the affection I po[s][s]e[s]s? No; I will adore her in [s]ilence, and pray that her felicity may be complete, though at the expen[s]e of my own." One morning he entered the parloun (where La Varone and our heroine u[s]ually [s]at at work) and seating him[s]elf be[s]ide the latter, told her he came to make [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-256.jpg) \- external link  - Page 247. ] her a partaker of his own unea[s]ine[s]s. "Our dear Je[s][s]y," continued he, "has left her father's protection, nor have we any idea whither the beloved fugitive is fled. Here is a note [s]he left for me; inclo[s]ed is a letter for you, Mi[s]s Dudley. The per[s]ecutions the [s]weet girl has lately undergone, I have concealed from you, becau[s]e, as you could not alleviate them, I wi[s]hed not to make you participate. But di[s]gui[s]e mu[s]t now be at an end. This was to have been her wedding day; but early in the morning it was di[s]covered [s]he was not in her apartment. The confu[s]ion this di[s]covery occasioned, reached me as I was preparing, with a desponding heart, to accompany the devoted victim to the altar; and as I was ru[s]hing out to inquire the cau[s]e (for my mind foreboded [s]omething fatal) the girl who usually attended on Je[s][s]y, came into my dre[s][s]ing-room, and in agitated [s]ilence put the[s]e papers into my hand, retiring the in[s]tant [s]he delivered them. I ha[s]tily tore my letter open; but it contained, as you will [s]ee, nothing [s]atisfactory. I learnt that a note had been delivered to my father, and wi[s]hing equally to avoid him, Mrs. Oliver, and the di[s]appointed bridegroom, I took a coach and drove directly here." The letter to Archibald was as follows. -  To E[s]q. WHEN the altar is decorated, the prie[s]ts at hand, and the knife is rai[s]ed, that will terminate exi[s]tence, who can blame the poor victim devoted to [s]acrifice, if it break the chain by which it is held, a[s][s]erts the privilege of nature, and, bounding over the plain, [s]ecures at once both life and liberty? Brother, beloved brother, they have prepared the altar, but the de[s]tined victim will e[s]cape their [s]nares. Deliver the inclo[s]ed to the friend of my [s]oul, Rachel Dudley; if [s]he contemn me, I will return a voluntary [s]acrifice. For [s]o pure is her mind, [s]o unprejudiced her opinions, [s]oaring [s]o far above the common herd, that I would abide by her deci[s]ion even in a cau[s]e of life and death. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-257.jpg) \- external link  - Page 248. ] Deare[s]t Archibald, though I am driven to the dreadful alternative of marrying the man I de[s]pi[s]e, or quitting the paternal roof, do not you for[s]ake our father. I [s]olicit, I conjure you, my brother, in the name of our [s]ainted mother, for[s]ake not our only remaining parent. I fear he will [s]oon, very [s]oon, [s]tand in need of a comforter. I will be con[s]tant in my inquiries concerning his welfare, and whenever I find my presence nece[s][s]ary to his peace or comfort, I will appear. Any thing but truth I would have [s]acrificed for his [s]ake. Could you [s]ee my heart at this moment, you would pity the angui[s]h I feel in bidding you adieu, perhaps forever. JESSY OLIVER. Rachel wiped off the tear this letter had extorted, and proceeded to peru[s]e the one addre[s][s]ed to her[s]elf. -  To Mi[s]s WILL my dear friend pardon me that I intrude my[s]elf upon her, and by explaining my [s]orrows, make her a party in my concerns? I have [s]uffered much per[s]ecution, dear Rachel, [s]ince we parted; and to avoid ru[s]hing at once into guilt and mi[s]ery, I have taken a [s]tep for which the world will cen[s]ure me. But what is the world to me? Had I voluntarily a[s][s]umed the [s]plendid [s]hackles prepared for me, had I become a titled wretch, and promi[s]ed faith and truth to one man, whil[s]t every wi[s]h, every tender thought of my heart was devoted to another, would the approving [s]miles of that misjudging world, the adulation it is ever ready to pay to [s]plendor and nobility, have compensated for the [s]acrifice I [s]hould have made of internal peace, of con[s]cious integrity? No.---Admired, courted, envied, I [s]hould [s]till have been mi[s]erable. The ba[s]ene[s]s of my conduct would be my daily reproach; I [s]hould have [s]ought to bani[s]h reflection by di[s][s]ipation, and who can tell where the career of guilt and folly might have [s]topped? I have endured both [s]tern commands and [s]oft entreaties; I have been [s]oothed and threatened alternately. That I might with more [s]ecurity follow the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-258.jpg) \- external link  - Page 249. ] plan I had previou[s]ly adopted for my future conduct, I pretended (Heaven pardon the deceit) to accept the hu[s]band my di[s][s]olute and ambitious mother-in-law had provided for me, and to-morrow morning I am expected to put on the Hymeneal yoke, and become a counte[s]s. But before the appointed hour arrives, I [s]hall be far, far out of the reach of their tyranny. Let not my [s]weet friend, who[s]e bo[s]om is the [s]acred temple of purity, [s]ear that I [s]hall forget what is due to myself. That I am [s]trongly attached to a worthy youth, I [s]eruple not to confe[s]s; but he is a [s]tranger to my pa[s][s]ion, and in all human probability will ever remain [s]o; for never will Je[s][s]y Oliver offer her[s]elf un[s]olicited to the acceptance of any man. My affections are pure as they are ardent; but the name of the object of them [s]hall never pa[s]s my lips, or e[s]cape my pen. I fly from proffered wealth and grandeur, to ob[s]curity; even from you, my dear Rachel, I will [s]eclude my[s]elf. Were I happy or affluent, you [s]hould be my cho[s]en companion, the partner of my heart. But I am the rever[s]e, and will [s]uffer alone. If you will conde[s]cend to receive and an[s]wer the letters of a fugitive, I have formed a plan by which we may regularly corre[s]pond; but do not flatter your[s]elf that by that means you can trace me; nor do not, I entreat you, [s]uffer my brother to know the means by which my letters are conveyed. And now, my deare[s]t Rachel, adieu! Fear not for me. I will never di[s]honour the name of my father, or forget the virtue of my [s]ainted mother. Perhaps (my heart [s]inks at the idea, but perhaps) I [s]hall never [s]ee you again. If [s]o, may Heaven [s]hower its choice[s]t ble[s][s]ings on you, and in[s]pire me with patience and fortitude to [s]ubmit, without repining, to an affliction which would lacerate the heart of JESSY OLIVER. When Rachel had fini[s]hed this letter, [s]he imparted to Archibald as much of the contents as [s]he thought nece[s][s]ary; but to all his entreaties of being permitted to peru[s]e it [s]he continued inexorable. She admired the re[s]olution of Je[s][s]y, and had [s]o good an opinion of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-259.jpg) \- external link  - Page 250. ] her heart and under[s]tanding, that [s]he felt confident of her [s]trict adherence to truth and rectitude. In all their pa[s]t hours of friendly confidence, Mi[s]s Oliver had never [s]uffered a [s]yllable to e[s]cape her lips by which Rachel could gue[s]s at her partiality to Reuben; and at the time when they were mo[s]t together, our heroine was too inexperienced to di[s]cover the passion of her friend by looks and ge[s]tures. Perhaps, had [s]he conver[s]ed much with Je[s][s]y after her own acquaintance with Hamden Auberry, [s]he might have been more clear-[s]ighted. Soon after this circum[s]tance, young Oliver, weary of home, di[s][s]atisfied with him[s]elf, and more than ever in love with Rachel, felt there was a nece[s][s]ity for tearing him[s]elf from her [s]ociety. Be[s]ides, he hoped, in travelling through the northern counties of England, to be enabled to learn [s]ome tidings of his [s]i[s]ter. A di[s]tant relation of his mother's re[s]ided in the beautiful little town of Alnwick, in Northumberland; thither he repaired on a vi[s]it. Its romantic [s]ituation plea[s]ed him; the [s]ociety of [s]everal agreeable families in its vicinity delighted him; and if we add that a lovely and intere[s]ting woman, who[s]e fortune was large and independent, beheld him with affection, and [s]uffered that affection to become manife[s]t, it is to be hoped the fair reader will not blame him, if he lengthened his [s]tay at Alnwick, and every day thought le[s]s and le[s]s of Rachel. After the marriage of Lieutenant Courtney with Mi[s]s La Varone, our heroine felt [s]omewhat disappointed that [s]he had not been pre[s][s]ed to accompany the new Mrs. Courtney into the country. The Lieutenant had, to be [s]ure, [s]olicited her company; but the bride did not, even by a [s]ingle mono[s]yllable, [s]econd tho[s]e [s]olicitations; [s]o Rachel [s]aw them depart, fervently wi[s]hed them hourly increa[s]e of felicity, and then [s]at down to reflect on her own [s]ituation in London, without friends, without employment, and with only eight guineas in her pocket. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-260.jpg) \- external link  - Page 251. ] "I have done wrong, ([s]aid [s]he mentally) very wrong. I mu[s]t take more care, mu[s]t endeavour to be more prudent for the future." As [s]he ruminated on the pa[s]t, felt no [s]atisfaction in the pre[s]ent, and looked with fear and de[s]pondency toward the future, [s]he heard a confu[s]ion in the adjoining apartment, and the voice of Polly Web[s]ter, who was her favourite, entreating a woman to have patience, who by her expre[s][s]ions and manner [s]eemed a total [s]tranger to that virtue. She opened the door, and learnt that Mrs. Web[s]ter was indebted to this woman for tea, [s]ugar, &c. (for [s]he kept a chandler's [s]hop in the neighbourhood) nearly five pounds. Now five pounds, to a per[s]on in abject circumstances, is a debt of as much con[s]equence as five thou[s]and would be to one who keeps high company, a carriage, hor[s]es, [s]ervants, dre[s][s]es gay, and, as it is generally termed, lives in [s]tyle; nay, perhaps, ten times more. For the poor being, who for the ab[s]olute nece[s][s]aries of life has incurred a [s]mall debt, may be dragged by a remor[s]ele[s]s creditor to die in a pri[s]on, unknown, unpitied; while he who, to indulge in luxury and superfluity, had deceived the expectations of hone[s]t industry, deprived the laborious mechanic of his due, or duped the unwary trade[s]man, is [s]uffered to proceed with impunity. Nay, even tho[s]e who criminate his conduct, will flatter his vices, eat at his table, take him by the hand, and [s]mile in his face, whil[s]t in their hearts they laugh at his ab[s]urdity, pity his weakne[s]s, or condemn his depravity. Not but there are tho[s]e, who, di[s]criminating between the embarra[s][s]ments of nece[s][s]ity, and tho[s]e of wilful extravagance, pity the one and de[s]pi[s]e and execrate the other. Yes, there are in this world hearts to commi[s]erate misfortune, whil[s]t they dictate to the tongue comfort, and to the hands relief to the [s]ufferer. And tho[s]e cho[s]en, tho[s]e [s]uperlatively happy few, mu[s]t [s]urely be the favourites of Heaven. For the ble[s][s]ing they delight to confer on others, will return a thou[s]and-fold into their own bo[s]oms. But I digre[s]s. To return to Mrs. Web[s]ter: She could not pay the demand, and was threatened with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-261.jpg) \- external link  - Page 252. ] the law. Rachel had but eight guineas; but [s]he could pay this demand and have three left. She stayed not to inquire what was prudent; [s]he felt what would be humane. She followed the heavenly precept of "doing as [s]he would be done by;" [s]he paid the money. The heart of Mrs. Web[s]ter dilated with gratitude; and the pain Rachel had endured from the departure and coldne[s]s of Mrs. Courtney, was forgot in the transport of the pre[s]ent moment; [s]o true is it, that real happine[s]s mu[s]t be the re[s]ult of the knowledge and practice of virtue. Mr. Spriggins, the nephew of Mrs. Web[s]ter, though awed by her [s]uperior [s]en[s]e and the dignity of her manner, was an ardent admirer of our heroine; but he had never yet breathed a word that could lead her to suspect his pa[s][s]ion. La Varone, young Oliver, and Lieutenant Courtney, had contributed to impo[s]e [s]ilence on him, and keep him at a di[s]tance. But now they were gone, he could offer any civility to her without the fear of having his endeavours to plea[s]e entirely frustrated, by officiou[s]ne[s]s or rivalry. The [s]econd day after their departure, he came, and reque[s]ted the Mi[s]s Web[s]ters and Rachel would accompany him to the play. He fore[s]aw that the young ladies would not be permitted to go without Mi[s]s Dudley, and al[s]o that her good-nature would not [s]uffer her to decline his invitation, as by [s]o doing [s]he would deprive the juvenile party of a rational and (to them) rare amu[s]ement. His expectations were realized; and at an early hour they were all at the pit door of Drury-Lane Theatre. The performance was a tragedy and pantomime, both excellent in their kind. Rachel, who[s]e [s]en[s]ibility often u[s]urped dominion over her rational faculties, bani[s]hing the milder reign of rea[s]on, was, during the tragedy, [s]o entirely ab[s]orbed by the [s]ufferings of the hero and heroine, that the splendid circle that [s]urrounded her in the boxes was totally unnoticed. But between the play and entertainment, [s]he looked round on the glittering throng; and in the [s]tage-box, conver[s]ing with attentive carne[s]tne[s]s with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-262.jpg) \- external link  - Page 253. ] an elegant and very young lady, [s]he [s]aw Hamden Auberry. The lady laid her hand on his [s]houlder. Rachel di[s]covered that her [s]eat was uncomfortable. Hamden, as he conver[s]ed, twi[s]ted a curl of her luxuriant auburn tre[s][s]es round his fingers. "I declare I am out of patience," cried Rachel. "At what, ma'am?" cried the officious Mr. Spriggins. "At the players," [s]aid [s]he; "they are [s]o tedious." "Yes, ma'am," replied Spriggins, "they are to be [s]ure a long while." At that moment Hamden had taken the hand of his fair companion and pre[s][s]ed it to his lips. "I cannot endure it any longer," cried Rachel, "the pit is [s]o crowded, and it is [s]o hot." Rachel was not ea[s]ily overcome; but her heart was more attached to Hamden Auberry than [s]he was aware of. "It is [s]o oppre[s][s]ive," repeated [s]he, unwilling to acknowledge even to her[s]elf the cau[s]e of her unea[s]y sensations. "I mu[s]t really quit the hou[s]e," [s]aid [s]he, ga[s]ping for breath. And then, before any effort could be made to get her through the crowd, a [s]udden mi[s]t came over her eyes, and [s]he fainted. The young Web[s]ters were frightened, and Spriggins was entirely occupied in [s]upporting her, [s]o that no method was taken to recover her. But an elderly gentleman, who [s]at near them, ob[s]erved if they could lift her up, [s]o that [s]he might be above the crowd, it would accelerate her return to life. Accordingly, he humanely [s]tepped up on the [s]eat, and rai[s]ed her in his arms. A [s]melling bottle was now applied, and [s]ome lavender rubbed on her temples. The bu[s]tle this incident had occa[s]ioned in the pit, attracted the notice of the company in the boxes; and as the old gentleman rai[s]ed the declining head of Rachel that [s]he might receive the more benefit from the air of [s]everal fans, Auberry [s]aw and knew her. Like lightning he [s]prang over the front of the box, and rushing through the company, was by the [s]ide of our heroine, when returning life began to animate her lips [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-263.jpg) \- external link  - Page 254. ] and cheeks; and when [s]he opened her eyes, Auberry was the fir[s]t object that met them. The tender solicitude of his looks and manner, whil[s]t he inquired into the cau[s]e of her di[s]order, contributed to re[s]tore her entirely; and having thanked the old gentleman for his care, and made room for Auberry to [s]it between her[s]elf and Polly Web[s]ter, as he held her hand, and [s]poke to her of his mother, Dr. Lenient, and the re[s]t of their acquaintance in Lanca[s]hire, [s]he entirely forgot both her indi[s]po[s]ition and its cau[s]e. Though the impul[s]e of the moment had urged Hamden Auberry, in direct oppo[s]ition to every rule of politene[s]s or even propriety, to quit his company and [s]pring into the pit, when he beheld the lifele[s]s form of Rachel, yet when he now [s]aw her perfectly recovered, he remembered the nece[s][s]ity of immediately returning to them, and apologizing for the abruptness of his conduct. "I do not feel altogether [s]atisfied, my charming Mi[s]s Dudley," [s]aid he in a low voice, "that the society in which, perhaps, you are obliged to mix, is proper or congenial to your feelings. Who are the[s]e young women, and the young man who attends them?" "I am not indeed," [s]aid Rachel, "[s]ituated exactly as I could wi[s]h; but I know not how to better myself." "Where [s]hall I call on you," [s]aid Hamden; "I cannot now [s]tay to [s]ay all I think. I mu[s]t return to my cou[s]in, lady Lucy." "Is that your cou[s]in?" [s]aid Rachel, glancing her eye upon the young lady in the box. "Yes; I came to town by my aunt's de[s]ire merely to accompany her; [s]he is come upon a vi[s]it to a friend of her mother's, and is going with her to make a [s]hort tour on the continent." "And do you accompany her?" [s]aid Rachel; but [s]he dared not rai[s]e her eyes to his face as [s]he made the interrogation; for [s]he felt that her own was suffused with a blu[s]h. "No; I [s]hall only go with them as far as Dover. But as we do not [s]et forward till Saturday, I [s]hall [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-264.jpg) \- external link  - Page 255. ] hope to pa[s]s a few delightful hours in your [s]ociety previous to my journey. At what time will you be at lei[s]ure to-morrow morning?" "I am always at lei[s]ure to [s]ee my friends," replied Rachel, with a fa[s]cinating [s]mile. Hamden's countenance expre[s][s]ed his gratitude, and the plea[s]ure her frankne[s]s gave him, and pre[s][s]ing her hand, he wi[s]hed her a good night, returned to the box, and a few moments afterwards, the whole party in which he was engaged left the theatre. The remainder of the performance was entirely lo[s]t upon our heroine. Her per[s]on was pre[s]ent, and [s]he [s]aw the figures that pa[s][s]ed and repa[s][s]ed before her; but her mind was totally ab[s]ent, and [s]he might as well have gazed upon vacancy. She was di[s][s]atisfied with her[s]elf; [s]he had di[s]covered that [s]he was too much interested in whatever concerned Hamden Auberry; [s]he feared too that he had di[s]covered her weakne[s]s. The[s]e reflections entirely employed her thoughts. When the performance was ended, [s]he mechanically followed her party out of the hou[s]e. When freed from the hurry of coaches, chairs, orange-women, link-boys, and the crowd that had ju[s]t immerged from the play-hou[s]e, [s]he took hold of Polly's arm, and in [s]ilence pur[s]ued her walk home. When [s]he entered the parlour [s]he a[s]ked for a candle, and would have retired to her chamber; but Mrs. Web[s]ter had prepared [s]ome little delicacy for her [s]upper, and [s]he had too much good-nature and politene[s]s to refu[s]e [s]itting up to partake of it. The curio[s]ity of Spriggins and the two elder Websters was excited by the behaviour of Hamden Auberry. They had talked it over as they walked home together, and all agreed that he was certainly a lover. The company he was with declared he was of a superior rank in life; but they had not been quite plea[s]ed that our heroine had neglected to introduce them. "He is a mon[s]trous hand[s]ome man," [s]aid Belle, the [s]econd daughter. "He is well enough," [s]aid the elde[s]t, "but he [s]eems [s]o proud and [s]elf-conceited." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-265.jpg) \- external link  - Page 256. ] We'll joke Mi[s]s Rachel a little about him at [s]upper time," [s]aid Spriggins. "I wonder what made her faint," [s]aid Belle. "Why lawk, Belle!" replied the [s]i[s]ter, "you know [s]he has always lived in the country, and [s]o I [s]uppo[s]e the lights, and the noi[s]e, and the heat---" Ju[s]t then they arrived at home, and in a few minutes they were all [s]eated round the [s]upper table. Mi[s]s Dudley has been very ill at the play, mamma," [s]aid Polly. "Yes, indeed," cried the elde[s]t, "[s]he fainted quite away, and there was [s]uch a fine gentleman jumped out of the box and came to her, I believe he is an old acquaintance." "I believe [s]o too," [s]aid Belle, laughing; "for he [s]eemed mon[s]trous anxious, and looked [s]o happy when [s]he began to recover." "He is an old acquaintance," [s]aid Rachel, at once di[s]tre[s][s]ed and flattered by the manner in which his anxiety and a[s][s]iduity was mentioned; "it was Major Auberry, madam," addre[s][s]ing her[s]elf to Mrs. Webster; "the [s]on of our re[s]pected friend." "Indeed! Well, I have not [s]een him [s]ince he was an infant; and be[s]ides, if he even remembered me, he is [s]o much among[s]t the great folks, it would be beneath him to notice me, or any of my family, though his mother and I, when girls, were ju[s]t like [s]i[s]ters." "Yes, yes," cried Spriggins, who[s]e [s]elf-con[s]equence had been lowered by his being entirely overlooked by the Major; "yes! when folks get up in the world, they generally forget their poor friends." "But I dare affirm Major Auberry is not one of tho[s]e kind of people," [s]aid Rachel; "he intends calling on me to-morrow, and I have no doubt but he will rejoice in being introduced to Mrs. Web[s]ter and her family." "Well, we [s]hall [s]ee!" cried Spriggins; "but I am [s]ure he is not overburthened with good manners, or he would have [s]aid good night, or your [s]ervant, or [s]ome [s]uch like, to me, when he went away; for though mayhap I am not [s]o grand, nor [s]o fine, nor [s]o learned, I thinks I under[s]tands good-breeding as well as any [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-266.jpg) \- external link  - Page 257. ] body. And for the matter of that, a man is but a man, and I don't [s]ee why wearing a laced coat, or being called Sir, or My Lord, or Your Grace, makes one man a bit better than another." Rachel found that it would be in vain to attempt defending Hamden again[s]t the complaints and prejudices of Spriggins, who[s]e contracted mind and very [s]mall portion of under[s]tanding, would not [s]uffer him to comprehend tho[s]e nice di[s]tinctions which, allowing for the natural equality of man, [s]till pre[s]erves that respect, that nece[s][s]ary [s]ubordination, due from inferiors to per[s]ons of [s]hining abilities, liberal education, and [s]uperior under[s]tanding; and the ignorant, self-opinionated being who prates of equality, never once conceives the cau[s]e of the di[s]tinction, which education (more than any other cau[s]e) makes between man and man. Per[s]ons of large fortunes are enabled to enjoy the benefits of in[s]truction in its mo[s]t extended [s]en[s]e; and they who have cultivated their minds with care, who[s]e ta[s]tes and manners are highly poli[s]hed, feel as great a repugnance to the [s]ociety of the vulgar ignorant, in whom mean pride, ob[s]tinacy and vanity in general combine, as the pure and uncontaminated mind would feel in being forced into an intercour[s]e with the vicious. But Rachel knew the[s]e arguments, if advanced, would have no effect on Spriggins; [s]he therefore li[s]tened in [s]ilence to the end of his harangue, then wi[s]hing them all a good night, retired to her apartment. Matters of Con[s]equence. The next morning by ten o'clock, Hamden Auberry was in Dartmouth-[s]treet. He was introduced to Mrs. Web[s]ter and her daughters; to the former, as the friend of his mother, he was uncommonly re[s]pectful, and he [s]poke to the girls with [s]uch freedom, politene[s]s and affability, that when they went [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-267.jpg) \- external link  - Page 258. ] into the adjoining room, Belle declared he was a mo[s]t captivating man. Polly [s]aid [s]he hoped, if he was going to marry dear Mi[s]s Dudley, that he was as good as he was handsome. For if he was a king, he could not be too good for her. "Marry," [s]aid the elde[s]t, putting up her lip, "I dare [s]ay he would be frightened to hear you [s]ay [s]uch a thing. No! no! young men of his rank and fashion don't often marry poor girls; if they did, I don't [s]ee why [s]ome folks might not [s]tand as good a chance as others." And [s]he ca[s]t a [s]ly glance at the looking-gla[s]s, which hung directly oppo[s]ite to where [s]he was [s]itting. Hamden, in this interview with our heroine, felt his admiration increa[s]e. Every circum[s]tance that had taken place during her re[s]idence in London, [s]he recapitulated to him, with an ingenuous freedom that captivated his heart, whil[s]t his rea[s]on applauded the involuntary tribute of admiration and re[s]pect, her manners and [s]entiments exacted. When [s]he had fini[s]hed her artle[s]s recital, (which was drawn forth by his inquiries, not voluntarily obtruded on his attention) "You are, I fear, improperly, as well as uncomfortably [s]ituated," [s]aid he with energy. "I acknowledge it," replied Rachel, "but I mu[s]t bear it with patience; there is no remedy." "What do you mean, my dear Mi[s]s Dudley? You [s]urely have friends." "I dare [s]ay I have, Sir, many friends; but I [s]hould be [s]orry to tre[s]pa[s]s on their goodne[s]s." "Is it po[s][s]ible Mi[s]s Dudley can imagine---" He was proceeding, but [s]he [s]topped him. "Do not mi[s]under[s]tand me, Major Auberry; I do not think meanly of my friends, but I am con[s]cious of my own defects; I am too proud to live in a [s]tate of [s]ervile dependence." "Good heavens! what do you mean?" "Nothing very extraordinary. My brother is absent; my late dear father's agent, I greatly fear, is [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-268.jpg) \- external link  - Page 259. ] difhonest; and perhaps I [s]hall find it nece[s][s]ary to be industrious, in order to continue in [s]ome degree respectable." She [s]aid this without embarra[s][s]ment, and with a cheerful [s]mile. She felt no degradation in the idea of exerting her talents to procure [s]upport. Hamden was [s]ilent; a certain [s]omething [s]truck cold upon his heart. No wonder; it was the cold, hard drop that turns whatever it falls upon to [s]tone. Poverty has a mo[s]t unaccountable petrifying quality; many a heart has it rendered impenetrable as adamant; many a bo[s]om has it inca[s]ed in marble, or enveloped in ice, [s]o firmly congealed, that only the [s]un of prosperity, riding in full meridian, could [s]often or relax it. Hamden felt the cold chill run trembling through every nerve; but his heart defied its frigid power, and glowed with more fervour. He [s]aid but little after this explanation, and [s]oon took his leave. On his return to his lodgings, he thus inquired of him[s]elf. Do I love Rachel Dudley? Mo[s]t a[s][s]uredly, beyond all other women. Does [s]he return my pa[s][s]ion? That is a que[s]tion yet to be determined. If I might judge from the intelligence of her eyes---But hope may be pre[s]umption. Would I marry her? Yes, with delight and tran[s]port, if [s]he would accept me. What? in defiance of my aunt's wi[s]hes and injunctions? Here was a moment's pau[s]e. At length he proceeded in his que[s]tions. Would I be willing to relinquish all hope of future affluence, honour, title, and devote my life to ob[s]curity and Rachel Dudley? I fear not. I [s]hould repine at the advantages I had relinquished, and embitter her life by my own fruitle[s]s regret. Then is it honourable, by indirect attentions, to lead her to [s]uppo[s]e [s]he has an exclu[s]ive preference in my bo[s]om, or to awaken expectations, which will end only in di[s]appointment? Certainly no. After thus clo[s]ely interrogating his own heart, Hamden determined to avoid vi[s]iting Rachel again; but on the morning following, he received a letter from his mother; it would be but kind to call and let Mi[s]s Dudley know her friend Dr. Lenient was well, and that Tabitha [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-269.jpg) \- external link  - Page 260. ] Holdfa[s]t had taken to her[s]elf a help-mate of one of the faithful. He accordingly went; one vi[s]it produced another. Prudence on one [s]ide, and pride on the other, were for a while forgotten. Hamden talked of love, and Rachel li[s]tened with complacency. It was on a fine evening in the beginning of September, as wandering on the banks of the Thames, where a row of young willows drooped their pendent branches over the [s]oftly gliding [s]tream, that Hamden (on who[s]e arm Rachel reclined with the confidence of fraternal affection) [s]poke of the happy intercour[s]e of congenial minds. "Dear, charming Rachel!" [s]aid he, "it [s]eems as though our [s]ouls were formed at the [s]ame moment, and partake of congenial particles." "Our [s]entiments are certainly much alike in mo[s]t things," [s]aid Rachel. "And why not in every thing," cried Hamden eagerly. "Why, my lovely friend, loving as we love each other, (for you do not deny though you he[s]itate to avow your affection) why do we not [s]anctify that affection by the mo[s]t [s]olemn vows?" "You have an aunt, Hamden Auberry," [s]aid Rachel with firmne[s]s, "and on her depends your future fortune. She will not approve of the untitled, unportioned Rachel for your wife." "Do not name her. I will renounce her favour. I will henceforth live but for you." "Hamden," [s]aid Rachel, and her features a[s][s]umed a [s]erene [s]olemnity that was almo[s]t cele[s]tial, "Hamden, I have not expre[s][s]ed the feelings of my [s]oul, because I was [s]en[s]ible of the impo[s][s]ibility of our ever being united with the con[s]ent of your aunt; and know, though you were dearer to me than life it[s]elf, I will never intrude my[s]elf into a family, who would think them[s]elves degraded by the alliance. That I am an unconnected being, is certain; no one has a right to [s]ay, Rachel, why do[s]t thou [s]o? But I have a heart that tells me when I err. To the reproaches of this tru[s]ty, [s]ilent monitor, I will never [s]ubject my[s]elf; to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-270.jpg) \- external link  - Page 261. ] the contumely and con[s]ures of the world I am invulnerable; they too often misjudge and condemn the innocent unheard." "Sweet, charming morali[s]t, whither would[s]t thou lead me?" [s]aid Hamden. "To happine[s]s, I hope," [s]aid Rachel [s]miling. "That I feel my heart glow with e[s]teem to you," continued [s]he, "is a truth I wi[s]h not to deny; but that e[s]teem is pure; nor per[s]onal intere[s]t, nor hope of future aggrandizement, will ever bias me. You a[s]k me for a wife; here is my hand; let us [s]anctify our loves in the face of Heaven. Enable me to [s]atisfy my dear Renben, when he returns, that I have not dishonoured the name of Dudley; and for the indiscriminating, curious, idle multitude, let them think as they may. Happy in your affection, their [s]mile or their frown will be alike incon[s]equential." The gratitude of Hamden was manife[s]ted in wild, enthu[s]ia[s]tic expre[s][s]ions of everla[s]ting love. But Hamden's pride [s]till predominated, and he accepted the title of hu[s]band to an amiable woman, who[s]e virtue and under[s]tanding would have done honour to a diadem; yet, fearing to forfeit the paltry di[s]tinctions of wealth and title, he [s]uffered her to bear the ignominy of [s]u[s]picion, and the bitterne[s]s of reproach, from tho[s]e who neither comprehended or could e[s]timate her merit. They were married in St. John's Church, Westminster; and Rachel removed to a lodging provided for her by her hu[s]band in the neighbourhood of Mary-lebone. When Rachel propo[s]ed removing from Mrs. Webster's, [s]he found no [s]mall difficulty in [s]atisfying her inquiries re[s]pectting the cau[s]e of her removal. She had imprudently acquainted Mrs. Web[s]ter with the diminished [s]tate of her finances; when therefore on the morning of her marriage, which took place a little after eight o'clock; for Rachel, though [s]he had now been [s]ome months in London, continued the healthgiving cu[s]tom of early ri[s]ing, and frequcntly walked before breakfa[s]t, [s]o that it was nothing extraordinary for her to be abroad [s]o early; when, in con[s]equence [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-271.jpg) \- external link  - Page 262. ] of this union, [s]he prepared to quit her lodging, and gave Mrs. Web[s]ter a bank bill for forty pounds, requesting her to get it changed, the old lady looked at her with a [s]crutinizing eye; and though not apt to make remarks, could not avoid [s]peaking to our heroine in the following words: "It is no bu[s]ine[s]s of mine, to be [s]ure, Mi[s]s Dudley; but I am afraid you are going to do a very imprudent thing. To your family and connexions I am a total [s]tranger; but for the [s]ake of my friend, Mrs. Auberry, I could wi[s]h you had conducted your[s]elf with more circum[s]pection." "In what, madam?" [s]aid Rachel indignantly, "have I tran[s]gre[s][s]ed the laws of prudence?" "You have received the vi[s]its of [s]everal young men. Mr. Oliver, I concluded, was your lover for [s]ome time; but after vi[s]iting, taking you on parties of pleasure, and being as attentive as man could be, whi[s]k he goes off into the country, and there's an end of the matter." Rachel could not help [s]miling as [s]he replied---"Mr. Oliver, I believe, madam, never thought of me in any other light than as a friend. I am [s]o happy as to be e[s]teemed by his [s]i[s]ter, and for her [s]ake he [s]hewed me, whil[s]t he [s]tayed in town, more than common re[s]pect." "Well, it may be [s]o; but it had a very odd appearance though. Then came Mr. Courtney. I made quite certain that he would be the happy man, when, behold! in[s]tead of you, he marries Mi[s]s La Varone. To be certain, [s]he was a clever [s]ort of a body; but then one would have thought a young man would not be at a lo[s]s to choo[s]e between you and her." "Well, you find he was not at a lo[s]s," an[s]wered Rachel rather petulantly. "And now," continued Mrs. Web[s]ter, not noticing her reply, "now here has been Major Auberry, dancing attendance above a month pa[s]t. I am afraid he means no good; he is, as one may [s]ay, one of the quality folks; and his aunt, lady Anne, would no more agree to his marrying a poor girl, than [s]he would to his going to Jeru[s]alem. What then does he de[s]ign? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-272.jpg) \- external link  - Page 263. ] Take care, Mi[s]s Dudley, do not let him make you his dupe. You are going from me; for what purpo[s]e, or into who[s]e protection, you have not thought proper to tell me; however, that is neither here nor there. As I [s]aid before, it is no bu[s]ine[s]s of mine. But when I think, that not a fortnight [s]ince you [s]hewed me the contents of your pur[s]e, which were very trifling, and declared it was all you po[s][s]e[s][s]ed in the world, and that I now [s]ee you in po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of forty pounds, I cannot help thinking all is not as it [s]hould be." "I thank you, madam, for your care and anxiety on my account," [s]aid Rachel, who perceived, in Mrs. Web[s]ter's manner, more of curio[s]ity than real solicitude for her welfare, "but to quiet your apprehen[s]ions, permit me to a[s][s]ure you, I [s]hall be careful never to offend again[s]t virtue and morality. My conduct may incur cen[s]ure, but [s]hall never be criminal. Whil[s]t my dear brother is from England, I hold my[s]elf accountable to no one for my actions; and whil[s]t my own heart acquits me of any breach of my duties either moral or religious, I am perfectly indifferent as to what opinion the world in general may form concerning me." Thus argued Rachel; but her ideas were erroneous, and [s]he found, when too late, it is not only nece[s][s]ary to be virtuous, but to appear [s]o. Alas! pity it is, but the [s]emblance is often more re[s]pected than the reality. "I [s]uppo[s]e we [s]hall [s]ee you [s]ometimes, Mi[s]s Dudley?" [s]aid Mrs. Web[s]ter with a [s]neer, as [s]he took leave of her. Rachel [s]lightly an[s]wered in the affirmative, [s]hook hands with her and Belle, ki[s][s]ed the affectionate little Polly (who [s]tood [s]obbing by the window) and put a guinea into her hand; then ordering her trunk to be placed in a hackney-coach that waited at the door, [s]he [s]tepped in, drew up the gla[s]s, and a few moments conveyed her to her new lodgings, where her hu[s]band was ready to receive her. The attachment of our heroine to Major Auberry was pure as it was ardent. Accu[s]tomed from infancy to confine her affections within a narrow circle, [s]he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-273.jpg) \- external link  - Page 264. ] would have felt no repugnance to [s]eclude her[s]elf from all other [s]ociety, could [s]he have been certain by [s]o doing to in[s]ure his eternal love and [s]idelity. She had a[s]ked leave of Hamden to inform Je[s][s]y Oliver, with whom [s]he regularly corre[s]ponded, of the change in her circum[s]tances; but he [s]orbade her. She acquie[s]ced in [s]ilence. It had never entered her mind, that an unknown indrividual like her[s]elf, could excite the curio[s]ity of her neighbours. She was the lea[s]t inqui[s]itive of any human being. "Of what con[s]equence," [s]he would often [s]ay, "is the bu[s]ine[s]s, plea[s]ures or pur[s]uits of others to me. I harbour no ill will towards any; and have I a right to [s]crutinize their actions? No." Hamden Auberry, [s]till the [s]lave of pride, and fearing to forfeit the favour of lady Anne, [s]uffered his wife to go by the a[s][s]umed name of Dacres. Our heroine too was equally the [s]lave of the [s]ame pa[s][s]ion, but it was of a more laudable kind. He [s]acrified the reputation of a virtuous woman, rather than relinqui[s]h the in[s]ignificant di[s]tinction wealth and power could give; and [s]he nobly (though romantically) braved the cen[s]ures of the world, to evince her thorough contempt of both. Acro[s]s the Atlantic. As Variety is [s]aid to be the [s]a[s]cinating charm that intrances the [s]en[s]es, awakens attention, and, displaying her many coloured wings in a thou[s]and different lights, ob[s]cures from our view the [s]cythe and gla[s]s of Time, and [s]uffers him to pa[s]s unheeded by; at her [s]hrine I kneel, her aid I invoke. Come, enchanting phantom, who, as thou pa[s][s]e[s]t momentarily, a[s][s]ume[s]t [s]ome new [s]ome charming form.

Ha[s]ton then, for with thee ever comes the Mu[s]e. Her ve[s]tments white cla[s]ped by a golden zone, her bu[s]kined leg half bare, her auburn tre[s][s]es floating in the wind; her veil, which part conceals her beauteous face, and part plays loo[s]ely in the breeze, wrought with devices [s]trange and rare; Hi[s]tory, Poetry, Fiction and Truth, blended [s]o [s]oft as to relieve each other; ethereal vi[s]ion, come; I wait thee here. For many is the painful hour thou ha[s]t [s]oothed; many the heartache thou ha[s]t lightened. Wearine[s]s has fled at thy approach, and the [s]till hour of night has been as cheerful as the full blaze of day. `But, madam, if you plea[s]e, we would prefer a little le[s]s of the figurative, and a little more plain matter of fact.' Pardon me, gentle reader. I forgot I was writing the hi[s]tory of Reuben and Rachel, and was giving you the hi[s]tory of my own [s]eelings. A poor [s]ub[s]titute, you [s]ay. I acknowledge the truth of the ob[s]ervation, and therefore return to my hero. After a pa[s][s]age of thirty days, Reuben Dudley arrived [s]afe in the Delaware, and on the thirty-[s]econd day after his departure from Liverpool, landed in the city of Philadelphia. He had with him [s]everal letters of, what is called, recommendation from merchants in Liverpool, to their tran[s]-atlantic corre[s]pondents; but they contained nothing more than a general mention of his family, and that his character and morals had been hitherto unimpenched. "I will not inquire out the gentlemen to whom the[s]e letters are directed, till I have [s]een my good friend Jacob Holmes," [s]aid Reuben to him[s]elf, as he walked up the main [s]treet. "He will, without doubt, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-275.jpg) \- external link  - Page 266. ] accompany me, when I wi[s]h to vi[s]it them. How glad will he be to [s]ee me," continued he mentally. "His natural love to my [s]i[s]ter and [s]elf, his gratitude to my father---" At the remembrance of his father, Reuben's heart became full; and when he [s]eated him[s]elf in the tavern to which he had been recommended, and began to reflect [s]eriou[s]ly upon where he was, and that it was more than probable his father might have been in that very hou[s]e, in that very room, nay, he might have re[s]ted on the identical chair he was now [s]eated on, the fulne[s]s of his heart overflowed at his eyes, and he indulged in the effu[s]ion without re[s]traint. He had ordered [s]ome [s]upper. As the ma[s]ter of the hou[s]e came in with it, Reuben a[s]ked him if he had ever known one Mr. Dudley, who had re[s]ided in Philadelphia between two and three years. The landlord had, previous to the que[s]tion being a[s]ked, drawn a chair to the oppo[s]ite [s]ide of the table to that where our hero was [s]eated, and when he heard the interrogation, an[s]wered it by another. "I expect he is [s]ome relative of yours, by your being [s]o inqui[s]itive about him." "He was," [s]aid Reuben mournfully, "a very near and dear relative." "So I expect," replied the landlord. "Pray where is he now?" "In heaven," [s]aid Reuben, rai[s]ing his eyes, whil[s]t every pul[s]ation vibrated in exulting confidence of his father's worth. "You mu[s]t not be too [s]ure of that," [s]aid the landlord. "Had you known him, Sir," [s]aid Reuben with a firm and earne[s]t manner, "you would have no more doubt of his pre[s]ent happine[s]s than I have." "I did know him," replied the ho[s]t. "Then you knew one of the be[s]t men that ever lived." "Yea, he was good in the worldly acceptation of the word; he did alms, told no lies, hated no one, paid every man, yea, more than his due; but all this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-276.jpg) \- external link  - Page 267. ] is vanity, filthy rags, unclean ve[s]tments. He was not one of the cho[s]en; he was in a lo[s]t [s]tate." Here a di[s]pute en[s]ued, in which Reuben evidently lo[s]t ground with his antagoni[s]t; for Reuben argued with coolne[s]s, and took rea[s]on for his monitor; whereas his opponent was wild, enthu[s]ia[s]tic, and extremely ignorant. He had adopted [s]ome eccentric ideas in regard to religion, and he a[s][s]erted that his opinions were right, "becau[s]e they were," and that all who did not think exactly as he did, were in the high road to de[s]truction, for the [s]ame unan[s]werable rea[s]on, "because they were." Before Reuben had fini[s]hed his [s]upper, the landlord left him, to impart to his [s]pou[s]e all he had learnt concerning the [s]tranger. The curio[s]ity of Jael was not [s]atisfied with this intelligence of her helpmate's. "Thou ha[s]t learned nothing, Zekell," [s]aid [s]he; "I will go and que[s]tion the young man my[s]elf." Jael entered the parlour. "You are ju[s]t arrived," [s]aid [s]he, [s]itting down in the place her hu[s]band had ju[s]t left. "Yes, ju[s]t landed." "From England?" "Yes." "What part?" "Liverpool." "Liverpool?" "Yes." "I expect you have got [s]ome kinsfolks in the city." "Not that I know of." "No friends, no acquaintances?" "Oh yes! Do you know Jacob Holmes?" "Yes, to be [s]ure I do. Ma[s]ter has rea[s]on to know him; he is a dire hard man to deal with." "What bu[s]ine[s]s does he follow?" "Bu[s]ine[s]s! Well, I expect you don't know much about him, to a[s]k that que[s]tion. Why Jacob Holmes is one of our grande[s]t men, for all he be a Quaker. And then he married [s]uch a grand woman; why I expect [s]he had a matter of five hundred pounds to her fortin." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-277.jpg) \- external link  - Page 268. ] "Mr. Holmes is married then?" "What, did not you know that? Well, I thought you were a boa[s]ting [s]ort of fellow, pretending to know folks who you never [s]aw'd." "How long has he been married?" [s]aid Reuben. "Why I expect it is about a year and a half ago." "So long?" "Yes, [s]o long; and madam Holmes has got a [s]weet little baby, about three months old." Reuben pau[s]ed a moment, and then without reflection exclaimed, "Why he mu[s]t have married immediately after my father's departure for England." "And pray what may be your name?" [s]aid Jael, placing both her elbows on the table, and re[s]ting her chin on her hands, whil[s]t her large blue gla[s]s eyes were fixed on the face of our hero with a mo[s]t unmeaning [s]tare. "My name is Dudley," replied Reuben. "So I expected," [s]aid [s]he, and [s]omething like low cunning informed her broad and inexpre[s][s]ive features. "And [s]o you are cum'd to look ater the fortin [s]quire Dudley left?" "Even [s]o," replied Reuben, pu[s]hing from him the plate that contained his almo[s]t unta[s]ted [s]upper. "How far from Philadelphia does the late Mr. Dudley's estate lay, and which is my neare[s]t road to it?" "Ah, young man!" [s]aid Jael, "I expect you be cum'd on a fool's errant. It matters not to you where it lies; he never paid for it; and cording to counts that we have heard, the [s]quire owed a pretty deal before he cum'd from home." Reuben [s]tarted. "Of whom are you [s]peaking?" [s]aid he. "Of [s]quire Dudley." "What Dudley? what was his Chri[s]tian name?" "Name! name! I can't ju[s]t now [s]ay; but I expect it was a bible name." "Was it Reuben?" a[s]ked our hero eagerly. "I do expect it was," [s]aid the woman, ri[s]ing without the lea[s]t emotion, and beginning to remove the [s]upper from the table. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-278.jpg) \- external link  - Page 269. ] "Oh! my dear father!" exclaimed Reuben, and his re[s]piration became [s]o difficult that he was obliged to walk to the window and throw up the [s]a[s]h. Jael replaced the di[s]h upon the table, and with a look and manner to which no de[s]cription can do justice, thus addre[s][s]ed him:--- "If [s]quire Dudley was your father, I wonder how you got [s]afe over [s]ea. Nobody was [s]urpri[s]ed when they heard he was ca[s]t away and drownded; for he was as great a reprobate as ever lived." "Reprobate!" repeated Reuben with vehemence, and his eyes fla[s]hed re[s]entment, whil[s]t his heart swelled almo[s]t to bur[s]ting. "Yes, reprobate," repeated Jael, "and I expect you will find a pretty many folks in Philidelphy that will tell you as how here he comed over [s]ea, and pretended to be a va[s]t rich man." "'Tis fal[s]e!" cried Reuben; "I would [s]take my exi[s]tence upon his probity. My father would have [s]corned to pretend to any thing more than he could make appear reality." "But I [s]ay he did though," [s]aid Jael; "giving away his intere[s]t as a body may [s]ay, [s]elling his goods at half-price, that, as he [s]aid, the poor might buy as well as the rich. Then if he [s]aw a man that wanted, he never inquired whether he was a Chri[s]tian or a Papish, but lent or gav'd him what he axed." "And a ju[s]t and beneficent God will reward him for it," [s]aid Reuben, rai[s]ing his eyes fervently. "He is now, I tru[s]t, reaping the reward of his philanthropy." "It mought a been all very well," continued Jael, not noticing the ejaculation of our hero, "had he only given away his own; but to deal [s]o hardly as he did by that pious young man, Jacob Holmes---Oh! it was a wicked thing." Reuben approached a few [s]teps towards his ho[s]te[s]s, and then [s]topped, fixed in curio[s]ity and amazement; amazed at the malignity with which this ignorant woman endeavoured to a[s]per[s]e the memory of his father, (whil[s]t every [s]entence till the la[s]t, mu[s]t appear [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-279.jpg) \- external link  - Page 270. ] in the eye of pure religion and candour as his highe[s]t culogium) and curious to know from what [s]ource this malignity proceeded; whil[s]t Jael, leaning over the back of the chair from which [s]he had ari[s]en, her features [s]till fixed and without expre[s][s]ion, in the [s]ame monotonous tone of voice proceeded:--- "It is a [s]erious thing, young man, a very [s]erious thing, for one to be left gardeen to a wealthy child. Oh! it is a trying matter, a grand [s]nare, laid by Satan, the mighty tempter, the great deceiver. Money is the root and [s]pring of all evil; it is the bait the wicked one makes u[s]e of to draw the children of vanity a[s]tray, as he did thy father. Oh! it was an abomination for him to keep Jacob Holmes as he did, without even pocket money, whil[s]t he was throwing away his intere[s]t by handfuls." "I do not under[s]tand you," [s]aid Reuben; "Jacob Holmes was an orphan child, adopted, brought up and educated by the charity of my father." "Ah! that was the [s]tory [s]quire Dudley told, when he fir[s]t comed here; but we knows better things now. It was the money of the good Jacob Holmes on which he was living; for I expect if it had been his own he would a been more careful of it. But thy father, young man, has wronged the orphan of his right, and made him[s]elf rich at the expen[s]e of the [s]on of the widow, and the cur[s]es of the widow and the orphan will re[s]t upon him and his children." "So be it," cried Reuben; "I fear no judgment for my father's actions. Oh that I may be enabled to emulate his virtues, to tread his foot[s]teps---But I feel I am to blame in li[s]tening to one, who[s]e aim is to caluminate the memory of him who gave me being. What could he have done to de[s]erve thy hatred, that even his [s]acred du[s]t cannot re[s]t in peace? Did he ever wrong thee or thy family?" "No, not he; I expect he was the means of my getting a matter a twenty pounds or [s]o, that I [s]hould a lo[s]t; but then, though it did me a kindne[s]s, it did not tell much to his credit, though (as ma[s]ter [s]aid) [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-280.jpg) \- external link  - Page 271. ] we got our money, and what matter was it to us who paid it?" "True," cried Reuben, "that could be of but little con[s]equence indeed; but pray tell me, how came my father to render you this [s]ervice?" "Why I expect it is [s]o long a [s]tory, you will be tired." "Tell it as conci[s]ely as po[s][s]ible," [s]aid Reuben; "I will an[s]wer for my patience; and even [s]hould it be more lengthy than I expect, when a father's good deeds are the theme, what [s]on could be weary or feel his attention flag?" Jael looked at him, with mouth and eyes extended. She comprehended nothing more than that he de[s]ired to hear how his father happened to pay her twenty pounds; [s]o, [s]till leaning over the back of the chair, [s]he began:--- "I expect it's a matter a three years agone, a woman comed over in a [s]hip from London, an [s]he [s]aid as how [s]he comed ater her hu[s]band. She was as pretty a body, I expect, as one mought [s]ee in a hundred. Ma[s]ter and I was ju[s]t married, and got into this here hou[s]e. So [s]he comed an wanted to board with us, an [s]he had a baby with her about [s]ix months old. So [s]he had plenty of money, an a golden watch, an a power of fine clothes; [s]o we let her have our be[s]t room, an hired a girl to wait on her." "Plenty of money, a gold watch, and fine clothes," [s]aid Reuben mentally, and he turned from the [s]elfi[s]h narrator to hide his indignation and contempt. "Well, ater a while," [s]he continued, "we found as how the par[s]on [s]he cum'd ater was not her hu[s]band; he had kept her company, and I expect, promi[s]ed to marry her; but he would neither own her nor her child when he [s]aw'd her here. So [s]he did nothing but cry, and cry, and ki[s]s her little girl; [s]he was too proud to work, and [s]o, when her money was [s]pent, and her golden watch [s]old, [s]he [s]aid [s]he wi[s]hed to die." "Poor, unfortunate girl," [s]aid Reuben in a tone of commi[s]eration, "how I pity her!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-281.jpg) \- external link  - Page 272. ] "Pity her indeed," [s]aid Jael, "a creeter! When I told her [s]he mought get a good living by going out to [s]arvice, [s]he [s]aid [s]he knew not how to labour for bread; them was her very words, an [s]o [s]he would not eat nor drink, an u[s]ed to go night ater night with her clothes on, [s]itting on the floor, and re[s]ting her head on a chair or the window-feat. She at la[s]t grew [s]o weak, that [s]he was not able to walk; [s]o I went and axed her what [s]he meant by going on [s]o; for [s]he know'd as how [s]he owed me above twelve pound; [s]o [s]he only an[s]wered me, `[s]he meant and wi[s]hed to die, and at once relea[s]e me and her[s]elf.' But then [s]he would hug her baby, and cry, `Poor little wretch! what will become of you? It were better we both died together." Reuben's eyes gli[s]tened with the dew of [s]en[s]ibility, but he was [s]ilent. "So at la[s]t [s]he fell into a con[s]umption; I expect it was all owing to her pride that was [s]o humbled and mortified. So [s]eeing as how [s]he was like to become a trouble to ma[s]ter, I told her how [s]he mu[s]t go about her bu[s]ine[s]s; for I wanted my room to let to somebody el[s]e." "Did you tell the poor dying creature [s]o?" [s]aid Reuben, in a tone expre[s][s]ive at once of anger and commiseration; "did you tell her [s]o?" "Yes, I did," [s]aid Jael; "for you knows self-preservation is the fir[s]t law in nature, and 'tis but right one [s]hould chri[s]ten their own child fir[s]t. So madam got up, and with her child in her hand crawled down [s]tairs; and when [s]he got into the kitchen, [s]he fainted away. So [s]quire Dudley was in the next room, and he heard the bu[s]tle in the kitchen, and came out to axe what was the matter; [s]o when I told him, he threw me the money [s]he owed me; but he called me a very bad name. Then he got two men to carry the [s]ick body to his own lodging in an arm chair, an there he had her tended and doctored; but that did no good, for [s]he died. An there he took the child, and had it put out to nur[s]e, though every body [s]aid he ought to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-282.jpg) \- external link  - Page 273. ] be a[s]hamed of him[s]elf for doing any thing for [s]uch a [s]ort of woman." "Oh my father! my father!" exclaimed Reuben, "ought not thy [s]on to exult that thy character was [s]uch, that even the a[s]per[s]ions of thy enemies are thy highe[s]t prai[s]e?---And where is the poor child?" addressing him[s]elf to the woman. "Dead; for ater the [s]quire went away, Jacob Holmes would not pay for its being nur[s]ed; and who can blame him? There had been enough of his interest wa[s]ted already." "I tell thee, woman," [s]aid Reuben, "Jacob Holmes never had any property whatever but what he enjoyed from the beneficence of my father." "I expect that [s]tory won't do you much good here," [s]aid Jael; "but how[s]oever, you axed about the child, an [s]o as I was [s]aying, it went to the poor-hou[s]e, and there it died." As Jael fini[s]hed this hi[s]tory, [s]he took the di[s]h and plate from the table, and left the room, and Reuben [s]hortly after retired to bed, but not to re[s]t. To find his father's memory traduced, to find Jacob Holmes in actual po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of his e[s]tate, and believed universally the lawful owner of it, was a [s]hock he had never dreamed of receiving, and knew not how to [s]upport. As he had imagined he [s]hould, without the lea[s]t difficulty, take immediate po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of the effects his father had left in Holmes's care, and as he knew there mu[s]t be con[s]iderable money in his hands, ari[s]ing from the [s]ale of merchandize with which he had been entru[s]ted, our hero had taken but a very [s]mall [s]um of money with him from England. Indeed his finances in general were in [s]o confined a [s]tate, that he could not command a [s]um of any con[s]equence. It was therefore no [s]mall addition to his unea[s]y [s]en[s]ations, that he was in a [s]trange land, with very little money, and without a [s]ingle friend. However, he determined the next morning to vi[s]it Jacob Holmes; for, [s]till unwilling to believe human nature could be guilty of [s]uch depravity, or that a man, adding di[s]hone[s]ry to ingratitude, would return the benevolence of the father by wronging the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-283.jpg) \- external link  - Page 274. ] [s]on, he indulged a feeble hope, that his reception would be better than from what he had heard he had a right to expect. After a re[s]tle[s]s and perturbated night, he aro[s]e with the earlie[s]t dawn, and having inquired for a hor[s]e, was preparing to vi[s]it Jacob, when, as he went to the door with the de[s]ign of mounting, he [s]aw the identical person he was going in [s]earch of ju[s]t alighting. Spite of the intelligence he had received from Jael, Reuben's heart warmed with affection, when he beheld a per[s]on who had been [s]o dear to his father, and who had borne him[s]elf and [s]i[s]ter in his arms a thou[s]and times. He darted forward, and took his hand. "Jacob," [s]aid he, in a tone of fraternal tenderne[s]s, "Jacob, how are you?" "Well, I thank thee, young man," replied Jacob, coldly withdrawing his hand, and [s]talking with upright formality into the hou[s]e. Though chilled by his frigid manner, Reuben felt his heart contract, yet he followed him into the parlour, and laying his hand upon his [s]houlder, cried, "Don't you know me, Jacob?" "No, really, young man, thou ha[s]t greatly the advantage of me; I do not recollect ever to have [s]een thee before." Nearly [s]ix years had elap[s]ed [s]ince Jacob had left England, and a period of that length might naturally be [s]uppo[s]ed to make a material alteration in the person of a youth, whom it had transformed, as it pa[s]t, from a cheerful, blooming boy, to the graceful, wellinformed man. But [s]till there was [s]ufficient in his manner, voice and features, to inform Jacob Holmes, at one glance, who it was addre[s][s]ed him. But Jacob had found a [s]hort memory very u[s]eful on many occasions, and was determined to try its efficacy on this; and therefore boldly a[s][s]erted he had never, to his recollection, [s]een Reuben before. "Look at me again, friend Jacob," [s]aid our hero, "you [s]urely cannot totally forget the face of Reuben Dudley, the [s]on of your friend, Mr. Dudley, of Lanea[s]hire." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-284.jpg) \- external link  - Page 275. ] "I do remember thee now," [s]aid Jacob; "but how is it, young man, that I [s]ee thee in the garb of the children of vanity? thy father wore it not." Reuben was now [s]truck by ob[s]erving the very formal and primitive appearance of Jacob. "I hope I am not the le[s]s pious," [s]aid Reuben with a [s]mile, "because my coat is not cut in the [s]ame fa[s]hion as thine, or my hat quite [s]o large. I am come to inquire after my father's effects, and to relea[s]e you from the trouble you have [s]o long had, of attending to concerns which may interfere with your own bu[s]ine[s]s and pursuits." "Thou art welcome to Philadelphia, friend Reuben," [s]aid Jacob, a[s][s]uming [s]ome [s]mall degree of cordiality; "I [s]hall be ready to give an account of my [s]teward[s]hip whenever thou [s]halt demand it. In the mean time, go home with me, and [s]ojourn till thou can[s]t [s]uit thy[s]elf better. I am going acro[s]s the river on [s]ome little matter of bu[s]ine[s]s; when I return, we will go together to my hou[s]e." "Ah!" [s]aid Reuben, after Jacob had left him, "I fear this man has a di[s]hone[s]t heart; but I will not judge too ha[s]tily." Towards evening, Jacob returned, and with our hero proceeded to the hou[s]e of Mr. Dudley, which he now claimed as his own. It was [s]ituated on the declivity of a hill, that, ri[s]ing gradually behind it, [s]heltered it from the wintry bla[s]ts, and who[s]e [s]ides were covered with a variegated wood; the [s]preading pine, the cedar, the wild walnut, the hiccory, the birch, the oak, were intermingled, and beautifully diver[s]ified the foliage, whil[s]t here and there the par[s]imon tree di[s]played its tempting but deceitful fruit, which, like the frivolous plea[s]ures of the world, are lovely to the eye when viewed at a di[s]tance; but when ta[s]ted, disappoint the expectation, and its har[s]h acidity is rejected with di[s]gu[s]t. Here too, in native beauty, bloomed the laure[s]tinus, and here innumerable wild flowering [s]hrubs, gave richne[s]s and fa[s]cination to the [s]cene, whil[s]t the mild [s]outh-we[s]t breeze wa[s]ted their delicious odours to the [s]en[s]es, refre[s]hing and invigorating [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-285.jpg) \- external link  - Page 276. ] nature. From the front of the man[s]ion, the green banks [s]loped gently to the margin of the Schuylkill, and displayed the advantages of cultivation. Here were fields of ripened grain; here were pa[s]tures, where the [s]heep and cattle repo[s]ed in [s]afety, and fea[s]ted on luxuriant verdure. To a mind [s]o pure, [s]o every way formed to conceive and enjoy the beauties of nature as was that of our hero, the [s]cene was enchanting; he rode on, wrapt in contemplation and delight. At length perceiving the hou[s]e, which ju[s]t peeped from between the [s]urrounding trees, he a[s]ked, "Is that my father's hou[s]e?" "That is my hou[s]e," [s]aid Jacob. "And how far from hence is my father's place?" "This is the place the de[s]igned to purcha[s]e." "De[s]igned?" "Yes, but he went away before he concluded the bargain, and I have [s]ince made it mine." They had now reached the hou[s]e, entered a large gate and di[s]mounted, when Jacob, with affected solemnity and humility, welcomed Reuben to his homely dwelling, and pre[s]ented him to his wife Dinah, a pretty Quaker, who[s]e heart was naturally good, but who[s]e under[s]tanding was [s]carcely above mediocrity, and had been cramped by prejudice, and who[s]e knowledge of the world extended not beyond her own immediate family concerns. She loved Jacob [s]incerely; he was in her eyes the fir[s]t of human beings; and when [s]he pre[s]ented her hand to welcome Reuben, it was with an air of friendly cordiality; for he was the friend of her hu[s]band [s]he thought, and as [s]uch, claimed the fir[s]t place in her e[s]teem, and was entitled to every mark of re[s]pect and attention. She was more than commonly careful that her [s]upper [s]hould be good in its kind, and [s]erved with neatne[s]s. A chamber was prepared for him by her orders, and thither he retired at an early hour, to reflect on his own uncomfortable [s]ituation, and lament the ingratitude and di[s]hone[s]ty of Jacob Holmes. Settlement of Accounts---A Campaign. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-286.jpg) \- external link  - Page 277. ] The next morning after breakfa[s]t, Reuben requested to [s]ee a [s]tatement of his accounts, that he might be a judge of what he ought to do; but Jacob told him he expected his wife's father the en[s]uing day, and as he had been confidentially entru[s]ted with the mutual concerns between Mr. Dudley and him[s]elf, he thought he would be a proper per[s]on to be pre[s]ent at the final adju[s]tment of their accounts. To this delay Reuben with reluctance con[s]ented, and the day pa[s][s]ed on heavily enough; for notwithstanding the novelty, beauty and variety of the surrounding objects, his mind was too much occupied in reflections on his own [s]orlorn [s]ituation, and from thence reverted to the inconveniencies and misfortunes to which his beloved [s]i[s]ter might be [s]ubject, [s]hould he be detained from England, and by the fraud of Jacob Holmes rendered incapable of remitting her any pecuniary a[s][s]i[s]tance. On the following morning, Jacob's father-in-law arrived, and he, with great formality bringing out a heap of papers, began to read over to our hero long accounts of money paid. "And pray," [s]aid Reuben, "where is the account of the [s]ales of the merchandize from whence this money aro[s]e? My father left very confiderable property in your hands, and I have every rea[s]on to imagine the e[s]tate he purcha[s]ed here was entirely paid for, as he drew large [s]ums from his agent in England for that purpo[s]e." "Thou can[s]t not prove what thou do[s]t affert," [s]aid Jacob, with a look of malignant [s]atisfaction; "and I believe thou wilt find it difficult to di[s]po[s][s]e[s]s me of an e[s]tate, the title deeds of which are all made out in my name; and to prove my right thereto, I have the receipts given to me for various [s]ums of money, paid by me at different times, till the whole was paid for." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-287.jpg) \- external link  - Page 278. ] "But tell me," [s]aid Reuben, "who[s]e property was the money with which you made the[s]e payments? Was it not my father's." Reuben fixed his penetrating eyes on the face of Jacob, as he made this interrogation, who[s]e eye fell beneath the [s]crutinizing glance; he dared not meet the hone[s]t look; his cheek turned pale, his lips trembled, and his tongue [s]altered, as [s]tooping, with a pretence of replacing [s]ome papers in a box, but in reality to hide emotions he could not [s]uppre[s]s, he replied, that the money was his own. "Oh Jacob!" [s]aid Reuben, "how can[s]t thou a[s][s]ert [s]uch a fal[s]ehood? Does not thy heart [s]mite thee whil[s]t thou art thus deliberately planning to rob the orphans of their ju[s]t due?" His heart [s]welled; he could not proceed. Friend Simcox, the father-in-law of Jacob, took upon him to an[s]wer: "It was thy father, young man, who endeavoured to wrong the orphan of his ju[s]t due; it is thou ha[s]t occa[s]ion to blu[s]h for his evil deeds. This worthy young man has improved the trifle of property Reuben Dudley left behind him, and all demands again[s]t him di[s]charged, there remains a [s]um amounting to about fifty or [s]ixty guineas, which Jacob is ready to pay whenever thou [s]halt demand it; and I would advise thee to return home in the fir[s]t [s]hip that goes." A conver[s]ation now en[s]ued, which convinced our hero that he had little hope of ever obtaining his right; for was he even to apply to the law, money would be wanting to pro[s]ecute his [s]uit, or to prove his right to the e[s]tate, which was called Mount Plea[s]ant. Mr. Dudley had with him, at the time he was lo[s]t, all the original papers nece[s][s]ary to be produced, the duplicates of which were in the hands of Jacob. That all the papers were irrecoverably lo[s]t, Reuben had informed this unworthy [s]teward of by letter, immediately after the fatal cata[s]trophe. There was another circum[s]tance, which militated much again[s]t him, and with which he was not informed till that hour. Mr. Dudley had ever placed an [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-288.jpg) \- external link  - Page 279. ] unbounded confidence in Jacob Holmes; he was a man of ea[s]y di[s]po[s]ition, fond of agriculture, and [s]uch pursuits as might ultimately tend to benefit the country of which he was about to become an inhabitant, and to render his new purcha[s]e at once beautiful and beneficial. He had therefore, after having [s]urveyed the land, and had one conver[s]ation with the per[s]on of whom he was about to purcha[s]e it, entru[s]ted the whole management of the bu[s]ine[s]s to Jacob. The whole of the payment not having been made before he left Philadelphia, he had never had the deeds properly executed, and the news of his being drowned arriving before they were completed, Jacob conceived the idea of having them filled up in his own name. He had, from their fir[s]t arrival in Philadelphia, been artfully undermining the reputation of his benefactor, by representing him[s]elf as a youth of fortune entru[s]ted to his guardianship; and whenever he made a payment, he always gave the per[s]on to under[s]tand that it was his own money that he was advancing to [s]erve his friend Dudley. This idea having been artfully propagated, and univer[s]ally credited, and Mr. Dudley and him[s]elf being equally [s]trangers in the place, Jacob found no difficulty in procuring the e[s]tate to be [s]ecured to himself. He found it much more difficult to [s]ilence the admonitions of his con[s]cience. But the heart naturally ungrateful, by ea[s]y gradations may be habituated to admit, and even approve, every other vice. Gratitude is the foundation and [s]ource of all the moral virtues. For if we receive the many great and good gifts of our beneficent Creator without a grateful sensibility, we no longer love him; and whom we do not love, we become indifferent, whether we obey or [s]erve. Jacob [s]tifled the remon[s]trances of con[s]cience; and even when he [s]aw our hero, could he have done it without fear of the law, would [s]carcely have he[s]itated to give him a quick pa[s][s]port from this to a better world. The accounts adju[s]ted according to the plan Jacob had concerted, and which old friend Simcox never [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-289.jpg) \- external link  - Page 280. ] [s]crutinized, becau[s]e he wi[s]hed not to be undeceived, the paltry [s]um of fifty-[s]even guineas was offered to our hero, for which he was reque[s]ted to give a general acquittal of all demands whatever, on the per[s]on or property of Jacob Holmes. When this money and this curious acquittal were pre[s]ented to Reuben, the one for his acceptance, the other for his [s]ignature, his indignation aro[s]e beyond the bounds within which he had endeavoured to confine it. He ro[s]e from his [s]eat, pu[s]hing, with an indignant motion, the proffered money from him. "Add not in[s]ult to injury," [s]aid he, "Jacob Holmes; I would recapitulate who and what you are; but there are [s]everal forcible rea[s]ons that oblige me to [s]ilence. And fir[s]t---You, Jacob, are not an[s]werable for the faults of tho[s]e, who[s]e memories the grave has consigned to eternal oblivion; nor dare I [s]peak of obligations; for well I know he who conferred them, ever made it a rule to fix the [s]eal of [s]ilence on his own good deeds, and the faults of his fellow-creatures. As to taking the money you offer and [s]igning this acquittal, they are alike repugnant to my feelings. I have no demand on your property, Jacob; I a[s]k but for my own; the property of my late dear father is mine and my [s]i[s]ter's. For my[s]elf, I value it not. I am young, unencumbered, have hands to labour, or an arm to fight. I cannot want bread. But my [s]i[s]ter, lovely, innocent, unacquainted with the world, mu[s]t [s]he be dependent? Mu[s]t [s]he court the [s]miles of that world? Mu[s]t [s]he [s]ubmit to the contumely of the haughty, the [s]lights of the unfeeling, or the more humiliating pity of affected [s]en[s]ibility, and in return procure the [s]canty means of bare exi[s]tence? No! I cannot tamely give up her right, however I might relinqui[s]h my own. I do a[s][s]ert, Jacob Holmes, and you, friend Simcox, bear witne[s]s to the a[s][s]ertion, that this e[s]tate, this hou[s]e, this land, the [s]tock and all appertaining to it, is the joint property of my[s]elf and [s]i[s]ter Rachel, inherited from our father, Reuben Dudley; nor will I relinqui[s]h the claim whil[s]t I have exi[s]tence." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-290.jpg) \- external link  - Page 281. ] He took his hat, and walked towards the door; then turning, he added--- "Jacob, poor as thou ha[s]t, by thy di[s]hone[s]ty, made me, I pity thee. Yes, Jacob Holmes, I pity thee. Thou ha[s]t reduced me to poverty, and thy[s]elf to misery." Dinah, Jacob's wife, had overheard the conversation; not at fir[s]t intentionally, but pa[s][s]ing through the parlour that adjoined the room in which they were, and catching a word that awakened her curio[s]ity, [s]topped. Curio[s]ity, when once awakened, is hard to be repelled, at lea[s]t in women, [s]ay the oppo[s]ite [s]ex. Whether we are more troubled with the impul[s]e than our fathers, brothers, or hu[s]bands, I will not now di[s]pute; it is a certainty Dinah [s]topped to li[s]ten to a conver[s]ation which had powerfully excited her's. It has been remarked, that Dinah's under[s]tanding was not of the mo[s]t brilliant kind; but [s]he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed that plain, natural [s]en[s]e which enabled her to have a full and clear perception of right and wrong. Her wi[s]hes were moderate, her wants few. She was equally a [s]tranger to avarice, luxury and ambition. She li[s]tened to the accu[s]ation of Reuben, and all that [s]he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of [s]en[s]ibility was awakened; not that [s]he feared to be deprived of part of the comforts and conveniencies [s]he at pre[s]ent enjoyed; but the man whom [s]he thought the fir[s]t and be[s]t of all God's creatures, had been accu[s]ed of fraud; if innocently, her indignation would fall on his accu[s]er; if ju[s]tly, then Jacob Holmes was no longer the perfect being [s]he had ever believed him; and if guilty of di[s]hone[s]ty, Dinah felt [s]he could no longer re[s]pect him. Yet [s]he was unwilling to believe aught to his prejudice; [s]he therefore approached our hero as he left the apartment. "Thou mu[s]t not leave us in anger, Reuben Dudley," [s]aid [s]he, laying her hand on his arm as he attempted to pa[s]s her; "if Jacob has done thee wrong, I dare affirm it was not wilfully; and if thou can[s]t make it appear, he will make thee ample re[s]titution." "Do not detain me, madam," [s]aid he, gently freeing him[s]elf from her hold; "I am in ha[s]te to depart; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-291.jpg) \- external link  - Page 282. ] but I part not in di[s]plea[s]ure with you. God ble[s]s you, and make you as happy as you are innocent." Then ki[s][s]ing the child, which [s]he held in her arms, he went ha[s]tily to the [s]table, [s]addled his hor[s]e, and without any oppo[s]ition, mounted and proceeded to Philadelphia. Dinah entered the room where her father and husband were [s]itting. "Good Jacob," [s]aid [s]he, "let not the young man leave us in anger. I do remember his father; I have heard him [s]peak of thee with affection, as though thou had[s]t been his own child. I verily believe he did love thee, Jacob; for his [s]ake, let me call back the young man." "No," cried Jacob, with a [s]tern look, "[s]tay where you are (for [s]he was about to quit the room); the youth has behaved un[s]eemly, refu[s]es the money which I have tendered him, and lays claim to my whole estate." "And art thou [s]ure, quite [s]ure, Jacob Holmes," [s]aid [s]he, and her countenance expre[s][s]ed fear and doubt, "art thou quite [s]ure that he has no lawful claim upon thy property? In good truth, I thought he [s]poke as though he were a[s][s]ured of his right." "Dinah," [s]aid Jacob, "thou art a good woman; thou do[s]t under[s]tand thy hou[s]ehold concerns; they are [s]ufficient for the extent of thy capacity. I pray thee, Dinah, trouble not thy[s]elf with what is beyond thy comprehen[s]ion. Thou art a [s]tranger to the world, totally unacquainted with the arts and deceptions with which it abounds." "Verily thou [s]aye[s]t right," [s]he replied mildly, "but as I could not a[s][s]ert a fal[s]ehood without he[s]itating, nor claim what was the right of another, without blushing, I judged by the firm voice and unembarra[s][s]ed manner of the young man." "If thou did[s]t judge of him by thy[s]elf, Dinah," [s]aid her father, "thou did[s]t wrong." "Perhaps [s]o, father; I am [s]imple, and uninstructed. But I hope I am not equally wrong in judging of my hu[s]band's heart by my own; for I think, Jacob," continued [s]he, and [s]he laid her hand [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-292.jpg) \- external link  - Page 283. ] affectionately on his arm, "I think I would rather be poor and hone[s]t, than rich at the co[s]t of another; would[s]t not thou, Jacob?" Jacob could not reply, nor even lift his eyes to the face of his wife; he rather unkindly [s]hook off the hand [s]he had laid on his arm, and the child ju[s]t then beginning to cry, he bade her take away the noi[s]y boy, for it di[s]turbed him. Dinah obeyed in [s]ilence, repaired to a di[s]tant apartment, and as the infant drew from her bo[s]om life's nouri[s]hing fluid, [s]he hung fondly over him and wept. Our hero in the mean time returned to Philadelphia. His mind was hara[s][s]ed, his [s]pirits depre[s][s]ed; he endeavoured to compo[s]e him[s]elf, and to form [s]ome plan for his future conduct; but, inexperienced as he was, he wanted a friend to advi[s]e and direct him. "To-morrow," [s]aid he, "I will deliver the letters I brought with me." Reuben was elegant in his appearance, though perfectly plain in his dre[s]s; but there was an air of superiority, not pride or [s]elf-con[s]equence; it was that native dignity of manner, which is ever in[s]pired by conscious rectitude of heart and unimpeached integrity. His per[s]on was [s]triking, and what would in general be termed hand[s]ome. It will naturally be [s]uppo[s]ed he was therefore received with politene[s]s, and would have prepo[s][s]e[s][s]ed almo[s]t every one in his favour, but that almo[s]t all whom he conver[s]ed with were prejudiced per[s]ons, who conceived that Jacob Holmes's intere[s]t had been much injured by the extravagance and folly of his father. From [s]everal to whom he delivered letters, (which letters were nothing more than a [s]imple annunciation of his name and family) he received invitations to their hou[s]es; but when his circum[s]tances began to be [s]u[s]pected, and indeed the openne[s]s of his di[s]po[s]ition led him rather to expo[s]e than endeavour to conceal them; when it was di[s]covered he wanted friends who would be farther [s]erviceable than merely giving him a dinner, or a bed for a few nights; he found, by their di[s]tant, frigid manner, that he was no longer [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-293.jpg) \- external link  - Page 284. ] welcome, that he was thought an intruder. His independent [s]pirit took fire; he no longer vi[s]ited, he [s]hut him[s]elf in his apartment, lived [s]paringly, and revolved a thou[s]and different plans by which he hoped to immerge from ob[s]curity, and re[s]cue from oblivion the name of Dudley. He had applied to [s]everal professors of the law to give him advice and a[s][s]i[s]tance for the recovery of his right; but his poverty was known to be certain, his claims were [s]uppo[s]ed very doubtful; no one would undertake the cau[s]e. Can any [s]ituation be more di[s]tre[s][s]ing, than that of a young man, of brilliant under[s]tanding, a[s]piring genius, laudable ambition and uncorrupted heart, thus deprived of every means of improving his fortune, or exerting his talents, in [s]uch a manner as might at once be advantageous to him[s]elf and [s]ociety in general? In a large and flouri[s]hing town, without a friend, without even an a[s][s]ociate towards whom he felt the [s]malle[s]t degree of affection, how forlorn, how totally devoid of comfort were his days! A [s]olitary individual, who looked on the [s]urrounding multitude, whom business or plea[s]ure had drawn together, and [s]aw not one with whom the feelings of his [s]oul could claim kindred, not one who conceived or commi[s]erated his sufferings, or, [s]hould [s]ickne[s]s overtake him, would feel intere[s]ted for his recovery, or drop a tear of regret over his bier, [s]hould it plea[s]e Heaven to put a period to his exi[s]tence. Depre[s][s]ed by his own [s]ituation, and tortured by reflections on what might po[s][s]ibly be the di[s]tre[s][s]es of his [s]i[s]ter, Reuben had not courage even to write to her. "Why [s]hould I torment her," he would [s]ay, "by an account of my ill [s]ucce[s]s? Why write, when I have not one comfortable idea to tran[s]mit? No, I will [s]uffer her to [s]uppo[s]e I am no more; my [s]ilence will lead her to imagine I have paid the debt of nature. She will grieve, but time will [s]oothe and le[s][s]en her affliction, which even at the fir[s]t will not be half [s]o poignant, as the knowledge of my exi[s]ting in a [s]tate of ob[s]curity, without money, without credit, without friends would occa[s]ion." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-294.jpg) \- external link  - Page 285. ] Je[s][s]y Oliver too, would [s]ometimes intrude on his thoughts; but he endeavoured to bani[s]h hopes, which, [s]pite of rea[s]on, would often ari[s]e. "She is lo[s]t to me," he would [s]ay; "I [s]hall never [s]ee her more, or [s]hould I, will my ruined fortune entitle me to the hand of a woman of her rank? But Mi[s]s Oliver is above valuing a man for the paltry di[s]tinctions of wealth. Then ought I not to repel, with the utmo[s]t force of honour, every [s]elfi[s]h pa[s][s]ion that would in[s]pire a wi[s]h to degrade her by a union with my humble de[s]tiny?" The[s]e were the hourly reflections of our hero. Night came, and he, cheerle[s]s, [s]ought the pillow of repo[s]e, courting oblivion in the arms of [s]leep. But the [s]omnific power was deaf to his [s]olicitations; or if, perchance, he paid a tran[s]ient vi[s]it, [s]ealing his weary eyes for a few hours, Memory, [s]till wakeful, would repre[s]ent pa[s]t [s]cenes, or fondly paint illu[s]ive pre[s]ent joys. Rachel and Je[s][s]y were the objects of his dreams. Sometimes he [s]aw his [s]i[s]ter on the brink of a precipice, from the edge of which a horrid [s]pectre [s]trove to precipitate her, when, as [s]he fell, Je[s][s]y appeared with arms extended to catch and [s]ave her from plunging into the dreadful aby[s]s that yamned beneath. Sometimes his fancy repre[s]ented his [s]i[s]ter and Mi[s]s Oliver embarked in a [s]mall and ill-accommodated ve[s][s]el, on a tempe[s]tuous ocean; the [s]ky lowered, the winds howled, and glaring meteors [s]hot along the horizon; the waves ro[s]e tremendous, broke on the little barque, and [s]he di[s]appeared. Then in a moment he [s]aw the fair form of Je[s][s]y leading his fainting [s]i[s]ter up the beach, when, as they [s]trove to avoid the encroaching tide, their feet would [s]lip, and [s]ucceeding waves again immer[s]e them in the foaming flood; and then again an in[s]tantaneous change (for the vi[s]ions of [s]leep are wild and unconnected) would repre[s]ent tho[s]e dear objects of his fonde[s]t [s]olicitude [s]eated in an arbour of evergreens, twined round with myrtle flowers and ro[s]es. He [s]aw them, talked to them; [s]weet [s]miling infants [s]eemed to play around them. Archibald Oliver too was there, and a [s]tranger of noble mien. But [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-295.jpg) \- external link  - Page 286. ] [s]uddenly [s]ome new terror would ari[s]e; he [s]tarted, awoke, and all the fa[s]cinating vi[s]ion fled. Sleep thus agitated and di[s]turbed afforded but little refre[s]hment, and in a few weeks our hero was but the [s]hadow of his former [s]elf. About this period the natives, who had been driven back into the Allegany Mountains, and who had pitched their habitation, in different tribes, upon the furthermost banks of the Su[s]quehannah, Allegany and Mohawk rivers, made frequent de[s]cents into the new [s]ettled parts of the country, plundering, burning and de[s]troying with impunity every European [s]ettlement within their reach. In con[s]equence of the treachery and rapacity of the[s]e [s]avages, it became nece[s][s]ary to [s]end a military force to repel them, and guard the lives and properties of the inoffen[s]ive [s]ettlers; and Patrick Gordon, E[s]q. who at that time governed the colony, propo[s]ed rai[s]ing a volunteer company for this [s]ervice. Proper officers were accordingly appointed, and the company increa[s]ed daily. The noi[s]e this occa[s]ioned in the city awakened Reuben from his lethargy of de[s]pondency. The native [s]park of ambition, which had [s]o long lain dormant, was fanned to a flame, and with the [s]anguine ardour ever in[s]eparable from youth, vainly imagining to de[s]erve was to in[s]ure preferment, he offered him[s]elf to the Governor, and was accepted. His candour in [s]peaking of him[s]elf and circumstances; his youth, his manners, his open, unembarrassed air, and intelligent, manly countenance, [s]poke volumes in his favour, and procured him the honourable appointment of [s]tandard bearer. Early in the [s]pring, they began their plan of operations, and marched towards the margin of the Susquehannah. During the [s]pring and [s]ummer months, they had [s]everal rencounters with the Indians, and being in general victorious, they had driven and pur[s]ued them a farther di[s]tance into the country than they imagined, and the weather began to grow cold before they thought of returning. At length the officers [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-296.jpg) \- external link  - Page 287. ] having unanimou[s]ly agreed that it would be hazardous, as well as of little u[s]e, to pur[s]ue their retreating [s]oe any farther, preparations were made for their gaining good quarters before the inclement [s]ea[s]on [s]hould be too far advanced. The main body had began their march, and our hero, (who was now promoted to the rank of lieutenant) with a [s]mall party, was left to follow the next morning with the baggage. Among[s]t the party of which Reuben was [s]econd in command, was an Iri[s]h youth, who particularly attached him[s]elf to our hero. O'Neil was ignorant, but honest. Like an unpoli[s]hed diamond, his outward appearance was uncouth and rough; but within was a jewel of ine[s]timable price. Simplicity, integrity and humanity were the characteri[s]ties of his [s]oul. This young man was [s]o pointed in his attentions to our hero, that it could not pa[s]s unnoticed. One day, when he had been voluntarily performing [s]ome little menial office, Reuben thus addre[s][s]ed him: "By what good fortune, O'Neil, is it, that I am [s]o particularly favoured with your kind offices?" "Arrah, my [s]wate ma[s]ter," [s]aid O'Neil, "by no great matter of good fortune, only that your Honour happened to have a father." "Did you know my father, O'Neil?" "Och! and did you think I did not know him? Many is the time I havent [s]erved him, to be [s]ure; and while Pat O'Neil lives, he will [s]erve any that wears the name of Dudley, for his [s]ake; aye, by night or by day, fair weather or foul, all's one for that. And did you think now I could ever forget how he paid the money for that [s]wate crater, Madam Juliana, and how he had her nur[s]ed, and ---" It now [s]truck Reuben that he might, through O'Neil, learn [s]ome further intelligence concerning a circum[s]tance, which he had often thought of [s]ince the information he received from Jael, on the fir[s]t day of his arrival; for he naturally [s]uppo[s]ed that the Juliana he talked of was the unfortunate woman, who[s]e sorrows his father had alleviated. He put [s]everal questions to his humble friend, and gleaned from him a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-297.jpg) \- external link  - Page 288. ] tale which cannot be better related than in his own [s]imple language. "It was in dear Ireland," [s]aid he, "about fifteen miles from Dublin's [s]wate city, that my honoured ma[s]ter had a hou[s]e; I would tell you his name, but that I can't, becau[s]e, you [s]ee, I promi[s]ed Madam Juliana never to breathe a [s]yllable of the matter. She was all the child he had; and he thought [s]he was too good for the [s]un to [s]hine on, and [s]o [s]he was; but [s]he was not quite [s]o good neither, that is to [s]ay, [s]he might a done better than to li[s]ten to a [s]pallpeen of a lord that was an Engli[s]hman, only that he was born in Dublin. So he [s]aw her one day when [s]he was riding out, and he [s]poke to her, and rode home with her; and when my ma[s]ter [s]aw who he was, he turned him out of the hou[s]e, and never a[s]ked him into it; and I heard him tell Madam Juliana at [s]upper-time, that he was no better than he [s]hould be, an if he had [s]aid not half [s]o good, he would have [s]aid more in his favour than he de[s]erved. I was a boy, plea[s]e your Honour, then, and half a guinea tempted me to take a letter and give it to her. Och! the remembrance of that makes my heart ache very often; for if I had not been [s]o ea[s]ily per[s]uaded, my good ma[s]ter and my [s]wate lady might a been alive and happy together now. So [s]he did not mind what her father [s]aid, but wrote to him, and met him; and one evening he brought a chai[s]e and four hor[s]es. It was after [s]un[s]et, and the new moon gave but little light; [s]o [s]he [s]aid, "Patrick, will you walk with me as far as the Mill-Bridge?" "Now it was October, and the wind was [s]harp. So [s]ays I, `It is cold, my lady,' [s]ays I." "A little or [s]o," [s]aid [s]he, and her voice [s]eemed to tremble. "It is a little cold, Patrick, but here is something to keep you warm;" [s]o [s]he put a crown piece into my hand. So we went out together, and as I opened the gate, [s]he turned and looked up at the windows of her father's [s]tudy; for there was a big row of trees from the hou[s]e to the gate, and his [s]tudy windows were right oppo[s]ite. So [s]he looked at them, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-298.jpg) \- external link  - Page 289. ] and lifted up her hands and wrung them, and I heard her [s]ob." "You had better go back, Mi[s]s," [s]aid I; but [s]he made me no an[s]wer, only walked very fa[s]t forward; and when I [s]aw the lord and the chai[s]e, my mind misgave me, and I [s]aid, "Och! Mi[s]s July, what are you going to be after doing?" "Do not be frightened, my good lad," [s]aid [s]he, "but go back and take this letter to my father." "Go back?" [s]aid I, "no! no! Pat O'Neil does no [s]uch thing; I could not bear to [s]ee my poor old ma[s]ter die of the heart-break, or go crazy for your lo[s]s." "But you mu[s]t go back," [s]aid the lord. "But I won't," [s]aid I; "I will follow my mi[s]tre[s]s to the end of the world, and farther too if needs mu[s]t." "Och! your Honour, I cannot tell how I felt when I thought they were going away without me. He had lifted my poor lady in, who [s]eemed almo[s]t dying; [s]o I caught hold of her gown, and hung upon the [s]tep of the chai[s]e, and [s]wore never to quit my hold till my hands were cut off." "Let him go with us, poor fellow," [s]aid my lady. "He will betray us," [s]aid the lord. "No, I will not," [s]aid I; "let me go with my mi[s]tre[s]s, and I will not [s]peak a word to nobody; but I will protect her, fight for her, die for her." "Get up behind," [s]aid he. "I [s]prung up in a giffey, and away we went. Well, that night we went aboard a packet, and failed away to England, and there a Roman Catholic prie[s]t married them; but the fal[s]e-hearted lord never meant the thing that was right all this while; for in a week or two he grew cool, and at la[s]t told her he was no Catholic, and therefore not her hu[s]band, and that to provide for her during her life, he had got her a hu[s]band, and when [s]he was married, [s]he might go back to her father. So a captain u[s]ed to come with him, and I don't know how they managed; but Madam Juliana was married to him, and I thought the next day [s]he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-299.jpg) \- external link  - Page 290. ] would have gone di[s]tracted. She tore her beautiful flaxen hair, and wrung her hands, and cried and sobbed. So then, in a little while her hu[s]band went away over [s]ea, and then after Madam lay in, [s]he followed him, and when [s]he came to Philadelphia, he would not own her, and [s]he pined and pined, till at la[s]t---" Here the voice of poor O'Neil failed. His hone[s]t heart bur[s]t forth at his eyes. "Spare your[s]elf, Patrick," [s]aid Reuben, "for I think I know the re[s]t." "Not quite all, your Honour," [s]aid Patrick; "for on the day before [s]he died, your good father, Heaven ble[s]s him for it, let me [s]ee her. She was almo[s]t gone, and [s]poke [s]o low, I could [s]carce hear her." "Patrick," [s]aid [s]he, "I want to thank you for your [s]teady attachment to me. I would fain leave you [s]omething as a remembrance; but I have nothing left of any value." "My dear, [s]wate, angel lady," [s]aid I, "you will leave me the remembrance of your precious [s]elf. I never! no, never! [s]hall forget you." "I [s]ent for you," [s]aid [s]he, "to tell you, Patrick, that, [s]hould you ever [s]ee my father, he may know from you that I have been puni[s]hed, ju[s]tly, I own, though very [s]everely, for my di[s]obedience to the be[s]t of parents. I leave my child an orphan, in a [s]trange land; but my benefactor has promi[s]ed to take care of it. You, I know, will, to the utmo[s]t of your power, protect it." She fainted before [s]he had fini[s]hed; they took me out of the room, and I never [s]aw her again. Och! your Honour, [s]he is [s]urely in heaven; for to die heart-broken, and in poverty, in a [s]trange land, without any friends---Do you not think [s]he is in heaven? do you not think her [s]ins were pardoned?" "We will hope [s]o," [s]aid Reuben; "but disobedience to parents is certainly a deep offence again[s]t the commandments of our Creator." "But [s]he was very penitent," [s]aid O'Neil. Reuben was [s]ilent. After this conver[s]ation, there [s]eemed a kind of social bond formed between Reuben and the young [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-300.jpg) \- external link  - Page 291. ] Irishman; the latter performing all the offices of a [s]ervant, the other practi[s]ing all the kindne[s]s and benevolence of the be[s]t of ma[s]ters. The autumn nights were cold; O'Neil would watch till he [s]aw our hero in a [s]lumber, then, adding his own blanket to the [s]light covering of Reuben's bed, he would wrap him[s]elf as well as he could in his great coat, and lie down on the ground be[s]ide him. The baggage being placed in order ready for an early march, the [s]oldiers and officers were retired to re[s]t. O'Neil had, as u[s]ual, thrown his blanket over his ma[s]ter (as he delighted to call him) and the air being more than u[s]ually [s]harp, he found it impo[s][s]ible to [s]leep. He aro[s]e, and raking together the dying embers of a fire by which they had dre[s][s]ed their [s]upper, began to re-kindle it. As he was thus employed, he thought he heard a ru[s]tling among[s]t the trees; and turning half round, perceived, by the [s]aint light the fire ca[s]t around, the faces of two Indians peeping from behind a large tree. He gave a loud cry; the Indians uttered the war whoop; a [s]cene of confu[s]ion and horror en[s]ued, and in a few moments part of the little corps were [s]lain, the re[s]t wounded and made pri[s]oners. Among[s]t the latter was our hero, and his faithful adherent, Patrick O'Neil. Another Vi[s]it to [s]avage Habitations. There had, [s]ome little time previous to this event, been [s]everal of the Indian chiefs taken pri[s]oners by the Europeans, and it was to this circumstance tho[s]e, who were taken pri[s]oners by the natives, owed the pre[s]ervation of their lives, as the [s]avages entertained hopes that by means of the[s]e they might procure the liberty of their captured brethren. Their route lay acro[s]s the country, and before they had reached their place of de[s]tination, a very heavy [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-301.jpg) \- external link  - Page 292. ] fall of [s]now rendered the woods almo[s]t impenetrable; but the Indians, inured from their infancy to cold, hunger, every [s]pecies of hard[s]hip, felt little or no inconvenience from the [s]everity of the [s]ea[s]on, whil[s]t the Europeans [s]unk under their accumulated [s]ufferings; and of twelve who were taken pri[s]oners, [s]even died by the way. Reuben had been [s]lightly wounded, and O'Neil had received a [s]cratch, as he called it, in endeavouring to pre[s]erve his ma[s]ter, from the tomahawk of an Indian. But Reuben was by nature intrepid, and O'Neil was callous to every calamity that affected only him[s]elf. They mutually comforted and [s]upported each other, and were among[s]t the few who [s]urvived at the end of their weari[s]ome, pede[s]train journey. The morning after their arrival at the Indian settlement, the five [s]urviving captives were pre[s]ented to the [s]achem, Wampoogohoon. His wigwam was larger and more commodious than tho[s]e of his [s]ubjects. It was well lined with [s]kins of various wild bea[s]ts, and on a kind of throne, covered with the [s]ame materials, [s]at the [s]achem. At his left hand [s]at a woman, who[s]e complexion [s]poke her of European de[s]cent, and behind them [s]tood a young female, in appearance about seventeen years old. Her [s]kin was a [s]hade darker than that of the woman's; her eyes were of that kind of dark grey, which may almo[s]t be termed blue, and yet, from the [s]hade of long black eyela[s]hes, may [s]ometimes be mi[s]taken for black. Their expre[s][s]ion was at once [s]oft and animated, and her dark auburn hair, which did not really curl, but hung in waves down her back and over her [s]houlders, was ornamented with a few gla[s]s beads, and a tuft of [s]carlet feathers, [s]ancifully arranged, and not entirely devoid of ta[s]te. The re[s]t of her dre[s]s, though greatly [s]imilar to the other women, had a [s]omething of delicacy, in its formation and method of being put on, that was particularly plea[s]ing to Europeans. Her figure was above the middle [s]ize, yet not robu[s]t enough to be thought ma[s]culine, though every feature glowed with ruddy health, every limb di[s]played the [s]trength and firmne[s]s of her frame. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-302.jpg) \- external link  - Page 293. ] She [s]tood with her right hand leaning on the [s]achem's [s]houlder, in her left [s]he held an unbraced bow, and a quiver full of arrows was [s]lung acro[s]s her back. Wampoogohoon received the captives with a kind of [s]ullen dignity. He [s]poke to them in very bad English, but they under[s]tood [s]ufficient to comprehend that he mean to detain them till the captured Indians were returned in [s]afety. During the time he was [s]peaking, Reuben looked attentively at the two women, who from their places, and the univer[s]al re[s]pect paid them, he concluded were the wife and daughter of the chief. The pensiveness manife[s]t in the countenance of the elder, the beauty and maje[s]ty of the younger, awakened in his bo[s]om a wi[s]h to be acquainted with their [s]tory; for he was certain they were of European extraction, though of what nation he could not determine, as they had neither of them [s]poke. At length, when the conference was ended, and the [s]achem waved his hand for them to depart, his wife aro[s]e, and [s]poke to him in the Mohawk tongue. Reuben perceived, from the [s]oft tone of her voice and her earne[s]t manner, that it was a [s]upplication. He answered, but not with the gentle[s]t accent; [s]he laid her hand on his arm, and repeated her reque[s]t, in which [s]he was joined by Eumea, his daughter. He looked irre[s]olute for a moment, then [s]eeming to acquie[s]ce in their demands, arofe from his [s]eat, and taking his bow and arrows, was followed by his attendants out of the wigwam. The two intere[s]ting females now came forward, and the elde[s]t, who[s]e name was Victoire, addre[s][s]ed our hero in very tolerable French: "Stranger, I am [s]orry for your captivity, though my [s]ituation among[s]t the[s]e Indians makes me appear your enemy. Your[s]elf and companions are no doubt [s]urpri[s]ed, to [s]ee a per[s]on of my complexion [s]o intimately connected with one of theirs; my [s]tory may be told in a few words. My mother, a native of France, being of a prote[s]tant family, and apprehending per[s]ecution, emigrated to this new-found world, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-303.jpg) \- external link  - Page 294. ] in company with her hu[s]band, a man of [s]trict piety and principles. Their portion of worldly goods was not large; they purcha[s]ed a wild, uncultivated [s]pot upon the borders of the Allegany, and by five years of inde[s]atigable labour, rendered their little hut and [s]urrounding garden, together with one field, tolerably comfortable; but ju[s]t when they began to ta[s]te [s]ome [s]mall degree of happine[s]s, which would [s]earcely have de[s]erved the name, but by being contra[s]ted with the exce[s]s of hard[s]hip they had endured in clearing and rendering their little deme[s]ne fit for cultivation; then, at the moment when they hoped to reap the reward of their labours, a party of Mohawks came down upon them, rifled and de[s]troyed their dwelling, murdered my father and two little brothers, and carried my wretched mother and my[s]elf, then only a year old, into captivity." Victoire pau[s]ed; [s]he [s]eemed affected; a tear glistened in the expre[s][s]ive eyes of Eumea. At length the former proceeded:--- "My mother was a convincing proof of the exce[s]s of mi[s]ery the human mind can [s]uffer; [s]he [s]urvived the lo[s]s of a hu[s]band tenderly beloved, and two children. I was her comfort, her [s]tay, which held her to this world; for my [s]ake [s]he bore captivity without murmuring, for my [s]ake [s]he wi[s]hed and [s]trove to preserve her exi[s]tence; [s]he lived till I was fourteen years old, and gave me every in[s]truction which memory furnished, for [s]he had no a[s][s]i[s]tance from books. She instilled into my young mind a knowledge and love of a [s]upreme, benignant Being, and taught me to place my whole dependence on him, who[s]e goodne[s]s was equal to his power. "Wampoogohoon was the younge[s]t [s]on of the sachem, who at that time governed this tribe; he offered me his protection. My mother, in a dying [s]tate, rather than leave me expo[s]ed to in[s]ult, advi[s]ed me to accede to his propo[s]al, and I became his wife. His father and brothers are [s]ince dead, and you behold him a chief of the Mohawks. He is not unkind to me, and as the father of my children, I feel an [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-304.jpg) \- external link  - Page 295. ] affection for him. Eumea is the only [s]urviving child I have of [s]ix; for her [s]ake, I wi[s]h for [s]ome intercour[s]e with the Europeans, that her mind, which is not a barren [s]oil, may receive the culture of education. To this end, I have reque[s]ted my hu[s]band to permit you to have a wigwam to your[s]elves, where you may dwell in quiet, till we hear of the [s]afety of tho[s]e Indians who have been detained by your party. In return, I only reque[s]t you to exert your abilities to in[s]truct, in your language, cu[s]toms, manners and religion, my child Eumea." Saying this, [s]he pre[s]ented the Indian maid to Reuben, who a[s][s]ured Victoire he would do all in his power to return the obligation [s]he had conferred. He was then, with his companions, [s]hewn to a habitation that wore a trifling appearance of comfort; in it were three or four bear [s]kins, a quantity of clean dry [s]traw, [s]ome dried fi[s]h, veni[s]on and maize, and without was plenty of fuel. Here our hero indulged him[s]elf in reflection; and often would his thoughts revert to his grandfather, William Dudley, who was for many years in a situation [s]omewhat [s]imilar. But Reuben had [s]een too much of [s]avage men and manners to have a wi[s]h to remain among[s]t them, even though he might have been elevated to the highe[s]t [s]eat of dignity. It was at once a comfort and amu[s]ement to Reubeh, that he was obliged, for [s]everal hours every day, to employ his mind, in order to cultivate that of his pupil Eumea. He contrived, by boiling the [s]humak berries, to make a liquid with which he could write on white birch bark. In this manner, he made an alphabet, which [s]he pre[s]ently learnt; and [s]eeming to delight in attending to his in[s]tructions, he experienced a double [s]atisfaction in endeavouring to expand and inform her under[s]tanding. She was [s]oon able to read [s]hort [s]entences, which he compo[s]ed for her; his hand being generally employed, and his mind often totally occupied in [s]triving to recollect what might be of the mo[s]t [s]ervice to his lovely [s]cholar, he had little time for reflection. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-305.jpg) \- external link  - Page 296. ] O'Neil laboured ince[s][s]antly to keep their dwelling warm and tight; and [s]ometimes he went out with his gun, and brought home [s]ome kind of game which [s]erved to diver[s]i[s]y their [s]canty repa[s]ts; and often Victoire would accompany her daughter to their wigwam, and on tho[s]e occa[s]ions generally carried [s]omething which they thought a delicacy, [s]uch as noa-cake, omanny, or [s]uccata[s]h, viands compo[s]ed of maize and dried beans; and thus wore away a very long and intensely [s]evere winter. Reuben had been a pri[s]oner above [s]ix months, and yet no news had arrived that could rai[s]e his hopes of [s]peedy liberation; and we mu[s]t leave him among[s]t the[s]e children of nature, and return to our heroine, whom we left married to Hamden Auberry, but living in the vicinity of Mary-lebone, under the a[s][s]umed name of Dacres. Scandal---Separation---Jealou[s]y. It has been already remarked, that Rachel had as little curio[s]ity in her compo[s]ition as any woman exi[s]ting: [s]he was al[s]o by nature of a retired, quiet turn of mind, though ea[s]ily led into [s]cenes of dissipation, in which, as [s]he generally mixed to gratify others, [s]he took but little [s]atisfaction. She therefore [s]pent the chief of her time at home, either employed at her needle, or reading. Hamden was fond of music; he had procured her a [s]pinnet and a ma[s]ter. She had a con[s]iderable ta[s]te for drawing; Hamden was a proficient in the art; he directed and improved her judgment; pointed out proper [s]ubjects for the exerci[s]e of her genius, and with her book, her pencil, her necdle, mu[s]ic, and [s]ome few dome[s]tic concerns, [s]he [s]o [s]weetly diver[s]ified her time, that not one moment hung heavy on her hands. Indeed, Rachel had, from her childhood, been taught that mo[s]t u[s]eful, and to tho[s]e who practi[s]e it, that mo[s]t plea[s]ant of all le[s][s]ons, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-306.jpg) \- external link  - Page 297. ] con[s]tant employment; that it is better to be engaged in trifling pur[s]uits (if innocent) than [s]uffer the mind to [s]ink into inanity for want of exerci[s]e. Hamden remained in London about a month or [s]ix weeks after their marriage. He then left her to return to his aunt, who was [s]till in Scotland; and at the time he bade his dear Rachel adieu, he purpo[s]ed returning to her within the [s]pace of two months. After the departure of her hu[s]band, our heroine continued the [s]ame regular cour[s]e of life. But calumny, who has a hundred ears, a thou[s]and eyes, and ten thou[s]and tongues, not one of which is ever [s]uffered to [s]lumber for an in[s]tant, could not permit her to enjoy her favourite and inoffen[s]ive employment unmole[s]ted. Though Rachel had imagined that the uniform tenor of her conduct was [s]uch, as might defy even the prying eyes of malice and envy, yet [s]he felt there was [s]omething wrong in her appearance. She went by an a[s][s]umed name; yet, confident that [s]he was in reality the wife of Aubevry [s]he al[s]o felt that though [s]he had tran[s]gre[s][s]ed the bounds of prudence, [s]he had [s]trictly adhered to the rules of virtue and morality; and this internal a[s][s]urance gave her great comfort. And when retiring for the night, [s]he would reflect that her heart was in univer[s]al charity with all her fellow-creatures, that her pur[s]uits were altogether harmle[s]s, and in [s]ome degree laudable; a [s]weet serenity would diffu[s]e it[s]elf through her bo[s]om, and offering up her prayers for the [s]afety of her beloved Reuben, and her almo[s]t adored hu[s]band, [s]he would [s]ink into a [s]lumber, as compo[s]ed and refre[s]hing as her own mind was pure and uncontaminated. The heart that is it[s]elf a [s]tranger to guilt [s]u[s]pects it not in another. Such was the heart of Rechel; without enthu[s]ia[s]m pious, without oftentation charitable, and innatcly virtuous, without an idea that there was any particular merit in being [s]o; [s]ince, without being in[s]en[s]ible to the inevitable mi[s]ery that mu[s]t and ever will follow the forfeiture of that ine[s]timable jewel, cha[s]tity, [s]he wondered how [s]o many heedle[s]s women fell into an error [s]o repugnant to her own feelings. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-307.jpg) \- external link  - Page 298. ] As Major Auberry was certain he could not remain long with his wife, when he [s]ecured her a hand[s]ome and convenient place of re[s]idence, he was not forgetful of the plea[s]ure that would naturally re[s]ult from a companion of her own [s]ex being under the [s]ame roof with her. In his [s]earch after lodgings or a ready furni[s]hed hou[s]e, chance directed him to Mrs. Varnice, the widow of an attorney, who[s]e pride would not [s]uffer her to leave the hou[s]e her hu[s]band had engaged but a [s]hort time before his death, and who would, to [s]upport that pride, (the real origin of which was meanne[s]s, not real dignity of [s]oul) [s]ubmit to any thing but labour. At the time Major Auberry applied for the upper part of her hou[s]e, [s]he knew him, and that his name was not Dacres. "But he will pay me well," [s]aid [s]he mentally; [s]o [s]he concealed her knowledge, and agreed to our heroine's becoming the mi[s]tre[s]s of the apartments. When Rachel was fir[s]t introduced to her, [s]he observed her lovely, maje[s]tic form, and [s]weetly intersting countenance. Mrs. Varnice was [s]hort, rather too much em bon point , dark complexioned, and on the wrong [s]ide of forty; but her eyes, which were of jetty hue, and who[s]e brilliancy [s]he endeavoured to increa[s]e by an artful tinge of rouge on her high cheek-bones, were animated and expre[s][s]ive, and [s]he was not without hope that [s]ome future conque[s]t might [s]ecure to her a [s]econd matrimonial e[s]tabli[s]hment. To [s]uch a woman, the fir[s]t appearance of our heroine was by no means prepo[s][s]e[s][s]ing. "She is certainly hand[s]ome ([s]aid [s]he, on the day Rachel took po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of her new lodgings) [s]he is hand[s]ome, I mu[s]t own; but your pretty women have [s]eldom much to recommend them be[s]ides their beauty." This remark was made to a poor relation, who was dependent on Mrs. Varnice for bread; an unfortunate being, who, from want of education, and extreme poverty, po[s][s]e[s][s]ed a mind as abject as her circumstances. Education, [s]pirit of light, being of the fir[s]t order, who in thy right hand do[s]t hold a magic mirror, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-308.jpg) \- external link  - Page 299. ] displaying to the a[s]toni[s]hed [s]en[s]e of youth the wondrous, fa[s]cinating charms of nature; who, [s]till receding as we pur[s]ue, yet [s]till di[s]playing [s]omething [s]trange and charming, invite[s]t the admiring pupil [s]till to follow; who[s]e left hand holds a tablet, on which is written all that was learnt from thy in[s]tructive mirror; who as thou pa[s][s]e[s]t, giving place to age, who hangs his head and droops that thou can[s]t charm no more, pre[s]ente[s]t the tablets, whence fond memory gleans [s]omething to cheer the la[s]t cold eve of life, and being tran[s]mitted to the ri[s]ing age, incite them to attend thy earlie[s]t call, follow thee through thy mo[s]t intricate labyrinths, that, as thou do[s]t a[s]cend the hill of fame, holding before them [s]till the in[s]tructive gla[s]s, each ri[s]ing age may take a higher [s]tep, till frail humanity [s]tands on thy [s]ummit:---Education, thou fir[s]t, be[s]t gift that mortals can receive; tho[s]e who know thee not, conceiving not thy intrin[s]ic value, [s]light thee, condemn thee, treat thee with contempt; but they who feel thy influence, benignant power, will revere thee, wor[s]hip thee, and court thy [s]miles, humbly entreating that the ri[s]ing age might fully comprehend and ta[s]te thy beauties. Rachel had received a good, though not a brilliant education; her mind was therefore free from prejudice. Mrs. Varnice and her cou[s]in Lettuce were totally uncultivated, and [s]uper[s]tition and prejudice were ea[s]ily admitted and encouraged. The former of the[s]e women, therefore, concluded our heroine to be a deluded victim to inexperience and affection. She thought the infatuation (as [s]he called it) of Hamden would not la[s]t long, and wi[s]ely imagined, by paying the mo[s]t marked attention to him, by giving up her own opinion whenever it was in oppo[s]ition to his, and in a hundred different forms, which [s]he conceived to be the height of complai[s]ance, but which to Auberry him[s]elf appeared to have partook more of abject servility, to [s]upplant her in his good opinion; however, as he imagined her, in the main, a good-natured, ino[s][s]en[s]ive woman, he encouraged her advances to an intimacy with Rachel. He knew the purity of our heroine's mind, and native good [s]en[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-309.jpg) \- external link  - Page 300. ] would prevent her receiving any ill impre[s][s]ions, or contracting any low ideas from conver[s]ing with a woman every way [s]o infinitely her inferior, and at the [s]ame time thought her knowledge of the world might guard the inexperienced Rachel from impo[s]itions. If the fir[s]t fight of our heroine awakened in the bosom of Mrs. Varnice the malignant fiend envy, her manners and conver[s]ation a[s][s]i[s]ted to heighten it, and in le[s]s than a fortnight Mrs. Varnice pronounced her to be proud, conceited, fooli[s]h, in [s]hort, every thing that was the direct oppo[s]ite to her real di[s]po[s]ition. Yet [s]he concealed her opinion, and would take opportunities to admire her under[s]tanding, prai[s]e her [s]hape, her complexion, even the tone of her voice. Rachel was not greedy of flattery; but where is the human being that can at all times turn a deaf ear to its adulating voice, or [s]teel their hearts to its in[s]inuating qualities? When Anberry left his wife to go to his aunt in Scotland, Mrs. Varnice had not an idea that he meant to return, and felt [s]omewhat mortified that all her arts to attract his notice had proved ineffectual; but as [s]he found it would be to no u[s]e to repine, [s]he turned her thoughts to what advantage might be made of our heroine. The parting between Major Auberry and his lady had been extremely painful on both [s]ides. Rachel's heart [s]unk within her, and as the chai[s]e drove from the door, her emotions became [s]o violent, that Mrs. Varnice was obliged to lead her into her own parlour, and give her a gla[s]s of drops and water. "Come, come, my dear Madam," [s]aid [s]he, as Rachel endeavoured to [s]uppre[s]s her tears, "you mu[s]t not give way to this immoderate [s]orrow; Mr. Dacres, I dare [s]ay, will [s]oon come back again; I [s]uppo[s]e he is not gone very far." "Four hundred miles," [s]aid Rachel, "appears to me an immen[s]e di[s]tance; and I know not how to account for it, but I feel [s]uch an oppre[s][s]ion at my heart, it [s]eems as though I had beheld him for the la[s]t time, and yet I know he will return as early as po[s][s]ible." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-310.jpg) \- external link  - Page 301. ] "O! to be [s]ure he will; he promi[s]ed to come back [s]oon, did not he?" "He will come as [s]oon as he can, I know; but the length of his [s]tay does not depend entirely on him[s]elf. However, he has promi[s]ed I [s]hould hear from him very often, and I [s]hall count the moments with impatience till I can hope to receive a letter. I have been very trouble[s]ome to you, Madam," continued [s]he, ri[s]ing to quit the parlour; "pray pardon my childi[s]h behaviour; I will retire and endeavour to attain fortitude to bear this fir[s]t (and I hope in Heaven it will be the la[s]t) [s]eparation." Her eyes filled again as [s]he [s]poke, and courte[s]ying ha[s]tily, [s]he repaired to her own apartment; and having di[s]burthened her heart by giving a free cour[s]e to her tears, [s]he compo[s]ed her [s]pirits; and a[s][s]erting that under[s]tanding which was ever ready at her call, [s]he began to employ her[s]elf on a piece of embroidery, the pattern for which was drawn by Hamden; from that [s]he went to her [s]pinnet, and played as well as [s]he could a trifling air which he had taught her. The[s]e employments amu[s]ed and [s]oothed her. She became composed, and determined, during this enforced and painful ab[s]ence, to occupy her[s]elf in acquiring tho[s]e accomplishments which [s]he knew would be mo[s]t agreeable to her hu[s]band. Every trace of the primitive puritan was now entirely aboli[s]hed, except that [s]he was extremely neat in her dre[s]s, and [s]imple in her manners. She followed fa[s]hion as far as [s]he thought it con[s]i[s]tent with propriety, but no farther; and though [s]trangers would pronounce her perfectly elegant at the fir[s]t glance, were they to [s]crutinize the [s]everal articles that compo[s]ed her apparel, they would be at a lo[s]s to [s]ay what particularly con[s]tituted that elegance. In [s]hort, Rachel was the kind of woman who gives ta[s]te and fa[s]hion to every thing [s]he wears, however plain its formation, however common the materials of which it is made. The [s]tate of her mind, after the departure of her hu[s]band was [s]uch, as precluded every idea of [s]eeking [s]ociety during the day. She attempted, but the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-311.jpg) \- external link  - Page 302. ] attempt was vain, to partake of a meal which the care of Lettuce had provided (for Lettuce had performed the office of attendant on the per[s]on of our heroine from the fir[s]t day of her re[s]idence in the hou[s]e of Mrs. Varnice); but towards evening [s]he began to reflect, that the [s]olicitude and attention of her ho[s]te[s]s demanded [s]ome return; [s]he therefore reque[s]ted [s]he would come and take tea in her apartment. It was now the middle of October, and the twilight at that period [s]oon clo[s]es; it was [s]ix o'clock, when the tea things were placed on the table; a cheerful fire illumined the hearth, two wax candles lent their rays to enliven the [s]cene, the windows were clo[s]ed, the curtains let down, and perfect [s]ilence reigned in the apartments. The hou[s]e was as retired as though twenty miles from London, and not a [s]ound interupted the tranquillity of the [s]urrounding [s]cene, [s]ave now and then the rattle of a [s]olitary carriage pa[s][s]ing to and from the environs of the city. If there is a moment in which the human mind is more inclined to unbend, and place an unlimited confidence in tho[s]e who profe[s]s a friend[s]hip, it is, when fully comprehending the charms of [s]olitude, we find that [s]olitude may be enlivened by being participated by one who enters into all our feelings, and [s]miles or weeps as the colour of our fate or expre[s][s]ion of our [s]entiments excites the oppo[s]ite emotions. Such was the moment we have ju[s]t de[s]cribed, nor was our heroine in[s]en[s]ible to its influence. "I am glad to [s]ee you [s]o much recovered," [s]aid Mrs. Varnice, [s]eating her[s]elf at the tea-table, and drawing the tea-board towards her, which Lettuce had ju[s]t brought in; "[s]hall I [s]ave you the trouble and make the tea?" Rachel acknowledged her goodne[s]s, and acquie[s]ced in the propo[s]al. "I [s]uppo[s]e Mr. Dacres," [s]aid [s]he with a [s]igh, "is now many miles di[s]tant from me; and [s]uppo[s]e he writes at the fir[s]t po[s]t town, when may I expect to hear from him?" "That I cannot tell," [s]aid the artful Mrs. Varnice, "unle[s]s I knew what road he took." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-312.jpg) \- external link  - Page 303. ] "The High North-road." "Well, you may hear from him [s]ooner, but I do not imagine he will write till he gets to York. He is a beautiful man," taking a miniature in her hand that hung by a ribbon round Rachel's neck, "a very handsome man indeed; and I think there is [s]omething in your countenances very much alike, very much indeed, ju[s]t about the eyes and the mouth; that pretty dimple, ju[s]t at the left corner. Well, you were certainly relations." "No indeed, we were not, I never [s]aw him till within eight months of our union." "Indeed! Well, I could have [s]worn you had been cou[s]ins. Where were you married, in London?" "In We[s]tmin[s]ter." "In We[s]tmin[s]ter? what at the Abbey?" "No." "At St. James's Church?" "No." "Oh! you were married at St. Margaret's?" "No, I was not." "Ble[s]s me, then what church was it?" "Pardon me, I am not at liberty to [s]ay." Mrs. Varnice [s]miled. "Ah! I under[s]tand now; it was a [s]tolen match?" "Not entirely [s]o." "What, I [s]uppo[s]e your friends knew it?" "I have no friends in England." "None?" "No, not one. I have a brother, a dear, respectable, worthy brother; but he is in America." "In America? Dear me; what all among[s]t the blacks and the wild Indians?" Rachel could not [s]uppre[s]s an inclination to [s]mile, whil[s]t [s]he an[s]wered, "No, Madam, among[s]t the European [s]ettlers, who have, within the la[s]t century, emigrated into the new world, which I under[s]tand is a fertile continent extending from north to [s]outh, and con[s]tituting one entire quarter of the habitable globe." "And [s]o, your brother is gone over [s]ea to tho[s]e [s]trange parts. And what could tempt him to leave dear little England?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-313.jpg) \- external link  - Page 304. ] "To inquire after property my father left there." "Dear well, how odd! And [s]o your father died abroad." "No, he was lo[s]t on his pa[s][s]age home, even when in [s]ight of his native [s]hores." "Oh dear! how unfortunate! So you have no friends in London?" "In London? No, nor in England, except my husband." "Dear me! Well, I hope he will prove a faithful, good hu[s]band to you." "I have no doubt of his faith or tenderne[s]s." "Oh dear no! I dare [s]ay not; though men are [s]trange, incon[s]tant beings, will profe[s]s much without meaning any thing, marry women under a[s][s]umed names, and never care for them after a little while." "There may have been [s]uch things," [s]aid Rachel; "but for the honour of human nature, I could wi[s]h not to believe them po[s][s]ible till my [s]en[s]es convince me." "Sweet innocent! I wi[s]h you may never be convinced," [s]aid Mrs. Varnice pointedly. This exclamation awakened [s]omething in the bo[s]om of Rachel, that could not rightly be termed either jealousy or curio[s]ity, but it was a mixture of both; and the artful Varnice led her on, till [s]he had gleaned from Rachel (only that names were concealed) every circumstance relating to her[s]elf, her brother and her hu[s]band. After a day or two pa[s]t in that kind of uncomfortable, unconnected manner, which every per[s]on of sensibility mu[s]t have experienced when [s]eparated from the cho[s]en friend of their hearts, Rachel began again to re[s]ume her u[s]ual avocations. Her needle employed the earlie[s]t hours of morning, after which [s]he dre[s][s]ed, and walked into the fields for air and exerci[s]e. Her dinner pa[s]t, [s]he employed the intermediate hours between that and evening with a book, her pencil, or a le[s][s]on on her [s]pinnet; and the evenings were u[s]ually pa[s][s]ed in reading to, conver[s]ing and working, or playing picquet with, Mrs. Varnice. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-314.jpg) \- external link  - Page 305. ] But during this period, it mu[s]t not be imagined that [s]he was entirely forgotten by her quondam friends, the Web[s]ters. They had been indefatigable in their inquiries, till they found out her lodgings, and hearing that [s]he went by the name of Dacres, they were persuaded that [s]he had forgot the re[s]pect due to her[s]elf, and become the mi[s]tre[s]s of Hamden Auberry. Mr. Spriggins, though at fir[s]t mortified and disappointed by her [s]udden departure from his aunt's hou[s]e, [s]oon found con[s]olation, by transferring his devoirs to his elde[s]t cou[s]in, by whom they were very favourably received; and an old uncle having left him a decent hou[s]e, [s]hop and [s]tock in trade, in a market town in Northumberland, he [s]oon obtained the a[s][s]ent of Mrs. Web[s]ter, and took her fair daughter, to [s]hine forth in all the airs and finery of a London bride, and to [s]et the fa[s]hions for three months to come, to all the tradesmen's wives and daughters in a little country town. His [s]hop too was newly painted and decorated in the London [s]tyle, and Mr. Spriggins him[s]elf was [s]o polite, [s]o obliging, that he [s]oon attracted a large number of cu[s]tomers. Beginning the world thus, not only without embarrassments, but with a [s]mall [s]um of ready money in hand, this young couple found, in a very [s]hort time, that they were in a fair way to accumulate a fortune. The wife, though proud, vain, and fond of finery, was meanly par[s]imonious, and would [s]tint her family in nece[s][s]aries, in order to buy a finer gown, or give a more expen[s]ive treat than her neighbours. Belle Web[s]ter was [s]ent for to be her companion, and [s]et her cap at [s]ome of the [s]mart young men, in hopes of an e[s]tabli[s]hment for life; while little Polly was left to a[s][s]i[s]t and con[s]ole her mother for the lo[s]s of her two elde[s]t daughters. When Hamden Auberry reached his uncle's [s]eat, he was received with [s]uch affectionate tokens of joy by lady Anne, that he was almo[s]t tempted, in that moment of tenderne[s]s, to throw him[s]elf on her mercy, and confe[s]s his marriage. Happy had it been, both for him[s]elf and our heroine, had he followed the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-315.jpg) \- external link  - Page 306. ] impulse; but he took time to con[s]ider, and that fal[s]e pride, which was his only foible, repre[s]ented to him, that he was [s]ecure of the per[s]on and heart of Rachel, bound to her by the mo[s]t irrevocable vows; he hazarded nothing, therefore, by longer concealment. But to avow his engagements with a woman in re[s]pect to rank and fortune [s]o diametrically oppo[s]ite to what lady Anne de[s]ired, might forfeit her regard forever; nay, this very pride flattered him that it was for the [s]ake of his wife he [s]till wi[s]hed to conceal their union, and that the wealth and con[s]equence in lady Anne's power to be[s]tow were only valued by him, as, by possessing them, he could elevate the woman of his choice to a rank [s]he was born to adorn. Alas! this was fal[s]e rea[s]oning; it was in reality an unwillingne[s]s to give up the re[s]pect, the parade, the ea[s]e and conveniencies, wealth is ever certain to in[s]ure. Two days after his arrival in Scotland, the family were [s]urpri[s]ed by the [s]udden and unexpected appearance of lady Lucy. The tour to the continent had been [s]hortened by an untoward incident, and [s]he having, on her return, landed at Harwich, [s]he proceeded immediately north, without going to London. Lady Anne was not di[s]plea[s]ed by the return of her niece; [s]he looked upon Hamden as the certain [s]ucce[s][s]or to the title and e[s]tates of his late grandfather, but [s]he thought a union with lady Lucy might by no means retard the completion of her wi[s]hes, which were to [s]ee him at the head of her family. It was the evening after the arrival of this lady, that, [s]itting in a family way with only her aunt and cousin, and diverting them with her vivacity and innocent prattle, when, turning [s]uddenly to Hamden, [s]he cried, "Oh! by the bye, Coz, how does your pretty Quaker girl do?" Hamden's face was but a trifle paler than his coat. He he[s]itated, attempted to an[s]wer; but finding himself at a lo[s]s for words, affected a laugh. "You may laugh," cried [s]he, "but I declare I thought her very pretty." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-316.jpg) \- external link  - Page 307. ] "Who are you [s]peaking of?" [s]aid lady Anne, fixing her eyes on the glowing face of Hamden. "Oh! he knows," continued the thoughtle[s]s girl, "and now I have the [s]cene full in my mind, I'll tell you, aunt. You mu[s]t know we went to the play.---" "Nay, dear Lucy," [s]aid Hamden, gaily catching her hand, "how can you remember [s]uch ridiculous trifles?" "Your [s]ervant, cou[s]in Hamden; it was no trifle at the time. Now, aunt, I'll tell you how it was. Between the play and farce, I had ob[s]erved a very pretty, intere[s]ting Quaker, who [s]at in the pit looking very earne[s]tly at Mr. Hamden. I [s]uppo[s]e [s]he had [s]een him before. Eh, cou[s]in?---Well, dear aunt, the hou[s]e was very full, and the pretty Quaker fainted; when behold ye, my gentleman here takes a leap over the front of the box, and ru[s]hing through the crowd, flew to her a[s][s]i[s]tance. But if you had [s]een when [s]he recovered---" "A little moderation, if you plea[s]e, lady Lucy," cried Hamden, eagerly interrupting her; "you paint the [s]cene in [s]uch lively colours, that my aunt will suppose the bagatelle of con[s]equence." "And your manner, Hamden, does not contradict the [s]uppo[s]ition," [s]aid lady Anne pointedly. "Pray who was this fainting dam[s]el?" "It was a Mi[s]s Dudley," [s]aid Hamden, in a hurried accent; "I was introduced to her when I la[s]t visited my mother." "Indeed!" [s]aid lady Anne, [s]arca[s]tically. "Yes, [s]he was a great favourite of my mother's; but I under[s]tand [s]he is lately married to an old crony of mine, one Dacres. I am [s]ure, aunt, you mu[s]t remember what friends Tom Dacres and I were when boys." "And are you friends now?" [s]aid Lucy with a half [s]mile and a [s]ly glance at her aunt. Lady Anne was [s]truck with the evident embarrassment of Hamden; [s]he therefore put an end to the conver[s]ation by ri[s]ing and de[s]iring him to attend her to her clo[s]et. Here a conver[s]ation en[s]ued, which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-317.jpg) \- external link  - Page 308. ] convinced Auberry, that the moment his aunt [s]hould be a[s][s]ured of his having formed a family connexion with our heroine, would be the la[s]t of her favour. "I mu[s]t di[s][s]emble longer," [s]aid he. Alas! dissimulation is [s]eldom nece[s][s]ary, can never be laudable, and was in this ca[s]e de[s]picable.---But we will return to our heroine. The fir[s]t [s]ix weeks of her hu[s]band's ab[s]ence [s]he bore with tolerable patience; when a month more pa[s][s]ed over, and no hope of his return, [s]he murmured at the delay; but when, at la[s]t, week after week glided on, and Auberry did not appear, [s]he began to de[s]pond. Mrs Varnice was not [s]urpri[s]ed; it was what [s]he had expected. She by flow and almo[s]t imperceptible degrees endeavoured to undermine the principles of our heroine; but Rachel, though not quick at di[s]cerning evil (becau[s]e almo[s]t a [s]tranger to its baneful qualities) at la[s]t di[s]covered her aim, and repul[s]ed her with the [s]corn [s]he merited. But innocence is ever inadequate to oppo[s]e, with any degree of [s]ucce[s]s, the united powers of envy and cunning. In revenge for the contempt with which [s]he had been treated, Mrs. Varnice [s]uppre[s][s]ed the next letter with which Lettuce was entru[s]ted to carry to the po[s]t, opened, read it, and committed it to the fire. By the tenor of this letter, [s]he comprehended that Rachel fully believed her[s]elf the wife of Auberry; but this [s]he knew before, and inwardly laughed at what [s]he [s]uppo[s]ed to be the credulity of a fond, un[s]u[s]pecting girl. Having once began to interrupt the corre[s]pondence, [s]he did not he[s]itate the next po[s]t-night to make Lettuce keep watch at the [s]treet door, and prevent the rap of the po[s]t-man, which would have immediately called our heroine down [s]tairs. The [s]tratagem succeeded; [s]he took the expected letter from the postman's hand, paid the po[s]tage, and retired to her own apartment to read it. It has often been [s]aid, that envy is its own puni[s]her, and in this ca[s]e the adage was completely verified; for when from this letter [s]he di[s]covered that Hamden [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-318.jpg) \- external link  - Page 309. ] really was, and freely acknowledged him[s]elf, the husband of our heroine, her heart overflowed with rancour, and [s]he determined to he[s]itate at nothing which might be likely to poi[s]on the happine[s]s of one [s]he at once envied and hated. One act of guilt leads but to the commi[s][s]ion of another; it is in vain the human heart may think only this one little deviation, and I will [s]top. As the ball precipitated from the [s]ummit of a hill pau[s]es not, but ru[s]hes with amazing velocity till it reaches the very lowe[s]t part of the vale beneath, [s]o the human [s]oul, giving way to temptation, [s]inks from error into guilt, nor pau[s]es till plunged in the lowe[s]t aby[s]s of depravity. Another and another letter from Hamden was opened by Mrs. Varnice, whil[s]t tho[s]e from Rachel (who[s]e heart now began to throb with fear, doubt, and a thou[s]and anxieties, which none but tho[s]e who are united to, and [s]uffering an early [s]eparation from, the man of their choice can conceive) [s]uffered the [s]ame fate. At length one arrived inclo[s]ing a bank bill for a hundred pounds. At the [s]ight of it, Mrs. Varnice turned pale; fear was the fir[s]t emotion of her bo[s]om. But not even Lettuce was privy to the receipt of this letter. Mrs. Varnice was not very economical; a hundred pounds would relieve her from [s]ome few embarrassments. She looked at it, pau[s]ed for a moment, at length, committing the letter to the fire, [s]he deposited the note in her pocket-book, and on the en[s]uing morning exchanged it at a [s]ilk mercer's where [s]he purchased a gown of ro[s]e-coloured tabby. This note would have been very acceptable to Rachel; for [s]he began to be [s]en[s]ible of the decrea[s]e of her finances, and to experience the [s]olicitude and pleasing cares of maternal tenderne[s]s; and to prepare for the reception of a little [s]tranger, [s]he had nearly exhausted the whole of the money Hamden had given her at parting. It cannot be [s]uppo[s]ed that the mind of Hamden was in a much ea[s]ier [s]tate than that of our heroine; but as he was now on a party of plea[s]ure with his uncle, lady Anne and lady Lucy, making excur[s]ions [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-319.jpg) \- external link  - Page 310. ] from one part of Scotland to another, and [s]taying but a few days in each place, he reconciled him[s]elf to not hearing from his wife, under the idea that her letters might not follow him as he directed, and that he [s]hould get them all together when he returned to Gla[s]gow. But when he returned, and found not a [s]ingle letter waiting for him, he felt the utmo[s]t impatience, and would have [s]et off immediately for London, but that his aunt was attacked with an alarming fever, and to leave her at [s]uch a period, would be the height of ingratitude. She lingered long, and even when pronounced out of danger, [s]till hovered as it were on the brink of the grave for many weeks, and at length change of climate was ordered as the only chance of perfect re[s]toration. Hamden, who[s]e mind was now tortured almo[s]t beyond [s]ufferance, finding that he [s]hould be obliged to attend his aunt to Li[s]bon, whil[s]t preparations were making for the voyage, di[s]patched his confidential servant to London, to make inquiries for and bear remittances to our heroine. Though this man may ju[s]tly be termed confidential, yet [s]o fearful had Hamden been of having his marriage known, that even he was not entru[s]ted with the [s]ecret, and Rachel was humiliated even in the eyes of her hu[s]band's [s]ervant. But her manners were [s]uch as had ever [s]ecured re[s]pect from James, and the hone[s]t fellow, often when he thought of her [s]ituation, pitied her, and blamed his ma[s]ter. Nearly [s]even months had now elap[s]ed [s]ince the marriage of our heroine, above five of which [s]he had been [s]eparated from her hu[s]band, and half of that period had pa[s][s]ed in the continual di[s]tre[s]s of alternate expectation and di[s]appointment. "I have been deceived," [s]he would [s]ay, whil[s]t tears of angui[s]h [s]tole down her cheeks; "Hamden no longer loves, no longer thinks of me, and, for[s]aken of him, who is there in this va[s]t univer[s]e, (for Heaven alone can tell whether my dear brother is in exi[s]tence) who then is there that cares for the unhappy Rachel? And forlorn, for[s]aken, wretched as I am, I [s]hall give life to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-320.jpg) \- external link  - Page 311. ] a helple[s]s innocent, who[s]e father will perhaps blu[s]h to own him." Rachel's days were joyle[s]s, and the tear of angui[s]h fell nightly on her pillow. The ro[s]e no longer bloomed on her cheeks, nor did the animated beam of health and internal peace dance in her expre[s][s]ive eyes; pale, languid, heart-broken, [s]he [s]uffered in [s]ilence; for to whom could [s]he complain? Mrs. Varnice had expo[s]ed to her, her true character, and Rachel would not hold communication with a woman [s]he de[s]pi[s]ed. She nur[s]ed her grief in solitude. If [s]he endeavoured to amu[s]e the heavy hour, by her pencil or mu[s]ic, every flower [s]he drew was moi[s]tened by her tears, and the chords of the instrument reverberated but the [s]trains of melancholy. It was a fine morning in the beginning of March, that, [s]till con[s]idering it a duty to u[s]e every method to pre[s]erve health, (though life was no longer valuable) Rachel walked to the green park. It was an early hour; [s]he did not fear being met by any one who knew her; there were but few by whom [s]he would be recognized, and tho[s]e few [s]eldom vi[s]ited the park except on a Sunday evening, to [s]ee and be [s]een. As with [s]low [s]tep [s]he paced along the margin of Rosamond's Pond, [s]he was [s]tartled by a voice which suddenly exclaimed, "Heavens and earth! Mi[s]s Dudley!" She rai[s]ed her eyes, and beheld Archibald Oliver. A [s]udden emotion, [s]omething like [s]hame, ru[s]hed upon her heart; [s]he ju[s]t articulated his name, extended her hand towards him, and, tottering to a [s]eat that was near, [s]he [s]unk on it almo[s]t fainting. "Good God! my dear Mi[s]s Dudley, to what am I to attribute the[s]e emotions?" "My name is Dacres, Sir," [s]aid Rachel; but her voice faltered, and the carnation vi[s]ited her cheeks as [s]he remembered her very apparent [s]ituation. "You are married then?" "Yes." "May you be happy, happy as you de[s]erve. But why thus alone? it is not [s]urely proper. Where is Mr. Dacres?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-321.jpg) \- external link  - Page 312. ] The [s]ormer intimacy that had [s]ub[s]i[s]ted between Oliver and our heroine could alone have excu[s]ed the[s]e abrupt interrogations; but Rachel had ever considered him as a brother, and new ties, new affections, had made him behold her now only in the endearing light of a [s]i[s]ter. "My hu[s]band is in Scotland," [s]aid Rachel, "whither he was called by bu[s]ine[s]s of con[s]equence; but come (continued [s]he, forcing a [s]mile) if you are disengaged, walk home with me, and I will tell you all you wi[s]h to know, and in return be very inqui[s]itive concerning your happine[s]s." Then, with that innocent freedom that gave a charm to all her actions, [s]he pa[s][s]ed her hand through his arm, and they pur[s]ued their way to her lodgings, engaged in [s]uch intere[s]ting chat, that they had reached the door before either imagined they were half way. During their walk, Rachel told as much of her own [s]tory as could be done without infringing the vow [s]he had voluntarily made to Auberry never to divulge his real name and family till authorized by him; and in return, [s]he learnt that Oliver had experienced a very tolerable [s]hare of happine[s]s in his matrimonial connexions, that his wi[s]e was then in town, and had ju[s]t made him a father. Of Je[s][s]y he could give her no information, and [s]ince our heroine's marriage, that young lady had declined the corre[s]pondence of Rachel, alleging, as [s]he no longer [s]hared her con[s]idence, [s]he would not intrude her letters where [s]he mu[s]t [s]uppo[s]e them unwelcome. This had at the time given Rachel much pain; but as Hamden would not allow her to explain her [s]ituation to her friend, [s]he was forced to relinqui[s]h a corre[s]pondence [s]o dear to her heart, and with it all intercour[s]e with the only woman [s]he had ever known whom [s]he thought really de[s]erved the name of friend. Oliver could not on that morning [s]et above half an hour with our heroine; but on the en[s]uing day he called, and drank tea with her. After this, [s]carce a day pa[s][s]ed but he inquired after her health. He [s]aw there was [s]omething of my[s]tery enveloped her; he [s]aw [s]he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-322.jpg) \- external link  - Page 313. ] was not happy; and though his knowledge of her heart, under[s]tanding and principles made him reject the idea whenever it intruded it[s]elf, he [s]ometimes almost [s]eared [s]he had been imprudent. To the afflicted heart, the voice of friend[s]hip is a [s]oothing cordial. Rachel had not heard its adulating [s]ound for [s]everal months previous to her meeting with Oliver. She dreamt not of impropriety, and, uncon[s]cious of evil, dreaded not cen[s]ure. His vi[s]its were always welcome, and the day pa[s][s]ed drearily in which [s]he [s]aw him not. It has been already remarked, that the greate[s]t and almo[s]t only [s]ault of our heroine was a too great openness of di[s]po[s]ition, in regard to her own circum[s]tances or bu[s]ine[s]s; [s]he never thought of concealment, and nothing but the mo[s]t unbounded affection for Auberry could have prompted her to enter into engagements which would involve her conduct in apparent my[s]tery, and oblige her to wear for a while the veil of concealment. To Oliver, therefore, only concealing his real name and family, [s]he was explicit in regard to her fears for the health and life of her hu[s]band; [s]he al[s]o, without he[s]itation, mentioned the embarra[s][s]ed [s]tate of her [s]inances. Oliver offered her money; but, though [s]he [s]ought con[s]olation from the [s]oothings of friendship, her [s]pirit ro[s]e above pecuniary obligation. She was grateful for the offer, but firm in her refu[s]al to avail her[s]elf of it. On the evening when this explanation took place, Oliver had [s]upped with Rachel, and the hoar[s]e voice of the watchmen proclaiming half pa[s]t eleven o'clock, was the fir[s]t thing that reminded them it was time to break off their intere[s]ting conver[s]ation. They had talked of Reuben, of Je[s][s]y, and the doubtful [s]ate of tho[s]e dear relatives had drawn tears from both their eyes. "I mu[s]t leave you, Mrs. Dacres," [s]aid he, ri[s]ing and taking his hat. Rachel rang the bell; but no one an[s]wering, [s]he took one of the candles from the table, and de[s]cended the [s]tairs to light him out. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-323.jpg) \- external link  - Page 314. ] "Good night, my dear Madam," [s]aid he; "do not come to the door, you will take cold." "Good night, Mr. Oliver," [s]aid Rachel; and as he pulled the door after him, [s]he turned the key, put the chain acro[s]s, and turned to re-a[s]cend the [s]tairs, when, to her [s]urpri[s]e, the parlour door opened, and Mrs. Varnice appeared. "Ble[s]s me," [s]aid Rachel, "I thought you were all in bed." "Oh! I dare [s]ay you did, and hoped it too." "Hoped, Madam! I neither hoped, nor cared; only I rang the bell for Lettuce to light Mr. Oliver out, and as [s]he did not an[s]wer it---" "I would not let her an[s]wer it; and let me tell you, Mrs. Dacres, (if that is your name) I think your conduct very unwarrantable; and if you mu[s]t have gentlemen vi[s]iting you in your hu[s]band's ab[s]ence, and [s]taying till twelve or one o'clock, you mu[s]t get another lodging; for I will have no [s]uch goings on in my hou[s]e. Mr. Dacres, (as you call him) if he is your hu[s]band, will have no great rea[s]on to be plea[s]ed with your conduct; and if he is not, why, my hou[s]e is a hou[s]e of good repute, and the [s]ooner you quit it the better." Petrified with a[s]toni[s]hment, Rachel could not answer for the [s]pace of a minute; at length, re[s]entment conquering her [s]en[s]ibility, [s]he replied: "Had I [s]uppo[s]ed you entertained [s]uch humiliating ideas of me, Madam, I would not [s]o long have remained an inmate in your habitation; but, painful as it is to me, I [s]hall be nece[s][s]itated to [s]tay [s]ome little time longer till I can di[s]charge my account with you. I [s]hall not leave a hou[s]e whil[s]t I am indebted to the mi[s]tre[s]s of it." "No, I'll take care of that," [s]aid Mrs. Varnice, with a malicious grin; "I [s]hall hardly let you go in my debt when I can detain any valuable property to the amount. But I [s]hall [s]ay no more to-night, to-morrow you mu[s]t look out for another place, and pay me how you can; for paid I will be, or you mu[s]t take the con[s]equence, and [s]o good-night." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-324.jpg) \- external link  - Page 315. ] Rachel would have [s]aid good-night, but the words [s]tuck in her throat; [s]he [s]lightly inclined her head, and pa[s][s]ing ha[s]tily up [s]tairs, [s]unk almo[s]t [s]ainting on the neare[s]t [s]eat. Lettuce, who had been tutored by Mrs. Varnice, followed her up, pretended to blame her cou[s]in, and take the part of our heroine. "I will not [s]tay in the hou[s]e," [s]aid Rachel, "but how to rai[s]e money to pay her." "Dear! that would be no difficult matter," [s]aid Lettuce, "[s]o many pretty trinkets as you have! Tho[s]e bracelets now---" Rachel looked on them and [s]ighed. "I cannot part with them," [s]aid [s]he, "they were the fir[s]t pre[s]ent I received from my hu[s]band." Well, but you have [s]uch a va[s]t number of pretty things, your watch and your etwee!---" This conver[s]ation let our heroine into a [s]ecret with which [s]he was before entirely unacquainted---that [s]he could rai[s]e a [s]um of money on the[s]e baubles without entirely parting with them; and [s]he went to bed with a full determination to quit the man[s]ion where [s]he had been [s]o much in[s]ulted, the en[s]uing morning. It may well be [s]uppo[s]ed [s]he [s]lept but little; [s]hort moments of forgetfulne[s]s, and tho[s]e interrupted by horrid vi[s]ions, were all [s]he could obtain. At the dawn [s]he aro[s]e, and [s]o earne[s]tly did [s]he [s]et about a removal, that by twelve o'clock, [s]he had paid the exorbitant demands of Mrs. Varnice, and was [s]eated in her new lodgings; though to accompli[s]h this point [s]he had di[s]po[s]ed of almo[s]t every thing of value [s]he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed, not excepting the bracelets, for which [s]he had expre[s][s]ed [s]o much regard. Two days after this removal, James arrived, commissioned by his ma[s]ter to make inquiry after our heroine. The tale told by the arch-[s]iend, Mrs. Varnice, filled his hone[s]t heart with horror. "Receive the vi[s]its of gentlemen, obliged to leave the lodgings in which his ma[s]ter had placed her, and go into others, on account of keeping bad hours, and other di[s]orderly behaviour. Good Sirs," [s]aid James, I can hardly believe it; [s]he was [s]o good, [s]o mode[s]t, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-325.jpg) \- external link  - Page 316. ] [s]o mild. It made one's heart glad to look at her; and to hear her talk, would a made an old man young again. Body o' me! there mu[s]t a been [s]ome witchcraft u[s]ed to make her change [s]o all of a [s]udden." But to all James's inquiries of where [s]he was removed to, they pleaded ignorance; and he being restricted in the time allowed him to make the journey, could not [s]tay [s]o long as he wi[s]hed to make inquiries in the neighbourhood. With a heavy heart, he [s]et forward on his return to his ma[s]ter; but near Berwick, the carriage was over[s]et in which he was travelling, and his right arm broken. Hamden, agonized almo[s]t to di[s]traction by his long ab[s]ence, the cau[s]e of which he was not acquainted with, (as a [s]ever and delirium, which immediately [s]ucceeded the accident, provented James from taking any method to let his ma[s]ter know his [s]ituation) was obliged to embark with his aunt, without receiving the lea[s]t intelligence of the [s]ate of Rachel. `She has forgotten me, [s]he repeants her union with me,' he would [s]ay, `and [s]eeks for an opportunity to break tho[s]e engagements which I have he[s]itated to announce to the world.' In the[s]e moments he would be ready to reveal all to his aunt; but the fear that Rachel no longer loved him, or perhaps was no longer worthy of his affection for her, always withheld him; and the voyage to Lisbon, though in it[s]elf extremely plea[s]ant, [s]eemed to the unhappy Hamden to teem only with vexation, and when landed, and the fir[s]t bu[s]tle of [s]eeking a lodging, &c. was over, he walked through the [s]treets like a discontented [s]hade; indeed, it was but the [s]hadow of Hamden Auberry, for his better part was flown to the [s]hores of Albion, where it hovered round the man[s]ion in which he imagined [s]till dwelt the object of his dearest affection. Sorrows of the Heart. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-326.jpg) \- external link  - Page 317. ] In the mean time, the afflictions of our heroine daily increa[s]ed. Oliver had left London; [s]he was without friends and without money, and to increa[s]e the [s]orrows of her heart, [s]he became the mother of a fine boy about the middle of June. Before her confinement, [s]he entru[s]ted her ho[s]te[s]s with the real [s]tate of her [s]inances, and to retrench her expen[s]es, had taken a room on the [s]econd [s]tory, where [s]he [s]uffered in [s]ilence all the mi[s]eries of di[s]appointed love, added to the poignant [s]ting of poverty. Once [s]he wrote to Mrs. Auberry; had [s]he addre[s][s]ed the letter to Dr. Lenient, [s]he had done right. But Mrs. Auberry had received a letter from Mrs. Web[s]ter, which had prejudiced her again[s]t Rachel; [s]he therefore did not mention to her brother that [s]he had heard from her, and threw the letter into a draw, without deigning to give our di[s]tre[s][s]ed heroine the comfort of one line in an[s]wer. During her con[s]inement, [s]he was told by the woman who attended her, that a very fine lady had taken the range of apartments on the fir[s]t floor, which con[s]i[s]ted of a dining-room, drawing-room, and bedchamber; that [s]he had taken them only for a few weeks, whil[s]t her own hou[s]e was fini[s]hed and properly furni[s]hed. "She is a charming lady," [s]aid the talkative old woman, "and keeps her chariot, her own maid and footman." All this intelligence appeared of [s]o little consequence to our heroine, that [s]he [s]carcely heard a syllable of the whole harangue; but the next day, as [s]he was pa[s][s]ing from the bed to the [s]ofa at the other end of the room, [s]he ca[s]t her eyes ca[s]ually out of the window; an elegant chariot drew up to the door, and to her utter a[s]toni[s]hment [s]he [s]aw Mrs. Courtney de[s]cend from it. Lo[s]t in amazement, [s]he [s]at down; that her eyes had not deceived her, [s]he was certain. To what could [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-327.jpg) \- external link  - Page 318. ] [s]he attribute this [s]udden elevation of fortune? This was a riddle [s]he had not power to unravel; but whatever was the cau[s]e, [s]he rejoiced at the effect, and, forgetting the coldne[s]s [s]he had experienced from La Varone immediately after her marriage with Lieutenant Courtney, con[s]cious only of a plea[s]urable [s]en[s]ation, to find a per[s]on with whom [s]he had formerly lived in habits of intimacy [s]o near her, [s]he wrote with a pencil on a [s]lip of paper, "Dear Mrs. Courtney, your friend Rachel is again an inmate of the man[s]ion you inhabit, and flatters herself you will give her the plea[s]ure of your company for half an hour." This billet [s]he [s]ent by the nur[s]e, and in a few moments Mrs. Courtney entered the apartment. The attendant withdrawn, and a few common-place inquiries pa[s]t, "You cannot think, my dear Madam," [s]aid our heroine, "what real plea[s]ure it gives me to find Mr. Courtney's pro[s]pects [s]o much amended, [s]ince your marriage." "Yes, he is made a Captain; be[s]ides, a particular friend of mine, whom I had not [s]een for many years, has [s]ettled on me a very hand[s]ome income, which makes me quite independent." "How fortunate!" [s]aid Rachel in the [s]implicity of her heart. "And where is Captain Courtney?" "Gone to India." "Is either of your [s]i[s]ters, or your mother-in-law in town with you?" "Oh dear no." "They are well, I hope?" "Yes, quite well; that is, I believe [s]o, for I have heard nothing to the contrary, but I have not [s]een them lately." "No?" "No, not for the[s]e three months pa[s]t. But come, tell me, my demure friend, what changes have taken place in your [s]ate [s]ince we parted." With a look of mingled confu[s]ion and candour, in the [s]imple language of truth did Rachel explain to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-328.jpg) \- external link  - Page 319. ] Mrs. Courtney every circum[s]tance of her marriage and con[s]equent unea[s]ine[s]s, [s]till concealing the real name of her hu[s]band. She [s]poke to a woman who[s]e heart was impure, and who [s]crupled not to judge of others by her[s]elf. Be[s]ides, Mrs. Courtney had been to vi[s]it Mrs. Webster, and had learnt from her the manner of our heroine's departure from her hou[s]e, and with whom it was [s]uppo[s]ed [s]he re[s]ided. She laughed at the affliction Rachel appeared to experience from her hu[s]band's neglect, called her agony of heart ideal mi[s]ery, told her the honey moon could not la[s]t forever, bid her keep up her [s]pirits, and, promifing to [s]ee her again in the evening, left her. Accordingly, in the evening [s]he again vi[s]ited her. "I have been thinking, Mrs. Dacres," [s]aid [s]he with a half [s]mile, and looking [s]idelong from under her dark eyela[s]hes, "that change of [s]cene and air would be of [s]ervice to you. I am going into Northumberland, to vi[s]it our old acquaintance, Mrs. Spriggins; what [s]ay you to a jaunt? You will travel at your ea[s]e with me in the chariot, Pelham will help take care of the child, and I dare [s]ay the journey will not be the le[s]s agreeable becau[s]e it will take you near the borders of Scotland." A tinge of carnation pa[s][s]ed over the languid cheek of Rachel, as [s]he [s]aid [s]he [s]hould like [s]uch an excursion, but it was not in her power to take it. "What, for want of money, I [s]uppo[s]e? P[s]haw! non[s]en[s]e! you cannot be wholly de[s]titute; a tri[s]le will [s]erve, and you [s]urely wi[s]h to be nearer the Major than you are at pre[s]ent." Rachel's heart beat quick, as [s]he attempted to reply. Mrs. Courtney put her hand before her mouth, "Come, don't deny it; I have found out your secret, but I won't betray you. Perhaps, when you are within a day's journey, he may be able to vi[s]it you. London is at a va[s]t di[s]tance from the banks of the Clyde." There is nothing more difficult to a per[s]on of natural veracity than to be under the nece[s][s]ity of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-329.jpg) \- external link  - Page 320. ] afferting a [s]al[s]ehood. Rachel [s]elt the impo[s][s]ibility of doing it, and remained [s]ilent. In [s]hort, her innocence, her credulity, her ardent wi[s]h to be near her hu[s]band prevailed, and [s]he con[s]ented to accompany Mrs. Courtney into Northumberland. But, however liable to err from the frankne[s]s and candour of her temper, Rachel had [s]till that pride of [s]oul which could not conde[s]cend to tell Mrs. Courtney that three guineas, and a few clothes, con[s]tituted the whole of her worldly po[s][s]e[s][s]ions. Part of tho[s]e clothes, with [s]ome very [s]ine laces, were di[s]po[s]ed of to pay the nur[s]e and other contingent expenses; and with a mere trifle in her pur[s]e, our heroine departed with her unworthy affociate from London. Mrs. Courtney was deceived when [s]he invited Rachel to take, this journey with her; but it was the depravity of her own heart had deceived her, and before the reached Northumberland, [s]he di[s]covered that the mind of our heroine was [s]till uncontaminated, [s]till pure, and [s]hrunk from vice with di[s]gu[s]t, turned from immorality with abhorrence. On their arrival at Mr. Spriggins's, Mrs. Courtney was received with a profu[s]ion of compliments, whil[s]t Rachel was [s]carcely noticed. She was [s]hown to an upper apartment, and, weary as [s]he was with the journey, [s]uffered to undre[s]s the child her[s]elf, and put him to bed. She laid him on the pillow of repo[s]e, and, kneeling be[s]ide the bed, poured forth her afflicted [s]oul to her Maker. Her cheek re[s]ted on the [s]ame pillow with that of her infant, and her tears flowed without re[s]traint. She [s]elt that the pretended friend[s]hip of Mrs. Courtney was only o[s]tentation; [s]he feared [s]he had more to [s]u[s][s]er than [s]he [s]hould be able to [s]upport. She prayed for re[s]ignation to the will of Heaven, and her tears continued to [s]low, not from impatience, they were the effu[s]ions of an afflicted [s]pirit. After a few weeks re[s]idence in the family of Mrs. Spriggins, Rachel perceived that not even a [s]hadow of re[s]pect and attention towards her[s]elf remained in the manners of the whole family. At meals, [s]he was suffered to take the lowe[s]t [s]eat at the table, where [s]he was [s]ometimes [s]o totally overlooked, as not to be helped [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-330.jpg) \- external link  - Page 321. ] till every one el[s]e had begun their dinner; and then [s]he was in[s]ulted by an affectation of friendly familiarity, [s]uch as, "Ble[s]s me, Mrs. Dacres, I had forgot you; but why don't you [s]peak? you are at home you know." At the[s]e moments, Rachel's heart would [s]well to her eyes, and in [s]truggling to [s]uppre[s]s her tears, the food [s]he attempted to [s]wallow [s]eemed almo[s]t to choak her. Mrs. Courtney di[s]agreed with and di[s]charged her woman, and the next day reque[s]ted our heroine to ri[s]e from her [s]eat, and fetch her work from the other end of the room. Had Rachel been independent, [s]he would without he[s]itation have complied with the request; but Rachel was poor, and [s]he felt the reque[s]t an in[s]ult. "I am not qualified to [s]upply the place of your [s]ervant, Madam," [s]aid [s]he haughtily. "Why I do not [s]uppo[s]e you are," [s]aid Mrs. Courtney, yawning indolently; "but indeed, child, circumstanced as you are, I do not know what you could do better than endeavour to get a place; though to be [s]ure your child is an objection." The expre[s][s]ive eyes of our heroine fla[s]hed indignation, at the in[s]olent manner and propo[s]al of her oftentatious friend; but [s]he di[s]dained to an[s]wer. `I am not yet fallen quite [s]o low as that,' thought [s]he, and ro[s]e to quit the apartment. "I really am [s]orry for you, child," continued Mrs. Courtney, detaining her, "but painful as it is for a per[s]on who is [s]o much intere[s]ted for your welfare as I am to [s]peak di[s]agreeable truths, I really mu[s]t tell you, that the haughty airs you give your[s]elf are very unbecoming; you mu[s]t learn humility." "I hope I [s]hall in time," [s]aid Rachel indignantly, "if I do not, I [s]hall profit but little by your endeavours." "Come, come, you mi[s]under[s]tand me; if you do not incline to do [s]omething for a livelihood, I really think it would be advi[s]eable for you to go on to Scotland to your hu[s]band. I expect a friend of mine here [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-331.jpg) \- external link  - Page 322. ] in a few days, with whom I am going to make a tour through the northern counties; if you choo[s]e to go with me in quality of a companion, and take the care of my clothes, a[s][s]i[s]t me to dre[s]s and undre[s]s, I will pay you twenty guineas a year; but then you mu[s]t leave your child here at nur[s]e." "No, Mrs. Courtney," [s]aid Rachel, "if I am obliged to eat the the bread of [s]ervitude, I will earn it of strangers, not of one who once thought her[s]elf honoured in being called the friend of Rachel Dudley. I will be the humble companion (or rather a [s]lave on which ill humour may be lavi[s]hed with impunity) to no one. I would gladly embrace your fir[s]t propo[s]al of [s]eeking my hu[s]band, but you know I have not the means of pro[s]ecuting the journey, even by the cheape[s]t conveyance." "Heavens and earth!" replied Mrs. Courtney, with a look of well-affected [s]urpri[s]e, "is it po[s][s]ible you can have come into this [s]trange place without any money? And what do you mean to do, child?" "To be no longer trouble[s]ome to you, Madam," [s]aid Rachel. "I thank you, Madam," continued [s]he, "for the [s]helter your roof has [s]o long afforded me," turning to Mrs. Spriggins, who had [s]at a [s]ilent and in[s]en[s]ible [s]pectatre[s]s of the [s]cene, "but will no longer intrude; but this very night remove to a habitation better [s]uited to my pre[s]ent humble condition." She then ha[s]tily left the room. On the [s]tairs [s]he met Belle Web[s]ter. "What is the matter, Mrs. Dacres?" [s]aid [s]he; for the tears, which a laudable pride had re[s]trained whil[s]t [s]he was in the pre[s]ence of her in[s]olent ho[s]te[s]s and her companion, wounded [s]en[s]ibility forced in a torrent from her eyes the moment [s]he had [s]hut the door. "What is the matter?" [s]aid Belle. "Nothing," replied our heroine, "only I have [s]tayed here too long." "Dear! I'm afraid [s]i[s]ter has been vexing you; well, don't mind her, you know [s]he never was very good natured." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-332.jpg) \- external link  - Page 323. ] "I do not mind either her or her a[s][s]ociate," [s]aid Rachel; "but I wi[s]h to relea[s]e them from an unwelcome intruder, and [s]hall leave the hou[s]e immediately. Do me the favour, Mi[s]s Web[s]ter, to reque[s]t one of the [s]ervants may take my trunk to the inn." "Dearee me! I hope you are not in earne[s]t?" "In very earne[s]t, I a[s][s]ure you." "Well, now I'm quite [s]orry." "I thank you, Mi[s]s Web[s]ter. Will you a[s]k the favour I reque[s]t?" "Oh! to be [s]ure I will; but you won't go before tea?" "Before another hour," [s]aid Rachel firmly. Belle was not overburthened with under[s]tanding; [s]he did not perfectly comprehend the delicacy of our heroine's feelings, nor did [s]he give her[s]elf the trouble to think much about it; [s]o wi[s]hing her health, [s]he descended the [s]tairs, and [s]ent up a boy to take her trunk. It was between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, when Rachel, taking her dear boy in her arms, and followed by the lad with her parcels, left the hou[s]e of Mr. Spriggins, and went to [s]eek a lodging in a town, to almo[s]t every inhabitant of which [s]he was a perfect [s]tranger. She knew that the public inns afforded lodgings to travellers, and to one of the mo[s]t reputable of the[s]e [s]he directed her [s]teps. Her pur[s]e was but slenderly provided, but [s]he augmented her little [s]tore by the [s]ale of a gold locket, the la[s]t thing of value which [s]he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed, and from which [s]he took a lock of plaited hair; for it was the hair of Hamden Auberry, and to her a thou[s]and times more precious than the metal in which it had been en[s]hrined. On the following morning, [s]he inquired after a private lodging, and was recommended by the woman who kept the inn, to a mean apartment in one of the mo[s]t unfrequented [s]treets in the town. To this humble a[s]ylum [s]he retired, and felt a degree of melancholy plea[s]ure that [s]he could indulge her tears without re[s]traint. It may occa[s]ion [s]ome degree of [s]urpri[s]e, that Spriggins, who had formerly been an admirer of our [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-333.jpg) \- external link  - Page 324. ] heroine, would [s]uffer her to leave his hou[s]e without either friends or money; but the heart by nature contracted, and who[s]e chief object has been [s]elf, is [s]en[s]ibly affected by an appearance of [s]light; it can never either forget or forgive it; and [s]uch a heart languidly moved in the bo[s]om of Spriggins. But tho[s]e vi[s]itors, who had [s]een Rachel in the family, and now mi[s][s]ed her, felt an awakened curio[s]ity to know what was become of her. To the[s]e interrogatories had the Me[s]dames Spriggins and Courtney simply an[s]wered, that [s]he was gone home; curio[s]ity would have died, but they felt they had done wrong in driving her, poor and unprotected as [s]he was, from their hou[s]e; and in palliation of [s]o inhuman an action, threw a[s]per[s]ions on her character. Not content with depriving her of the protection of their own roof, they prevented her obtaining that protection from any other, who[s]e inmates were in the [s]malle[s]t degree respectable. That the human heart is liable to error, and that on the eternal record our crimes and follies are enrolled, and will one day appear in dreadful judgment again[s]t us, is a [s]olemn truth, which no per[s]on of common [s]en[s]e will attempt to deny; yet we are led to hope, that the tear of un[s]eigned penitence will blot tho[s]e offences out. But the crime of [s]lander is of [s]o [s]oul a die, its [s]able hue [s]tains the [s]acred page, and only mercy infinite can purify it. Oh thou Giver of life, guard, I be[s]eech thee, my heart from ingratitude, and my lips from [s]lander; and for the re[s]t, thy will be done. During the period of the[s]e vici[s][s]itudes, Rachel had never omitted writing every week to her hu[s]band, only at the time when the birth of her [s]on prevented her. The[s]e letters, written after [s]he left the hou[s]e of Mrs. Varnice, all lay at the place where he had de[s]ired them to be addre[s][s]ed; and when James was sufficiently recovered to follow his ma[s]ter, he made them into a parcel, and took them with him. But words are inadequate to de[s]cribe the feelings of Hamden, when he by turns li[s]tened to the account [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-334.jpg) \- external link  - Page 325. ] which James gave him, and read the pathetic letters of his wife; [s]ometimes love, [s]ometimes re[s]entment predominated. But when he read that he was a father, and that his once loved Rachel, in that [s]ea[s]on of [s]ickne[s]s, was without the means to purcha[s]e the necessary accommodations and comforts to render the situation in [s]ome mea[s]ure [s]upportable, he determined to hazard every thing, own his marriage, and fly to her relief and comfort. Hamden was ever impetuous; he re[s]olved one moment, and the next put the re[s]olve in execution. Lady Anne heard him with more calmne[s]s than he had expected; but that apparent calm was deceitful; when he had fini[s]hed, [s]he upbraided him with his duplicity, imprecated mi[s]ery on both him[s]elf and his wife, and with a determined air renounced him forever. In vain was every endeavour to [s]often her re[s]entment, and Hamden embarked for England, without the [s]malle[s]t hope of being rein[s]tated in her affection, or of ever being the better for her fortune. Mortified pride, love and jealou[s]y corroded in his bo[s]om during his [s]hort voyage; and on his arrival in London, he repaired immediately to the hou[s]e of Mrs. Varnice; for though Rachel had mentioned her removal, yet [s]he had forgot to mention the name of the [s]treet to which [s]he had removed; and though [s]he was di[s]plea[s]ed with Mrs. Varnice, yet, as [s]he did not know the extent of that woman's vilene[s]s, [s]he [s]poke of her no farther than to [s]ay [s]he had rea[s]on to think both Hamden and her[s]elf had been mi[s]taken in her character. This was not [s]ufficient to deter Hamden from going to her hou[s]e, e[s]pecially as he conceived it the only probable means of finding Rachel. But this vi[s]it did not [s]erve to conciliate his affection, or awaken returning tenderne[s]s. Mrs. Varnice told her own tale. Our poor heroine was repre[s]ented as imprudent, if not guilty, in regard to Oliver; extravagant and thoughtless, in her expen[s]es. "Why indeed," [s]aid Auberry, "I thought I left her [s]ufficient to defray every expen[s]e till my return; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-335.jpg) \- external link  - Page 326. ] and when I found my [s]tay protracted beyond my expectations, I forwarded her a hundred pounds." "Well, who could have thought it?" [s]aid Mrs. Varnice; "before [s]he left me, [s]he, to my certain knowledge, rai[s]ed money on her watch, rings, bracelets." "Bracelets?" [s]aid Hamden. "Oh yes! Lettuce pledged them for her." "Cruel, unkind Rachel!" "Dear! don't let it di[s]tre[s]s you [s]o; I [s]uppo[s]e her young friend Oliver helped her off with [s]ome of the money." "Damn him!" [s]aid Hamden. "Oh! Rachel, Rachel, why have you u[s]ed me thus? Oh! Mrs. Varnice, if you knew how I loved her, how I adored her! how at this moment her fa[s]cinating image twines around every chord, every fibre of my heart! you would wonder how [s]he could be [s]o ungrateful, [s]o vile, [s]o barbarous." Alas! weak, credulous Auberry, had you in[s]tead of li[s]tening to this woman's infamous a[s]per[s]ions, treated them with [s]corn, and boldly a[s][s]erted the innocence of your wife, and your full confidence in her truth and honour, her accu[s]er, con[s]cious of her own guilt and duplicity, would have retired intimidated within her[s]elf, and [s]hrunk from a [s]crutiny, from whence [s]he mu[s]t have been a[s][s]ured her own fal[s]ehood would [s]tand detected. But who will e[s]pou[s]e the cau[s]e of an injured wife, when he who has [s]olemnly [s]worn to protect her from all evil, li[s]tens with avidity to the voice that defames her, and joins with her wor[s]t enemies to precipitate her into the aby[s]s of ignominy. From the hou[s]e of Mrs. Varnice, Hamden went to the lodging [s]he had la[s]t occupied, and there, from a conver[s]ation with the woman of the hou[s]e, learnt the route Rachel had taken, and with whom; but unfortunately, he al[s]o learnt that [s]he had been vi[s]ited almo[s]t daily by Oliver, during the period of his [s]tay in London. Tortured almo[s]t to madne[s]s, he re[s]olved to follow her, upbraid her with her perfidy and cruelty, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-336.jpg) \- external link  - Page 327. ] oblige her to relinqui[s]h the care of the child to him, and take an everla[s]ting leave of her. In the mean time, our heroine was drinking very deeply of the cup of affliction; poverty was her constant companion. The trifle [s]he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed, at the time [s]he left the hou[s]e of Spriggins, was [s]oon expended, and by degrees the remains of her wardrobe dwindled away, till two cotton gowns, with a change of linen, were the whole of her earthly po[s][s]e[s][s]ions. She had inquired for work, but could get none. The dearth of amu[s]ement in a country town makes every trifle, if wearing the appearance of novelty, become of consequence; and what [s]preads fa[s]ter than a tale of scandal? The circum[s]tance of our heroine's coming from London to Mr. Spriggins, and quitting the hou[s]e [s]o abruptly, had been talked over in almo[s]t every family in the place, told a hundred different ways, and each narrator adding or altering [s]ome circum[s]tance, poor Rachel was looked upon, even by the woman of whom [s]he rented her [s]mall apartment, as a [s]u[s]picious character; and had [s]he been inclined to partake the pleasures of [s]ociety, [s]he would have found the doors of almost every cla[s]s of people [s]hut again[s]t her. But [s]he had [s]till the con[s]olation of an innocent heart, and a firm faith and reliance on an omni[s]cient Deity, who would not [s]uffer her eventually to peri[s]h. She submitted to her afflictions as to the wife di[s]pen[s]ations of his providence, and prayed daily for a more humble, more unrepining [s]pirit. She was entirely ignorant al[s]o, that any [s]tigma had been thrown on her reputation, and con[s]cious of not de[s]erving, [s]he feared not the cen[s]ures of a world, which, though [s]he would not wilfully offend, [s]he was but little [s]olicitous to plea[s]e. The neglect of Auberry [s]unk the deepe[s]t into her heart, when her thoughts reverted to the few happy weeks pa[s]t in his [s]ociety immediately after their marriage. The tear of bitter remembrance would gu[s]h from her eyes, and as [s]he pre[s][s]ed her infant to her heart, it bled at every vein, that he, as well as herself, [s]hould be [s]o totally abandoned by his father. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-337.jpg) \- external link  - Page 328. ] It was one evening in Augu[s]t, when Rachel, having lulled her darling to [s]leep, the twilight [s]till giving [s]ufficient light, took her tablets from her pocket, and, as [s]he leaned over a window [s]he had ju[s]t opened to gaze at the [s]erenity of an evening, that [s]eemed to give plea[s]ure to the whole creation but her forlorn, unhappy [s]elf, wrote with her pencil the following lines: When the frame to the earth is bent low, By [s]ickne[s]s or [s]orrow oppre[s]t; When the moments drag pen[s]ive and flow, And the heart it lies cold in the brea[s]t; When each [s]ocial comfort is fled, Nor friend nor companion is near; When re[s]t has for[s]aken the bed, And the pillow is [s]tain'd with a tear:--- Ah! then, what avails each gay [s]cene Which Nature unfolds to our [s]ight? In vain Phebus ri[s]es [s]erene, Or Cynthia enlivens the night! In vain is you canopy [s]pread Thus gorgeous, with [s]apphire and gold, When each [s]en[s]e of plea[s]ure is fled, And each fond affection lies cold! Ha[s]te, Apathy, ha[s]te thee, and bring, With poppies infu[s]ed in the bowl, A draught from the Lethean [s]pring To [s]teep in oblivion my [s]oul. Thy fable [s]tole pa[s]s 'fore mine eyes, That when pale affliction I view, No [s]hades of pa[s]t plea[s]ures may ri[s]e To [s]harpen her arrows anew. But come, with thy [s]en[s]e-numbing power, A[s][s]i[s]t me tho[s]e arrows to brave; Nor leave me till that happy hour, When I [s]ink to repo[s]e in the grave! When [s]he had fini[s]hed, the full [s]en[s]e of her own deplorable [s]ituation ru[s]hed upon her mind; [s]he re[s]ted her head upon her hand, and, unable to weep, a kind of [s]tupor pervaded all her [s]en[s]es; and [s]o entirely [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-338.jpg) \- external link  - Page 329. ] absorbed was [s]he in her own agonizing reflections, that [s]he was as perfectly lo[s]t to every [s]urrounding object as if [s]he had been no longer in exi[s]tence. From this reverie [s]he was arou[s]ed by the cry of her child, and in her ha[s]te to let down the window, [s]he dropped her tablets. It was an awkward circum[s]tance; for the window looked into a garden belonging to a genteel hou[s]e that was in another [s]treet. It was therefore impo[s][s]ible to regain them that night; but [s]he re[s]olved to go early the en[s]uing morning to inquire for them; for they had formerly belonged to her mother, and were on that account highly valued by Rachel. Accordingly, the next morning, as [s]oon as [s]he imagined [s]he could gain admittance, [s]he took her child in her arms, and walked round to the front of the hou[s]e. The door was opened by a decent young woman, and Rachel was beginning to [s]peak, when, turning her eyes toward a parlour, the door of which [s]tood partly open, [s]he [s]aw Archibald Oliver, dre[s][s]ed in deep mourning, [s]itting at a breakfa[s]t table, and holding the identical tablets [s]he came to inquire for, in his hand. She was [s]urpri[s]ed---[s]he was [s]ilent. "Did you wi[s]h to [s]ee my mi[s]tre[s]s, Ma'am?" [s]aid the young woman. "Yes!" [s]aid Rachel, hardly con[s]cious that [s]he had an[s]wered at all. There was [s]omething in the air and manner of our heroine, that, had [s]he been clothed in the meane[s]t apparel, would [s]till have commanded re[s]pect. The young woman pa[s][s]ed before her, and courte[s]ying as [s]he pushed open the parlour door, de[s]ired her to walk in, and [s]he would call her mi[s]tre[s]s immediately. At the [s]ound of approaching [s]teps, Oliver rai[s]ed his eyes. "Good God! Mrs. Dacres!" exclaimed he. Rachel was fluttered; [s]he could not [s]peak. A languid [s]mile illumined her pallid countenance as [s]he extended her hand towards him. But the expre[s][s]ive tear that bur[s]t from its gli[s]tening orbit, contradicted the appearance of tranquillity the [s]mile was meant to convey. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-339.jpg) \- external link  - Page 330. ] "How is it, Mr. Oliver," [s]aid [s]he, when [s]he could command her voice, "that I [s]ee you here?" "A very unhappy circum[s]tance brought me and [s]till detains me here," he replied. Rachel glanced her eye over his fable dre[s]s. Je[s][s]y darted into her mind. "Your [s]i[s]ter!" [s]aid [s]he eagerly. "Is well," interrupted he, at once comprehending her fears, at lea[s]t I have no rea[s]on to think to the contrary; but Mrs. Oliver is no more." His voice faltered; Rachel was [s]ilent; [s]he knew the folly and impertinence of common-place consolation. Oliver recovered him[s]elf, and having learnt from our heroine every occurrence that had taken place [s]ince he [s]aw her in London, he in return informed her, that friend[s]hip for a very particular acquaintance of her's had brought him to that place--- "An acquaintance of mine?" [s]aid Rachel. "Yes, Lieutenant Courtney." "Courtney! You a[s]toni[s]h me; I thought he was gone to India." "He had an appointment of that kind, which was procured him by lord M---; but [s]ome di[s]coveries which he made after he had even joined his [s]hip, and had received [s]ailing orders, compelled him to quit his appointment, throw up his commi[s][s]ion, and follow his unprincipled wife to this place. Lord M. has a [s]eat at Alnwick, which is only a [s]hort ride from hence, and Courtney having obtained [s]ufficient te[s]timony of her depravity and his own di[s]honour, came to me, and a[s]ked my advice in what manner he [s]hould proceed. See your wife, [s]aid I, and remon[s]trate with her. I will go with you. He [s]eemed inclined to follow my advice, and we rode together toward this place. When we had proceeded a few miles, we [s]aw a chariot and four driving [s]uriou[s]ly along; the liveries be[s]poke it the equipage of lord M. Courtney no [s]ooner [s]aw it, than, clapping [s]purs to his hor[s]e, he gallopped from me, and before I could get up with him, had [s]topped the carriage in which was Mrs. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-340.jpg) \- external link  - Page 331. ] Courtney and his Lord[s]hip. The irritated, impetuous husband had dragged the ignoble peer from the carriage, and, drawing a ca[s]e of pi[s]tols, pre[s]ented him one, whil[s]t with the other he prepared to defend him[s]elf, when one of the footmen [s]truck him acro[s]s the head with the end of a whip, and he fell lifele[s]s to the ground. Lord M. [s]prang into his carriage again and drove off, leaving me with my [s]ervant to take what care we could of poor Courtney. We were nearer this place than we were to Alnwick, and placing him on the hor[s]e before John, with great difficulty we got him here. This hou[s]e is kept by a woman who nursed my wife; and as I thought he would be quieter and better attended here than in a public inn, I had him brought hither. The wound on his head is deep, but the [s]urgeon does not think him in [s]o much danger from the effect of that as from the violent perturbation of his mind. Rachel li[s]tened with a[s]toni[s]hment to this detail, and was [s]o entirely ab[s]orbed in reflection on the [s]trange incidents Oliver related, that when the mi[s]tre[s]s of the hou[s]e entered, and reque[s]ted to know what her commands were, [s]he had totally forgotten the circumstance that had brought her to the hou[s]e. She hesitated, blu[s]hed; at length, ca[s]ting her eyes on the breakfa[s]t table, [s]he [s]aw the object of her inquiry; but the con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of her embarra[s][s]ed, awkward appearance, [s]o increa[s]ed her confu[s]ion, that the inquiries [s]he made for her tablets had more the appearance of subterfuge than truth. However, the maid having mentioned that Mr. Oliver had picked them up in the garden, they were delivered to our heroine, who, having expre[s][s]ed a de[s]ire to [s]ee Courtney, and promi[s]ed to return in the afternoon for that purpo[s]e, took her leave. Now, though Rachel did not know five per[s]ons in the neighbourhood where [s]he dwelt, even by [s]ight, yet [s]he was her[s]elf known by every individual in it; and her embarra[s][s]ed and he[s]itating manner, added to a knowledge of the evil reports which were circulated concerning her, led the woman where Oliver lodged, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-341.jpg) \- external link  - Page 332. ] to imagine [s]he came to vi[s]it him, or Courtney, as [s]he [s]eemed [s]o perfectly acquainted with both. In the afternoon, Rachel determined to [s]ee Courtney. She had no idea that impropriety could be annexed to a vi[s]it which [s]he conceived to be an act of duty; and when [s]he found him [s]o extremely ill as to need the mo[s]t con[s]tant and tender attention; when [s]he di[s]covered that it was in her power to [s]oothe his afflicted heart, and [s]mooth the bed of pain, by an exertion of friendly a[s][s]iduity; forgetting every thing but that [s]he had once been under obligations to him, [s]he re[s]olved her[s]elf to be his attendant till he [s]hould recover [s]trength [s]ufficient to enable him to return to his mother and [s]i[s]ters. Thus every morning [s]he repaired to the chamber of the [s]ick man, nur[s]ing him with the affection of a [s]i[s]ter, and admini[s]tering to him the con[s]olation of a friend. Mrs. Spriggins and her unprincipled gue[s]t were mean enough to employ their [s]ervants to inquire in the neighbourhood after our heroine, and be con[s]tant [s]pies upon her actions. That [s]he was often, nay, almost continually at the hou[s]e where Oliver was, and where Courtney lay [s]ick, they were a[s][s]ured of; and though they knew that [s]he con[s]tantly returned to her [s]olitary apartment to her meals, which were [s]canty enough, and that [s]he was always at home at an early hour in the evening, yet they failed not to attribute to motives the mo[s]t degrading to the [s]ex, a conduct which was the re[s]ult of pure benevolence, and did honour to her heart, however it proved, that her head was not too much [s]tored with worldly prudence and knowledge. Things were exactly in this [s]ituation, when Hamden Auberry arrived in [s]earch of a woman, whom, one moment, he was ready to kneel and wor[s]hip, and the next, to call down everla[s]ting wrath upon her. It may ea[s]ily be imagined, that the [s]tory told by Mrs. Spriggins, Mrs. Courtney and family did not tend to [s]often his heart towards her; [s]o far from it, he poured forth a torrent of execrations, and vowed never to [s]ee her more. But when he had returned to his inn, and mu[s]ed a few moments, he thought he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-342.jpg) \- external link  - Page 333. ] would [s]ee her once more, upbraid her, and bid her an everla[s]ting farewel; he had learnt in what quarter of the town [s]he lodged, and at the du[s]k of the evening went to the hou[s]e and inquired for her. She was not at home. At eight o'clock he called again; [s]till [s]he was not returned. Having obtained a direction to the hou[s]e where he was told [s]he [s]pent every day, and having a[s][s]ured him[s]elf that was the re[s]idence of Oliver, he determined to keep watch before the door, and be him[s]elf an eye-witne[s]s of her leaving it, and at what hour. Long and weari[s]ome was the night, and horrible were the feelings of Auberry. About twelve o'clock, he determined to leave her to her fate, and return with all [s]peed to London; but before he had reached the inn, de[s]ire of revenge impelled him to return. `I will tear her from the arms of Oliver,' [s]aid he, `and wreak my vengeance on both her and her paramour;' but then the memory of his child cro[s][s]ed his imagination, and with it the fond recollection of what the mother was when he fir[s]t knew her; a flood of tenderne[s]s ru[s]hed over his [s]oul, and he wept like an infant. In this di[s]tracted manner did Auberry pa[s]s the night, and the dawn of day found him [s]itting on the [s]teps of a door oppo[s]ite to the lodgings of Oliver. He ro[s]e from the cold, damp [s]eat, and with a heavy heart was giving a la[s]t look at the hou[s]e, when the door opened gently, and Rachel her[s]elf, with her child in her arms, came out. Though during the whole night Hamden had supposed his wife was there, yet [s]omething like hope had [s]ometimes led him to think he might have been deceived, and [s]he might [s]till be innocent; but this ocular proof was beyond all doubt. He reeled again[s]t a po[s]t, [s]taggered and fell. Rachel [s]aw him; but, wrapped in a coar[s]e great coat which he had borrowed at the inn, with his hat flapped, it was impo[s][s]ible, by the faint glimmer of the twilight, [s]he [s]hould know him; [s]he imagined it to be an inebriated per[s]on, ju[s]t endeavouring to return home; and fearful, [s]hould [s]he be ob[s]erved by him at that early hour, that he might in [s]ome re[s]pect or other [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-343.jpg) \- external link  - Page 334. ] be rude to her, [s]he quickened her [s]teps, and before Auberry was [s]ufficiently recovered to [s]peak or ri[s]e from the ground, [s]he was out of [s]ight, and in a few moments reached her own habitation. A little girl, who was up on [s]ome particular occa[s]ion, let her in, and [s]he threw her[s]elf on the bed, in hopes to obtain [s]ome repo[s]e, while Auberry returned to the inn, penned a ha[s]ty letter to her, which he left, with orders that it [s]hould be [s]ent by eight o'clock in the morning. He then ordered a chai[s]e and four, and proceeded with all the rapidity of [s]uch a conveyance to London, seldom [s]topping even for refre[s]hment, as though he thought, by the velocity of the movement, to leave his cares behind, or lo[s]e the remembrance of them, by attending to the various objects that pa[s][s]ed in quick [s]ucce[s][s]ion before him. In the mean time, Rachel had enjoyed about two hours [s]leep, and felt her[s]elf greatly refre[s]hed; for the fatigue and anxiety of the night had exhau[s]ted both her [s]pirits and [s]trength. She had attended as u[s]ual the day before at the bed[s]ide of Courtney; towards noon he had ari[s]en, and was removed for the benefit of the air into an adjoining apartment, and placed in an ea[s]y chair near the window. The noi[s]e of hor[s]es drew his attention towards the [s]treet. He looked out, and [s]aw his wife, accompanied by lord M. on horseback, attended by two [s]ervants in rich liveries. She rai[s]ed her eyes, [s]aw the emaciated figure of her husband, pointed him out to her di[s][s]olute companion, and both bur[s]t into a loud laugh. Courtney was unequal to the [s]hock; he attempted to [s]peak, but his voice failed him; he ga[s]ped, groaned, and fell to the floor. Alarming faintings [s]ucceeded each other, and he was reduced to [s]uch a [s]tate of weakne[s]s, that the medical gentleman who attended him imagined it almost impo[s][s]ible that he [s]hould live through the night. Was it po[s][s]ible for Rachel in [s]uch a [s]ituation to leave him? No! She had not been treated with [s]ufficient re[s]pect by the mi[s]tre[s]s of the hou[s]e where [s]he lodged, to make her think it nece[s][s]ary to [s]end any me[s][s]age to her concerning her [s]taying out, or her rea[s]ons for [s]o doing. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-344.jpg) \- external link  - Page 335. ] Towards morning, Courtney fell into a quiet [s]leep, and Oliver entreated Rachel to retire, and endeavour to take [s]ome repo[s]e. Acting from motives the mo[s]t pure and even commendable, without a thought or wi[s]h in the [s]malle[s]t tittle derogatory to virtue, Rachel had no apprehen[s]ion of incurring cen[s]ure from any. How [s]urpri[s]ed was [s]he then, on awaking in the morning, to read the following note, which was brought to her by the little girl who had let her in. "Mi[s]stre[s]s Dakirs, ater the adventer of la[s]t nite, you cant [s]uppos I will [s]uffer you to [s]tay any longer in my ou[s]e, wich is a one[s]t ou[s]e; and furdermore, I does not expect you to go without paying me every fardin of what you oes me. You mu[s]t go meditly, as I does not want women of your [s]ort in my ou[s]e no longer." Rachel was really [s]o totally uncon[s]cious of evil, that [s]he was at a lo[s]s to think what the woman meant by "the adventure of la[s]t night;" but going to her to inquire, was [s]o overwhelmed with abu[s]e, that, weeping, trembling, almo[s]t fainting, [s]he retreated from the hou[s]e leaving every thing behind her to [s]atisfy the rapacity of her inhuman landlady. As [s]he was going out of the door, [s]he met the porter with her hu[s]band's letter. She took it, broke the [s]eal, and read that he had been there, that he had [s]een her, that he believed her lo[s]t to virtue, and that he abandoned her forever. Overcome by [s]en[s]ations the mo[s]t agonizing, [s]he [s]at down on the [s]teps of the door. The letter remained open in her hand; her eyes were riveted to it, and only that [s]he breathed, [s]he might have been taken for a [s]tatue of fixed and mute de[s]pair. How long [s]he would have remained in this [s]ituation is uncertain, or whether, [s]inking into in[s]en[s]ibility, [s]he would not have lo[s]t all con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of her mi[s]ery, had not the woman with the diabolical malice of a fiend opened the door, and bade her begone from the [s]tep. Arou[s]ed from her lethargy of grief, [s]he aro[s]e, folded her child to her bo[s]om, and bowing her head in meek re[s]ignation, the [s]orrows of her heart found vent at her eyes, and [s]he obeyed in [s]ilence. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-345.jpg) \- external link  - Page 336. ] And what was there, in this moment of angui[s]h, to [s]upport the [s]inking [s]pirits of our afflicted heroine? Con[s]cious innocence! And whil[s]t humbled to the very du[s]t, [s]he could look up with hope and confidence to Him who is a rock of defence to the injured, a [s]ure help to tho[s]e who tru[s]t in him. Wounded pride would have fir[s]t impelled her to hide her[s]elf from Oliver, as [s]he di[s]covered, from the unconnected [s]crawl left by Auberry, that it was of him he was jealous, and had it been only for her[s]elf that [s]he was intere[s]ted, [s]he would mo[s]t likely have suffered every degree of mi[s]ery before [s]he would have a[s]ked relief of any one; but her child, the [s]on of Auberry, the lawful heir to large po[s][s]e[s][s]ions, for his [s]ake [s]he was re[s]olved to [s]tifle her feelings, and endeavour to convince his cruel father that he had injured her in the mo[s]t unwarrantable manner. She therefore went immediately to his lodgings, and calming her perturbed [s]pirits as much as [s]he po[s][s]ibly could, thus addre[s][s]ed him:---"Mr. Oliver, I am nece[s][s]itated to reque[s]t the loan of a few guineas, at the [s]ame time that I tell you it is more than probable I may never be able to repay you. Something has taken place this morning, which obliges me in future to forbear [s]eeing you, or giving any farther attendance on our unfortunate friend." "Good heavens!" [s]aid Oliver, [s]truck with her pale countenance, [s]wollen eyes and evident agitation; "what can be the matter? Wherever you are going, do not refu[s]e me the [s]atisfaction of knowing, that I may be able to a[s][s]i[s]t, protect, comfort, be a brother to you." "It is impo[s][s]ible," [s]aid [s]he, "the world will not [s]uffer it." He comprehended the meaning of her words, and without reply tendered her his pur[s]e. She took five guineas from it, and then reque[s]ting to [s]ee Courtney, of whom [s]he took a [s]ilent leave, [s]he departed, leaving Oliver a[s]toni[s]hed and affected at her conduct. He mu[s]ed a few moments, and then thinking, however rigid propriety might forbid her to vi[s]it the hou[s]e he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-346.jpg) \- external link  - Page 337. ] inhabited, or receive vi[s]its from him, yet it did not forbid him following and di[s]covering her retreat, where he might [s]upply her with all the nece[s][s]aries and comforts of life. He [s]natched his hat, and ru[s]hed into the [s]treet; but he was too late; Rachel was no longer in [s]ight, nor could he di[s]cover which way [s]he had gone. Our heroine walked to a poor cottage about a mile from the town, inhabited only by an old woman and her daughter. Here [s]he agreed to board at a very low rate for a few days, and then [s]at down to write to her hu[s]band. She endeavoured to explain circumstances that appeared [s]u[s]picious; but to think that Auberry [s]u[s]pected her honour, gave her [s]uch inexpressible angui[s]h, that [s]he was frequently obliged to lay down her pen and weep. At length [s]he fini[s]hed, earne[s]tly conjuring, if not for her own, yet for his child's [s]ake, he would [s]end her [s]ome relief, nor [s]uffer them to expire with want, or langui[s]h out their lives in poverty and ob[s]curity. This letter [s]he directed to a coffee-hou[s]e in London, which [s]he knew he frequented, and reque[s]ting an answer to be directed to the po[s]t-office at Newark, [s]he left her infant in the charge of her old ho[s]te[s]s, went her[s]elf and put her own letter in, inquiring at the [s]ame time when [s]he might expect an an[s]wer. When [s]he returned to her humble home, fatigue, anguish of heart, and the violent emotions [s]he had experienced during the day, had [s]o far overcome her, that [s]he went to bed much indi[s]po[s]ed, and after a night of re[s]tle[s]s agitation, [s]he awoke from a [s]hort [s]lumber [s]o ill, as to be unable to ri[s]e. From that time, a period of three weeks was a total blank to Rachel. A fever, accompanied by a delirium, brought her to the verge of the grave; but the tenderne[s]s of her good old ho[s]te[s]s and her daughter, co-operating with a naturally good con[s]titution, and the attendance of a [s]kilful man of medicine, at length triumphed over the di[s]order, and [s]he returned to life and a renewed [s]en[s]e of her [s]orrows. The fir[s]t thing [s]he thought of was her expected letter. She di[s]patched the young cottager to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-347.jpg) \- external link  - Page 338. ] Newark to inquire for it; [s]he returned empty handed; there was no letter there. Thus day after day pa[s][s]ed on. The five guineas Rachel had borrowed of Oliver were totally expended during her illne[s]s, and no letter arriving from her hu[s]band, [s]he was once more pennyle[s]s, but not totally friendle[s]s. The poor inhabitants of the cottage were Chri[s]tians . Had [s]he been [s]tained with a thou[s]and errors, they would not have thought it right to remember them when [s]he was bowed to the earth by affliction. Their whole po[s][s]e[s][s]ions were, the cottage, a [s]mall garden, a cow and two spinning wheels; but they dried the tear from her eyes by the voice of kindne[s]s, and told her [s]he [s]hould be welcome to [s]hare their humble fare till returning health enabled her to join their labours for [s]ub[s]i[s]tence, if nothing better offered. During her illne[s]s, the old cottager had found Auberry's letter, and wi[s]hing to gain [s]ome intelligence concerning her family, had perused it. "She may be guilty," [s]aid [s]he, "but I have no right to judge her. She is [s]ick and afflicted; it is therefore my duty to nur[s]e and comfort her." She then returned the letter to the pocket from whence [s]he took it, nor even after Rachel's recovery did [s]he [s]uffer her to imagine, by any word, look or hint, that [s]he had [s]een it. As [s]oon as Rachel had gathered [s]trength [s]ufficient to enable her to attempt it, with [s]low and uneven [s]teps [s]he proceeded to Newark, determined to make inquiry her[s]elf concerning a letter; for [s]he thought it impossible for Auberry to abandon her and his child to ab[s]olute want. She went to the office, and was told no [s]uch letter was there. "Are you certain, Sir?" [s]aid [s]he; "it mu[s]t have been here [s]ome time, if it is here at all. Pray look among[s]t the letters that lay in the office; it is of more con[s]equence to me than you can imagine. It is directed to Mrs. Dacres, to be left here till called for." A young man hearing her repeat the name of Dacres, turned over a parcel of letters, and pre[s]ented to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-348.jpg) \- external link  - Page 339. ] the trembling hands of our heroine the long-expected epi[s]tle from her hu[s]band. Rachel opened it; a hundred pound bank note dropped from it! She attempted to read it, but a mi[s]t came over her eyes; [s]he reeled, and would have fallen, but the young man caught her. He called for water, and an interior door opening, a young woman, very plainly habited, ru[s]hed out, [s]upported and pre[s][s]ed to her bo[s]om the lifele[s]s, inanimate form, calling on her to revive by the tender name of friend, her dear, unhappy Rachel. Life [s]oon revi[s]ited her lips and cheeks; [s]he opened her eyes, and found herself in the arms of Je[s][s]y Oliver. Leaning on the arm of this dear friend, and hardly daring to tru[s]t her [s]en[s]es le[s]t it [s]hould prove an illusion, Rachel retired into a [s]mall, neat parlour, where [s]he [s]oon regained [s]ufficient compo[s]ure to peru[s]e her letter. It was [s]hort, and the conclu[s]ion of it almo[s]t annihilated her. It was as follows.--- My adored Rachel , THERE is [s]uch an appearance of candour and [s]incerity throughout your whole letter, that I cannot but believe you innocent; prove your[s]elf [s]o, and on the receipt of this come immediately to London, and prepare to follow my fortunes to foreign climes. Our marriage is no longer a [s]ecret; my aunt has discarded me. I have [s]old my commi[s][s]ion, and in the despair I felt at your perfidy, have taken pa[s][s]age on board a ve[s][s]el bound for Philadelphia. If you love me as you [s]ay, and as I would fain think you do, you will not he[s]itate to leave England forever, [s]ince it is for my peace of mind that I [s]hould do [s]o. I cannot submit to live in it below the rank I have been accustomed to fill. If your affection leads you to be the companion of my voyage, the [s]harer and [s]oother of all my cares, I [s]hall regret neither fortune nor country. If not, if [s]ome [s]tronger attachment binds you to this [s]pot, Oh Rachel! I cannot bear the thought; but [s]hould it be [s]o, why the farther we are divided the better. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-349.jpg) \- external link  - Page 340. ] "Inclo[s]ed I imagine is a [s]um [s]ufficient to di[s]charge any debts you may have contracted, and bring you to London. If you come, I [s]hall expect to [s]ee you in ten days from the date of this letter. If not, farewel forever; we meet no more on this [s]ide eternity, and I will [s]trive if po[s][s]ible to forget you. HAMDEN AUBERRY." Rachel referred to the date of the letter; it had been written near a month. "Then he is gone! left me forever! and thinks me the mo[s]t depraved of women," [s]aid [s]he; and her emotions became [s]o violent, that in her pre[s]ent debilitated [s]tate, Mi[s]s Oliver feared [s]he would have fallen into fits; at any rate, [s]he thought it nece[s][s]ary to take her home, and procuring a carriage, [s]he her[s]elf accompanied her to her lowly habitation. By the way [s]he talked her into [s]omething like compo[s]ure; [s]he learnt every circum[s]tance that had taken place [s]ince their [s]eparation. Convinced of the purity of our heroine's heart, that her motives had been always right, though her conduct had been [s]ometimes directly contrary to the rigid rules of prudence, [s]he felt all her affection for her revive; and taking her hand when [s]he had fini[s]hed her detail, [s]he cried, "Well, Mrs. Auberry, (as we [s]hall henceforth call Rachel) in return for the confidence you have repo[s]ed in me, I will tell you my [s]tory. It is a very [s]imple one, without one romantic or extraordinary incident. "When I left London, I recollected an old [s]chool fellow I had at this place, of who[s]e [s]en[s]e and discretion I had a very high opinion; to her I repaired, and through her means [s]ettled the method of corresponding with you and Archibald, al[s]o the means of receiving a [s]mall yearly income, which I po[s][s]e[s][s]ed independent of my father. I then threw a[s]ide the fine lady entirely, a[s][s]umed the plain attire you [s]ee me now wear, and with it a [s]implicity of manners that might be likely not to betray my real rank in life. I then procured an apartment at a farm-hou[s]e, that is situated in a mo[s]t delightful though very [s]olitary valley, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-350.jpg) \- external link  - Page 341. ] about three miles from hence. I purcha[s]ed a few books, with materials for needle-work, and diver[s]ified my time with reading, working, and taking nece[s][s]ary exerci[s]e. The productions of my needle, through my friend were [s]ent to London and [s]old, increa[s]ing my little income in [s]uch a manner as to afford me all the comforts of life. I heard of my brother's marriage, and of his re[s]idence [s]o near me. I longed to [s]ee him; but was too proud to think of throwing my[s]elf on the liberality of his wife, for I knew that Archibald himself was as poor as I was. I therefore continued my retirement and avocations. I have frequently thought of you, and from [s]ome accounts which accidentally met my ears, was led [s]ometimes to blame but oftener to pity you. "But [s]hould I ever return to the gay world, my young a[s][s]ociates will, I have no doubt, be [s]urpri[s]ed that I [s]hould have eloped from my father's hou[s]e, changed my name, and [s]ecluded my[s]elf above a year and a half in a cottage, yet never have met with a [s]ingle adventure, or made one conque[s]t; nay, if you will believe me, the impenetrable ru[s]tics have entirely overlooked my beauty and accompli[s]hments; and though I have appeared regularly every Sunday, when the weather permitted, at the pari[s]h church, the Squire has not once noticed me, and I have remained entirely unmole[s]ted. "But I am weary of this dull [s]amene[s]s of [s]cene, and you and I will now [s]et out together in [s]earch of adventures. This mad brained, harum-[s]carum husband of yours, though I think he little de[s]erves [s]uch attention from us, yet we will e'en go after him. For if we [s]hould not find him, we may perhaps find somebody el[s]e that will be glad to [s]ee us." Rachel comprehending that Je[s][s]y meant Reuben, replied with additional pen[s]ivene[s]s, "Alas! my dear girl, I have never heard from my brother [s]ince he left England." "So I under[s]tand," [s]aid Je[s][s]y, [s]till forcing a [s]mile, while her eyes were brimfull of tears; "but I cannot repre[s]s a fond hope, which almo[s]t amounts to a belief, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-351.jpg) \- external link  - Page 342. ] that he is [s]till in exi[s]tence, and that we [s]hall one day meet again. As to Archibald, it will not be proper to let him know of our de[s]ign till it is too late for him to overtake and accompany us; for that would overthrow my whole plan of reconcilement between you and Auberry. And [s]hould the wor[s]t come to the wor[s]t, there is [s]till my little annuity; we will live together, my dear Rachel, in humble, but contented independence. What our income will not procure, industry [s]hall [s]upply. We will [s]tudy to fulfil the duties of our lowly [s]tation, and, enjoying the [s]weet consolation of an approving con[s]cience, hold the trifling multitude, that is in general termed the world , in [s]o little e[s]timation, as neither to court its [s]miles or fear its censures." This was a plan too agreeable to the feelings of Rachel not to be immediately clo[s]ed with. This re-commencement of friend[s]hip, with a per[s]on [s]o dear to her heart as Je[s][s]y Oliver, [s]eemed to ea[s]e her bo[s]om of half its load. A very [s]hort time [s]ufficed for the [s]ettlement of every concern, either of Mi[s]s Oliver or our heroine, and on the [s]econd morning after their meeting they were on their road to London. Rachel left ample te[s]timony with her aged ho[s]te[s]s at the cottage, that whatever her other errors might have been, [s]he was not guilty of the [s]in of ingratitude. Arrived in London, they made every inquiry after Auberry, and learnt that he had been departed above a fortnight, and it was univer[s]ally believed to America. It was late in the [s]ea[s]on for ve[s][s]els to cro[s]s the boisterous Atlantic ocean; the two fair friends could hear of none likely to [s]ail to the port they wi[s]hed, under a month or [s]ix weeks. This appeared to the anxious and impatient Rachel an eternity; and being informed that a [s]hip would go from Liverpool in the cour[s]e of ten days, they pur[s]ued their journey for that place, and arrived ju[s]t in time to [s]ecure a pa[s][s]age, as the vessel was to [s]ail the following morning. Reduced as our heroine was by illne[s]s, this long journey was almost too much for her [s]trength; but Je[s][s]y Oliver had fine [s]pirits, and a con[s]titution which, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-352.jpg) \- external link  - Page 343. ] though not robu[s]t, could [s]upport great fatigue without [s]inking under it. They alighted at the inn, and re[s]olved to indulge in a few hours re[s]t before their embarkation, where we will leave them and make [s]ome little inquiry after Auberry. When he had di[s]patched his letter with the money to Rachel, he waited with the utmo[s]t impatience the arrival of the time in which he might expect her. He had in the fir[s]t hurry of jealou[s]y, rage and disappointment [s]old his commi[s][s]ion, and taken a pa[s][s]age on board a [s]hip bound to Philadelphia, determined never more to vi[s]it his native country, where every bright pro[s]pect of his youth had been untimely bla[s]ted. The reception of his wife's letter awakened all his tenderness for her. Rachel in want, depre[s][s]ed, [s]ick, brokenhearted, was ever before his eyes. `She may yet be innocent,' cried he; the very [s]uppo[s]ition [s]eemed to give him comfort; `yet the proofs of her depravity were [s]o inconte[s]table---' here his heart glowed with re[s]entment; `I will at lea[s]t [s]end her the means of coming immediately to me. If [s]he comes, I will receive her with affection, if not, I will endeavour to forget that I ever knew her.' In this frame of mind he wrote the letter which conveyed the money to our heroine. But when day after day pa[s][s]ed, and no tidings of her neither by letter or any other means, he concluded [s]he was totally abandoned, and in de[s]pair of ever knowing peace again, he embarked on his intended voyage. But tempe[s]tuous weather en[s]uing, and the brig in which he embarked being rather ancient, [s]prung a leak, and they put into Liverpool to refit; where Auberry, giving way to the de[s]pair that preyed upon his mind, [s]unk into a [s]tate of inanity. Both mind and body became debilitated; a hectic fever [s]lowly undermined his con[s]titution; and when the vessel was ready to depart, he was too ill to make the voyage, and [s]uffered her to go without him. He had gone to his mother immediately on his arrival in Liverpool, where he explained to her all his cau[s]e for [s]orrow, and felt every wound bleed afre[s]h as he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-353.jpg) \- external link  - Page 344. ] perused [s]ome letters from Belle Web[s]ter, which tended highly to criminate his wife. Doctor Lenient was absent at the time of his arrival; a [s]mall e[s]tate had been left him in Ireland, and he had cro[s][s]ed the channel in order to take po[s][s]e[s][s]ion and [s]ettle [s]ome very material bu[s]ine[s]s. When Hamden had been with his mother about three weeks, the Doctor returned, [s]urpri[s]ed to [s]ee his nephew, and more [s]urpri[s]ed at his very rueful appearance. He inquired what he had been doing to alter him[s]elf [s]o. "I have been ruining my[s]elf," [s]aid Auberry. "Od[s]o! I hope not," replied the good-hearted Doctor, "What, have you been gambling?" "Yes, in the lottery of life, and have drawn a blank. In [s]hort, my dear uncle, I have married a woman without either family or fortune, and am di[s]carded by my aunt; but that I could have borne, had my wife been faithful." "Odds my life!" [s]aid the Doctor, "matrimony [s]eems no improver of happine[s]s; for this is the [s]econd tale of mi[s]ery I have heard to-day. What think you, [s]i[s]ter? ju[s]t as I landed from the packet, I [s]aw two women [s]tanding on the [s]hore, ready to [s]tep into a boat that was waiting. One countenance I knew in[s]tantly; for though pale and greatly emaciated, there was [s]till that character of [s]en[s]ibility and virtue impre[s][s]ed upon it for which I u[s]ed to admire it. It was our unfortunate young friend Rachel Dudley." Hamden ga[s]ped for breath, but he [s]uffered the Doctor to proceed without interruption. "She had a fine boy in her arms," continued the Doctor, "apparently about four months old, and [s]pite of all we have heard, I felt my[s]elf impelled to [s]peak to her. Her companion was Mi[s]s Oliver, whom we heard had eloped from her father's hou[s]e, and who has not been heard of by her family for above a twelvemonth." "Well, Sir," cried Auberry impatiently, "but what of Rachel." "Why I'll tell you," [s]aid the Doctor, taking off his wig and deliberately putting on his crim[s]on velvet [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-354.jpg) \- external link  - Page 345. ] cap, and without noticing the emotions of Hamden; "when I went up to her, and a[s]ked her how [s]he did, [s]he laid her hand on her bo[s]om, and with a look I [s]hall never forget, an[s]wered, "Neither well nor happy, Doctor." "I am [s]orry, my poor girl," [s]aid I, "for [s]ome circumstances that I under[s]tand have taken place, and knowing your extreme [s]en[s]ibility, cannot be [s]urpri[s]ed that they have injured both your health and peace of mind. But where are you going now?" "To America," [s]aid [s]he, "in pur[s]uit of my husband." "You are married, then," [s]aid I. "Yes," [s]he replied, and fixing her eyes on my face, "did you not know it?" "No, how [s]hould I? I have been in Ireland the[s]e two months pa[s]t. Ju[s]t then the [s]ailors called to her to get into the boat. She tendered me her hand." "God ble[s]s you, my good Doctor," [s]aid [s]he. I [s]hook her hand, helped her in, and---" "And [s]he is really gone, then," cried Hamden frantickly. The Doctor rai[s]ed his eyes; the agitated countenance of his nephew alarmed him. "Yes, I believe [s]o," [s]aid he in a doubtful tone; "but why does it affect you thus?" "Why does it affect me? Oh! Sir, I am the husband of Rachel! It is me [s]he is gone in pur[s]uit of. I have de[s]erted, abandoned, for[s]aken her; I thought her depraved; I was told---" "Yes, and [s]o have I been told," [s]aid the Doctor with vehemence, [s]triking his hand on the elbow of his chair; "but after beholding her meek, expre[s][s]ive countenance, where candour and purity are [s]tamped on every feature; after [s]eeing her emaciated frame, and hearing her tremulous, plaintive accents, I would not believe the [s]malle[s]t tittle to her di[s]advantage, though millions joined to affirm it! Young man, you have been ha[s]ty, and blinded by pa[s][s]ion; have thrown away a pearl of ine[s]timable price." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-355.jpg) \- external link  - Page 346. ] Hamden's feelings were now too great for utterance. His mother [s]oothed him; but Dr. Lenient, who hated family pride, blamed the whole of his conduct; and though before he went to bed he pre[s]cribed [s]omething to compo[s]e the agitated [s]pirits of Auberry, yet when retired, his thoughts were wholly occupied by Rachel, wandering without a proper protector, in [s]earch of a man who had wantonly [s]acrificed her happine[s]s and reputation on the altar of ambition and intere[s]t. Where heaven-born Freedom holds her court Let me erect my humble [s]hed; Where all the arts with joy re[s]ort, And Science rears her laurell'd head. We left Reuben in captivity, employing every lei[s]ure moment in expanding the mind and cultivating the talents of Eumea. In this manner [s]ix weary months pa[s][s]ed on, and [s]till no hope of emancipation. At the end of this period, tidings arrived that the Indian chiefs had been guilty of a breach of the European laws, and in con[s]equence had [s]uffered death. The [s]achem called a council of his elders and chie[s]tains, and it was determined that Reuben and his unhappy companions [s]hould on the en[s]uing morning be bound to the [s]take, and [s]uffer tho[s]e inhuman tortures which none but [s]avages could inflict, and none but [s]avages [s]ubmit to, without an endeavour to be avenged of tho[s]e who inflict them. Eumea was in the wigwam at the time this horrid [s]entence was pa[s][s]ed; her heart [s]unk; there were but a few hours to intervene before it was to be put in execution. In the dead of night, [s]he entered the wigwam of our hero. "Engli[s]hmen," [s]aid [s]he, "awake, get up; danger and death are at hand; ha[s]te, quit this place, flee into the woods that [s]kirt the mountains, and the God of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-356.jpg) \- external link  - Page 347. ] the Chri[s]tians go with you." In a few words [s]he explained to them the nece[s][s]ity of their immediate flight, and directing their [s]teps to a cavern in a hollow glen, [s]he threw her arms round the neck of Reuben, bathed his cheek with her tears, pre[s][s]ed her cold trembling lips to his, and [s]obbing, Adieu! returned to her restless bed to weep and pray for his [s]afety. Innumerable were the hard[s]hips endured by Reuben and his companions, [s]kulking in caves, or deep woods, feeding on wild fruit, and even glad to make a meal of acorns; terrified by the ru[s]tling of the leaves, or the [s]teps of wild though inoffen[s]ive animals, natives of the uncultivated tracts through which they were obliged to pa[s]s. After three weeks weari[s]ome journey, they at length arrived at a European [s]ettlement; but [s]o reduced through famine and fatigue, that it [s]eemed as though they were only arrived at a place of [s]afety that they might re[s]t from all their cares in death. Even the [s]trength and [s]pirits of O'Neil began to flag, and he bitterly regretted that he was no longer able to cheer, attend and comfort his dear ma[s]ter. But what was the [s]urpri[s]e of Reuben, when, the day after his arrival at this place, he [s]aw Eumea enter the apartment where he was. He rai[s]ed him[s]elf from the bed on which he was reclining, and in a voice that expressed at once [s]urpri[s]e and plea[s]ure, exclaimed, "Eumea here! what [s]trange incident!" She [s]topped him, took hold of his hand, and looking earne[s]tly in his face--- "Is it [s]trange that I [s]hould follow you; ([s]aid [s]he) were not you my in[s]tructor, my more than father, my friend, and was it po[s][s]ible Eumea could [s]tay behind you and live? Do not look angry; I know I have done wrong; for you taught me to love, re[s]pect, and never for[s]ake my father and mother. I tried to remember your precepts, I tried to obey your injunctions; but, alas! the [s]ilent night was witne[s]s to my angui[s]h, and the ri[s]ing [s]un could not dry the dew from my eyelids. If I [s]lept, I [s]aw you, li[s]tened to you, and was happy. Fleeting joy! that but embittered [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-357.jpg) \- external link  - Page 348. ] the moment of awaking! The flowers you had gathered for me the day before you left me, I bound upon my brea[s]t next my heart; I have worn them there ever [s]ince; they withered and dried, but every day I refre[s]h them with my tears. One morning, ju[s]t as the day appeared, I aro[s]e, took my bow and arrows, and re[s]olved to follow you. My mother was [s]till a[s]leep; I looked at her, I knelt be[s]ide her; but I dared not ki[s]s her le[s]t [s]he [s]hould awake. I would have prayed, but you had told me that an undutiful child could never be a favourite of our heavenly Father; [s]o I pre[s][s]ed my hands on my heart, which throbbed [s]o loud, it [s]eemed to [s]ay, Oh! God of the Chri[s]tians, ble[s]s my mother! God knows every thought of the heart, and though I dared not pronounce his [s]acred name with my lips, perhaps its [s]ilent petition may be read and an[s]wered." Eumea pau[s]ed; Reuben would have an[s]wered, but he was at a lo[s]s what to [s]ay. O'Neil, weak and ill as he was, had moved towards her, and [s]itting at her feet, leaning one hand on her knees, his head re[s]ted on it, and his languid eyes were fixed on her face, as he li[s]tened to her with profound attention. "It is my belief," [s]aid he, "that God Almighty never turns away from the prayers of an innocent heart; and then to be [s]ure he knows all we want, when we can't [s]peak to a[s]k for even a mor[s]el of brend. Oh! if we were only to have what we de[s]erved, we [s]hould find but poor accommodations, in our journey through this world; but you [s]ee he was [s]o good as to [s]end people before us, to make every thing comfortable; and all he requires is, that we [s]hall in return make things plea[s]ant and agreeable for them that come after us." Reuben could not help [s]miling at O'Neil's morality. Eumea [s]eemed lo[s]t in thought, and [s]carcely to have attended to what he [s]aid; but when [s]he found he was [s]ilent, [s]he again addre[s][s]ed our hero. "So you [s]ee here I am; but what have I gained by following you? Nothing! for now all that I sufered before for your ab[s]ence, I now feel on account [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-358.jpg) \- external link  - Page 349. ] of my mother. But I will not return. No; I could not [s]upport my father's unkindne[s]s, and my mother's reproaches, which would be the more painful becau[s]e mingled with affection. I will follow you, my dear in[s]tructor, I will be your handmaid, and love and [s]erve you to the la[s]t hour of my life." "And [s]o will I," [s]aid O'Neil, "and I'll well [s]erve you too, my beautiful Indian lady, every day and all the day, and by night too, if [s]o be there be nece[s][s]ity." "And how did you know that you [s]hould find me here?" [s]aid Reuben. "I knew," [s]he replied, "that this was the neare[s]t [s]ettlement, and had I not found you here, I [s]hould have travelled onward to Philadelphia; and had you not been there, I [s]hould have thought you had died by the way, and would have [s]ought you in a better world, the world of [s]pirits." "You would not, I hope, Eumea, have dared to ru[s]h unbidden into eternity?" [s]aid Reuben. "I fear I [s]hould," [s]he replied; "for why [s]hould we endure life, when the nights are pa[s]t in angui[s]h, and every day is a day of [s]orrow? When the wintry bla[s]ts howl, when the [s]now falls, and the fro[s]t binds up the lakes: then, when confined to the wigwam, there is no comfort within, but the tempe[s]t of the pa[s][s]ions rages more furious than the gale that bows the tall cedars, and [s]hakes to the roots the [s]tately oak; why [s]hould we not [s]leep with the infect or the reptile tribes, that pa[s]s the dreary [s]ea[s]on in in[s]en[s]ibility? And when the warm [s]outhern breeze di[s][s]olves the ice, and bids the trees be green, the blo[s][s]om come; when the blackbird whi[s]tles merrily, and the robin begins to dre[s]s his plumes; if then nor fragrant blo[s][s]om, nor cheerful bird, nor flowerspeckled field delight the [s]en[s]e, or [s]oothe the tortured [s]oul, were it not better to [s]eek repo[s]e in other climes, more [s]uited to our feelings? Or when the deer [s]eeks the deep woods, and pants though lying on the river's brink, when the [s]corching [s]un dries the gra[s]s and parches up the ground, where is the harm if, plunging in the wave, we quench the fever that con[s]umes us, or from our veins let out the blood, that ru[s]hes with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-359.jpg) \- external link  - Page 350. ] [s]uch fury through our frame, [s]welling the heart till it is near to bur[s]ting? Or even when the [s]ea[s]on of corn arrives; when clu[s]ters of wild grapes hang on the bending vines; when the berries, blackened by the [s]un, peep through the half-faded leaves; when the cool, [s]oft breeze of evening, and the [s]weet air of the morning, affords refre[s]hing [s]lumbers to the eyelids, or unclo[s]es them to plea[s]ing pro[s]pects, that, being surveyed, makes the heart dance with joy---Ah! then, if the eyes are dimmed with tears and the heart oppressed with [s]orrow; is it a [s]in to [s]eek that happy place where we can neither weep nor [s]uffer more?" "You have profited but little by my in[s]tructions, Eumea," [s]aid Reuben, "if you can argue thus." "I will follow you, then," [s]aid [s]he emphatically, "and endeavour to improve." In about a fortnight, our hero and his companions were enough recovered to continue their journey. It was in vain he entreated Eumea to return to her mother, [s]he per[s]i[s]ted in following him. It was without effect that he repre[s]ented to her, that in accompanying him [s]he would be looked upon with di[s]re[s]pect by the European women; her re[s]olution was taken and was not to be [s]haken. The appearance of Reuben and his followers was mi[s]erable in the extreme when they entered Philadelphia; and what added to their mi[s]ery was, that among[s]t them all they had not a [s]ingle copper, nor any friends to whom they could apply for a[s][s]i[s]tance. The forlorn group had cro[s][s]ed the Schuylkill, and with weary [s]teps were approaching the city, when a venerable man of the [s]ociety of Friends, riding out for exerci[s]e and air, [s]urveyed them with an eye of compa[s][s]ion, and [s]topping his hor[s]e---"Friend," [s]aid he, addre[s][s]ing Reuben, "both thou and thy companions [s]eem fatigued, and appear to have taken a long journey; from whence do[s]t thou come?" "From captivity," [s]aid Reuben. "Yes," cried O'Neil, who, having recovered his u[s]ual [s]pirits, pu[s]hed forward to [s]peak for him[s]elf; "yes, we have been obliged to pay a pretty long vi[s]it [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-360.jpg) \- external link  - Page 351. ] to the copper-coloured gentlefolks, and if we had not come away as we did, they would have [s]calped us and roa[s]ted us, and then a pretty figure we [s]hould have cut! But this dear creature, who, though [s]he is a little darki[s]h or [s]o, has a heart as beautiful as an angel; [s]o [s]he told us what they were about going to do. Said [s]he, Get up, my lads, and run away whil[s]t you can; for to-morrow you will have no legs to run with. So away we came, and a fine trampoo[s]e we have had. And now we have got here, I don't know that we are much better off; for if they had roa[s]ted us, we [s]hould not a lived to be [s]tarved to death; for a devil a penny have we got to buy bread." "Neverthele[s]s," [s]aid the benevolent friend, "thou [s]halt not [s]tarve. I am not rich; but Heaven forbid that I [s]hould [s]uffer a fellow-creature to want while I have a mor[s]el to give him, or a blanket to [s]pare to [s]helter him from the inclemencies of the weather. I have a hou[s]e on the banks of the Delaware, but a very [s]hort di[s]tance from the city, and its doors were never [s]hut again[s]t the unfortunate; come home with me, then, and bring the good Indian maiden with thee. It matters not to what nation, kindred or people they belong who are in affliction; I feel they are my brethren, and as [s]uch, I will gladly [s]hare my own comforts with them." They heard with delight the genuine effu[s]ions of mercy and benevolence flow from the lips of the man of peace, and being directed by him, pur[s]ued their way to the habitation of ho[s]pitality. "A [s]mall man[s]ion, built by frugality and furni[s]hed by [s]implicity, [s]ituated on the banks of the Delaware, and [s]urrounded by a large and well-cultivated garden, was the dwelling of Stedfa[s]t Trueman. Elizabeth his wife was not hand[s]ome, but there was [s]omething in her look, voice and manner, more charming than beauty. Her hou[s]e, her children, her[s]elf, were pure emblems of neatne[s]s, innocence and indu[s]try. She heard that [s]ome poor gue[s]ts were arrived, directed to their friendly roof by her hu[s]band, came into the kitchen to bid them welcome, and with her own hands [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-361.jpg) \- external link  - Page 352. ] a[s][s]i[s]ted to [s]et forth refre[s]hment. The children came round them, [s]ome eagerly curious and inqui[s]itive, and others timidly [s]tanding aloof, to ob[s]erve the [s]trange dre[s]s and appearance of the travellers. In this a[s]ylum, Reuben and his companions [s]oon recruited both health and [s]pirits. Their benevolent friend [s]upplied them with [s]ome coar[s]e clothing, the joint product of his farm and his wife's indu[s]try. In the cour[s]e of conver[s]ation our hero mentioned his father's name. "Dudley," [s]aid friend Trueman; "I knew him well; a more worthy, hone[s]t man never exi[s]ted. If thou art his [s]on, thou ha[s]t, I fear, been greatly wronged by the man Jacob Holmes. I have rea[s]on to believe thy father was a man of [s]trict integrity, and that he would not premeditatedly a[s][s]ert a fal[s]ehood. He did declare to me in confidence every particular of his pa[s]t life, and though he did not boa[s]t of his good deeds, yet I gathered enough to believe that Jacob was the child of his bounty. But the man has [s]ince [s]o boldly and [s]olemnly contradicted that belief, that I dare not judge too ra[s]hly; and Heaven forbid that I [s]hould condemn him; for, ju[s]t or unju[s]t, he is gone to give an account of his [s]teward[s]hip before Him, who, requiring but humility, ju[s]tice and mercy from his [s]ervants toward their fellow-creatures, will in no wi[s]e excu[s]e tho[s]e who [s]light his coun[s]els, or break his commandments." Reuben was [s]urpri[s]ed. "Is Jacob Holmes then dead?" [s]aid he. "Verily he [s]leepeth with his fathers," [s]aid Trueman. "He was greatly hurt about three months [s]ince, by a fall from his hor[s]e; the brui[s]e was internal, brought on a [s]pitting of blood, which baffled all medical aid, and he went off [s]uddenly, when he supposed him[s]elf mending. Indeed, I was told he never believed him[s]elf in danger. More is the pity; the rod of affliction, that warns us of approaching di[s][s]olution, is a [s]alutary and nece[s][s]ary judgment, that as we bow under the correcting hand, we may implore that mercy which is never withheld from the penitent [s]inner." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-362.jpg) \- external link  - Page 353. ] "And who inherits his e[s]tate?" [s]aid Reuben. "His infant [s]on, who with his mother, [s]till re[s]ides in the hou[s]e." "Mrs. Holmes is a worthy woman," [s]aid Reuben, "and po[s][s]e[s][s]es an hone[s]t [s]implicity of heart extremely intere[s]ting. Oh bounteous Di[s]po[s]er of events," continued he, and his [s]oul expanded as he [s]poke, "vi[s]it not, I humbly be[s]eech thee, the [s]ins of the father upon the child; but may he live to be a comfort to his mother, a friend to the worthy, and thy faithful servant to a good old age." "Thy pious prayers, good young man," [s]aid Trueman, "return tenfold on thy own head." The unfortunate participators of Reuben's captivity being recruited, departed in [s]earch of employment; but him[s]elf, O'Neil and Eumea were detained in the habitation of friend Trueman, who wi[s]hed to place our hero in [s]ome reputable employ, meant to detain O'Neil in his own [s]ervice, and thought the food and raiment necessary to render the Indian maid comfortable, would never be mi[s][s]ed by his own family. The inquiries he [s]et on foot for employment for our hero made it universally known that he was returned to Philadelphia. One morning, as he [s]at conver[s]ing with Trueman, he was [s]urpri[s]ed by the entrance of Mrs. Holmes. She advanced to him with a firm but eager [s]tep, and presenting her hand, "I am glad to [s]ee thee, friend Reuben," [s]aid [s]he; "I did not hear of thy return till yester even, or I [s]hould have come to vi[s]it thee before." Our hero cordially [s]hook her proffered hand, led her to a [s]eat, and told her he was happy in an opportunity to renew their acquaintance. "I expect thou do[s]t know already that Jacob Holmes is gone home," [s]aid [s]he, her bo[s]om heaving and her eyes [s]wimming in tears. Reuben bowed a[s][s]ent. "Thou ha[s]t no right to regret his departure," continued [s]he, "but he was the cho[s]en friend of my heart, the father of my child, the [s]upport of his family; his lo[s]s to me is irreparable." She pau[s]ed a moment. "I have, [s]ince his departure," [s]he continued, recovering her voice, "di[s]covered among[s]t [s]ome old papers, which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-363.jpg) \- external link  - Page 354. ] I do dope and believe he had never in[s]pected, the attested copy of a will, and other accounts of consequence to thee. Here they are; thou wilt find by them that thou art the real po[s][s]e[s][s]or of Mount Pleasant. I am [s]ure I could not be happy to detain it from the lawful owner, and I here relinqui[s]h all claim to it, and throw both my[s]elf and child upon your benevolence." She then untied a handkerchief, and delivered the papers into the hands of Reuben, who[s]e feelings on the occa[s]ion cannot ea[s]ily be de[s]cribed. Our hero, thus rai[s]ed almo[s]t in[s]tantaneou[s]ly from extreme poverty to a [s]tate of ea[s]e, and indeed (what in tho[s]e days of moderation was termed) affluence, made it his fir[s]t care to place Mrs. Holmes and her [s]on in a comfortable habitation, and to [s]ettle upon them one third of all his father died po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of. He placed Eumea with her, who a[s][s]iduou[s]ly endeavoured to conform to the European dre[s]s, cu[s]toms and manners; but [s]he pined at being [s]eparated from Reuben, and if more than two days elap[s]ed without her [s]eeing him, [s]he would give way to the mo[s]t violent affliction. Our hero had, previous to his campaign again[s]t the Indians, frequently written to his [s]i[s]ter; but the[s]e letters being directed to the care of Mr. Andrew Atkins, were never forwarded to our heroine; indeed, after the fir[s]t, he might have pleaded in excu[s]e that he did not know where to find her. Reuben made every inquiry at the po[s]t-office, and of the ma[s]ters of ve[s][s]els then arriving from England, for letters, but could hear of none addre[s][s]ed to himself; and he meditated a voyage to his native place, in order to bring his [s]i[s]ter over, and [s]ometimes indulging the fond hope, that Je[s][s]y Oliver might accompany her. But as he had much to [s]ettle previous to taking [s]o long a voyage, he deferred it till the en[s]uing [s]pring. His friend, Stedfa[s]t Trueman, had made a purcha[s]e of [s]ome land [s]ituated in New-Jer[s]ey, near the mouth of the Delaware; he thought it nece[s][s]ary to vi[s]it it this autumn, and plan out the improvements he meant [s]hould take place in the [s]pring. He invited Reuben [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-364.jpg) \- external link  - Page 355. ] to accompany him on this excur[s]ion, and he, wi[s]hing to [s]ee a little of that part of the country, a[s][s]ented. Their journey was extremely plea[s]ant; but on the day preceding that they had [s]ettled for their return to Philadelphia, a cold [s]torm, [s]uch as often precedes or accompanies the [s]un's autumnal pa[s][s]age acro[s]s the equinox, commenced, and they re[s]olved to tarry till its fury was abated. On the evening of the [s]econd day, it was increa[s]ed to a tremendous degree, not blowing [s]teadily, but in gu[s]ts, that threw the ocean into horrible convul[s]ions, heaping up va[s]t mountainous waves that [s]eemed to threaten heaven, and leaving hollow cha[s]ms, in which the ve[s][s]els (which they could plainly de[s]cry from the windows of the hou[s]e they were in) [s]eemed often to be lo[s]t, though in a moment after they appeared again on the [s]ummit of the highest wave. Friend Trueman and our hero were greatly affected at the evident di[s]tre[s]s in which [s]everal [s]mall barks appeared; they [s]tood anxiou[s]ly watching them, till the curtain of night [s]hut them from their view. The hou[s]e they were in was [s]ituated at the entrance of Great Egg-Harbour; and as the [s]torm abated in [s]ome trifling degree towards morning, Reuben and his friend aro[s]e with the earlie[s]t dawn, to [s]ee if any [s]igns of wrecks were apparent, or if they could be of any service to the [s]uffering mariners, who might, if luckily they e[s]caped [s]uch a cata[s]trophe, be in want of friends and a[s][s]i[s]tance. They wrapped them[s]elves in their great coats, and walked towards the [s]ea, where they pre[s]ently de[s]cried a [s]hip dreadfully [s]hattered, endeavouring to make the harbour. Her forema[s]t and maintopmast were gone; [s]ome of her [s]ails, torn in atoms, were fluttering in the wind, and the few [s]he could expand were [s]carcely manageable. Long they laboured, for [s]ome hours oppo[s]ed both by wind and tide; at length the latter turned in her favour, and [s]he fetched in, but not without making repeated [s]ignals of di[s]tre[s]s; and it was very evident, as [s]he approached the [s]hore, that [s]he laboured heavily in the water, and all the [s]pectators concluded [s]he was in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-365.jpg) \- external link  - Page 356. ] danger of [s]inking. The [s]ea ran [s]o high, no boat could, without imminent ri[s]k, go to the a[s][s]i[s]tance of the wretched crew. At length a fi[s]hing boat ventured off. The people on board had thrown out an anchor, but [s]he dragged it, and the wind [s]etting acro[s]s the harbour, [s]he was making [s]tern foremo[s]t to the [s]hore. Ju[s]t as the boat reached her, [s]he [s]truck, and the cries of the affrighted [s]ailors and pa[s][s]engers reached the ears of tho[s]e who [s]tood on the [s]hore, waiting in [s]u[s]pen[s]e and horror to behold the fate of [s]o fine a [s]hip and her unfortunate company. Several women were [s]een on the deck, and the [s]pectators [s]eemed as though they could have given their own lives to preserve the lives of the [s]ufferers. When the boat reached the [s]hip, the people ru[s]hed over the [s]ides into her; the women were helped in, and in a few moments their [s]ituation was as perilous from having overloaded the boat, as it had been before in the ve[s][s]el. However, they put off, and made towards the [s]hore; the wind favoured them, and the [s]pectators exultingly cried, In five minutes they will be all [s]afe; but in a much le[s]s time, a [s]udden flaw took the [s]ails; from the number of per[s]ons on board, the fi[s]hermen could not flack the [s]heets in time, and [s]he over[s]et. All the aim of tho[s]e on [s]hore was now to [s]ave, if po[s][s]ible, the lives of [s]ome, who, borne by the foaming [s]urge, [s]eemed almo[s]t to reach the land, when the receding wave would da[s]h them back into the dread aby[s]s of waters. Spars fa[s]tened by ropes were thrown into the [s]ea, while a number of men on [s]hore [s]tood ready to drag them to land, [s]hould any de[s]pairing wretch [s]eize them as the means of deliverance. Reuben was bu[s]ied in this humane endeavour, when he heard a [s]hout of exultation from a group of men employed in the [s]ame manner at a little di[s]tance. They waved al[s]o for more help. He therefore quitted his own party, which was more numerous, and ran to their a[s][s]i[s]tance, when he perceived that two women had been already [s]natched from a watery grave, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-366.jpg) \- external link  - Page 357. ] [s]everal men were, by the help of the [s]pars, near the [s]hore. "Here," [s]aid the ma[s]ter of the hou[s]e at which they lodged, "here, take this poor infant, and carry it to the hou[s]e, bid my dame make up a large fire in every room, and get all the beds ready. You mu[s]t [s]leep on the floor to-night, Sir." Reuben cla[s]ped the poor little dripping infant to his naked brea[s]t, wrapped his coat round it, and was delighted to find, by a faint moaning noi[s]e it made, that in all probability it would recover. He ran to the hou[s]e, gave the child into the care of a kind hearted Negro wench, and then returned to help the two women. One was entirely [s]en[s]ele[s]s, for [s]he had dropped on the very moment [s]he reached the [s]hore; the other was unable to walk or [s]peak, but yet could make [s]igns that her [s]en[s]es were perfect. Reuben a[s][s]i[s]ted to carry them in, gave them in charge to the women of the hou[s]e, and then returned to the [s]ea [s]ide; but [s]oon perceiving nothing more was to be done, he came back to inquire after the little traveller. "The women are both recovered," [s]aid a man, as he entered the hou[s]e. "I am glad of it," [s]aid Reuben; "might I be admitted to [s]peak to them; they are no doubt Engli[s]h women, and will rejoice to find a countryman [s]o near them, who is willing and ready to render them any [s]ervice." This me[s][s]age was carried to the ladies, and in a moment he was admitted. They were in [s]eparate beds in the [s]ame room. Reuben drew near that which was next the door; the per[s]on who occupied it rai[s]ed herself partly, and exclaiming, "It is! it is my brother!" threw her[s]elf into his arms, which, [s]inking on the bed be[s]ide her, he had extended to receive her; for the moment he beheld her face, he recognized his [s]i[s]ter, and the exclamation of `Dear Reuben!' `beloved Rachel! ' mutually e[s]caped their lips as they bur[s]t into a flood of tears. And what were the feelings of Je[s][s]y Oliver at this moment? they were inde[s]cribable. She folded her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-367.jpg) \- external link  - Page 358. ] hands over her face, and the [s]ilent tears trickled through her fingers. Rachel recovered articulation fir[s]t. "Reuben," [s]aid [s]he, "there is a dear friend of both yours and mine; 'tis Je[s][s]y Oliver, who has been my friend, my [s]upporter, my more than [s]i[s]ter." Reuben left his [s]i[s]ter, and dropping on his knees by the bed[s]ide of Je[s][s]y, drew her hands from her face, and feeling more at that moment for her kindne[s]s to his [s]i[s]ter, than from any other motive, pre[s][s]ed them to his heart, and cried, "May Heaven forever ble[s]s you." The en[s]uing [s]cene may be conceived, but cannot be de[s]cribed. Reuben di[s]covered, from the lamentations of his [s]i[s]ter, that it was her infant he had brought to the hou[s]e ([s]he had dropped it at the moment of landing when her [s]en[s]es failed her, and imagined it drowned) and he had the exqui[s]ite plea[s]ure of re[s]toring it to her arms. A few days rein[s]tated their health and [s]pirits, and our hero, with his friend Stedfa[s]t Trueman, e[s]corted the happy Rachel and Je[s][s]y to Philadelphia. The former explained every circum[s]tance of her marriage, and its [s]ub[s]equent con[s]equences; and the latter when [s]olicited to become mi[s]tre[s]s of Mount Plea[s]ant, did not frown or threaten to be obdurate. They arrived at friend Trueman's hou[s]e about midday, and after taking a [s]light refre[s]hment, Reuben, with his [s]i[s]ter and her charming friend, proceeded to Mount Plea[s]ant. They were met at the gate by O'Neil. "Och! my dare ma[s]ter," [s]aid he, "I'm mighty glad you are come back, for here has been a [s]trange [s]ort of a gentleman here, and for the matter of that he is here now, in our hou[s]e, but he is [s]ick; [s]o as he [s]eemed to love your honour, and talk kindly of my good lady your [s]i[s]ter that I have heard your honour [s]peak of, I put him into the be[s]t chamber, and [s]ent for a doctor, and I hope your honour won't be angry, because you [s]ee I did as if I had been in your honour's place." O'Neil would have gone on, had he not [s]een a chai[s]e approach (for Reuben was on hor[s]eback). "And be the[s]e vi[s]itors?" [s]aid he. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-368.jpg) \- external link  - Page 359. ] "Yes," replied our hero, "and the very [s]i[s]ter you [s]poke of, and a charming lady, who I hope will [s]oon become your mi[s]tre[s]s, O'Neil." The hone[s]t, affectionate O'Neil [s]tayed not to reply; he darted forward, and [s]eemed as if he would have helped the hor[s]e that drew the [s]i[s]ter of his beloved ma[s]ter. When the carriage [s]topped, he waited not for ceremony; but as Je[s][s]y [s]tood on the [s]ide of the chai[s]e ready to alight, he [s]eized her in his arms, and bore her into the hou[s]e; then running back, took the child from Rachel, (whom Reuben had helped out of the chai[s]e) almo[s]t devoured it with ki[s][s]es, and leaping, dancing and capering, cried, "Yes! yes! he will be happy after all, I knew he would, I was always [s]ure he would. O that my dear Mi[s]tre[s]s Juliana was but alive now!" Perhaps the reader has before this [s]urmi[s]ed, that the [s]trange, inqui[s]itive, [s]ick gentleman was no other than Hamden Auberry, who had embarked for Philadelphia immediately after his knowledge of our heroine's [s]eeking him in that place; but the [s]hip in which he embarked being a fa[s]t [s]ailer, and [s]teering a different cour[s]e to that pur[s]ued by the one in which was his wife, arrived [s]afe in the port of Philadelphia the very night before the commencement of the [s]torm in which poor Rachel [s]uffered [s]o much, and [s]o nearly e[s]caped with life. His fir[s]t inquiries were for Reuben, and he was directed to Mount Plea[s]ant; on his arrival there, he learnt that Rachel was not arrived, and that Reuben was ab[s]ent from home. Change of climate, the fatigues of a long voyage, and the angui[s]h of mind he had endured for [s]ix months pa[s]t, had [s]o enervated his frame and [s]hook his con[s]titution, that when he attempted to remount the hor[s]e that brought him, he turned [s]o faint as to be obliged to return to the hou[s]e, where he grew [s]o much wor[s]e, that O'Neil (as he had told his ma[s]ter) advi[s]ed him to go to bed, and [s]ent for a doctor. The meeting between our heroine and her hu[s]band was all that real affection and [s]en[s]ibility can imagine. Rachel wept, and regretted the pain [s]he had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-369.jpg) \- external link  - Page 360. ] unintentionally given him, whil[s]t he implored her pardon for that fal[s]e pride, which had fir[s]t expo[s]ed her to the suspicions and in[s]ults of tho[s]e who, envying her [s]uperior merit, rejoiced in an opportunity to level her with their own contaminated ideas. About [s]ix weeks after this happy meeting, Reuben received the hand of Je[s][s]y Oliver. It was a day of fe[s]tivity. The gates of Mount Plea[s]ant were thrown open, and every vi[s]itor made welcome. To add to their mirth, a dance in the evening was to fini[s]h the entertainment. A [s]ocial meal, di[s]pen[s]ed with cheerfulne[s]s, and partaken with a true [s]pirit of hilarity, had been ju[s]t removed, when the parlour door ha[s]tily opened, and Eumea entered. Her hair hung loo[s]e about her shoulders; her eyes were wild, aud her voice broken. She ru[s]hed toward Reuben and Je[s][s]y, and taking a hand from each, joined them; then pre[s][s]ing them to her bo[s]om, rai[s]ed her eyes to heaven--- "God of the Chri[s]tians," [s]aid [s]he fervently, "make them forever happy. Wife of Reuben, thou art a happy woman, for thy hu[s]band is a man of honour. He [s]aw the weakne[s]s of a poor, unprotected Indian maid, he pitied her folly, but took no advantage of it." Je[s][s]y was affected by the [s]imple yet fervent addre[s]s. Reuben took the hand of Eumea, and would have made her [s]it down, but [s]he refu[s]ed. "No! no!" [s]aid [s]he, "Eumea will re[s]t no more, know peace no more. I had rai[s]ed a deity of my own, built an altar in my bo[s]om, and daily offered the sacrifice of a fond, an affectionate heart; but the days are pa[s]t, I can wor[s]hip no longer without a crime. Farewel," [s]aid [s]he, enthu[s]ia[s]tically ela[s]ping her hands, "do not quite forget the poor, poor Eumea!" She then left the hou[s]e, and Reuben [s]ent a per[s]on to follow and [s]ee that [s]he came to no ill. She went home, but continued not long there; a young woman, who from her wild looks and incoherent language imagined her mind to be di[s]ordered, endeavoured to detain her, but in vain. About the du[s]k of the evening [s]he went out, and all inquiry for her was fruitle[s]s [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-370.jpg) \- external link  - Page 361. ] till three days after, when as Reuben was giving [s]ome orders to O'Neil, in that part of his ground that lay on the verge of the Schuylkill, they di[s]covered something floating on the water; the garments be[s]poke it a woman. Reuben's heart [s]huddered; they dragged it to the [s]hore; it was the corp[s]e of poor Eumea. Reuben [s]ighed, rai[s]ed his eyes to heaven, but was [s]ilent. Not [s]o O'Neil. He fell on his knees be[s]ide the pale cor[s]e, and his hone[s]t heart bur[s]t in a torrent from his eyes. "Och! my flower of the fore[s]t," [s]aid he, "and art thou gone, and was it love that made thee leave us? Beautiful, good, [s]weete[s]t of [s]avages---O! thy poor O'Neil can pity thee. And what [s]hall he do now thou ha[s]t clo[s]ed thine eyes? Thou ha[s]t murdered thy [s]weet [s]elf, and what is there now in the world that he cares for?" Reuben was [s]truck with the fervency and humility that was at once expre[s][s]ed by O'Neil; for it [s]poke as plain as words could [s]peak, `I loved her, but I never dared to tell my love, le[s]t it [s]hould offend her.' Our hero by degrees drew him from the contemplation of the melancholy object, and proper forms being gone through in regard to the body, it was buried in a field near the margin of the river. O'Neil banked up the grave, twi[s]ted o[s]ier twigs and fenced it round; at the head he planted a weeping willow, and at the foot a wild ro[s]e tree. Of a night when his labour was fini[s]hed, he would vi[s]it the [s]pot, [s]ing old ditties, and weep whil[s]t he [s]ung; and though he lived to good old age, O'Neil never knew another love. After this period, our heroine for many years enjoyed an uninterrupted [s]eries of felicity. Auberry, entirely occupied by the cares of a mercantile life, into which he had [s]ucce[s]sfully entered, and giving every lei[s]ure moment to the a[s][s]i[s]ting of Rachel in the education of a beautiful ri[s]ing family, was entirely cured of jealousy and ambition, and wondered he could have ever doubted the faith of his wife, or have ri[s]qued losing [s]o va[s]t a trea[s]ure forever, rather than relinqui[s]h the hope of being rich and great. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-371.jpg) \- external link  - Page 362. ] Reuben and Je[s][s]y were patterns of conjugal felicity, and that felicity was increa[s]ed in the cour[s]e of a few years, by the arrival of old Mr. Oliver, Archibald and Courtney. The former had [s]aved a trifle from the wreck of his fortune, which had been almo[s]t di[s][s]ipated by a worthle[s]s woman. Archibald brought with him an amiable bride in the per[s]on of Courtney's [s]i[s]ter. The abandoned Mrs. Courtney had met the fate her vicious cour[s]e of life merited, and died abroad, neglected by all her pretended lovers, a victim to di[s]ea[s]e, poverty and remor[s]e. It was in the [s]eventh year of our hero and heroine's happy [s]ettlement in Philadelphia, that the latter was told one morning that a gentleman from England desired to [s]ee her. She went into the parlour, and beheld, to her infinite [s]urpri[s]e, Mr. Allibi. "Mrs. Auberry, I pre[s]ume," [s]aid he, bowing profoundly. "I am happy, Madam, to be the fir[s]t to wi[s]h you joy on a very great and unexpected acce[s][s]ion of fortune. Your hu[s]band's relation, lady Anne, is dead; al[s]o her brother the Earl, and I may now [s]alute you Counte[s]s of Montmorill. Moreover," continued he, not giving her leave to [s]peak, "I am to inform you, by order of Mr. Andrew Atkins, that your[s]elf and brother, Mr. Reuben Dudley, being the only de[s]cendants of the lady Arrabella Ruthven, who married about the year 1644-5, with Edward Dudley, [s]on of Henry Dudley, de[s]cendant of the unfortunate lady Jane Grey, and who relinqui[s]hing her title, embarked with him for America; as I [s]ay, your[s]elf and brother being the only legitimate de[s]cendants of that marriage, you are acknowledged joint heirs to the titles and immen[s]e estates of the hou[s]e of Ruthven. And I am commissioned by my very good friend, Mr. Andrew Atkins, to receive your orders in what manner he [s]hall proceed in regard to [s]aid e[s]tates, and to inform you, your Lancashire e[s]tate is now, through his care, entirely free from incumbrances." Rachel, overwhelmed by the rapidity with which Allibi related all this good news, and [s]carcely crediting what [s]he heard, yet under[s]tanding [s]ufficient, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-372.jpg) \- external link  - Page 363. ] perfectly to comprehend the mean fine[s][s]e of Allibi and his dirty employer, in thus informing her of her acce[s][s]ion of fortune, and making a merit of relinqui[s]hing the Lanca[s]hire e[s]tate, in hopes of being made agent and [s]teward to tho[s]e of much greater value, could [s]carcely command her temper, whil[s]t [s]he interrogated him concerning the extraordinary intelligence he conveyed. However, being a[s]certained of the truth of his assertions, and received from him [s]ome papers of consequence, with a long, ful[s]ome, congratulatory letter from Mr. Andrew Atkins, [s]he appointed him to call the en[s]uing morning, when her brother and hu[s]band would be [s]ure to meet him. On the following morning, therefore, at a little pa[s]t eight o'clock, Mr. Allibi entered the breakfa[s]t parlour, where he found Reuben, Rachel, Mr. Auberry and Mrs. Dudley a[s][s]embled to breakfa[s]t. After partaking a [s]ocial meal, and delivering and atte[s]ting to every nece[s][s]ary paper, both in regard to their new acquisitions and the Lanca[s]hire e[s]tate, he was [s]omewhat a[s]toni[s]hed to hear Reuben addre[s]s him in the following words:--- "You may think, Mr. Allibi, that by bringing us this intelligence you have greatly heightened our felicity; and in one re[s]pect you have, as it extends our power of [s]erving our fellow-creatures. As to titles, both my brother Auberry and his wife Rachel, join with me to renounce them; they are di[s]tinctions nothing worth, and [s]hould by no means be introduced into a young country, where the only di[s]tinction between man and man [s]hould be made by virtue, genius and education. Our [s]ons are true-born Americans, and while they [s]trive to make that title re[s]pectable, we wi[s]h them to po[s][s]e[s]s no other. Let the titles then go, and [s]uch of the e[s]tates as are annexed to them, to more di[s]tant branches of our [s]everal families, or in ca[s]e of default of heirs, let them [s]ink into oblivion. Of the immen[s]e property of which we are become po[s][s]e[s][s]ors, we [s]hall retain no more than will [s]et our [s]ons forward in bu[s]ine[s]s, and give our daughters moderate portions; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf329v2&image=329-373.jpg) \- external link  - Page 364. ] the re[s]idue [s]hall be equally divided among[s]t the indigent relatives of both families." Allibi brightened at the[s]e words, thinking he [s]hould be con[s]tituted agent in this bu[s]ine[s]s; but Reuben continued:--- "I am obliged to you for the trouble you have taken on my account, and hold my[s]elf your debtor for the expen[s]es of your voyage and other contingencies, which, whenever you plea[s]e, I [s]hall be ready to discharge; and when you return, I will trouble you with a letter to Mr. Andrew Atkins, informing him he will be no farther troubled with my affairs, but will plea[s]e to [s]ettle all accounts with Mr. Courtney, a gentleman who has kindly undertaken to go to England for that purpo[s]e." The poor, di[s]appointed Allibi could [s]carcely breathe at the conclu[s]ion of this [s]peech; he [s]huffled on his [s]eat, attempted to recommend him[s]elf by reprobating the conduct of Atkins, but a look of marked contempt from Reuben [s]ilenced him; and, mortified beyond endurance, he ro[s]e ha[s]tily and took his leave. In a [s]hort time, Courtney embarked for England, [s]ettled every thing according to the directions of Reuben and Auberry, made many an orphan glad, and many a di[s]con[s]olate heart leap for joy. He liberated the poor debtor, a[s][s]orded relief to depre[s][s]ed merit, and wiped away the tear from the eye of [s]uffering virtue. The incen[s]e of gratitude a[s]cended towards heaven, and was returned in ble[s][s]ings on the heads of Reuben, Rachel, and their po[s]terity. FINIS .
