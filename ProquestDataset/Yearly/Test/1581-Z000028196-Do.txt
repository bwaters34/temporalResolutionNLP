My floures bee of full growthe, and minister sweete and sowre smelles, to sundrie complexions: If thei please your honour with their homely rudenesse, for backbityng Ignoraunce, I esteeme it of small importaunce. I had rather the Enuious should woorke me credite, by their iniurious follie, then the noble myndes of my valiaunt good Lordes, should any waies misse of accustomed pleasure; and the fruites of my seruiceable, and dutifull endeuour; and thus I moste humbly take my leaue. Your honours Souldior and Seruaunt humblie to commaunde. Barnabe Riche. sendeth greetyng. Gentilmen , for your pleasures, I haue laied open the Anatomie of a curious louer, the fantasies of an Amorous Heremite, the costancie of a vertuous lady, the mediocritie of a gracious Prince, the confession of a deuoute Matrone, the description of notable Pandarina: the passion of a solitarie Shepeherde: the discourse of a gallante Souldior: the graue aduise of an auncient Father, the wholesome counsaill of a yong brother Pilgrime: and to conclude, the passionate demeanure of a foolishe obstinate Louer. I haue the rather indeuoured to laie this open to the worlde, for that (now adaies) it is more infected with this folly, then affected with the desire of continent staiednesse. This booke bringeth pleasure with profite: it reproueth vice in his owne habite, and manifesteth vertue, by openyng the infection of errour. All this (Gentilmen) I haue dooen for your sakes, to whose pleasure I comende my paines. For the acceptaunce of my labour, as there are twoo sortes of men that shall see it, so there is but one sorte that will like it. The well lettered will wincke at an errour, the capcious misliker, will finde faulte without a cause. For the one I will honour his Modestie, for the other I will laugh at his follie: For he that correcteth in opinion, shall bee accoumpted vnwise, by aduised iudgement. If wee striue aboute the letter, and leaue the sence, wee might seeme, desirous to write verballie, rather then wiselie. The Souldiour (how so euer the worlde goeth) hath sette out this Whetstone for yong wittes, wishyng that his vnlettered diligence, might make their Idell tymes, better occupied. If this please well, I will wade farther: if it displeaseth the ignoraunte, I am vndoubtedlie perswaded of the wise. But please or displease, the worlde muste now vewe it, who since it is a toy, do but vse it as a trifell: now read it, strait loose it: farewell. B. R. To noate or coate, the thyng that is amisse, Good Riche a wiseman hardly can denye, But that your Booke by me ill mended is: My hedde suche pleasure can not brooke bygis Whose long distresse hath laied his Muse to rest, Or duld his Sprightes, or sences at the lest. Some errours yet, if any suche there bee, Your willyng mynde, maie quicklie them subdue, For wisemen winke, when often tymes thei see, Yet fooles are blynde, when moste thei seeme to vewe, Of proude contempt this mischief doeth ensue, That he that scornes the fruite of honest toile, From bace regard, hymself can scarce assoile. The wisest men, for that thei mortall were, Did runne amisse, and kept not leuell still, Some wanton woorkes, some grauer stile did beare, Yet eche proceeded from the self same quill: Wee ought not thinke, that those mens myndes were ill, For sure the vice, that thei did laye in sight, Was for to make it growe in more despight. I leaue thee now, my Muse, affordes no more, A dolefull dumpe, pulles backe my pleasaunt vaine, Looke thou for praise, by men of learned lore, Despise the skoffe, that growes from shuttle braine, For me I honour thee for taking paine, And wishe eche youth, that spendes his tyme amisse, Would fixe his penne to write suche woorkes as this. Vita misero longa, faelici breuis. Or writes to teache all men dame vertues lore: Shall suche confused stuffe and method make, As nere was writ, or came to passe before. He pleaseth none, that would content vs all, As good sit still therefore as rise and fall. To write of mirthe, delightes naught whitt the Drone, To muche of witte, doeth loath the foolishe sotte: The captious mate, would serue his mynde alone, All graue preceptes are now a daies forgotte. Who pleaseth not the worlde shall reape no gaine, And who so doeth shall spende his tyme in vaine. If decent mirthe bemixt with pleasaunt stile, Maie moue thy minde good reader to delight: Accept his will, reward his paine with praise, Whiche did this fine and pleasaunt storie wright. Wherein thou shalt, of witte and learnyng finde, Sufficient store to please, thy courteous minde. The faultes are myne, that passed haue the Presse, The praise is his, that tooke the paine to penne: Yet paines to bothe, of truthe I must confesse, A thanklesse woorke, to please all kinde of menne. Yet as it is receiue, and there an ende, A woorke well likte of all, is wisely pende. FINIS. R. W. assured friendes of equal vertue,  & indoubted wealth made their abode: to whome, both Nature added perfectio, in that they were friendly, and neybourhood wrought Amytie, by long intercourse: Lawmenio , reioyced in his Calides , equal vertues procure iust proportions, & friendships way downe to the Center of aduisment: And as continuance had enterchangeably performed a league betweene the aged Parentes, so God and Nature (the perfiters of substance) with equal distrybution, imparted the seedes of the Parentes loue, to the corporall conformytie of the children: Lawmenios sonne, was christened Simonides: Calides , reporteth his Daughters name, to bee Clarinda : Now, what indifferent Iudge can denie, that the fathers vertues are not answerable in the children, since their vices are so comon? The fathers were friends, nature made the children friendly, hauing a greater yssue when their yeares were forward to perfection. These yong Ymphes (as the propynquite of place requyred) had often intercourse, youthly practises, and chyldish conueyances: and as their yeares grew, so increased their affections, while youth serued (I meane the tyme vnseasoned with impressions of likyng:) My virgyn Clarinda , would play with her Simonides : yet when Simonides had gotten yeares on his backe, my Youthe must pray his Clarinda . Oh Gentles see these times, yeares are the Mistresses of sinnes, and childhoode the minyster of Innocency: my coople in youth loue naturall consorte, in yeares of discretion vnnaturally, dismembre nature, who (as the wiseman sayeth) hath made vs all for increase. Simonides , at yeares of discretion, is calde on by his Father to marry. Clarinda , at her prime perfection, is vowed by Diana to chastitie. A hard summons, where beautie shall not yeelde to sensualitie, by whom (as the Poets fayne) she was bred. The Youth whom towardenesse had ledde to iudge of coulours, considering the harde, and importunate commaund of the parentes, and the willing instigation of his owne nature: bethought himselfe of his choice, consideringe with hymselfe, that hee that marrieth, weddeth for lyfe, not for yeares: wherevppon hee determined to like of his possession before he would enter. Amongst his Ciuill Maydens, hee bethought him of his choyce, for hys Father had determyned the lymmyts. Shamefastnesse, (the Badge of youthe) made him loath to attempt vnknowne Fortes: and an olde inueterat conceipte, made him amongst all other opinions, to say a prayer at Clarindaes Shrine: for Don Cupid had commaunded that she onely shoulde be Misteris of his affections, which he perceiued: (for inward conceipt, rules our outward apperations,) bethought himselfe, of his she neighbour, his olde companion: and hauing some secreat oportunitie, and heere withall imaginynge, that Clarinda woulde wedde, as well to playe in earnest, as shee coulde vouchsafe, to driue awaye the time in iest, fynding place conuenient hee vttered this discourse. My Misteris Clarinda , if you knewe, what message I bringe, and heare the enterparle I must imploye, perhappes, the straungenesse wyll make you maruell: but the necessitie inforceth mee to speake: You and I (fayre Uirgin) haue two louing parentes, whose inward loues, haue bene furtherers of our acquaintaunce: My Father hath mee his onelye sonne, to increase his progenie: your Calides , hath you his onely Daughter, to multiplye in addition, and to endeuour your selfe, that your Fathers labour, be not determined in you: I am commaunded to wed, and you were borne to loue: I am to make my choice, if for acquaintaunce, shoulde I refuse Clarinda ? if for beautie, I neede not seeke Venus : for vertues, as they are hardly founde in Women, so are they not to seeke in you: You are a Mayde, wherevppon I haue determined with my selfe, synce inwarde Fancye hath made mee setle my lyking, on your sweete selfe: to trye out the extremyties, and to leaue no submission vnsought for, or seruice vndone, vntyll I haue gayned the hope of my assuraunce, whiche vertuouslye, I wyshe to bee accomplyshed, by wedlock. But for that the verdite, must passe vnder your owne allowaunce, and the sentence of my good Fortune, dependeth on the iudgement of your aduysed lykynge: Giue mee leaue a little, to make way to my purpose, and to leuyll at your thoughtes, whereby a mutuall consent, by verball agreement may bee had. Two causes in Nature, haue endeuored my thoughts, to the liking of you: Fyrst, your vndoubted vertues, next your rare beautie: Your vertues, as time hath wrought them, are growne to their full rypnesse: your beautie, as Nature made it, is the Ensigne of honest and fauourable symplicitye. Now, where youth hath iudgement, how may it bee? that fyndinge you the onely Paragon of perfection in CIVILL , hee shoulde desist to honour you, and to make hys choyce amongst our vncyuell SPANISH Ladyes: whose outwarde deuotion is to Heauenlye: whose domesticall practises are to deuilysh: Now fayre Damsell, what deeme you? what dumpes are you growen into? hath not the Shafte of Cupid yet pearced your inuiolable Chastitie? are my perswasions of no effect? worke they no wonders? assuredlye for (my part) they purporte the discourse of an honest mynde, how so euer they be allowed off in your fantasie: This younge Nouice and fayre Clarinda , hauinge attentiulye harde the woordes of her young play felow Simonides , (lyke to the vnruly Heyfer not yet staled,) so her Maydenlyke demeanures not yet altered, gaue scope to sundrie imaginations, now driuing this way, now turning that way, to discouer the fyrme lande of the proposed discourse: and although she felte a little ticklyng heate make some motions of after allowance, yet beeinge of so much Maydenlyke perfection, as that she coulde alwayes folow the soule, yet sometime serue the fleshe, after some Rethoricall pause, with a certayne amorous (yet coy) countenaunce, she aunswered thus: Don Simonides it may not be, but that as nature hath alowed you exquisit proportion, so disdained she not, but that you shoulde bee partaker of some perfection: And though she hath made mee a weake vesell vnable to resist, yet hath she graunted all Womankinde an aduised will to refuse: for at our fyrst byrth we receiue impressions of good and bad, and as yeares increase, so our vertues and vices growe to the top, the one to the perfection of the mynde, the other to the destruction of the bodye: and though man be borne to attempte, yet Women were made to maintaine: and must you needes wed Simonides , when you speede, God giue you ioy: of truth there be fayre Dames in Ciuill , beautifull inough, but for our old acquaintaince, learne this of mee ioyne Beautie with honestie, the wrong I shall haue, I shall lose myne olde chaste play felowe, who vppon an earthly commaunde, is determyned to hazarde the Immortalytie of hys Soule. Ah Simonides, Simonides , would thy Father haue thee wed, and hast thou made thy choice of mee, O vniust Father, O vnequall choice: what wisdome hath thy Sire to make thee gouernour of many, that art yet insufficient to rule thy selfe, & to make thee a bye word to the worlde, where now thou art a spectacle of chast honour? what calamities (my olde friende) shouldest thou feele, when thy wealth should be impaired by ill seruaunts? thy memorie weried with many worldlye sorrowes? perhaps an vniust wife, amongst many Children some must bee infortunate: Now counting this (my Simonides ) what made you to choose mee, thinke you Fortune fauoureth mee to much? or is my chastitie an eye sore to our nominated Maides of Ciuill? you thought your former honest entercourse, would some what availe in this your later (yet iniuster) commaunded societie: no, no, the Fort is vnpregnable: chastitie wil preuaile, God gaue mee beautie, not to make mee vicious, but comlynesse to continue chast: wedlocke is honorable, but worldly, chastitie is deuine, yea, & more then that it is heauenly: what made (I pray you) our learned Progenitours to haue so often reuelations, visions, perfections, but onely chast lyfe and deuout prayer, whereby they were famous in their posteritie, and gayned a Crowne of immortalitie: I know my speeches are not seasoned to your lykinge, but in that they bee bitter, they be cordiall: Simonides , take this answer: Clarinda was borne chast, and wyll die chast, and if you please to vse her as an honest friend, desist from seeking to make her your wedded pheare: I had rather my Fathers name should ende in my chastitie, then the ofspring of my loynes should be the dishonour of our houshould: you see my nature my Simonides , I hope you wyll sue no more seeinge your repulse is so manifest: Clarinda wyll be your chast Sister to commaunde, you must seeke some other companion for your bed, she will rest a Uirgin. Simonides hauing heard the determined opinion of his Mistresse: and seing the Anker of his hope was bereft of the Cable of comfort, grewe into an extasie of mourning and lamentacion: and withdrawing himselfe from her presence to his owne chamber, in melancholy deuocion, entred this Discoure. Not without wisdome, the world is reported Sphearicall, in that it still turneth: and with iudgement, Fortune is said to be blinde, for that she is fleeting: our hopes are determined by yea and nay: our pleasures hange in the Balance of likyng: and when we thinke we haue the fastest footing, life is most subiect to declininge: we ymagyn euerye strange thinge a God: euery Idea of Folie, is become our Summum bonum : Our necessarie and naturall members, are displaced of their ordinarie courses: for beyng first created as the Mynisteres of the soule, now are they the disturbers of our Innocencie: Our Brayne, in stead of wise Preceptes, is cloyed with idle Imaginatios: our eyes, the deemers of our discretion, are made the blindenes of the insight of our soules: I had thought that no perswasions, could induce me to Follies, but now, I finde mine owne Imperfection. O vaine man that I am, what brainsicke Imagynation is that which should depresse my Immortalytie? Pardon me (my sweete Clarinda,) Simonides wyll bee no more passionate: but a sodain hot feuer ouerruleth my senses: I would refuse and can not: and am conquered by him that is not, so mine owne affections are mine owne destruction: I must loue, but whome? Clarinda hath refused me, for other choyce, I find hardly any worthy: yet there be many fayre Dames in Ciuill , but none so vertuous: many as riche, but fewe so relygyous. But she list not loue, and why? thou art not worthy her loue: O Nature, why was I made so deformed? O iniust tymes, that drawe lykyng without equalytie, and infortunate Planets, that bestow not your effecte accordynge to mediocritie: but one repulse is of modestie: no Forte wyll yelde withoute encounter: thy Speeches are Adamantine, they wyll drawe Yron: vayne wordes, vaine hopes, vayne loue: Vanitas vanitatum: Simonides leaue these affections, thou hast a resolute answere, die (wretche) if thou canst not liue honest. Usinge thease, and suche like Speaches, the Nouice grewe sickly aud became weake: his orient rednes, forsooke his cheekes, and weakenes burnished his face with wanne paalenes, whiche beynge spied by his friendes, whose eyes are euer watchful ouer their children: Phisitions were sent for, who though they mynistred drugs, yet lessened no dollor: the Parentes became sorrowful, the Sonne too amorous. Calides , vnderstanding the misfortune of his Neighbour Lawmenio , accompanied with his Daughter Clarinda , came to visit the carefull Father and his crased Sonne: at whose comminge, the louing SIMONIDES , recoueringe some parcell of his former perfection, by the view of his secret misteris, called for his Lute, and being serued with an amorous muse, somthinge to the Fathers comfort, and to the ease of his owne minde, in mournefull wise, he recorded this Dittie. Who dying liue, yet neither liue nor dye: What fickle Fates, and froward destinie, Compels mee hope, and haue no reason why, O CVPID, draw thy Arrow to the head, To ease his harmes, which liues for to be dead. ¶ My reasons raine, doth draw affection in But Beauties blaze, doth Fancy set on fyre: Whilst Wit, my Will, to maister dooth begin, I thinke no looke, can force mee to desyre: Yet when this surge, of sight doth beat my barke: I blyndfoulde shoote, at randon at the mark. ¶ I trust to mutch, and yeelde to euery blast, Now hope dooth fill the compas of my sayle, Now deepe dispaire, the Skie doth ouercast: And dimmes the Sunne, which serues for my availe: Both Sea and Sunne, both land and loue are bent, Vpon poore I, their torments to frequent. ¶ Care keepes the Forte, that comfort should posses, The key of trust, by treason is retaind, And gladsome hope, which wunted was to blesse: My sorowing soule, by cursed craft is painde: O werie lyfe, nay liuing death to mee, Who hopes for that, which is and will not bee. ¶ By day my teares, accompanies my thought, By night, a smilyng trust doth make mee glad, Yet want I that, for which I long haue sought: For why? report sayes it cannot be had: Wherefore thou God, that swaies the fyrie boe, Dispatch my lyfe, for to displace my woe. ¶ O sacred Cell, and shady desert groue, The onely Cabin, for a carefull mynde, Would God these lymmes, were ready for to roue: A silent seate, and Caben out to fynde: Where wrung with woe, to PAN I might complaine The hard distresse, that doth my body paine. ¶ That whylst in dolefull, tunes I dyd recorde, The harde repulse, that Lady beautie gaue, The water Nimphes, with all their sweete accorde: In mydst of mone, might singe mee to my graue: And leaue this last report, for men to reade. He liu'de in loue not lou'd, and now is dead. The later lines were chaunted with so mornefull melodie, as the hearers were inforced to shed aboudance of teares, both to heare the learned discourse of the louer, and to see the passionate, deliuerie of the dittie, onely Clarinda who had giuen atentiue eare to the noate, and memoriter , coulde sette downe the matter, began to descant of his plaine song in this sort. Although (good Brother Simonides ) I amongst so many, am least able to counsell you: yet by reason of the amytie of our Parentes, and the famyliaritie, that hath passed betweene vs: I wyll be so boulde, to yeelde you my simple aduise, which though it fyt not your body yet I doubt not, but it shall profyt your mynde: I muse what sodaine motion hath made you Melancholy, who naturally, both by your Fathers complection, and the constitution of your body, are pure sanguine. If humors worke your displeasure, an Apothycaries drugge wyll mende all: But if (as I am most perswaded) your affections mynister the matter of your maladie, reason must be the corsiue, to eate out the corruption which hath infected you. Assuredly my pacient, (which words she vttered with a smyling regarde) the greatest conquerours were they, that coulde conquere themselues: and honour is soonest minystred to them, which can maister their owne affections: You must cast off these vnacquainted sorrowes, which as they are the slaues of imperfections, so they bee the disparadgement of an honorable minde: I haue alwaies, since my Childehood continued this good opinyon of you, that youth may worke in you a while, but discretion wyll master your will at laste. Good Simonides , haue care of your Father, respect his yeares: beholde my Parentes equally intercepted, with the like maladye: and for theyr sakes and myne, your louing Sister let not vaine hope cary you away, for causes that be contemptible: neither sorrow much, for that slyding ioy, which is alwaies transitorye: and if it bee my fortune, to woorke your amendement by my counsell, I doubt not but hereafter your opinyon wyll be setled, and your experience shall serue to supply my necessaries. The discourse of this Damsell being ended, eche in presence, alowed her perswasion, onely Simonides , who coulde best coniecture of hir determination, with meeke voyce, (raysing hymselfe on his Pyllow) gaue her this replye. They do vnaptly determine of sicknes (my good mystres) that haue not ben subiect to diseases, for in all purposes (that I can remember) it is not possible by reason to redresse that which no medycine (touching the externall man) is able to mollifie, only in some outward dystemperature we finde this allay, that time shall eate out that, which treakle cannot, for some enueterat euils in the face, may be remoued with medicyne, but a sorrowe being grafted in the harte, will hardly byde the grapell of persuasion: for my sycknes truely, it is a harte sore: the salue of which, since it is remoued from my hope, by froward displeasure, I deeme it were more fitter for me (pasionat as I am) to die, then ouerburdened with weaknes and swalowed vp with sycknes, my life should proue to me a liuing death: wherevpon I most humbly requeste my parents pacience, lest their teares shed in my sight, be a greater increase of my sorrowe, for as theyr greefs cannot recall the day that is past, so theyr calamities cannot refresh me from my languishing passions: And for you my Clarinda , I yelde you harty thanks, who haue wisht that in me, that is in your selfe, a contented minde: but for my parte, I would before my death, that Fortune would alot me, to see an other happy in yt, wherein I am most vnfortunate, and then I deeme, fayre Mistres, you will conceiue, that your poore friend, was borne to beare the burthen, & an other to inioye the benefit: and for olde famyliarityes sake, report that he that felt the refusall, was as worthy (for his constancy) to inioye, as he that posseseth the castill of my comfort, deserued (for his valoure) to possesse. These latter wordes were vttered, as thoughe they had passed from a Prophet of Trophonius . The Parentes, seeynge the Furie of the Sickenesse of theyr Sonne to increase, and that their gentell and louing perswasions, rather wrought hys malancoly, then brought him medycine, withdrew themselues: commendyng their sikly Sonne to the mercie of Asculapius : after whose departure thence, Simonides bethought himselfe of secret flight, being of opynion, that the chaunge of soyle, and protration of time, would weare out the remebraunce of his conceiued sorrow, and the rather, that his deedes, might aunswer his determynation: he inuested hymselfe into the order of traueyling Pilgrimes, to the perfourmance of which, hee made hym an new habit, and being apareled with it, & storde with sufficient to affray hys charges, hee secretlye (to his Parentes sorrowe.) by nyght betooke himselfe to his vowed Pilgrymage: and posting to avoyde the outscouts of his Father, hee lefte Castile to his Clarinda , and by Iournies attained the citie of Caragoza : in which (being moued by the serenitie of the ayre, and the seemelye scituation of the place, with the stately buildynges, and riche monumentes) hee made his abode ten dayes: from thence trauylinge to recouer Barcelona , the sooner to imbarke for Italy , in midwaye, it was his fortune (being in meditation of his old loue, and sweetest Clarinda ,) to passe thorugh a fayre Feelde, the sytuation of which, it seemed Nature had so setled, as a rauished minde, in a distempered body, would haue thought it a second Elisiu , in which Flora had abundantly bestowed her foysans: the Ualyes delectable, seemynge to bee the receptable of the Nimphes, the murmuring brooks, with grassy banks, a seemly Palace for the Driades , the launes leueled by arte, vnles a certaine Hillock: which Nature had left for a seate for Faunus : no want of wood for Satires : yet for all this, but a place of meditation for a Pylgrime, for in the toppe of a Hyll raysde in the mydest of that Medowe, there appeared to our louynge Simonides sight, a simple Hermytes House, and olde decayed Chapell, to the which hauyng attayned, hee entered, takinge hymselfe to his deuotion, where beyng in the meditation of our Lord, for a farewel, forgot not the salutation of our Ladie: that done, entrynge into the Oratorie, fownde an aged man of sage countinance, to whome so soone as he had done reuerence, and receiued the lyke curtesie, with a vsuall benediction, he vsed this speache. Although (reuerent Father) it is a part of smal seemelinesse to desire to know a Strangers secretes: yet, for that I see, you carie the Hayres of Experience, and your yeares, betoken staiednesse, and my selfe haue neede of counsell, I beseeche you recount me the cause of your abode here, the Discourse of your trouble, and the intent of your solitarynesse? The olde Father hearyng the request of the Gentelman, and delightyng in his youthe, seasoned with perfection, friendly answered him thus. Twentie winters are gone and past, since time and Fortune allotted mee this Hermitage, the cause of my aboade here, since I see it is a meane to worke you some delightes (good sir) thoe to mine owne sorow) I wyll satisfie your request, but that the serenitie of the aire, may somwhat mytigate the meditation of my mishap, I pray you take the payne, to resorte with me to my Siedge of contemplation, (whiche place was a promontorie of an exquisite prospect, both to behold ye Champyon countrey, and also the Cities scituate neere aboute:) where beynge setled, Simonides yeldynge the place his due deserued praise, he requested the Hermite to performe his promise to which, he wyllingly assented, and recounted his calamytie in this sorte. You haue requested me (my sonne) to ryp vp the lamentable Discourse of my fortune, and to recorde those calamyties, the verie thoughts of whiche, makes me renewe myne olde passion: Knowe you (good sir) that my name is Aristo , of the citie of Caragoza , of good Parentage, the onely heire of my father, & the hope of his kynsfolkes: my youth was so fortunat (for a while) as I was of opinion, that pleasure was pertinent, & that hapinesse had vowed to make his home in my harte, but ye blinded mistris shot at an other mark, dispoyling mee of my pleasure, bereauing mee of my rest, and drowning mee in the daungerous flood of myne owne fancies, making mee an Ensigne bearer to Cupid , with whom when I had serued long, according to place of desert, I enioyed my rewarde, which I so dearely esteemed, as by it my fyrste frame of blessednesse was buylded on, in the desolation of which, my felycytie was frustrated: I inioyed a paragon, who equallye imparted her perfections to mee, and with such good nature, requited my loyaltie, as I with admyration was rauysted in her beautie, wee both being of selfe same opynion, and chast desyre, to the ende, that the burning flame, that had entered the habytacle of our reason, might bee alayed for a time, and not extinguished for euer, (by our Fathers consent) betooke our selues to wedlocke, thinkynge it a most happy lyfe, where Hymeneus is most conuersant: and hauing, to our great solace, (with mutuall consent) inioyed our purposed delight, the space of eight monethes, iniust nature, vnequall tyme, cruell death, and frowning Heauens, berefte mee of my delyght, tamed my Fancie, and with the surge of sowre Fortune, drowned the continuaunce of my good hope: in stead of pleasure, heauynesse mynistred mee mone, & care incombered my decaying lyfe: sorrow and desolation tamed my heart, and comfort was expulsed, by conceiued dispayre. O Sonne, see the chaunge of time, a man now happy, straight helplesse, now compassed with Friendes, now ouerrunne with foes, this day riche, that day poore, at morne a Prince, by night a Pesaunt. Our worldly honour hangeth in a britle ballance, and our estimatio runneth as the capacitie of the common people serueth: somtimes Caesar renowned in the Senate, accompted a pater patrie , inuested with Princely Offices, oftentimes pretor , no small time Emperour, beloued of Brutus , saluted by Cicero : now Caesar a tyrant, slaine in the Senate, hostis patrie , bereft of his Diadem, no pretor but predator : fro an Emperour to a dead carkasse, gorde with his his fryndes owne knife: Unkynde Brutus exclaymed on by the declaymyng Cicero , O time, O maners. I see my Sonne that thou art younge, and therefore vse the lenger discourse, by my mishaps, to arme thee against misfortune, my Wiues death made mee know the Worlde: and loue learnte mee the inconstancye of my lyfe: at the fyrst income of my sorrow, youth taught mee to trye all extremyties, to decide the strife betweene sorrow and lyfe, to cut of the malady, by bereauing my selfe of breath: My Genius taught mee, that the Crosse was layde on mee for to make mee know my selfe: to counte of earthly thinges, as transytory, whereby I might fixe my imagination more faster, on matters more parmanent: In these imaginations, and assaultes of fleshe and spyrit, I lyued no small whyle, tyll God bereft mee of my Father, and left mee to the possession of his lande: I being styll passionate of my former loue, and being lynkte in, with accustomed solytarie contemplation, departed my goodes in two seuerall portions, the one I bestowed on my progenie, the other I imparted to the poore, and a litle I reserued to the buylding of this poore Hermytage, and simple Cotage, where, for the residue of my lyfe, I haue indeuoured my selfe to contemplation, where I am growne to so setled a perfection, that the lyfe, lyuing, and worldly felycitie, that before dyd befall mee, seemes now (in my imagynation) but the increase of sorow, and maintayner of cares: who hath nothing left, is least sorye: my simple foode contents my mynd, since it is without feare: for Kinges daintie dishes (I haue heard) they be alwaies sawced with suspition: the couetous careth to increase his too much: I delight in my mediocrytie, and thinkes my deuotion to litle: In the Citie great store of Sichophantes folow landed men: in the Feelde, I am accounted off, amongst the creatures of Nature, who, as God hath appoynted them, mynister vnto my necessitie, and yet continue theyr wunted seemlynesse: My Sonne, my Son, I thought a strickt life foolish in my youth, but now I fynde it necessarie both for youth and age: Lo heere the Catastrophi of my discourse: if it profyt thee, I haue my wyshe, if it be as well conceiued of thee, as it was ment by mee, the world should deceiue thee litle, and I shall reioyce in thee much. Simonides hauing hearde, the lardge and lamentable discourse, of the deuoute Father: yeeldinge him humble thanks for the same: gaue praise to the immortall gods, that it had pleased them, in more medyocritie to minyster to him, considering with himselfe, that in comparing of Aristo , his mishappes with his: his calamytie might seeme happynesse, and the rather that he was passionate, for her who was yet lyuinge, and the Hermyte distressed, for her that was departed: and for that by the precedent Discourse, hee perceiued that Aristo was his neare kinsman, wherefore hee thought best not to discouer himselfe, for feare his pretensed Pilgrimage should be hindred, but yeelding deserued thankes to the olde father, he entered into his Cabin wt him, where he founde wrytten in a faire table, these verses following, and as it is to be supposed Aristo his owne inuention. What hateful hap hath made a brech? between my life & mee. Why is my trust & sweetest hope? of after pleasant life, By Cruell CLOTHO cut in twaine, by reuing of my Wife. O brittell lyfe, why flites thou so? o ioyes the fruites of chaunge: Why was MARCELLA mee bereft? by vncouth Fortune straunge. Why was the beauties blase so bright? that darkned Phebus light: Idimde by death, why fled hir ghost, which fed me with delight. Did faire ORION in the East? disdaine the glittering eyes, Of her whose lookes, while that she liu'd, did dim eche star in skies: Or faire Lucyna ielous Queene, lest Ioue should her espie. Dyd close her in the Center deepe, of heauie colde and drie. If thou art chaunged to a foule, faire IPHIS, let mee know: I will not straine with Orpheus, to fetch thee from below. But if the higher heauens innoy, thy sweete and sacred spright, As I coniecture it must bee, thou Sonne then of the night: Inioy thy part, and let my soule, haue leaue with hers to reste Which being body and a soule, did loue MARCELLA best. Then shal my sad and drowping daies, lead on in heauy mone When I inioy thy blessed ghost, be laide and left alone. But if that fates denay mee styll, as yet to ease my smart, Yee powers be recorde that MARCEL is Misterisse of my heart. Simonides , viewed these lines, with singular delight, and the rather for that partly, they were confyrmers of his owne conceiued fancye, wherevppon turning hymselfe to olde Aristo , he said: My most louing Father, I conceiue by these few lynes, the earnest & loyal faith, that was betweene you & your Marcoella , wherin I do not onely wonder, but also honour the coutinuance of the affections, which in yeares that are yet vnseasoned with constancie, can hardlye bee beeleeued to rest, but in this one thing, I must think you happie, that Fortune hauing bereft you of one sweete benyfyt, hath left you partaker of a blessed and fortunate continencie, whereby you haue both learned to increase your earthly affection, with a heauenlye contemplation, and to consider with equalytie, the necessity of your Marcellas departure: and the happynesse that they enioye, (which in that state that you are in) doo folow after. In the life you led before, your liuing, your Lady, your earthly pleasure, brought with feare and care, but now what comfort and happinesse is to be compared to yours? who inioy that, that the most fortunate and wise men, for the moste parte haue fayled of, to weete, a contented minde: whiche beyng the Badge of a reasonable soule, what naurall cause, shall be remooued from your conceipt: what hidden Phylosophie, vnknowen to your contemplation? And surely, I finde thus muche comfort, beyng a yonge man, and but vewing in one day your course of lyfe: that it were more better for a Prince to bee Irus for contentment, then to euioy the Regiment of the whole worlde: for whilst he seeth all pleasures he inioyeth none: and in midst of his sugred daintie suppeth vp sorrowes euerye day, tired with Suters, troubled with Damocles , euery night subiect to broken sleepes, ouerburthensome thoughtes, and vncouth Dreames: You good Father (of all worldlye pleasures) haue attayned Aristotles summum bonum : Hauing both the goods of the mynde, whiche is Science, Art, and Contemplation: the perfectnesse of the body, which is to haue a seemly personage, a comely feauture, a good visage: ye necessaries of fortune, which is erthly honor, riches, & such other ministers of heartbrekig, your state is honourable, in that you are a religious Hermyt: and for Ryches, you haue most, in that you desyre least: for rightly wealth is not to be measured, by the aboundaunce in superfluitie, but by the suffycencie in continencie: for exceasse breadeth woe, mediocrytie, weale: Wherfore, good Father, reioyce in your hapines, for I am releaued by thinking of your good Fortune, so that I wyll setle this for an Axioma , in my soule, that the solytarie lyfe is alwayes the best, since it is least worldly. Aristo , reioced much at the speaches of this olde yong man, and imbracing him, commeded his naturall affabylytie, aunswering him thus. My Sonne, I cannot yeelde too many, or sufficient thankes, to my most iust God, who hath berefte mee of my worldly trustes, slypper ioyes, fading pleasures, and transitorye delightes, to blesse mee with assured peace, continuaunce of health, no want of contynencie: and to conclude, with an inuincible minde: whereas (mee thinkes,) I could now maintaine open warre, against vniust Fortune, where as to fore, I alwaies folowed her with fyxed deuotion, now fickle trust leadeth mee no more: for my foundation is layde on assuraunce, my Fame dependeth not vppon euerie blast of report: neither seeke I affectat honour, and inioying so great pleasures as I doo, I am not determyned to chaunge them, since the chaunger (for the most parte) alwayes runnes to the worse, hardly to the better. The reasidue of my lyfe, as it is but short, so I determyne (as much as flesh wyll suffer) it shall be deuoute. But for that it is late, and draweth towardes supper time, if it shall please you to accept of a poore Hermytes prouision (simple as it is) for this night (and as long otherwise as you please) you shall not be so wylling to stay, as I wyll be glad of your companie. Simonides , accepted the offer, since it was so friendly, and after that hee had past ouer eight dayes, with the good olde Father, in sundrye discourses, deuises and occasions, takinge his leaue verie dutifullye of the deuout Aristo , with no small foysen of teares, shed by them both: vnderstandyng (by report) what a goodly citie Farara was, how honourable and iust a Prince was resident there: he directed his course thyther, and hauinge passed Pauia , and other places subiecte to that clymat: In midest of his trauell, he bethought him of his Clarinda , and the teares falling from his eyes, in remembraunce of his misfortune, hee communed in his iournying, to himselfe in this sorte. Ah SIMONIDES , how infortunate art thou, that in the prime of thy young yeares: thy fortune was to become besotted on her, which disdayneth thy sute: O vniust Clarinda , how cruell art thou whiche dispisest the humble seruice of thy equalles? must I be an exile in my yong dayes, and tread vnknowne pathes for vncertaine pleasure: should a womans vaine refusall, banysh hym Ciuill , whose returne would be no small ioye to his Parentes? This, this Simonides , shoulde haue bene thought on before: thy returne now would be thy discredit, and CLARINDA might well iest at her passionate young suter: Thou hast vndertaken trauyl, to what ende? to attaine loue: death may cut of her dayes, who thou seruest: yet experience wyll make thy crosse lesse cordial: vayne wretch, cast off these cautels, they be but the moates of a foolish disaster, they beare no signe of setled fydelytie: for to the attainemet of an Andromida , who would not venture with Perseus ? or for the goodwyll of a Uirgin, who would not bestryde Pegasus ? who woulde not be Leander for Hero ? or Theagines , to inioy a Cariclea : bare brutes they be, that measure not loue and honor together, synce none can be venturous, except hee be amorous: the mind cloyed with vncertaine studie, drawes on the daye in dumpes, frames new castles in new Spayne , to the spending of his body, and the contempt of aduised insyght. The louer (if he aduenture) hath this, an vnspotted Uyrgin for his guerdon, with whom hee may inioye (a more then) heauenly contemplation, and by whom, hee may receiue (a more then) pleasaunt possession, in whom the worlde shall be multiplyed with gallaunt myndes, and the venturer inioy an assured signe of victorie: what gayneth he with Pen in honour, that he with Launce leaues vnwoorthylye possessed in Feelde, to please hys Mysterisse. Well Simonides , leaue off thy sowre remembraunce of thy Parentes, synce by the present toyle, thou art to be infeofed, of a possession that is most delectable: and let thy crased mynde bee comforted, with an assured hope of royall rewarde: lose not a more then heauenly possession for a litle pleasaunt trauyll, to thine owne perfection. Thou hast thought thy Clarinda worthye thy loue, then think not scorne to please her by thy labour: perhaps at this very instant, she bethinkes her selfe of thy iourney, in thy constancie, and determyning, that thou onelye for thy fayth shalt be rewarded with her loue, let not her opynion be frustrated: Simonides , shee loueth thee, and leaue thou not to lyue for her. Discoursing thus with hymselfe, hee ascended a steepe and stately mountayne, from which, beholding the leuell on euerie side, it was his fortune to espie out, a most delightfull and pleasant plot of grounde, furnished with all exquisit proportion, and disposition of Arte, fenced with the Walles of Nature, two statelye Rockes, shadowed with the rayes of seemelye Ceaders, and beautyfyed with the Mantell of the delyghtfull Ladye FLORA , equalitie in this ELISIVM had disposed her perfections: the whole compas and circumference was so sphericall, as Euclide myght from thence deriue a proposition, nature made al thinges perfect, arte, pleasaunt: so that it might be thought, partlye for the solytarinesse of the soyle, and pleasantnesse of the place, that some affectionate Satire , being forsaken of his nymph, had prepared this seate, for his earthly purgatorie. Simonides rauished with the strangenesse of the sight, betooke hymselfe thither, imagining yt the outside being so delectable, the inside should be more then deuine: But alas, he founde it farre otherwise, for drawinge neere the place, hee saw a Cabin compassed with the bende of Trees, wherein hee had no sooner entered, but to his more sorrow and desolation, he founde a Graue couered with a Marbell Stone, on whiche (to his no small greefe,) hee sawe these lynes set downe, siphered in Bloud, as the Epytaph of the disceased. This wilde and sauadge soyle shalt tread: Kuow thou that heere in desert plot: Vnder this stone in turffe lyes dead, The wight who most deserued praise, Of any louer in his dayes. ¶ Thoe name and fame obscured be, By froward frowne of spightfull Fate: This place and death did both agree, To worke his ende, such cruell hate: Whose valew great, and troth dyd craue, To be intumbde in Princely graue. ¶ Let this suffice, for thee to know, His lyfe, two liues in one dyd gaine: Let this suffice his death did show, Of twyned hartes the parting payne: Let this suffice, no more to moue, He liued and died in loyall loue. My Pylgrime, hauing ouer read this lamentable recorde, wundringe at the straungenesse of the place, the misfortune of the deceased, the order of his burial, and the rection of his Tombe: desirous to haue further knowledge of the matter, began to bestiir himself, and to leaue no one corner vnsought, to the satisfiyng of his troubled, and distembred minde: but for all his narrowe searche, no creature was neere to recownt, or to disbourden him of his feare: onely the place seemed abandoned, and by fortune, onely left for hym to discourse his misfortune in: At last, passynge foorth with more setled intente to finde out, he espied an other seelie Cabyn, compact of Bowes, chamberwise: into the which, he hauing entred, he found in a secrete corner of this course and comfortlesse Cell, a Harpe hangynge on the Sprayes of a small Wyllowe, whiche, takyng to hym, (beynge altogether ouerpressed, with a feruente and Melancholye Imagynation, and sodanly incountred with solitary sadnesse, he said thus: Truely, Simonides , thou art happie, by arryual heere, the onely place, whiche the Goddes haue appoincted for thy penance, where shakyng off thy worldly conceiptes, thou mayst be partaker of thy Unckle Aristo his Contemplation: where (solytaryly) thou mayste season thy youth, whiche is yet cloyed with distempred humoures, and settle thy minde in beholding of the Heauens: wheretofore thou wast only accompanied with earthly delites, here maist thou inioy the peace that nature allotteth thee and ymagyn on the felicitie that wayteth on the soule: Clarinda , fare thou well, Ciuill Dames must seeke newe Husbandes, I leaue now to be lasciuious, and will betrothe my selfe to constancie. This said, takyng the Harpe in hande, and offeryng, a sacrifice of his teares at the Shrine of the God of the Desert, lyke the olde Swanne in the Ryuer of Tagus in mournefull melodie, he thus carefully complayned. O fickle fort, whence naught but sorow is, O idle hope, whose substaunce is vnsure, O heedlesse hap, thou leades my lyfe amisse: O fayned show, of most vncertaine blisse. I take my leaue, since Eares haue mee assignde, A secret Cell, where I may ease my minde, ¶ Farewell vaine loue, that made mee leaue my soyle, From Parentes seige, to seeke vncertaine rest: Cease fleeting feete, to folow further toyle, Since Heauens perswade, that setled seate is best, Wherein I finde, this comfort at the least: That brutish beastes, being moued with my mone, Will hardly leaue, SIMONIDES alone. ¶ Where fixing on the Starres, my steady sight, Whose royall rayes, doo ouerloke the land: I may no more, in worldly loue delight, Where wealth and woe, on yea and nay doth stande, Where health is graspt, within a Womans hand: Where small myslyke, doth master honest mynde, Where honour yeeldes, to wanton woman kinde, ¶ For loue in mee, hath made a Tragidie, But God and Fates, will make it Comycall: A heauenly thought is onely remedie, To reue the wrong, that ouer ruleth al: And thoe my power, for to resist be small: Yet graunt this Boone, O CVPID for my sake, For all my woes, some sweete amendes to make. ¶ Thou shady plot, a welcome seate to mee, Ye whistlyng windes, the masters of this soyle: Let these my lines, to her reported bee, Who first inforst, my feete to tast of toyle, By whom sith I am forced to turmoyle: I fynde this place, since pleasure fled and gone, The onely meane, for to alay my mone. Thus fynished my amorous Simonides , his sweete song, compassed throughly with dispayre, and incumbred with wofull remembraunce of his weried Pylgremages and oportunytie of offered solytarynes, hauyng his mind wholly his, yet he without his minde, perplexed sundrie and diuers wayes: now his fancie ymagynynge on the beautie of his Mistresse, now his Melancholy misdeeming of her constancie, now delighted with his Cell, now dismayde for want of company: In middest of whose extremities, it happened the wofull Mystres of the mournfull Mansion to drawe neere, a Lady of surpassing beautye, in which Venus had sworne she would manifest a myrour of constancy, her yeares in the pryme, as the Orient Sunne in the enterance of his, morrowe glorye, her proportion of so exquisit perfection, as neither in the depth of the Center, where restes the Driades and gratious Pharies , ne in the circumferrence, where, Cupid makes his greatest muster, her equal may be founde. Her face lyke the fayre Phebe in her prime, and more perfecter; for why, Nature ingrafted a Uermylyon die, by natiue blood, which by succession, so filled the Cundytes of her vaynes, as euerie light motion of Zephirus , or passion of her mynde, made a reflection, lyke to the ruddy glowing of the messenger of the SVNNE , her eyes lyke to GEMINI , that accompaneth Iupiter , sendeth a resplendece, as though some gratious Nimphe, hauing tasted of the cuppe of the Gods in approued glorye, had vouchsafed to manifest it on yearth, a lyttle christall teare bedewed her currall cheeke, in remembraunce of some misfortune, not vnlike the sweete morning dew, that deliuereth from the sprouting branches, a declining moysture: her Iuorye necke, not vnlyke the coulour of Bachus cheeke, when he beareth the best blast, which increaseth the coulour of his growyng Grape, but for the two round compasses, whose equall reuerberation gaue to euerye motion an essence, not farre vnlyke two flaming yet pale fyrye ministers, which wayte on theyr Mystres the Moone . It may not be deemed that Nature, coulde haue framed them, except in scorne of her selfe: For the other proportion (for the lower we discend, the more admiration wyll moue vs) though diuers woulde describe them, yet I content my selfe with the imagynation, seeing the center of the Instrumentes, from whence all these exquysit tunes fettes their essence. A seconde Cup for Ganimede , nay rather a sporting place for Iubiter . And had her apparell bene aunswerable to her forme, shee might rather haue bene compted a Diana in chase, then an amorous handmayde of Venus : Her Cote of Skinnes, an vnfit furniture, for so fayre a feauture, her backe burthened with a torne Quyuer full of Shaftes, lyke a braue Lady Huntresse: in her left hande a Bow, and in her right hande a young Prycket, of her owne kylling, and for her owne dyet: Who hauing harde the whole discourse of the sorrow that Simonides had made, and with aduised Iudgement, considered of his shape and youthly substaunce, rather seeminge to her to bee some amourous Appollo , then affectionate louer, was greatly abasshed, thinking that ye God, pytying hir misfortune, and hauing lost his Cassandria , and traunsformed his Daphne , would bestow some parte of his medcynable humour on her. But Simonides , hauing now resolued with himselfe, to make heere his habitacle, determined with himselfr, to seeke out if he might fynd some spring of water conuenyent to serue his necessaries, whereby she perceiued him to be mortal, being wel perswaded that the Gods are not subiect to earthly necessities: although they vouchsafe some amorus delightes, which indeede are demy heauenly. And now, laying downe her new killed Supper, to the end, to heare of his further discourse, she drew neere: at which time Simonides , complayned thus. Fortune, I may curse thee worthely, which hast from my yeares of discretion, besotted mee, euen with a surmysed ioy, when in truth, the euent was most vnfortunate: Thou hast sauced my sweete, with to much sowre: thou hast made mee taste of the cuppe of errour, and so crossed my ymaginatiue powers, that euerye light shewe of Beautie, hath by succession of Appetite, placed a seconde felycitie: thou hast made mee the seruant of the worlde, and captiuated my Sences too simple, yet subtle likinge: thou haste made me subiect vnto flesh, and to wonder at the bristle substance, whiche is femynine, that in procreation, for natural operation, it is far dissident from masculine: thou hast inforced mine eyes to serue for snares to mine owne distemperature, and my reason to yelde to vnbridled wyll, the rather to make me amorous. Thou hath made me forsake ye coutrey I was born in, to greeue my aged Parents, to leaue my Ladye and Mistres Clarinda , whome (were not Cupide the Lord of my memorye) I had forgotten, committing thereby more then sacryledge, in respect of the Deitie of Venus : many cuntreys thou hast made me trauell throughe, I haue visyted Cyties, saluted Pylgrimes, and nowe lyke an vniust Lady, thou hast setled me in the assured seege of my contemplateon: where since I am resident, Clarinda , thou shalt not want my prayers, so that euerye wynde that bloweth, shal bring the benefit of my salutations to your presence, and to the allaying of my malady, these hollow rockes shall resound the Ecco of my exclamation, & in my heauines, this shal be reserued for the, that it wold please the Gods, to graut Clarinda to be still fayre, neuer aged, and Simonides to loue assuredly, & to continue constant. The amorous Lady, hauing hitherto considered of this Hermits exquisit melody, & eloquet discourse, being perswaded of ye humanity of her supposed Apollo , as Simonides was parting out of ye Cabin, at ye very doore she incoutred him, where being both equaly rauished, ech at others beauty, he imagining her, some Diana , or at the leastwise some vowed Nimph, she esteeming him some second Ganimed for beauty, hauing both paused a while in admiration ech of other, & some thing eased of their careful imagination, the Lady discoursed with the Pylgrime thus. Tell me (my good friende) by the Deitie of the immortall Goddes, and the powers of our sacred and solitarye desert, what strange hap or hard misfortune, hath brought you into this place, where (onely) a poore perplexed Lady, accompanied onely with the Fowles and Beasts of this Deserte, haue liued (in mine owne conceipt) vnwillynge that the world shuld see, that which now by strange Fortune, hath ben laide open to your vewe: surely, I am thus much setled in opinion, that it may not be ymagined, that your mortal faate coulde haue directed you to this place, vnlesse some secrete Mercurie , sent from the pytyfull Powers haue brought you hether, to singe a Counter verse, in my vncomfortlesse and tragicall Orysons: wherfore, (good sir) to satisfie a poore passionat Ladies minde, let me vnderstand the cause of your trauaile, with your fortune, that therby I may gather what foundation Fortune hath laide, in multiplying my three yeares sorowes. Simonides , hauing hard the milde motion of this amorous and solitarie Nimph, the Maiestie of her Personage and the Iustice of her demaunde, gaue her this answere. O noble Ladye (for youre honourable behauyoure, indoubtedlye perswadeth mee of youre tytle) so it is, my poore selfe am a swoorne seruaunte to beautye, whyche determynynge to trye my constancye, hath assygned mee to thys habyte, whereby I myght by seeynge much, and incounterynge wyth those, whyche were swoorne Souldyours vnder that ensygne bearer, be more seruiceable, and contynewe more constante: I haue (synce I forsooke my countreye) visyted manye, whose manners I haue marked, whose Maydens I haue vewed, yet am I so setled, as neyther the strangenes of the one, nor the beautye of the other, can force mee to be forgetfull of her, whoe is the Mystresse of my ymagynations, I haue contynewed my Iorneyes throughe manye dessolate Forrestes, and beynge in a contemplatyon of my Mystresse beautye, God and Fortune brought me at lengethe into this place, the scytuation of whych, drowned me in Melancholye contemplation, and the rather, for that hauynge entred into this Cabinet, I had a vewe of this graue, and read this Epitaphe, the vnderstanding of which, I sought about to finde out some one, which might infourme me of the hole cause, & certify me of ye man whom these verses makes mention of: & hauiug sought long & found none, to disburden me of my supposed sorrow, I bethought my selfe that the heauens, had apoynted this place as the only allay to my greefs, wherevpon, I finding your Harp, (for I know not what opinion makes me so deeme) I recorded with my selfe my hole aduenture in an amorous sonet, determining, by the dyrection of Fortune, to contynue in my allotted Cell. I haue recounted nowe (fayre Mistresse) my whole trauayle, my cause of trouble, the order of my hether commynge: whiche no doubt (fayre Ladie) was to your comforte, I hope, for me (vndoubtedly) it is the first fruictes of my delectation. The, fayre Ladie, hauyng conceyued of the friendly & effectuall Discourse of the yonge Gentleman, not without cause (from her delightfull eyes,) distylled (at large) Amber teares, in remembraunce of the olde and accustomed crueltie of inconstant Fortune: whervpon, in most humble and curteous wise, she thus replyed. Good Syr, synce Aduenture hath broughte you hyther to visite the place of my Purgatorie, a poore desolate Ladie, I can not ymagyn whyther by the course of my desertes, whyther by the iuste Iudgemente of the Goddes: but that you are sente hyther, rather to confirme the Catastrophe of my trouble, then for the continuaunce of my distresse: the remembraunce of whiche, makes mee sheadde teares and yf you were priuie to the passion, you would lykewise be pensiue: for the straungenesse of it would worke your delight, and (perhappes) the euentes in it are medycynable to your humour, whom I find (as farre as my coniecture, and your Reporte directes me) equallie passionate: yet no greatter extremytie, the Faates haue assigned mee, for they haue departed my soule and body, leauyng mee but a breathing spryght, to continue my decaying lyfe: so that (my Gentleman) you may comfort your selfe in this, that you are most safelye garded, synce the mysteris of your thoughtes, hath the possessyon of youre harte, whyche hardly wyll suffer that myscarye, whereby shee lyueth. But for that I am indoubtedly perswaded, that you are of good parentage, for that your vertues be many, yf (therefore) vpon the honour of your gentilhoode, and the chast vow that you haue made to your modest Misteris, you wyll promise mee, not to bewray my place of abode, neither open the secretes, I shall reueale vnto you, vntill suche tyme as report shall assertayne you of my death, I wyll (thoe to my no small sorrow) aunswere your expectation, and rippe vp, the ruthfull recorde of my painefull pilgrimage, signyfying vnto you (both) what I am, whye I abide here, and what fortune brought me hether. Simonides , vnderstanding the determination of the solitarie Nymphe, solemnely swore to the performaunce of the couenauntes, assuring, that death shoulde sooner reue hym of his breath, then vylanously wold breath foorth, that which should be forbidden him by beautie: whiche shee perceiuyng, withdrawing her selfe, with him to a pleasaunt fountaine (not farre distaunt from the graue) furnished with cristaline water, and paued with peble, hauynge placed the Pylgrime by her selfe, with statelye countenaunce, and sober seemlynesse, yet seasoned with a continuall aspect of continuinge sadnesse, she declared the dolefull Discourse of her conceiued sorrow, in this sorte. When beautie (renownied Gentilman) had first bestowed her colour in my yong and tender face, and years of discretion had led my thoughtes to esteeme and lyke of loue, & Nature had geuen me a iudiciall insight to deeme of the condytion of men, and perfection which abydeth in them: when in stately court I aboad a paragon, amongst our Italian Dames, I was by the famous and vertuous Duke of Ferara (whose neere Neece I am) hyghlye esteemed, and woorthylye accounted of, both for the exquisitnes of my proportion, and other towardly impressions of seemlines, which began to make show, & promise, some after rare vertue to take effect in me, through out his court, amongst the courteous noble men, accompted and called by the name of the fayr Lady Porcia , now imagyne you my youth inamorous, if hauing according wealth to my beauty, I either wanted suters to inioye the fruition of my chastitie, or friendes to increase my credit or seeke my preferment: surely I was sought too by gallant Gallerio Duke of Millayne , yet I knowe not what vayne fury distempered my affections, or ouerruled my friends, for the match was vndone, the man was aged: next him a yong noble man gaue the assault, whose personage, had it ben answerable to his youth and birth, he might happily haue sped: if you would his name, it was Antidono , mine vncles sonne: after him courteous Calistro Duke of Mantua , who thought no scorne of repulse, since other of aunswerable renowne and wealth, were subiect to the refusall. These presages of good Fortune, loue alotted me at the first, but the sequell of the assurednes was soure, and Ramnusia , mynding to showe her nature, wrought her pestelent purpose thus: she somoned Fancye her boundslaue, to fabricate a conceiued lyking in my tender hart, and to setle my opyniatiue affection, on a gallant gentleman, of Spayne , borne in the renowned Cyttie of Caragoza , called Hernando Miletti , honourably esteemed of by myne vncle, whose exquisyte and rare vertues, whose singuler and worthy qualities, whose famyliarity, fidelity, & constant loyalty, whose perfect and polyshed personage, if I were able to manyfest vnto you, you could not but ymagyne, that some angry Pandora had opened her Boxe castyng out a fume of perfection more the natural, to sommon my sences to the seruice of Cupid . O my Gentleman, you may not conceiue wt how great hartbreake, I growe in remembraunce of him, for whose sake, as I haue suffered this small torment, so to encrease the Maiestie of his Deified soule, I could vouchsafe to hasarde ten thousand deathes: but let this suffise, that in the Courte of Ferara , he fancied me, and esteemed rather my health and welfare, then the continuance and happie successe of his owne lyfe: so that his honest and assured affection, made me so setled in vnfayned likyng, as I thought my selfe moste happy, when I was in his company, and he deemed hymsefe moste infortunate, when he fayled of mine: so that mutuall amytie so muche wrought in vs as we would needes to weddyng, the rather to enioy chaste beddyng, which was as quickly perfourmed, as the furie of our fancie encreased: And Fortune, at the first vewe, smiled so fayre, that I alwayes was in doubt, she would frowne at last: O how many sweete delights, how many pleasaunt, yet secrete pastymes, how many harde Aduentures, how many Royall rewardes (seemely Gentleman) ye imagination yt now holdeth me) were it not allaid with the remembraunce of a succeding euyll) would mollyfiie somewhat the extreamytie of my passion: But Oh vnluckie Saturne , why doest thou sende thy Messenger Sorowe, to displace our felicitie, and to make vs vnfortunate: wherfore diddest thou punish vs for that which was passyble in the Goddes? thy nature was earthly, no meruayle then, thoughe thou disparagest that whiche is more then heauenly: O Sir, thus it befell vs, and geue eare to the Thesis of our moste miserable thraldome, the Reporte of our loue (vnluckely) came to the eares of my Unkell, who vnderstandynge the Practise of my Hernando , and the secreate solempnised Mariage, with oure settled intente of departure into Spayne , he determyned a Reuenge, whiche beynge brought to myne eares (for where loue is, there resteth an amorous suspition of the beloueds welfare,) I certified my Hernando Milleti , who vncertayne what waye was to be taken, to auoyde the fury of his princes dyspleasure, and yet loth to leaue me the only staye of his good fortune, he secretly practised with me for present flight, the which I willingly performed, so that by the break of day the next morow, through our dyligence indeuour, my Compere and I had left Farara , for we let not the night passe, for feare to be intercepted the next day, & fortune our good & bad Mistres so happily directed vs, that secretly with our owne safety, we ariued at this place, distant from mine vncles palace eyght leagues, which as you see now, was onely peopled with wilde beastes, & to which, none before vs that was resoable, neither any after vs (as our fancy & opinion serued vs) was like to resort: we hauing attayned this hard harber, by my husbands aduice, who was alwayes careful of my safecundit, (for that all the passages were stopped, and this only place was left vs by the Gods, to fynish ye residue of our loyal life) pitched our pauilion here, comforting me in this sort: my fayr wedded Porcia , thou must nowe vowe thy selfe from thy courtly sylkes, to a sauage coote, & sith Fortune hath bewitched vs in greatest extreamity, let this be thy comfort as it is mine, to rest contented with this Cabin, where in dispyght of sorrow, we wil solace our selues with mutual delight, & bury our former proud & stately ports, in the closet of a contented mind: for our food let me alone, only comfort thou thy selfe, Arte & Nature makes instrumets: these words vttered by my sweet hart, were so pleasant to my conceyued mistrust, that afterward in this desert, I thought me more happy, in inioying my Hernandos companye, then whe in statly court, I was huted after by me of no small name: & accordingly as my deare hart apoynted it, he & I haue to our power, yet pleasaunt contentation continued heare, where with this bowe of his owne making, and these shafts of his deuising, we haue furnyshed our selues of food, & haue prepared an allay for our necessities, myring the fruit of the feeld, with our delicat venison, & comforting vs with this water that you see in this foutayne: Loe gentle Hermite, the equalytie in loue, which subdueth our disordered affections, to an assertayned mediocrite, and humbleth our Imagynations, to esteeme poore estate more pleasant, then stately houses & proude buylded places: surely, I foud in my chiefest sorowes, so great solace, by feedyng my fancie in the vew of my husbande, as while he was in my presence: I ymagyned my selfe partaker, of most assured pleasure: but beynge absent, I bethought my selfe of my olde estate, and the glory of the Ferarian Court, so that I fownde my selfe most comforted in his presence, and displeased with his absence. This lyfe we led while three yeares were expyred, at the ende of whiche, the Faates , beyng bent to frowne, facioned them selues to bereaue me of my rest: for a certayne day my courteous Hernando , siting betweene my armes and recounting how soroweful he was for mee, that for his sake, I had abandoned so braue a court, and lost so great good Fortune, and inioyed so simple a cotage and cold comfortlesse repast, in mydest of his contemplation and secret sorrow for his poore Porcia , myne owne selfe, he fell in a sound, and the tyme beyng appoynted, in which the destinies had appoynted Clotho the cuting of the twine which maintayned the continuaunce of hys lyfe, to the discontinuance of my poore heart, hys sweete soull forsooke his proportionate body, and the ayre inioyed the delycate breth, which was the nurrisher of my accustomed pleasure, which to my great sorrow, layd open to my vewe, I was (lyke the poore turtle disposed of hys mate) driuen into an extasy, my senses bereft me, and lyke a she beare, bereft of her whelpes my extreeme passion made me exclayme on the heauens, whose vniustice had extremynated fro me my hope, the possession of good hap, and had departed that soule from out my company, which was the only comfort of my solitarynes, I cursed the Destenies, who vouchsafed vs loue, and berefte vs pleasure, by cuttyng off Hernando Miletties dayes, and hauyng only this cold comfort to inioy, to weete, his brebreathlesse body, I bathed it in my teares, bestowyng a thousande kysses on his dead Carcase, in whose liuyngs delights, I fed my only delectation: & had not the Goddes appoincted me to more great Purgatorie, I had parted my soule from my bodye, to the ende to adioyne it to the deceased soule of my louyng husbande, but for that I perceiued the necessytie and vrgent importance, to the Funerall of my friende called me to my self to forsake bootelesse playnt, and betake my selfe to the makynge of his graue, which I so featly framed, as in short space it was finished and made ready, where, with myne owne hands I buried my husbande, and coueryng him with this Marble (as you see) with myne owne bloud wrote this Epytaphe vpon Hernandos Graue: Since whiche grieuous tyme, I haue remayned here thease seuen yeares, furnishyng my selfe with foode of myne owne kyllynge, and vsing these tooles for mine owne defence, against the inuasion of wilde Beastes: and euery daye, as my carefull custome is, at sonne rysing and sonne settyng, I delyuer my deuotions at the graue of my deceased Hernando , solemnely singyng my sorrowfull Hymnes to hym, & perfityng the mournefull Melody with suche homely Musick as vse hath allowed me, on the very same Instrument on which you lately so deliuerly executed the office of Apollo , with most solempne sute, laying open to the Goddes the loathsom misfortune that is infraunchised in me and the bitter medicine I haue to purge from me the agony of myne euyll, exclaymyng on death, that hath not onely bereft me of my faythfull friende, but also disdayned me the fruition of his Ghoste, by makyng a partition betwixt my soule and body. Loe heare (good sir) the Discouerie of my most vnfortunate state: Loe here, the Myrroure of misfortune: See how all estates are equally gouerned by this aspyrynge passion, which now hath planted his Pallace in my hart and subdued the raine of Reason: my Nobylytie preuayled me nought, my flockes of friends could not fence me sufficientlye agaynst that shot of vniust Cupid : I and my friende are myrrors of noble myndes, to looke into, and to admonishe them, that preuention and aduysment must be had before attempt: for as loue in mercy graunteth equall lykinge to his true seruauntes, so vnkynde Fortune with iniurious operation, rayseth vp, eyther enemyes to frustrate, or vniust friendes vtterly to ruinate theyr aduysed hoapes: but for that (courteous syr) the howre of performaunce of my solemne cerymonyes is at hande, I am earnestlye to beseeche you, not to hynder me in the same, whyche at the fyrst thoughe it seeme straunge to youre selfe, yet synce it is vsuall in me, I do the better dysgest it. The Gentleman courteouslye yeelded, wherevppon shee aparrelled her selfe to the executyon of her purposed ceremonyes, and drawyng neere to her friendes toombe, shee opened the graue, and settyng downe on her knees, shee dyscouered the goodlyest and most fayre head of heyr, that any creature might behould, & wyth a violent hand (strayning forth flouds of teares, and fylling the woodes with pitifull resoundes of sweltryng sobs) she tore part of, and comending it with a carefull kisse to her Hernando , she threw it into the Graue: which done, castynge vp her eyes to the cloudes, & beatinge her delicate pantinge brest, with most violent & wilfull stroakes, & thumpyng her beautiful face, wt her faire & wel formed hads, taking the Harpe and strikyng the strings with her proportionate and seemely fingers, in moste dolorous Tunes, she swetely deliuereth this Sonet, recommendyng the Melodie, to the Ghoste of her dead Husband. Dyanaes trayne, the flowers of beauty braue, Ye hollowe rockes, which God and Nature made, To close the plot, of my HERNANDOS Graue, You sauage beastes, whose company I haue, Resound her woes, whom cruell death denies, To ease her harmes, by closyng of her eyes. ¶ And thou fayre Eccho, whose delightfull face, Was set at nought, in proud Narcissus sight, Vouchsafe a while, to harbour in this place, My later wordes, in sorrow to resyght, Who still am wrung, by Fortunes dyre dispight, And reft of him, in whom I did inioye, A greater pryce, then Cresyda of Troye. ¶ O stately Phebus, from thy goulden chayre, Behould my greefes, whose heart doth melt in mone, And if that mercy, bydeth in the ayre, Vouchsafe my soull, from body may be gon, That my sweet friend, and I may lyue in one, And walking in th'Lisian feeldes a space, To our content, ech other to imbrace. ¶ For as the ship, with many billowes tost, And rent by rage, of myghty Aeols blast, Doth fall in leake, and lyke for to be lost, Is forst her frawght, and burden to our cast, The Master greeues, the sea beates in so fast, And Mariner, in daunger still of death, Doth plye the Pumpe, tyll he be out of breath. ¶ Euen so poore I, by many sorrowes wronge, And dryuen in floode, of soull and dyre dispayre, Dysdaine this lyfe, which lasteth ouerlong, And call on death, by humble sute and prayer, That this vile lyfe, may vanysh into ayre, And I may rest at last, betweene his armes, For whose sweete sake, I suffer all these harmes. ¶ For what mishappe, maye be comparde to myne, Whose byrth requires, a better place then thys, Who seekes by prayer, and sute for to resyne, This loathsome lyfe, that breakes me from my blysse, But waywarde woe, doth turne my ioyes amisse, And cruell wyndes, by boystrous blastes do blow, My humble sutes, least death should ease my woe. ¶ O happy soules, that rests amyd the skye, Thou gladsome ghost, of my HERNANDOS grace, Behould these teares, that trickle from the eye, Of her who longe to vewe thy heauenly face, And to bereaft, of this her vitall case, In ease to rest, with thee whose only loue, Poore PORCIA forst, from court for to remoue. ¶ O my deare friend, if any fayth there be, If any whitt, of auncient loue be lefte, If heauenly powers, do yearthly sorrowes see, Vouchsafe my breath, from body to be refte, But if the Faates, no fauour haue me left, Yet thou the last, refuge of mournefull mynde, O driry death, let me some fauour finde. ¶ But if both heauens, and death do lowre on me, And meane my lyfe, shall be prolongd in mone, Yet my HERNANDO, I will honour the, Tyll sence and breath, from body shall be gon, And though I lead my loathsome lyfe alone, Yet in my thought, I euery daye will dye, Tyll death in deed, do force my lyfe to flye. These verses thus reported, and cerymonies performed, by the fayre and amorous Lady Porcia , shee couered in mournefull manner, her gallant bushe of goulden heyre, and placing the stone ouer the bodye of her buried Hernando , she arose, and with portly paace, and stately maiestye, the true and manyfest token of her royall and noble byrth, she aduanced her selfe towardes our sorowfull Simonides , who like a melancholy diseased man, furnished with many corosiue and harmeful humours, now tossing his ymagination this waye, nowe turning his opynion that waye, nowe wondering at the force of loue, nowe bewayling the mysfortune of the Lady, now rauished in her rare beauty, her seemely vertues, and inuiolate faate, nowe condemning the gods of iniustice, now remembring the cause of hys owne proper maladye: in those and such lyke passions, his sences for a space, was occupyed, tyll at the last, reason the allay of all contrarious affection, disburdened him of his fancy, & made him (the rather for yt his sorrowes could not but be displeasant to poore Porcia ) with humble speach, to breake of ye ymagined greef that ye Lady was wrong withall in this sort. Most renowned Ladie, since to my no small sorow, it hath pleased you to finish the ceremonies of your vowed funeral, & to my no small wonder of your costancie, haue gratified your husband with an vnuiolat offering of your chast loue: let it stand with your likyng (consideryng the infirmyties of our bodies, are hardly able to beare out any surge of sorow without some natural foode and sustenaunce) to betake you to some repast, not only for your owne health, but also for the satisfiynge of my hunger, whom trauaile truely hath almost ouertyred. Madame Porcia , whiche had not, throughe her sauage Purgatorie forgot her courtly seemelines, answered hym thus. Gentleman, I am of your opinion, that sorowe must haue somwhat to feede on, least it worke too much, and since the remedie lieth in prouision of a slender diet, yf you list to be partaker of my simple supper, you shal be welcome, I will promise you some of our Forest Uenison: and for that you are a Stranger, I wyll showe you this fauour, my selfe wyll gather you of the best fruict to furnish out your Banquet: hunger made Simonides , wyllyng: so betwene them bothe, the Pricket was vncased, and by the Ladies labour, delicatly roasted: in whiche Cookerie, I esteeme my Pilgrim to be Turnebroach, for fayre Porcia , was applied in the fieldes, in gatheryng fruict, and the rather, for that her experience, was greater then Simonides , for that she had serued out a hole seuen years Prentishood, and by that meanes furnished her selfe with greater Experience: In briefe, all thinges were in a redinesse, our Ladie Huntresse returned home with her fruict, the Uenison well roasted, and both their appetites answerable to the redines of their suppers: whervpo they set the down at their meat, hauing supply of drinke fro the Fountaine. what Table talke thei had, if you demaund, it was none, their Appetites were not Courtly, to make leasurable Discourses betwene euery morsell, but after Supper, I must tell you Simonides bespake hym thus. Madame, you may count me a man of small nurture, that hauyng receyued so many curtesies at your handes, and driuen you to so often & solitary Discourses, I haue forgotten to deliuer you some (although not answerable) thankes: but I beseche you Ladie, let this excuse me, that I confesse mine errour, and for treble amendes in dutyful seruice. And for that my purpose is to waade further I am to craue your patience, in hearyng my request and answerynge my demaunde, beeynge the rather imboldened, for that I am assured of your byrth, whiche alwaies beareth a seal or cognisance of rare vertue and comendable curtesie: if my request shall take place, (good Ladie) let me knowe, for in the Solution of my Question, I shall distinguysshe the controuersie betwene my hoape and feare. Porcia replied: you may vndoubtedly perswade your selfe (curteous Gentleman) that neither a reasonable demaunde, mooued for your pleasure, nor a small forgetfulnesse, in none performance of a little comon curtesie, can make me alter my nature, or proue coy in dissoluing your doubt, for those dispositios, though ye pryde of Court vsuallie accompte of them, yet our sauage ciuilitie, requyreth alwayes equallytie, in aunswere and demaunde, so there be no difference in byrthe: And for that your outwarde behauiour, makes showe of honorable linage, you are not so wyllyng to enquyre, as I am redy to satisfie. Then truely, my good Ladie, quoth Simonides , I can not sufficiently wonder at the rare beautie, and singuler constancie of your owne selfe, who trayned vp in Court, sought to by Princes, allyed to Dukes, reuerenced by inferiours, haue contrary to the course of common nature, made your honorable personage, a seruaunt to solitarines and being delicatly ordered by your first Parent to beare small or no burdens of misfortune, haue for a lyttle transitorie pleasure, abandoned a stately Courte, forsaken a louynge Unckle, despised Princely offers, to receyue the Offalles of loue and Fortune. And truelye, I can not sufficiently wonder at the straunge effecte that is wroughte in you: maye it bee thoughte that an amourous conceypte shoulde make a woman esteeme that for happynesse, whiche our moste wisest Auncestours, haue accoumpted worse then Deathe. Cicero , a Senatour of famous Eloquence, sufficient wealthe, able to spye oute all the Conspiracies in Cataline , and beynge perfectelye ynoughe perswaded, by the woorkes of his owne wytte: what aduersitie was, and in a noble (and) wise mans mynde, what it ought to worke: yet beynge put in exyle, howe hardly exclaymed he on Fortune? howe lamentablye payncted he his Miserie, in sorowfull Discourse, to his Brutus ? howe vneasely did he brooke the absence of his Tulliola ? howe often wisshed he returne vnto his Countrey? Truelye Madame, I haue often read of many, that in prosperytie were wise, accomptynge themselues sufficientlye able to waade throughe all streames of trouble, firynge their Anker of Hoape in the inuiolate constancie of their minde, but when Aduersitie had wroonge them by the backe, and the fawnes of their friendes were tourned to frownes: their Princes fayre speaches, to cruell threatninges, the daintie repastes, to suspitious meales: them selues and their Heires, dispossessed of their Titles: sodaynely, their stayednes vanished to vnwise and foolysh lamentation, they became wanne, paale, slaues in Nature, abandonynge their bodyes to seruyle dueties, and hynderynge their former contemplation of minde, by their after lamentation for the misfortune of their transitorie bodye: But it maye be, that in this case, your Ladyshyppe esteemeth your trouble no lesse then dutiful, you were somoned by Loue, and fled wt your friend, yea, more then friend, a husband: a comendable constancie in a woman, yet a hard choyce in you both: but we wyll graunt you this your first flight with Hernando was vertuous, your costancie in his life, prayse worthy, your secreate solytarinesse to be wondred at: But now when Porcia hath no Hernando to lye by, why should she still continue in exile, for him that is not, bootlesse are those teares, that are shed for the deceased, and foolysh are those louers, that feede them selues wyth theyr fancy, that theyr passyons, theyr tormentes, theyr penuryes, which they suffer in remembraunce of theyr poore deceased friendes, shall cause them worthyly to be inrowled, in the leagend of true and faythfull louers: I am assuredly perswaded, that the wisest allwayes hould it small wisedome, for men to sorrow for that, which by their teares receiueth no succoure: But Madame, pardon me, if I dyscourse more largely, I will drawe nyer you, and leaue no corner vnsought, or matter vnreported, which my memory will mynister, tyll I haue woon that I shot at, and perswaded you to my purpose. Your husband and you Madame left Ferara , like two louing friendes, to auoyd the fury of your vnkle, should it not be to become subiect to the vnmercyfull manaces of Fortune? you kept this desert plot wherein no small space, you haue inioyed the fruictes of wedlocke, whych because they be transitory, ought not to be recompensed in their losse with continual sorrow, he is dead, you haue alotted him his buriall, the only remembraunce of hym that you can haue, is a secret Idea of his proportion, in your brayne, with a fewe perished bones of hys in thys graue, do these (thinke you) deserue seauen yeares ceremonies? if you wil consider with me a while (good Lady) of that which foloweth, the controuersy would quicklye be concluded, you knowe all mortall creatures, direct all their courses to an end, eyther apparantly, or verily good, amongst which two ends, I desyre to know your owne, if the end of your lamentable lyfe is to do your selfe good, or to pleasure your friende, you conclude aparance and essence in one, but for that you are a louer, I thinke you rather applye youre actions, to the showe, then the substance, you haue had tyme sufficient to forget an inueterate fancy, & to fassion your selfe to leaue this resolute, yet foolysh aboade in distresse: and wisedome should teach a Matrone of your stayednes and beauty, that as the nyght is Mystres of the fadinge flowers, to the morning restoreth them to their orient colours, your Phenix hath lefte an other out of his owne dust, who will Master your olde friend in vertues, and match him in comelynes, you are nowe in your spring tyme, if happily possessed of a second faythfull Husband, lyke to be a mother of many children, and parhapps more welcome to Ferara , by reason of your long absence, then infortunate being repulsed from thece, by the Princes heauy displeasure, but were it, your rare vertues should be drowned in this desert, and so pleasaunte and wyse dyscourses shoulde be seuered from the Courte, good Madame cast off youre vnaquaynted carefulnesse, synce it is bootlesse, respecte the greefe of youre vncle conceiueth in youre absence, and the comforte out Italyan Prynces woulde fynde in youre recouered company: But if no reasons that are past before, can worke you to that I most earnestlye wishe for, if my perswasions by reason of youre settled opynyon, wyll not serue you to take aduysment by, you shall heare the last refuge that my remembraunce affordeth me, whyche I beseeche the powers maye as presentlye take place in your harte, as it is faythful and zealouslye reported from my minde: Nature as shee gaue you beautye (Madame) and a goodly body, so she adorned you with an inward diuine soull, which ye greater perfectyon it hath, the more subiect ought your earthly mebers to be vnto it, now the loue which vnyted your fleshlye substance, to fancy youre Hernando , seeing it is an enemye to your soull, ought not so much to mooue to solitarines, as the other to perswade you to consider of your owne welfare, your body & loue are to serue you on earth, your soul both maketh you reasonable here, and mynistreth to you in Heauen, way therfore wt your selfe (fayre Ladie) how much you hurt your soule, in yeldyng to vnreasonable Loue, whiche maketh you sorow, for that, which neyther your teares can profite, or your hard and extreme passyons, and earthly calamyties may pleasure: The brute and sauage Beastes, ledd but by a naturall instynct, refuse the bad and admyt the good, they carefully make ready for their winter prouision, as the Ante: they louyngly tender the yong ones as the she Beare: they naturally mourne in others losse, as the Turtell: and wisely emptie the drinkyng Brookes from poysoned humours, as the Unicorne: If these senceles substaunces, onely ledd by Nature, admyt the weale, refuse the woe: how much more ought you (good Madame) leaue to humble your self to misfortune, & to mangle your setled hope with deuillysh dispaire, to forsake the abode of reasonable men, and to inhabite amongest the broode of vyle and vntamed Beastes, and to leaue to lyue in statelye Court, & abide in solitarie Desert: But one thyng dryueth me vnto horror (good Ladie) if the iust Gods by their secret wisdomes, knowing the Marke you shoote at, shuld close vp your eyes, and receiue your soule to their mercy, what Tumbe shuld be left for your Princely personage, or who were he that happily should come to perfoarme your funerales, alas I feare me, these rude rocks doeth harbour the brute & sauage bowels, which greedily shuld receiue these sacred lims, & cruelly teare in peeces these exquisit lineaments, & vnles the water Nimphes happily syng you a dyrge, hardly could I thinke, you should be buried with your rightes: O way this good Lady, consider of these occasioned discourses, and geue eare to my sute, which I vowe by the immortall Gods, so vertuously to performe, as you shall not but well esteeme of me, and accompte me onely sent by the Goddes to be youre conducter, not of these dessertes: if it shall please you to forsake your accustomed place and seat which heare you possesse, I vowe by the faythe of a louing and true Pyllgryme, and by the fydelytie of a Gentleman, safely to conduct & bryng you hither, when as your pleasure, & accordyng, to your decree, you shal lyue to your own contetation & your ancient credit, either solitary, as you are woont, or with company, as you please, you haue here fire and water (good Ladie) layde before you, a poore Seruaunt that faythfully wyll perfourme his promise: you perceiue by this (I truste) my tryed zeale, & of your good nature, I knowe wyll ouerslyp whatsoeuer is offensiue, till I haue your resolute answer (Madame) I am styll. Porcia , which attentiuely heard the friendly exhortation of this Spanysh Gentleman, hauyng wayd with her selfe, both the intent he shot at, & the learned, orderly, and curteous speach of Simonides , beyng sufficiently perswaded of his wisdome and rare Uertues, replied thus. Not without great delight (good friend) I haue wyllyngly conceiued of your Clarkly Discourse, & determyned of my purposed answere, I perceue, you haue in somthyng mistaken Porcia , for you vnderstad her in nothing, you accompt my cotemplation, which I haue purposed, to be a desperate opinion in me to cotinue vnhappy, and with the same reasons, you seeke to disarme me of my pretenced Purgatorie, by which I am sufficiently warded to wtstand the intymation of your arguments, many reasons there be, which to som men seeme displeasant, by cause ye persos theselues are erthly minded, bin to a hart setled in coteplation, thei are ye ministers of meere diuinitie: First (my Gentleman) loue brought me hither, yea, chast loue, a loue not grounded vpon the vsuall pleasure of the flesh, but on the grounded vnitie of hart, wherby my husbandes soule was so firmely allied to mine, as no showers of misfortune, or breach of tyme, could alter the quallytie of our Loue, the quantytie wherof, as it coulde not be conceyued in Earthe, so it taketh effecte in Heauen: The Faates haue hereafte this rest from me, and suffred my flowre to be parched vp, with the schorchyng flames of assured charitie, & vnkind deth poured out of his cold viol, an icy moistur which distilled on my freds hart hath seperated his soule from his body, and sent hym to that place of pleasure, where he shall receyue a Crowne of immortall honour, for his heauenly & earthly amytie. The separation of hym fro me, the Godds haue made to this purpose, to make me learne the mutabylytie of this wretched lyfe, and consider of the eternytie & wonderful essence of the heauens, where they haue placed my friend to this end, that I might with more desire, behold the Skie, that beyng rauyshed with the Maiestie therof, I might become too heauenly, and forget to be earthly. I haue (curteous Gentleman) more ioy and comforte in this place of abandon, then euer your earthly Creatures could affoord me, from beholdyng the fadyng Beautie of our earthly personages, I am brought to vewe the Maiestie of the Sunne, whose secreate operation on earth, beyng by experience layde open to my sight, more perfecteth me then all other terrestriall Triumphes, can pleasure me: to see how he equally distrybuteth his Beames, a noate of the dutie of a Prince, how both the Deserte and Groues, Hylles and Dales, are equally increased, by his eiected seede, & decked with the greenest Mantell, that his morrow dew yeldeth, noating what Pouertie and Richesse shuld be in the Iudgemente Seate of a kynge: I could waade farther, but a womans wytte as myn is, were better to conceiue in scilence, the vtter and seeme vndiscreete. But in that you touch worldly pleasures somwhat, as Argumentes to draw my minde fro vowed home, of trueth, the more I vewe this earth, the more I hate it: and the lesse I delight in it, the more contentacion my soule hath of Heauen: and were it not for this vile sinfull fleshe, I woulde neuer neede my Mother Earth, for that my soule delighteth in Nectar and Ambrosia , the foode of the Goddes: Stately Pallaces, be receptacles of proude mindes, and high Halles harber combersome cares: quietnesse abideth in Humili casa post equitem sedet atra cura : I, poore I, am contented with my Forrest Dainties, my woodde Uenison, and my Fountaine wine: the marow of the wheat, and the blood of the Grape, are for my courtlye Mistresses, and as theyr downe beds bring them in softe and sweete sleepe, so my sweete bowes, nestle a temperate body, and a contented minde, my diet requireth no phisike, for melody, the birds of the mountain salutes me, euery daye wyth a morning sonet: and iudge you courteous Segniour, if I lyue not daintily, first my contemplation of heauen, next my contempt of earth, nowe to a soull armed with this coate armour, what obiect you death, or speake you of a buriall? for death it is naturall: and therefore not uotiue: shal we feare that for which we were borne? what wretch were I, if I should be loath to returne to my countrey of rest, from this painfull and werisome trauel? for burial, a bootlesse matter, as though nature cold not turne into nature by any other vyolent or orderly meanes: are the teeth of wilde beastes felt to the nipped carkasse, you knowe they are not, why then they hurt not, if it be your fortune to stand by my death, as some did by Dyogenes, at his departure, I would answeare your question by demaunde of a staffe, to driue awaye the deuourer. Gentleman, Gentleman, let these toyes passe from you, and answeare your selfe in this, Porcia , findeth happines in the desert, and court had care: her aspect is heauenly in this Cell, it was yearthly in the Pallace: shee serued the yearth at Ferara , in her bow Cabinet the earth serueth her, in the Citty she feared all things, nowe shee is dismayd in nothing. Rest courteouse Gentleman, to stryue agaynste the streame, the motion of my purgatory, come from the iust Iudges in heauen, your perswasyons cannot vndoo it, I would synce you know my minde, vnderstand, your own estate, byrth and cause of trauell, so by making a progresion we shal wind you from your perswasions which are in vayne, and winne you to the remembraunce of youre owne misfortunes. Simonides perceiuing the setled opinion of the vowed louing Ladye, and vnderstandinge the certayne reasons that led and gouerned her determinations, was aunswered and satisfied in mind, and according to the Ladies resonable and courteous demaunde, he recounted to her the place of his byrth, which was Ciuill , the state of his Parentes, which was Honourable, the chast vertues of his Mystres which was Clarinda , and his vnbridled affections which were the causes of hys trauell. Thus hauynge opened to her the whole dyscourse, at her request, and the matter as quyckelye conceyued by her, shee delyghted verye much to vnderstande, that shee alone was not passionate: And perceyuynge that nyght, the Messenger of darkenesse drewe neere, and that the Sunne had forsaken the fyrmamente, and the Moone the Mystresse inchauntmentes, had begunne to showe her horned head, in the starrye Heauens, shee courteouslye gaue Simonides a Conge , and departynge some of her small prouision with the Pylgrime, shee left hym to take his rest, and setled her selfe to sleape. Simonides wearied with trauell, was litle troubled with dreames, for he was compassed with dead sleape, had not the Messenger of the Sunne, by his streynynge lyght, awakened my Gentleman, and the Goddes also appoynted hym to the perfourmaunce of a succedent purpose, I doubt mee, he woulde haue byne a seconde Endemion , but Porcia , that sleapt lytle, and weapte muche, hauinge her Hernando in remembraunce, at the Sunne rysynge, as her custome was, made her selfe readye to geue her Husbande hys due ceremonyes: so armed with her Harppe, passinge by Simonides , to whome shee gaue a gentle good morrowe, and receyued the lyke, shee set her downe on her knees by her Louers Graue, whych beynge opened as her custome was, shee offered her forespoken sacrifices, with manye carefull inuocations, and wythout anye innouation in ceremonye, shee tempered her voyce to the tune and tyme of her Harpe, and lamentably sunge thys pyttifull Hymne. The luke warme lycour, of a crased heart, My tremblyng tongue, repor thou all my payne, Whose torments fell, are more then my deseart, Whose pearsyng playntes, are able to conuert, The Marble mountes, for to bewayle my mone, And brutish beastes, for my poore sake to grone. ¶ O that sweete death, would nowe accorde to yelde, My sorowing soule, to see my heauenly friende, That being plaste, amidde the fatale feelde, On her HERNANDO, PORCIA might attende, Where both in one, our dayes we well might spend, And resting there, where Phebus takes his lyght, Myght be releeud, from Fortunes dyre dispight. ¶ O heauenly powers, behould her carefull state, whose seuen yeares toyle, requires some sweet reward, Tis death ye heauens, can finishe this debate, O pittie powers, to PORCIA haue regard, O blessed howre, Death hasteneth his award, O welcome Death, thrice welcome vnto me, My port of rest for thou must succour me. ¶ HERNANDO lo, thy PORCIA hasteneth fast, Prepare the place, that I haue sought for long, My happie howre, the faates do graunt at last, When I maye showe, to the my seauen ysares wrong, And howe for the, I chaunted many a song, Farewell this lyfe, my Ghost now parte awaye, with my HERNANDOS spright, to lyue for aye. In deliuering of which last lines, she bowed her head to the Sepulcher, & for that the date of her desteny was finished, without speaking any woorde, whych sensiblye Simonides could conceiue, shee sylently breathed out her gladsome Ghost, recommending it to the company of her louing Husband: Our Pilgrim moued by ye rare musike of Porcia , & least suspecting her so sodaine departure, yet wundring at her long scylence, dyd thinke shee had bene in some sad Orison, and therefore gaue her leaue a while, but doubtyng somwhat by her long continuaunce: drawyng neere, he found the vertuous Lady dead, the whiche, to his no smal sorrow and wonderful admyration, when he perceiued, he considered that Lamentations were vnnecessarie, where the bodye remayned breathelesse, and therfore, bethinkyng hymselfe of her buryall, and searchyng the secrete corners of her Cabynet, at last, he foud out the Spade wherwith she had interred her Husband, which toole he vsed for the intumbyng of her self, and hauynge opened the Graue to the Bones of Hernando , he recommended (with many a wofull sighe) the Corse of this worthy Ladie to the colde earth, and wounded with many carefull thoughtes, and astonyshed by the mercylesse Stratageme of vniust Fortune, he left the solytary habytacion of deceased Porcia , and trauaylyng by many bypathes, to attayne the sight of some inhabited Cittie, he spent seuen dayes in search, being noorished only with such Rootes and fruictes, as the Deserte mynistred vnto him: At the last, as with soryfull and werysome paace, he was trauayling on his way, ther happened to his vew a great troupe of Horsemen, to whom he made way, and vnderstood by one of the traine, that the Gentleman that ryd by, was Antidonus , Sonne to the Duke of Ferara , who was trauaylyng toward Myllon , and hauynge inquyred how farre Ferara was off, and the right way, he vnderstoode, it was but two Leagues off: whervpon with a gladsome cheare, and renewed paace, he trauayled in shorte space, and attayned the Cittie, where, hauyng for his money, prouided a sufficient lodgyng (for that it was night, after Supper) he betooke him to rest, and the rather to lessen the great agony of his minde, and also to refresh the werynes of his bones, The next day, for that he lothly could conceale the fortune of Hernando Milleti and fayre Portia ) hauyng apparayled him selfe in his vowed Roabes, he dircted his course to the Dukes court, of purpose to make him priuie to the lamentable Tragedie, of his infortunat Neece: the Warders vnderstanding by him his intent was to haue conference with theyr Pyrnce, brought him within the Pallace, recommending his cause to a Gentleman, who courteously (as his duty was) brought him to the Dukes presence, who at that time, was in a fayre, and pleasaut Garden, disporting himselfe, with sundry of his Nobility, and other of his Counsell. Simonides , delyghted with the graue, & seemely personage of the noble Prince, & by the serenitie of his face, conceiued the Humanity of his mynde, with humble and due reuerence, vttered this speeche before his Maiestye. I haue (most noble and renouned Duke) certayne secret conferences to discourse with your excelency, which if by your lawfull fauour, I may haue leaue, and by conueniencye of the place be inbouldened, you breefely shall vnderstand. The Duke delighted with the modest regard, & comly porte of the yong Pylgrym, considering of his reasonable demand, and waying of his byrth by his orderly and dutifull behauiour, answered hym thus: I haue alwayes (my good frend) accompted it a pryncipall in the precepts of good nurture, that amongst pryuat men, curteous & fauourable acceptance shuld be had: much more ought it to be in a Prince, naturally ingrafted, to here with mediocritie, and to distinguishe no persons, either by fortunes faune, or pouerties frown, this only rule I haue kept, euen since I enioyed the signorie, nothyng to esteeme on the persons wealth, but of the equitie of his cause: for assuredly, it is most requisit in all comon weales, that the gouernours shuld haue no itching eares or lymie fingers in passionat affections, but stayed distrybuters of Iustice: for where as ye good fortune of ye Prince dependeth on the loue of the people, the Magistrate ought alwaies to indeuer, that the ingrafted zeale of the comunaitie: be not sequestred from the Prince, by lewde practises & euil admynistration of law: mercie & Iustice (good friend) are my two hands which I temper as both are not confounded in one, but equalitie in the vsage of them, hath made my subiectes accustome to loue mee and feare mee: I heare the poore and the rich, but the equitie of the cause directeth my reason: As muche as in mee lyeth, I temper my bodie in that mediocritie, that the worlde shoulde not accoumpt mee a Lorde ouer manye, and yet not able to master my selfe: you may therfore be perswaded, that your sute shall be hearde, and equitie admynistred: and with these wordes, he tooke Simonides asyde, and willed him bouldly to vtter his mynde: who after due and orderly reuerence, began in this maner: The rare vertues, that accompany your callinge, the singuler curtesies, that I finde in your excelencie, the straungnesse of the matter, that I pretende to open vnto you (renowned and famous Duke) craue longe discourse, aduised purpose, and seemelye conueiaunce: but for that my litle poore skill, simple perfourmaunce, and mynde worne with myseries, cannot acquainte your maiestie with Courtlyke or Rethoricall speaches, yet as the passion that brought mee hither shall direct mee, your highnes shall heare the discourse of a pitifull tale. My selfe (noble & vertuous Prince) being led wt delight to beholde straunge Cities, rare nouelties, and the operations of Nature, in this earthly Chaos , left my natiue citie Ciuill , forsooke my parentes Landes, which were honorable: and betooke my selfe to pretensed trauell, some causes happened to mee in my iourneyinge, where of the most deserue not the attention of a Prince: and the rest for that they were common in a wisemans iudgement, they are not commendable: I had thought to haue concealed nothing, which ye maiestie of your personage inforceth mee to open: your rare vertues noble Segnior , the renowne that the world wisheth you, the aduised stayednes in your gouernment, the beautifulnes of your Citty, the wyse men that inhabyt it, the true Iustice that ruleth it, though one of them then were of sufficiency to mooue admiration, yet the most of them haue directed my trauell, whiche was to see your Highnes, whome I fynde more then reporte can speake, an exquisit Prince, wise in gouernment (pardon my bouldnes good Duke, the Pilgrim admitteth no affection, as his profession is religious, so he canot realy vpon ye pleasure or displeasure of a personage, only honest meaning is his mark, on which his purposed determination doth lay foudation) I haue found what I sought for, now (good Duke) attend for that I come for, I trauell long betwixt Ciuill & Ferara , & perhaps hungry, you cannot imagin but weary, my dyat was naturall, for it was desert rootes, & forrest fruites, since I could not attayne to better prouision, I haue seene Barcelona, a fayr Cytty, but from Barcelona, I was lost in a desert, wher I found a cause of equal sorrow to your Highnes, and incredible lametation for my selfe, the place where the sight befortuned me, solitary: the persons which I will relate vnto you seemely, and more then that, vertuous: had not your Maiestie a Neece called Portia ? if your remebrance fayle you not she was fayre, I know she was vertuous, yea more then that, costant, you amongst your youths in court knew Hernando Milletti , her husband to your mislike, yet a frend alloted her by the Gods, your displeasure banished them from Ferara , & the iust Goddes haue blest them with Heauen: for hauyng fled from you, they lyued three yeres equally together in mutual loue, which being expyred, the man died, and is buried: the wife (your neece) hath ben seuen yeares solytarie, tyll the Faates directed me to beare witnes of her ende: I haue seene Portia aliue and haue buried her for dead, & now your highnes vnderstandeth in briefe, the whole Discourse of your Neeces fortune, who wt her Hernando now, is partaker of more heauenly ioyes, then you can conceiue. You here (noble Prince) the effect of my message, you cosider I doubt not of the euent, my dutie perfourmed, I rest farther to sollicite you, but of troth I must conclude, these costant louers, deserue a more honorable burial, the one by reason of his costancy, the other for yt she is nobly borne. The Duke hauyng (with no small foyson of teares) diligently conceiued the effect of Simonides discourse, and the hard destinie, that had befortuned his amiable kinswoman, and his loyall seruant: and loth that so rare constancie should fynde so bad a buriall, dissembling his inward sorow, with a Princely maiestie, gaue the Pilgrim hartie thankes for his trauell, and earnestlye requested hym, that to the perfourmaunce of the funerall of these two faithfull friendes, he woulde guide his companie to the graue of Portia , who was not so soone requested, but as willyngly perfourmed: and being accompained with the most worthy personages in Ferara , hee speedily ariued at the place of these two louers purgatorie: where discouering the bodies by opening the earth, the whole Carcase of Portia , with the bones of Hernando , were closed vp in one Coffin, and so solemplye conuaied to Ferara , at the entraunce of Simonides and his companye, with the bodies of these two faithfull friends: the Duke in mournynge attyre, accompanied with all his nobles, in lyke sort mournefully appareled, with solempne deuotion, and dolefull melodie, conducted the deceased to the Tumbe, which was royally prepared in the Cathederall Churche of Ferara , where hauinge accordinge to their degree lefte them in the earth, he returned to his pallace, accompaned with our Pilgrim, whom hee royallye rewarded for hys paines, and stayed him in the Citie three monethes: in which time Simonides writ this Epytaph, in memoriall of this straunge misfortune, whiche was ingraued ouer the tumbe of the two louers. Who list to know, a myrror of these daies A Pilgrim poore, hath pend for his behooue The faithfull liues, of two, most worthie praise Whose lyfe, whose death, this sedule heere bewrayes, To whom I leaue, for to increase their fame The whole discourse, set downe vnder their name. ¶ The noble Duke, that swayes this royall state, Had to his neece, a Ladie of renowne Faire PORTIA cald, by many sought of late But now inioynde, till Fortunes fatall frowne To pull her plumes, and lay her pleasure downe, Did sommon loue, to fasten in her sight, A noble youth, to further her delight. ¶ A Spaniard borne, Hernando men him call, A worthie mirrour, of a faithfull friend, Who liu'de so well, as he was lou'd of all Him Portia chose, to loue vnto the ende The matche was made, but fortunes brow did bende And made them flye, for feare of Princes Ire. From stately court, to Forest to retire. ¶ There three yeares toyle these louers did possesse, With foode of rootes, yet with contented mynde, Till death, to make poore Portias pleasure lesse: Bereft Hernandos life, in sorow pinde, Whose graue poore Portia, quickly him assignd, And seauen yeares more, she liued in that state Till equall death, did giue her lyfe the mate. ¶ The noble Prince, the honour of this land, Conceiuyng by, a Pilgrimes wofull tale: The whole discourse, set to his helping hand That these two freendes, of buriall should not fayle Returnde their bodies, for their more auaile: And lo intumbde, these faithfull louers lie, Their bodies heere, their soules amidst the Skye, Our Simonides , beeing myndefull of his trauyll, and finding that the citie retained naught but pleasure, where as his maladie required no such medicine, after humble dutie perfourmed to the noble Duke, who had so courteously entertained him hee left Ferara , to visit Venice , by ye way what he thought on, let them that liue in loue giue verdite: the prouerbe is, that there a mans minde is most conuersaunt, where his affection is best serued . I meane not to discourse of the vaine tales of his felow trauelers, nor make you priuy to the pleasaunt purposes of his mariners, lande and sea serued both to his vse, a Shippe and Saylers farthered his determynation, a wyllinge minde (which worketh all) with a prosperous wynde, blew him to Venice , where God sende him good reste for this firste night, for he aryued late, nowe what he perfourmed the next day, you shall heare. As Hermits are wont, who vow themselues to venter, & abhorring the vaine stratagemes of this worlde, indeuoringe vnder their simple habite, to harbour a relygious minde: Simonides , to perfourme his dutiful orisons, went to visit our Ladies shrine in Venice , where humblinge himselfe with due reuerence, he perourmed the prayers of a religious traueler: and whether that it were that an extasye, made him lenger on his knees, or the feruente zeale of his minde, made him forget the vnaptnesse of his bodie, he continued in his prayers two howres. In which time, amongst manie others, whose deuotion was great, there came an aged & stately Ladie Matronesse in sight, one of the noblest Citezens wiues, well accompaned, & honorablie serued: who setling hir selfe to perfourm, yt she came for: it was her fortune to perceiue our deuout Simonides trikling downe teres fro his eies, in deliuering his orisons: and as it is to be conceiued, her commyng thyther, was to doo the like: for why, to outward appearance she was holy, and in truth she prayed feruently, and whether it were the motion of a good spirit, or the godly shew of our Hermit, or some deuine powers that moued it, our Ladie would be confessed, her prayers had made her penytent: whereupon, seeing the oportunitie to be so good, she waited Simonides departure, and taking him by the hande, she led him into an oratorie of Saint Fraunces, cituate within that Church, & seuering her retinue from her, she reuerentlye, and in most humble manner saide thus. Most deuoute Hermit, thy holy demeanure, thy seemly personage, and this present oportunitie: my compulsyon of spirit, prick in conscience, with the conueniencie of the place, doth inforce mee to craue your fauour, that opening vnto you, the burthen of my Soule, and the loathsomnes of my sinne, I may be farthered, by your godly exhortation, and be absolued at your reuerent handes, willinge to abide, what so euer penaunce, your holynesse shall inioyne mee to. Our Simonides , tickeled with this vnacquainted talke, and seeing that necessitie inforced hym to this occasion, makes his wordes sutable to his Coate, aunswearing thus. Your yeares (Noble Ladye) shoulde alwaies make shew of stayednesse, and your relygious mynde sufficiently perswades mee, that your repentaunce is vnfained, since confession is so readie, order your selfe therefore in that sort (madam) that opening your offences to the full, you may the more sufficientlye be disbourdened of your sinnes, and by due deserued penaunce, pacifie the displeasure, of our most iust and mercifull God: alwaies when you come to make relation of your worldlye misdeedes, thereby to haue participation of heauenlye mercie, you must consider the person to whom, and the matter which is to be vttered: The person, for that he representeth the maiestie of the most hyghest: The matter, that it be simply vttered, sorowfullye detested, and in your after dealinges, to be more modest: for by spirituall speculation, and deuine insight I conceaue, that womens errours bee great when they practise to deceiue, and where they are bent to make a fayned confession, there they commonlye are inclyned, to fasten on dissimulation: I speake not this Ladie as a worldly pleasing man, to feede your earthlye fancie, but as a deuout and true meaninge Hermite, that hath care of your soule. If therefore, you with submyssion wyll make me priuie to your euyl, and with due contritio wil mortify your earthly affections, to make satisfaction for your abuse, by the vertu of my heauenly commission (the which for your behoofe I wyll stretche to the vttermost) I wyl giue you a clere absolution, & to the comfort of your soule, delight you with eternall consolation. If thus you come, speake on, your mynd is vertuous: if otherwise, refraine, your fact is daungerous, and for soules health I am curious. The aged and honorable matron, hauinge conceiued of the godly discourse of her gostlye father, falling on her knees, with dutiful and deuout reuerence, and being pricked on with the motion of her troubled mynde, with teares in her eies discouered the sorow of her hart in this sorte. Unfainedly (reuerent Father) and from the bottom of a penytent sinners hart, you shall receiue the whole report of my lamentable, and wretched misseled lyfe: of the vaine, transitorie, and amourus delight, of my vnbrideled youth: And although the nature of this my feminyne flesh, perswads mee to dissemble some secret escapes perpetrated by mee very wickedly: yet being admonished and eaten vp with the zeale of the Lordes house, I wyll not fayle according to veritie, to make you priuie to my youthly vanytie. Know you (deuoute and religious Father) that I am a Cockney borne of Venice , dayntely bred vp by my father called Flauius , and cokishly cherished by my mother called Fuluia , and christened (threescore yeares since) by the name of Lamia : the wealth of my Father brought mee many woers: and beautie made our courtlye Italyans verie amourous, I knew well inough how to please fancies, and to fasten my selfe to the motions of sinfull flesh, whiche beinge made out of corruption, minystereth vs naught els in this worlde, but foule abhomination, and drowneth our soules in the floud of errour. How manie (good Lord) haue I led by delaies? how many haue I fed with follye: our Uenetian Marchauntes, many woulde faine wedde mee, but some, though wealthye, I mislyked their imperfections: for my mothers iudgment alwaies made mee alow or mislyke, for I knew she spake by experience: some had personage and no wealth, whiche my Father could none off. At the last, one came which serued the turne, of great nobylytie, and singuler vertue, a renowmed Marchaunt, carefull and louyng: hym my Father did lyke off, and my selfe lykewise alowed off: there was cause why, to the pleasure of my flesh, and therfore fleshly reason wherfore: But as they were follies in my youth, Lorde I detest them in mine age, willyng that my priuate confession, and carnall pennaunce: and to conclude, my harty sorow, were layde open to my compeers, and fellow ladies in Venice , who for that there beautie now serueth them, are loth to bend them selues to religion, and forsake their secret and sinfull delights. True it is, with great solempnytie, I was maried to this riche Marchaunte Seginor Voltranio , with hym I lead, the space of three yeares, a chast and honest lyfe, concernyng the bondes of chast wedlocke, for my bodie, but for the corruption of my thoughtes, the Lord wype them out of his remembrance, for mee I haue forgotten them: But couetousnesse, the roote of all inconuenience, hauing gotten holde on my husbands hart, my friende and Lorde Voltranio , would needes to Sea, from strange countries, to bring home new gaine: at whose departure, Lord how I sighed in soule, when he had taken Ship, and had delyuered mee a gentle conge , I standynge on the shore, how carefully in outward show, did I alow of his vale , and inwardly, with how many curses, did I harrow the cause of his trauell: and whilst the ship was in sight, how berated I ye master? how exclaymed I on ye water? how ofte wished I, that to make my husbande keepe home? some violent storme might affright him from farther trafique. These and such like passions my yong head, by youthly yeares, and vnbrideled lust, mynistred mee: tyll beinge conueyed by my retinue to mine owne home, tyme eats out the cause of my sorrow, and I began to tak counsell, of the wedded Wiues of Venice , whose priuate causes I leaue to their personall confessions: whose pryuie counsailes, and disordered conuayaunces with yonge Ladies, since my selfe haue bene beaten, and it belongeth to my confession, to manyfest, though to my sorrowe you shall heare them. Our Citie heere you see, as it is furnished with stately buildings, riches in superfluitie, and no want of faire women, so it hath according to the abundaunce of wealthe, and beautie of women, store of wickednes and abhomynation, whiche woulde God (gostlye father) I had neuer knowne, since it was the firste displace of my vertuous lyfe: There are a sort of notable women, whose outward appearaunce show of deuotion, often visiting the temple, seeldome times without their heads in their handes, most conuersaunt amongst our brauest and most Honorable Ladies, and would perswade a simple mind, that all vertue, by reason of their age, and honestie in outward show, had abode in them: but when with aduised eye, we shall prie into their priuie practises, oh what horour? what confusion. These be they, that make housebirds flidge, and home huswieus harlots: they serue the brothel houses with plenty, and furnish the Court with cohortes of Curtizans: these make shamefast youth shamelesse, gallant beautie disdainfull, and vertuous myndes, vicious bodies, for they incorporat, the inwarde essence, with an vnknowne show of disordinate desire, making the vessels of God, no lesse then deuils incarnate, from the broode of Magera , from these weeping Crocodiles , from these disparagers of ladies honors, poore Lamia hath learnt cause of penance, which for feare of being tedious, I meane breefly to let you know it. Not wholy two monthes after my husbands departure, ye remembrance of his bad pleasure, wrought wunders in my heart, and a little tickleing desyre of this lothsome flesh, made me looke abroad, to see if I could lenify the greefe by open ayre, you know my mening, a priuate friend (for that losson was put in my hed, I beshrowe my scoole Mystresse for it that taught mee) in the streete (lyke a young wanton) I cast many pleasaunt regardes, offered many lyght lookes, both on whome I eyther alowed for personage, or perhaps imagined likely to pleasure me, and returning home, fed my fancy with a trust, knowing very assuredlye, that my beautie of necessitie, must proue a staal for some young Nouice: And as I thought, so it fortuned: for loue presented my shape to the view of a gallant yonge Gentilman, at that verie time, when little looking for such good bad luck: I aduanced my selfe to a window towarde the streete to beholde the passers by: The wounded louer with a sigh, as my thought breathed out the scalding fume of the burnynge flame of fyring loue, and the hoat bloude proceeded from the blemish of his woful wound in sundrie entercourses, flashed in his face, and had not his retinue remoued his extasy, by remembring him of the vnfytnesse of behauyour, you woulde haue imagined him some chaunged earthlye creature, turned to a stone, hauing beholde the head of Medusa . I seeing the conquest gotte, began to triumph, and to make my louer more amourous, in a sodayne forsoke my standing: and left him at his meditations, who wounderfullye wrounge, with his newe passions (as I afterwardes vnderstoode) beganne to bee verie pensiue, feedynge all his thoughtes on the remembraunce of mee his onelye beeloued, who GOD knowes, was as readye to lyke as hee was to loue, and as apte to receaue, as hee was wyllynge to proffer: Often times he passed by, where he fyrst sawe mee, in which place if I were, I eyther had a Cappe, and Courtly conge , a pearceing looke, or els a carefull sigh, wt a drowping countenaunce, to open the myrrour of his maladie, which I rewarded as I thought good, and as simple as it was, hee lyked it well: but had not God opened, nay, rather Sathan mynistred help, my youth had died for sorrow, and I had fayled of my purpose: the order was thus perfourmed: As our youth Proculus (for so my seacret pleasure was tearmed) was passionate vpon hys bed, recommending (with many sobbes) his seruice to my soueraigntie, sodainly, an olde Lady Laundresse, a french Macarella , with new starched bandes, offered her selfe to his presence, he rauished with contemplation of my beautie, she delighted to see his disordinate humor, and the rather for that she knew there needed no salue, where there was no sore, neither yet any phisick, where there was no maladie: how she dealt the Gods knowe, the olde and young were alone (as she tould mee) how they agreed the sequell wyll show. After many curtises, fine and staall incounters, the trueth that was presaged, was manyfest to my Monedula , not mine, but Cupids (for though her age serued her not, her wyll was good) and my hart was woon seely woman, as she made mee yeelde to that, which scarcelye my husband could mend, and by a subtil pleasure, bereft hym of his perfectio, & displaced my hope with miserable mistrust: but all was to an ende, Fortune was fauourable, loue fortunate, time conuenyent, my body willing, hymselfe louyng: then what wanted, O my sinne, thou wast youthly, therefore to bee remitted: O my soule thou art sorowfull, and therfore I hope excusable. How she delt with him, because shee made mee priuy to the discourse, for relygions sake (gostly Father) I trust you will affoord mee the hearing, first lyke the skylfull Phisition, the better to giue iudgement of the essentiall, materiall, and fynall cause of the feuer, she repeated (as the order is, that are bondslaues to scurility) many fayre damosels names, their houses, perhaps some conuenyences. The young Gentilman being galled (for Lamia was not out of the legende) began to winch, and shamfastnesse the vertue of youthe, blemyshed his pale with rednesse: which no sooner happened, but our Monedula conceiued, and being abundantly furnished with rethoricall perswasions, she greeted my youth in this sort. My good Maister, I am sorie to see you take care for that which is so easely get, and pine your selfe alwaye on your bed in malancolye, where it were more meeter, to ye attainmet of good fortune, & the inioying of your loue, you were well apparelled, and gallantlye beseeminge your estate on Horsback, praunsing with a Brauado , before the dore of your mysteris, and offering your seruice, with secret regardes, so you might recouer your flesh, and reuiue your weakened spryghtes, and set your vitall powres at their former perfection, by possessing of that, which easely you may attaine vnto. And I were a man as you are, a litle foolish loue should not keepe mee vnder, but I would haue some fetch to attaine my purpose. What say you Maister? why are you so dumbe, haue you no forcast? why, your Laundresse then wil teach you wit, you are in loue I know, is it not with Madame Lamia? He raysing himselfe vp softly with a bashfull face and a sigh fet from the bottom of his hart, aunswered, yes. And is it shee, (quod Monedula ) the Marchaunts Wyfe should not make mee a mecocke, I woulde trust to make hir stoupe haggard. Can you beleeue, that she being beautiful and yong, new maried, and nowe without a bedfelow, that shee could refuse so braue a Gentilman, so well proportioned, of so modest behauiour, and good parentage, no, no, they may simper it for a while, but they will bee plyable as wax: if the Sun take force, the warmed harte will melt: I speake by experience, and you shall fynde my wordes true at the last, misdeeme you neuer so much: And now giue eare a litle, and I wyll lay my lyfe by to morrow noone, your kerchiffe will off, and shall see you Ala flama , before your Misterisse on Sonday. Saist thou mee so (quod my Gentleman) good Monedula , then instruct mee, for without present remedie, my hart wyll breake for sorow. God forbid good Maister (quod shee) your Laundresse had rather be a folower to laugh at your pleasant conueiances, then to weare a mourning gowne at your burial, and put finger in eye to see your follye, and therefore harken. You shall to morrow gallantly apparelled resorte to her house and vse these or such lyke speaches: Madame Lamia , so it is, that my parentes hauinge dealinges in Fraunce at Rone , hath commended mee hither through your husbandes handes, whose billes of exchange I haue in readinesse, the sum of two thousande Crownes, to bee payde vpon sight, let mee therefore accordinge to the dyrection receiue the mony. The Ladie vnaquainted with such circumstaunces, as the guise is to incroche more fauour, wyll bid you to dinner: then haue you better leasure, to discourse at your pleasure: if this you doo, you may speede: arise therfore, maister arise, sharp your wits, I must haue you sipher with your misteris, you must cast of these dul dumpes, and put on an other more pleasaunt visage, your behauior must be frolyke, though your mind be passionate: what she sayeth, that confyrme you, what she mislyketh, that ban you, if shee offer you curtesie, accept it, if she geue you a scoffe, beare with it, the losse is not great where you gaine that you looke for: Maister, Maister, I am an olde dogge, and can byte sore, doo not skorne my instructions, though lyke a foolish Woman, I take vpon mee to set to Schoole a yonge and well learned man: To bee breefe (reuerent deuine) as I know by the sequell, my youth forsooke his bed, and acording to an apt and reddie Scholer, performed the president his Schoolemistris had set him: he came to my house, saluted mee modestly, vsed me reuerently if he kist mee, God forgiue me, my minde was he should haue come to a harde market, but womens harts are for the most part hindred with ouer weanings: what past betweene him and mee, because it was spoken pryuatly betweene two, I wil not open secretlye to you, for him let his deuotions molyfie his sins, for mee I repent my follies: for conclusion, though hee playd ye Orator in perswasions, yet I taught him a trick of legerdemaine , hee suspitiously departed, he sorrowfully bare his answer, and the forespoken debt, our named two thowsand crownes, would easely haue bine paide wt repentaunt pleasure, he wanted that hee looked for & but alas, the next time hee came, hee had that he sought for, how it befortuned, thou iust God, thou knowest, oh Gods, oh women, oh nature, oh men, I speake in siphers (worthie Hermit) sith deuines are good Arethmitricians. For where the contepaltion is setled, there the mesure is alwaies ministred, were it not that I should cofesse in deuotion, you should faile of a true confession, but for that I am sory, my hope is the greater, and in that you are secret, I am the more wyling, and would God it were manifest to the world, poore Lamia is so penitent, I knowe God is more mercyfull: And must I open the follye: you shall heare it, and would God al honest meanyng wiues might eschew it. Since my youthes purpose, fayled him at the fyrst, as a faynt Souldiour that giueth ouer at the fyrst incounter (as at the length I vnderstoode) hee returned home to hys bed (for night drewe on in deede, I deteined him all the day) and therefore his humour alowed him no sleepe, hee tooke his pen and inke and penned a Sonet, whiche was presented by a subtil Pandenna (sauinge the reuerence of you good Father) and tooke such place, to the vtter vndooyng of the poore Marchauntes wife, more wrong had Lamia , more pleasure the Gentilman, some gaine to Monedula : the Sonet, I haue heere in my poket, which your holyness shall see. Heere withall, she drewe out certaine verses, whiche were to this effect. In sorowing sence, for to salute my friend Yet if submission, may my faught excuse, I think him best that profereth to amend. ¶ If Loue commaund, who wyl not stoope to lure? My wounded hart, deserue to haue some rest Then since your yeelde, doth serue to worke the cure, Let no mistrust foyle him, who fancies best. ¶ If euerie thought, that wrings my hart with woe, If euerie sigh, that breedes my endlesse payne: Were laid in view, and you the same did know, I should not then, such hard misfortune gaine. ¶ My daseled eyes, made red by restles teares, My broken sleepes, my sad and mournfull cheare: My sodaine soundes, my hugie heapes of feares Would force your gentle hart, to haue some care. ¶ Beholde these lynes, how euerie word is maid, With ruthfull drops, from coundites of my vaines: See how your friend from pleasure is debard, And plungd in pit of euerlasting paines. ¶ Good Ladie, let no rigour make a breach, Betweene his soule, which liueth for your ioy Tis you may help, you only are the leach, To worke my weale, or mate mee with anoy. ¶ And if poore I, may finde such lucky fate, As dire disdaine, shall not vndo my trust: I hope by wit, to order so the state As both our deedes, shal stil continue iust. ¶ And let this serue, to make an end of all Your husband seekes for wealth in foraine soyle: And therefore since, at home his stock is small, Vouchsafe that it may grow by others toyle. ¶ Meane while, no day shall passe but I will waile, No night shall come, but teares shal red my eye Till she vouchsafe, to graunt for my availe, The only ioy, for which I liue and dye. These were the practises of Sathan, to circumuente me poore soule a weake vessell, these shares were laied for me this was the beginnyng of my sorowe, and the Thesis of my freendes vaine pleasure: but how this was deliuered, I praie good father giue eare. O Uenice a wonder it is, that the sea swalloweth thee not vp for thy synne, whiche retainest so many brothell houses, and wicked Baudes. Heare O faire damoselles, let Lamia her mischief be your president: For after that ouer youth by necessarie slepe (whiche began to occupie his sences for a while) had forsaken his penne and paper, and takyng leaue of his muse, till the nexte mornyng: Cruell Alecta , sent by implacable Cupede the sonne of amorous Uenus (I speake wordes now, whiche swerue from Religion godlie Heremite, but better were it to shadowe vice with a Cipher, then to laie it open to so modest eares) arested her self in the bosome of Monedula , and leauing there a sparkell of her firebrande, and an offal of her Snakie heare, inflamed her to the persecution of modestie and Matrimonie, and to the aduancement of abhomination and wickednesse, which was so naturally performed in our Laundresse, that the nexte mornyng hauyng the furie full of subtiltie aboute her, she visited verie early her yong maister, who when she founde in his old agonie, perplexed with many passions, and troubled by his harde repulse, whiche the daie before he receiued, conferryng with hym of all causes, after she vnderstoode his aunswere, and giuen aduised insight to all that had forepassed, she comforted our passionate Proculus in this sort. Since a mannes witte (good maister) is not able to compasse your purpose, you shall see what a woman can doe, for that I haue care of your welfare (good sir) I will not faile to straine curtesie with mistres Lamias staiednesse, and I will so Philosophically take my tyme, that she shall hardly refuse the force of my reasons: but can you Segnior Proculus might louyngly: What I can doe (saied he) you shall see my louyng Laundresse, and here withall he reade his nightes fansie vnto her: who likyng it verie well, made hym seale it up, then takyng it in her hande, she made hym couenaunt with the Sexten of saincte Maudelins Minster, to toule all that after noone for hym, as though he were departyng, admonishyng hym farther to putte finger in the eye, and to make semblaunce as he were deadly sicke for so small a season, to woorke hym self his wished healthe: whiche doen, she freendly tooke her leaue of the louer, and my freendly enemie accordyng to her derection performed all thinges. The Sexten is a toulyng, the gentilman is a so Sownyng, Monedula is a practisyng, Lamia poore soule thinkyng nothyng: the Laundresse had she not visited me, I had not yeelded, and had she not founde some Couler to make me credulous, it would hardly haue been brought to passe, that I should haue credited soo well. Monedula hath left home, and is quickly at my doore, where she behaued her self thus. As soone as she had knocked, she courteouslie demaunded for my housebande her nourse childe, how he did, what had befortuned hym, where he was: my seruaunt beyng thus gentilly required, aunswered as freendly, and certified of as muche as he knewe: When she harde he was in Fraunce, Lorde how she tooke on what shewes she made of sorrowe, whiche my poore Prentise perceiuyng, (as a kinde harted young fellowe) came in and tolde me: I vnderstandyng by hym of her sorowe, and earnest good will she bare to my dearely beloued housebande and freendly Voltranio , called her in, made muche of her, questioned with her of many thynges, to the whiche she so honestly aunswered in appearaunce, as I rather imagined, she had been some deuoute Abesse , then a wicked and counterfeite woman: But now I see, the Deuill can put on the habite of an Aungell of light, and deceiue poore women as I am, for I simplie thinkyng it gold that did glitter, made verie muche of mother Monedula , and after I had victualled her well, I caried her into my garden, where pretendyng to haue passed awaie the tyme, discoursyng of many matters: it fortuned that the belle that touled, penetrated my harte with zealous deuotion, and although I knewe not for whom it went, yet I wished saluation, if there were no remedie, or els present health, if it were the Lordes pleasure, to which she replied thus: truely Madame Lamia , I am afraied it will fall out to my sorowe, for I haue a proper yong gentilman to my Maister, of the age of 25. of gallaunte proportion, a sweete face, good behauiour, whiche for these seuen daies hath been sicke, in the Parishe of Sainct Maudelines Minster, and as his freendes thinke, and the Phisitions imagine he is in Loue, a pitifull case, and I am afraied this Bell is for hym: I desirous and inquisitiue for him that should bee thus at the extreamitie of death, for light loue, was aunswered subtilly by her thus. Truly Mistres, because we are talkyng of this matter, I will tell you (to my greef) what befortuned my daughter in this Citie, my heire and onely comfort: when she was at yeres of discretion, Loue besotted her, with the comely shape of a yong gentilman, who with foule disdaine requited her, so that for meare and pure Loue, my daughter died: afterward, the bloudde of my daughter criyng vengeaunce of his crueltie, it fortuned hym to Loue an other Ladie so extreamely, that as he was repulsed by the iuste Iudgement of God, he went and hanged hymself in the Suburbes of the same Citie. And truely Mistres, I haue liued, in comparison of long life, but an ynche (yet I am fower score) and I haue in my tyme, seene many, bothe men and women, whiche haue perished for the same follie. But pardon me Mistres, for I see I haue farre degressed from your demaunde, whiche I beseche you to accompte, to the slendernesse of myne olde braine, rather then to the vnwillyngnesse of my mynde. The gentilman that I suppose is departyng, is called Signior Proculus , a gallaunte youthe, whom I haue knowne long, would I were the woman in my youthe, and to his likyng, that might saue his life in this extreamitie, who with a little pleasaunte escape, might pleasure the noblest gentilman of all Italie, yea, and in my conscience, is yet the purest Uirgine of the worlde: Oh how it greeues me for his sake, my mynde truely misgiues me that it is he, Alas good Proculus , with that the olde woman and deceiptfull messenger, began to weepe, whiche I greatly pitiyng, and as partly my yeeldyng had perswaded me, beeyng loathe a gentilman should dye for my cause, I aunswered Monedula thus. Truely mother, if I thought the gentilman were at suche extreamitie, as you tell me he is, and that his Loue bee so affectionate, if Proculus bee the man, I dare vndertake to perswade his Mistres. But men (for the moste parte) are so subtill, that he whiche speaketh fairest, performeth foulest. O Mistres ([quoth] the old Mother) doe you thinke I would fitten to my Nursechildes sweete wife: No, no, I knowe, I knowe it is Proculus certainlye, and dare sweare he loueth faithfullie, and for more assuraunce that you shall see his constancie, Loe here the letters, that subtilly I conueied from hym yesternight, he vnwittyng the same, whiche I the rather did, that meetyng with some that could reade, I might finde out the name of his beloued, and by that meanes indeuour to perswade her to compassion: And if you can read (good Mistres) we here the stolne goodes, whiche to content an old womans fancie, I praie you ouer looke. I (ghostlie father) little suspectyng this policie, tooke the letters, and as you sawe euen now, thei were derected to me, whiche I perceiuyng beeyng ouercome with the passion, softly with bashefull face, saied to Monedula , mother, mother you were sent, and you are welcome. And if Proculus will sweare, to haue regarde of myne honour, as he promiseth by these letters, if he will come to morowe night about eight of the clock, he shall not finde me so vngratfull as he takes me for: A gentilman (through my default) shall not miscarie for loue, which maie be fulfilled without discredite. But you Monedula , must woorke all for our safetie, and for feare the gentilman should miscarie before you come, hye you to hym, and takyng a gem from my finger, I willed her recommende me to her Maister and rewardyng her with a fewe crounes. Mistres Panderina tooke her leaue (God forgiue her for so deceiuyng me) and findyng her Maister longyng for her commyng: She recounted vnto hym all the storie, how cunnyngly she had wrought me, and how mercifull she had founde me, then deliueryng hym my Iewell, whiche he receiued with humble reuerence, and thankyng Monedula hartely, he rewarded her with a hundred Ducates: But when he vnderstoode by her, how happie an hower was appoincted. Lorde, how soone was he apparreled? How readie were his feete to daunce out of measure? How pleasaunte a conflicte was then in his mynde, how victoriously did hope triumphe? How dastardly fled dispaire, all care was ceased, and pleasure aduanced, no more sadde, but excedyng pleasaunte. Thus as Proculus lusted, so I longed, and like a brute beaste I listened to the horne of the Hunter: but to conclude to bothe our desires, the hower long looked for was at hande. Monedula , armed her Champion, and brought hym to the place of combate, where valiauntly he should enter the listes: She furnished hym with perswasions, and for that I muste confesse at our seconde meetyng, he found hymself more pleased, then with his former greetyng, what simple cheare I had prepared thei had it willyngly? what speeches wee had at supper tyme? what discourses passed the rest of the euenyng? how cunnyngly our Mistres Monedula handeled vs twoo yonge ones, I will (holie Heremite) that you should thinke, for the former discourse will open all. But to bee breef, bedde tyme came, the old woman would sleepe, the gentilman was amorous, my self willyng, Monedula is gone home, my seruauntes gone to sleepe, and Proculus and I, were at our Mooneshine (naie, rather mornefull) banquet, where seruyng the appetite of our vile fleshe, we ministred discomfort to our soules. I am sorie for thee my Voltranio I am sorie for thee, wee twoo had the pleasure, thou the wrong, we twoo were recreated in filthie delight, thou dispossessed of thy name thou haddest before, hauyng that added to thee, whiche inuisibly seen, doeth breede a visible scarre, and an enuious remembraunce, if happily weetyng followe. I must confesse (ghostly father) I haue synned, and with the Prodigall childe will offer submission, I was to profuse of myne honour, and the freende that enioyed me, to profounde to be misliked of: synne ledde vs both by Nature, and the seruaunt of luste ruled the rest: now can you think that twoo innocentes could otherwise doe, beeyng so wickedly intised. The Lorde forgiue her, I doe, for by Gods lawe I thinke (good Heremite) we ought to forgiue one an other. But in sooth Porculus and I were bothe agreed, and loath to departe when we were once met. Oh how many lewde pleasaunt nightes ledd we after this: how couertly towardes the worlde, did we dissemble all thynges. Trewe it is, Porculus was a good Woer, and Lawyer bothe, he knewe the Cannon, Si non caste tamen caute , but so it was, that God displeasaunt that our soules should perishe, and willyng that my Houseband should not be worne out with ouer filthie abuses, caused the traffique of Voltrauio to cease, and furnished him to his contentment home towards Venice : the Winde was faire, the Sailes full, the Mariners longed for home, my Housebande forgot not me, thei sailed long, and ariued late. When the Sunne had forsaken the Heauens, and buryed her self in the Occean , my Housebande tooke Shore, our Mariners went to salute their Wiues, the Marchauntes vnmaried went to their beddes, my Voltrauio wearie of his toyle, hyed him home, and opening the doore to shew the good will he bare me (for Marchaunt men carrie priuie keyes with them at all tymes of night to open their doores) he came derectly to my Chamber, where findyng two bodies in one bed, my Houseband grewe into gelousie, and for that he was without light to make euident shewe of my folly, he raysed vp my maide Claudia , who loath to see hym there to her Mistreis shame, tolde hym that it was not to be doubted, but that her Mistris (naie rather viciouse woman she might haue saide) was faithful, wherefore she counsailed hym, presently to sende for some holie Frier, who beyng sent in to confesse them, if it were founde as he suspected, he vppon his owne authoritie grounded aswell on Moyses lawe, as otherwise of the custome of the Citie, might put them both to death with his owne handes, and reuenge the wrong whiche her vniust Mistris had proffered. These and such like perswasions craftely laied open to my Housebande, somewhat pacified his furie, and aleied the vehemencie of his cholore, wherupon he sent her (before any candle was lighted) to fetche a Frier, who vppon their confessions might manifest to hym the truth, and afterwardes accordyng to the heynousnesse of the faught, he might deale his due correction amongst vs. But we two simple soules slept soundly, we imagined nothing, but after our vngodly exercise fell arme in arme into a sweete sleepe. The Maiden myndyng in what she might to saue my credite, resorted vnto her for a salue, that had first made the sore: our Mother Laundresse olde Monedula , to whom when she had recompted the whole lamentable discourse of my Housebandes quicke returne, the agonie she left hym in, and the necessitie of helpe, then certifiyng her farther howe she was sent for a Frier, for that her Maister would putte her Mistris to Shrifte, before he destroyed her bodie, yet to the sauegarde of her soule. She like a cunnyng worke woman, practised in like extreamities, apparrelled her self, and resortyng to one Longotius , a Frier Fransciscan , of whom she borowed his Habite, and attyryng her self with the same, with my Maide Claudia , she entered my house, and with a gentle Benedicitie , saluted my Housebande, and crossyng hym somewhat to molefie his cholore, she demauded like a cunnyng she Frier, the cause why at midnight he stoode so in neede of Religious helpe. My Housebande in hye tearmes, greate threatnynges, and loftie speeches, tolde of my incostancie, disloyaltie, breache of Wedlocke, what defamation was like to grow to his stock, in matching hym self with a Harlot, what sorrowe his frendes would take to vnderstande of my lewdnesse, what exceedyng care he had for me in forrayne sayle, and how vngratiously I requited his faithe and fixed loyaltie. In briefe, he made our Frier priuie to his whole mynde, desiryng hym to enter the Chamber, and to take bothe our confessions in as certaine order as might be: in the meane tyme, he betooke hym self to his accustomed walke, whereby to disgest his choler. Monedula laughyng in her sleeue, at the successe whiche was like to followe, seemyng to satisfie his request, came to my Chamber, beeyng derected by my Maide Claudia , and entryng the doore, she fastened the inwarde bolte, then drawyng neare our beddes side, where she founde vs fast a sleepe, she wakened vs bothe, who astonyed at suche a sight, began miserably to lament, suspectyng muche, that a Frier should salute vs so late: she seeyng it tyme to comfort vs, softly wringyng vs bothe by the handes, commaunded vs to silence, and in this sorte spake vnto vs. My Maister and Mistris be of good cheare, it is a she Frier that meaneth to salue a sore, whiche if it were not wisely looked vnto, I feare me it would goe harde with you. In euill tyme sweete Ladie, your Housebande is returned home, and myndyng pleasauntly to bedde with you by darke, he hard the breathyng of two bodies, and in a rage sent for a Frier to giue you Shrifte, after intendyng to woorke a reuenge, your wife Maide Claudia hath salued vp all, for commyng to me, and making me priuie of the hard fortune that had befalne you, and the message where aboutes she was sent, I borowed this Habite as you see, and am sent in by your Housebande to giue you Shrift. We two Louers hearyng of this heauie happe, wonderfully amased with this sodaine returne, and incredidbly tormented with feare of death, yet somewhat comforted with Monedulas wordes, besought our Mother of some good instructions, promising her, that if she salued this sore, she should haue the paie of two Phisitions. She louyng money, and hearyng so faire a promise, comforted vs thus. Maister ([quoth] she) can not you plaie the Frier, necessitie is a good Schoolemistris, arise therefore and roabe you in my Friers apparrell, and you shall see mee quickly become bed-fellowe to a fayre Ladie, you vnderstand by a scipher my meanyng, and I dare not be tedious least Voltranio be suspicouse, arise Maister and apparrell you, and then learne you this lesson, when you shall goe out to the Marchaunt, you shall chide extreamely, tellyng hym the wickednesse that Ielousie still worketh, and bring him into the Chamber where he shal finde vs two a bed, and seyng me to be his Nurse, I will saie came hether late yesternight for the loue of hym, and was deteyned by his wife this night for her bedfellowe, if you followe this course, no doubt but all will be well: dispatch therefore, for now must I to bed. Thus (gostly father) the matter was concluded, my frend readie apparrelled, a Gentleman in a Friers Weede, Monedula and I together in bedd, all thinges wisely handled, Proculus now tooke his leaue of his Lamia , and vnbolted the dore to goe perswade with angrie Voltranio , who no sooner harde the doore open, but with hastie pase came to meete the Frier, (in deede his very foe) and earnestly demaunded of hym the veritie of the matter, who in this sorte, and with this course of speeche (as I afterwardes learned) deluded my Housebande, yet disburdined hym of his Ielousie. Oh Signior Voltranio , amongst all euiles the greatest and moste pernicious errour, Iealousie yet exceedeth, whiche not onely altereth nature, but also is cause of muche horrour and confusion, I maruaile that you a Gentleman of good birthe, and a man of aproued wisedome, will so vnwisely suspect, and so wilfully pretende the murtheryng of a vertuouse Ladie, and as faithfull a wife as any liueth in this Citie, naie in my conscience in the whole worlde. Truely Gentleman, you haue greuously offended, who after your long absence, in steede of freendly greetyng, haue made your wife grow in teares, and perhappes through your wicked Ielousie, couceiue suche a hart sore, as will bryng her yong and tender body quickly to her graue. Surely it greueth me to see howe heauely she taketh your suspition, and had it not been for me, and that good olde woman her bedfellow, and your Nurse, I am afraied she would haue proffered herself some desperate vyolence for very griefe. Come in quickly sir, and with calmer wordes helpe to content her, whom vnkindly you haue displeased, cause Candles to be lighted, that you maie got and comfort her, I am sorrie that our Venetians should be made priuie to your folly. Voltranio hearyng thse wordes, my poore and pittifull Houseband, thinkyng our dissemblyng Friers speeches an Oracle, with greate and grieuous lamentations, and with many and crewell blowes be battered his face, and had not Proculus helde hym he had slaine hym self. The Candles beyng light, he came into me on his knees, he humbly craued pardon, and with many sweete kisses began to comfort me, who craftely counterfeited, and made my good freende a Mecocke. Oh how I exclaimed on his inconstancie where I onely was lewde: to conclude, our Frier made the atonement, for he had taken the possession before from the right heyer. My Monedula was welcomed ten thousande tymes, I recomforted, she with crownes departed home, and our Frier had a rewarde for his paines giuen hym by my Housebande, Voltranio became no more suspitious, and for my self euer after that (vnlesse it were two or three escapes) I was faithfull and louyng. Loe here the true and certaine information of my lewde life, loe here the anotomie of a cunnyng dissembler, loe here how youth is subiect to errour, and is wonne with euery light blast of reporte. I am sorie Lorde in that I haue sinned, I repent me in that I haue doen vniustly, and in deuotion I promise I will amende it. O good GOD, see the vanities of these daies, women that are the weaker vesselles, are the instructers of men, and as thei were the first cause of sinne in Paradice, so faile thei not to falsifie in this wretched Worlde: All estates runne at randome, Religio couereth some misdeedes, although thei cloake it with misbeamyng. What honest Frier would haue lent his Coule to couer a sinne more then damnable, nay what man of vertue would be thought to be aquainted with our night birde Monedula . These my errours perhappes are straunge to you (holy Hermite) whiche haue abandoned your self from the Citie to followe solitarinesse: But truely as thei passe from me with contrition, so I beseeche the almightie to let them passe with remission. To conclude, I see our Romishe Clargie can sowe Rye, and plaine meanyng men must bee contented to reape it: for craft now adaies is the simple mans aquitaunce. O happie Venice , when the women onely delighted in their Beades and Mariage bed: O vnhappie Venice , when a wicked womans perswasion, can wrest in twaine the bondes of blessed wedlocke. But I haue been tedious (ghostly father) I will therefore cease to be iniurious, most earnestly beseechyng you, to whose aduised in sight, my hartie sorrowe is laied open vnto, graunt me your praier for my consolation, and to rewarde my confession, with freendly and fauourable absolution. Simonides , our amorous Hermite, hauyng ouer harde, and attentiuely vnderstoode the whole discourse of Ladie Lamias penitent life, and considering the reasonable request with euery other light regarde, that furnished fewell to his burning fancie, as one somewhat Religious, yet altogether amorous, he adressed hymself in comforte, and to absolue the Ladie in this sorte. Madame, by your discourse, I bothe vnderstande your birthe and name, the familie that you came of, and the reporte that the world alloweth you. And it had been better (I thinke) you had been basely borne, beeyng trained vp in vertue, then richely brought vp, to followe laciuious life: Truely continencie, ought to bee the ensigne of an honourable Ladie, whiche alwaies she ought to aduaunce, against all the incounters of yong wilde headed Venetians : It had been more better you had been vnborne, then vntaught. Dooe parentes thinke, that when their daughters are moste Musicall, thei are beste manered? or when she hath her Sinquipace by measure, she will conteine her self in mediocrite? No, no, the daies fall out more contrarie, she is beste brought vp, that is taught to contemne her beautie. In steede of garishe garmentes, seemely vestimentes, in place of amorous Sonettes, deuoute Orisons, would bothe make a coole bodie, and a comfortable soule. God gaue beautie, the Deuill Pride, these garded gounes, these silken raimentes, these curled heare, these infinite gaudes practised by women, are firste deriued from the Deuill, who outwardly woorketh the bodie, to the inwarde desolution of the soule. Beautie sheweth her self, not in royaltie of raiment, but in loyaltie of Wedlocke: Better were it that the backe were bare, then the soule deuilishe, if thyne eye displease thee plucke it out, and caste it from thee: It were better to enioye heauen maimed, then possesse Hell bodie whole. I haue recounted all this Ladie Lamia , to lette you vnderstande, the firste fruites of your springyng errour, whereby you maie loathe the effectes, since the beginnynges were so daungerous. I am sorie to heare that this renoumed Citie, the spectacle of the worlde, should bee blemished with so detestable a vice, gentilmen Venetians hauyng so many brothell houses, might leaue the chaste and noble wedded wiues, to the proper vse of their housebandes. But good Lorde, how farre haue you erred, displacyng your self of heauenly Paradice, to feede on yearthly and transitorie pleasure: Adultrie, thou arte a heauie synne, and hardly maistered: Woman than art a weake vessell and quickly wonne, but woe to hym by whom the offence commeth, yet comfort your self Madame, in the penitent harte you beare, for it is partaker of remission. Giue almes, for thei shall not hinder you: And for that you are to bee absolued, and accordyng to the Rites of the Church, to be disburdened from the burden that indamnifeth you, drawe you neere vnto me. Gentilmen and Ladies, I haue waded thus farre, to open a confession, because it was made open vnto me, but for the order of Penaunce, or the wauer of absolution: I neither can perfectly declare it, because he couertly performed it, and in veritie, the necessitie is not greate, the matter in truthe is so religious: but I must tell you, it was shortly fulfilled, and our Heremite was inuited to our Ladie Lamias house, where beeyng royally entertained for the space of sixe daies, and hearyng of certaine Merchaunte straungers that were trauelyng towardes Genoa , desirous to see the Citie, and to vnderstande if the riches thereof were auswerable to the report: After gentle and courteous leaue taken of the penitent Lady Lamia , he imbarked with the Merchauntes: the winde for sixe howers serued well, and the Sonne comforted them verie muche, till sodainly a Northeast winde, with boisterous blastes troubled the Skie with darcksome cloudes, and by violent power opened the water gappes of Neptune : The poore Sailers and Merchauntes wonderfully affreited with this terrible tempest, plied the Pompe, belaied their tackelyng, the Maister diligently conducted by the Helme. Our Simonides , with the reste of the passengers, vehemently intended their praiers, but the angrie and louryng heauens, the straunge and hugie billowes, the poore brused and leakyng Barke, put them all out of hope, warnyng them, that their onely refuge was, to arme the selues for God, for their bodies were alotted to the Sea. Simonides emongest these, beeyng demaunded of consolation of many, was holie comfortlesse, and dismaied hym self, and seeyng no remedie, whereby he might be releeued of, with wofull, and lamentable voice, he petiouslie complained hym in these verses thus followyng. For faithfull Loue, shall I from life and Ladie be debarde O thou that rules, the ragyng Sea with thy iii. forked mace If euer thou the Troyan Fleete, didst helpe in heauie case If poore Iulus, by thy meanes enioyed Latine lande, Let poore afflicted passengers, finde fauour at thy hande: Reuenge the wrong, that Eolus, hath doen within thy raine, Alaie the Seas, shut vp the floudes, and graunt vs calme againe. O let not furie, fret thy face, gainst them that honour thee, Thy aulters shall not faile of fume, so thou wilt succour me: Alas I see Neptunus failes, I deeme no God he is, Then welcome depth, yet heauenly power, vouchsafe to mede our misse, Thou Primus motor who directes, the Sphers of Planets seuen: Preserue poore Seawracte men fro woe, sende doune thine aide fro heauen, No help o God? no graunt o floud? then my Clarinda loe, My partyng ghost, I sende to thee, my corps to floud must goe. At these laste wordes, the furie of the tempest strake the Ship vpon a Rocke, with so greate violence, that it brake all to shiuers, at whiche tyme, Lorde what a wofull crie there was? how many salutations of newe wedded men? how many farewelles eche to other? Onely our Simonides , by good lucke, castyng hym self on a planke, was saued: the reste pitifully perished, and not without the greate prouidence of the highest surely, for no sooner was the Barke broken, and the passengers drowned, but streight waies the furie of the storme ceased, and by the violence of the waues, our Seawracte Heremite was driuen a Shore, where settelyng hymself on his knees with greate deuotion, he yeelded his moste duetifull and abundant thankes, to the almightie, besechyng hym to pardon his error and follie, in that he had not sought vnto hym in his trouble, but craued the helpe of prophane and no Goddes. This doen, for that he was very hungrie, he began to prie about hym, if possibly he could espie any place where he might finde sustenaunce to slake his hunger, and of fewell to drye his wet cloathyng: but alas to his more sorrowe, he founde hym self to be in a wilde deserte inuyroned with high Mountaines, and onely inhabited with brute and sauage beastes, wherewith at the first though he were somewhat amased, yet he comforted hym self with the remembraunce of his late good lucke, and hauing gathered sufficiet fewell, he strake fire with Flints that he founde in the Mountaine, whereby when he had well warmed hym self, and dryed his cloathes, he began to looke out to see what fruites the Forrest might yeelde, but his best cheare I thinke was Rootes: where with hauyng well vituled hym self, he fortuned to finde some fewe clusters of wilde Grapes, which squeesing in his hande, he made a cuppe of delicate Wine, wherewith he satisfied the vehemencie of his thirst. Thus well vituled and warmed, he left the Sea shore, makyng a vowe, that as long as feete and land would serue hym, the Sea should not be troubled by hym: remembyng now that whiche Cato accompted for an errour, how greate folly it was to goe by water in daunger, when the lande serued without perrill, and very willyng to vnderstande in what coast he was landed in, he betooke hym self to seeke out some secrete pathe, whereby to finde a waie out of the Forrest: long he trauelled, for it was necessarie, the Forrest and desert was huge, for the space of seuen daies he had no sight of any euident path, but the tract of wilde Beastes, the eight daie, he fortuned to lighten a by path, which as farre as he had any kenning, was a hie waie in appearaunce to some Uillage or Castle, whiche somewhat reuiued hym, and with a more willyng mynde he bettered his pace: and hauyng followed on for the space of two Leagues, it grewe towardes night, and the Sunne betakyng her self to her shroude, he likewise nestled him self in a queachie Thicket, wherefor that night he intended to rest, he had not sate there long, but he espied a faire Ladie of incomperable beautie, with her heyre shadowyng her shoulders, aparrelled in a Peticoate of greene, her head crowned with Bay, a Quiuer at her back, and Bowe in her hande, passyng by hym: whereupon he wonderfully amased, and thinkyng her bee some Nymphe of the trayne of Diana , readie to attende vpon her Mistris, he softly pace by pace followed her, and at last it so befortuned, that she ariued at a Caue of wonderfull and surpassing singularitie: for that Nature had framed out of a Rocke a notable and exquisit peece of worke, and as it seemed in dispight of Arte. The enteraunce by Naturall instruction, was portratured the Storie of Arachne and Diana , the perfectnesse of the mortall work and proportions of the heauenly Fabrycature: the supporters of these were twoo Marble Pillers, where on the right Arche was naturally as superiour in Allablaster, disciphered the amorous Demophon , on the left side in Christall, delicate and vertuouse Philis . When he had entered (for this Nymphe was his conducter) Lorde how his senses were rauished, how farre was he from mortall contemplation: For first, the Maiestie of the woman, whom he sawe face to face, the miserie of the persone whom he sawe distressed, and the varietie of conceiptes, whiche the place did minister, made hym mery and Malancholy, suspicious and superstitious, he wondered at the one, and feared the other, the Pament was Cristiline, whereon was portratured the wofull passions of Phices , and the crewell meanaces of Iuno , the rare familiarities of Marce and Venus , the common and incommodus pleasures of the Goddesse, the angrie Iuno with her seruaunt Argos , the subtill Mercurie with his Oten Pipe, the faire Io in a disguised shape, the fliyng Daphne in the figure of a Laurel, the wise Apollo pursuyng Cassandria , the Troyan Prophetior refusing his proffer. I can not name all, therefore pardon me if I forget some: The walles were hanged with Tapestrie furnished with orient colours, throughly beautified with Pearle and Stone, wherein was worthely wrought the triumphes of Cupide , with the hole Captaines and seruitours of his retinewe, Suspition Admirall: Iealousie Captaine generall: Lookes Cannon shot: Desire , Maister Gunner: the principall Soldiours, foolishe Louers : (who for their valoure in somethyng, I will beare withall in this one thing) the Rascall route were Pillers for daies: yet those because thei were mercinary, might be discharged with the Captaines pasporte: for the rest, I will leaue it out, least some one should accuse me of errour: for I speake by first sight, and in troth, the principal Officers of euery Legion were Englishe Gentlemen, if thei serue well, God sende them honour for me, the fielde is so perrilous that I dare not enter. You haue heard the true discription of this wonderfull Paradise, now I will make you priuie to the rest that happened in the sight of Simonides . He hauyng entered with the Ladie, and seene all that I haue made you priuie to, fearyng least he should haue been espied, he secretly conueied hym self into a corner of the Caue, where sencibly he sawe this performed as followeth. This faire and deuine Nymph, beyng settled on a seate of Marble, reached from a hooke of golde that was fast to the wall, a Harpe of singuler workemanship, stringed with golde and siluer wyre, whereunto she sweetely tunyng and temperyng her voyce, she Nityngale like deliuered this dittie. And skorne his powre, who rules the Prince of Skye; Lo how my Paphos Queene, for your dispight, Hath forst her skornefull foe to liue and dye. Who for that he, did beauties grace denye. Is wrong with loue, and counterfoylde with hate, And craues for mercie, in this cell to late. Doe vayle your bonettes, you of mightie poure, Loue will beare swaie, it bootes not to resist: If Cupid once, be forced for to loure, From anger Venus, scarsly can desist. If winged Boye take once his Bowe in fist, Although he blindfolde shootes, and aymes by darcke: It daily proues, he neuer failes the marke. Morne wofull wretche, the Gods will haue it so, Weepe Titerus, yet mercie getst thou none: I here am sent, to yeeld thee store of woe, Yet not by loue, for to abate thy more. And tho thou wouldst, thy life from corps were gone: It maie not be, thou euery daie must dy, And loue for hate, and knowe no reason why. While these, and suche like cruell domes were vttered, in the presence of the amorous Sheperde, and comely Titerus , Lorde how the teares distilled from his bloubered eyes, how wofullie wrong he his handes, with how many faire & submissiue speeches, assaied he to mitigate, the furie of his harde Fortune, but all in vaine, for no sooner has the Ladie finished her noates, but with amorous offers she greeted hym, and when he thought hym self moste nearest of his greatest delight, the Ladie sodainly fledde from hym, and his power (by the dome of the Goddes) so weakened, that he was not able to followe her. Thus twoo howers and more, poore Sheperde Titerus was tormented, and Simonides beyng the beholder of this incredible crueltie, could not but shedde teares, my self that sette it doune, can hardely forbeare the sorrowe. But to conclude, the Ladie at laste with an amorous and coye regard, tooke her leaue of her louer, and in this sort she scorned hym. Now faire Pigesnie, and Sheperdly saincte, what thinke you now of Loue, Daphne could not please you, Venus was no Goddes, Cupid in your mouthe was a blinde Boye, how proues it now scornefull paciente, your Phisition you should haue. Now makes you sicke: make muche of this Euensong, your morowe Masse, shall pinche you worse. Whiche saied, as swifte as the winde the Nimphe departed: After whom with many exclamations, whe our Titerus had indeuoured for merrie, and seeyng no hope of helpe, but that his fortune was still to bee thus tormented. He beganne to raise hym self, for that Night had ouershadowed the yearth, he nesteled hym self to bedwarde, whiche was wonderfull riche and stately, and as it might bee imagined, the gifte of some amorous Fairie, to our poore destressed Titerus . Simonides , who all this while had rested hym self in a secrete corner, where he sawe all that had befortuned, seeyng the conuenience of the tyme, raised hym self, and began to drawe neare Titerus , who seyng suche vnacquainted companie, began sodainly to meruell, and beyng in his mase stoode stone still, his oriente couler flourishyng in his face, whiche argued the timeritie of his minde, whiche beeyng perceiued by Simonides , he drewe neare vnto hym, and with these and the like tearmes, he began to salute hym. Lette it not seeme straunge (my freende) tho companie befortune you at this tyme, for truely (in myne opinion) your disease, requires no solitarinesse, and it maie so fall out, that my presence maie pleasure you, and by that shall folowe, my companie maie woorke you some auaile. I haue seene (not without greate admiration) a sodaine appearaunce of a Ladie, though of beautie surpassyng, yet of crueltie exceadyng, I haue heard her syng sweetely touching the note, but too tyrannouslie consideryng the dittie, I haue behelde her amorous proffers, and haue partly conceiued your vnable performaunce I haue seen how hardly Fortune hath dealt with you, and the rather for that you haue expressed your sorrowes, with the abundaunce of teares, but what euent will folowe, or what hath paste before, I am bothe ignoraunte, and earnest to knowe. Now if it shall please you to caste of your domppes, and to put on the paterne and habite of a reasonable manne, I praie you make me priuie to the whole discourse, and that I maie the soner prouide a remedie for your sorrowe. The poore Titerus vnacquainted of suche comfort, and not vsed to suche kinde and familiare gratulation, beeyng wrong with his daie sorrowe, was desirous of his nightes slepe, therfore with a drousie eye and heauie countenaunce, he aunswered Simonides in this sorte. Signior , as trauellers that hath past a long and wearisome iourney desire reste, so I that haue been incombered with many calamities, and haue tasted of the sower wigge of mournefull miserie, and desirous (as some allaie to my sorrowe) a sillie nightes sleape, whiche Nature hath lente me, like a good mother, to mitigate parte of my sorrow: And although youre credible informatio perswades me, that you haue been an eye witnesse of my purgatorie, yet for that my case is suche, that heauinesse maistereth my wittes, I beseche you to diferre the discourse till to morowe mornyng, at whiche tyme after my morowe trouble, you shall vnderstande the cause of my wofull misfortune, and in the meane tyme, if it like you to bee a Sheperdes bedfellowe, I will not faile to giue you the beste entertainement I maie. Simodides thanked hym hartely, and beyng as willyng as he to yeeld Nature her due, he became bedfellowe to Titerus for that night, where he rested hym self to his contentation, our Heremite sleapt soundly, how the afflicted pacient passe the night, I referre me to those that are in dread of a morowe daunger. The messenger of the Sunne, had not eight howers shrouded her self, but sodainly gaue token of Phebus succeding glory, at whiche tyme our Titerus apparelled hym self, and takyng Shepehooke, Tarre boxe, and other Sheperdly instrumentes, he softly departed his Caban, leauyng Simonides fast a sleape, who raised at length by the roiall beames that the Sunne had reflected, on the pament of the princely fabricature, sorrowfull for the sodaine departure of his bedfellowe, quickly apparelled hym self, and with speedie pace commended hym self to the queste of the Sheperd, long he sought, till at length he founde Titerus , who was trauailed so farre to auoide the companie of Simonides , but good lucke was at that verie tyme, the Sheparde was tunyng his Instrumente, to make sute to the angrie Goddes. Our Heremite by the record drewe neare, and couertly coueryng hym self into the corner of a quicke sette Hedge, against whiche Titerus was leanyng his backe, beholdyng his Hearde, and lamentyng his misfortune, he heard hym wofully to his Harpe syng this sorowfull Sonet. With warblyng noates, to waile your stoupyng state; Ye pensiue prisoners, plunged all in paine. Bereft of reste, and foilde with heauie fate, Helpe hym to mourne, that mourneth all to late. A sillie Sheperd, wrong with deadly Ire, Of Paphos Queene, the mother of desire. Once beautie braue, once coye and seemely face, Midst many Sheaperdes, made me beare the name, The water Nymphes, for all their stately grace: Were forst to Loue, by lookyng on the same, But proude contempt, did set me out to frame. I scornde to Loue, faire Daphne Ladie bright, Whiche forst faire Venus worke me this dispight. If auncient myrrores, might haue serude my turne, Narcissus facte, might well haue warned me, He scorned faire Eccho, who for Loue did burne; And died for lacke, of that whiche seemde to bee. Thus good and badde, doeth alter eche degree. And sodaine honour, makes some rise alofte, Whose sodaine fall, hath been derided ofte. O you whom Nature, hath adorned well, With beauties blase, with faire and cristall eyes, Let no disdaine, amidst your iudgement dwell: Least you bee wrong, with like calamities, Through straunge contempt, greate plagues doe often rise. Where he that yeeldes, to mercie of his foe, For greate or little, raunsome home maie goe. O me vile wretche, how many heapes of cares, How many Occeans, of vnwildie woe, How many wronges, how ofte and subtill feares: Ouerwhelme my harte, that I my self maie knowe, O Loue would God, these wronges might part me fro. O Daphne would, thou wert betweene myne armes, For whose sweete sake, I suffer all these harmes. But thou O Queene, oh Cupids mother deare, Beholde my plaintes, loe my submissiue hart: O mightie Goddes, whom my soule doth feare, Graunt mercie now, the Sheapheard will conuert. And Daphne fayre, shall haue her due desert: And I a slaue, will at thine Aulter stande, And make thy shrine, more famous in the lande. And Titerus, with all his fielde compheares, With oten Pipes, and with their best repast: Will praise thy name, this daie and many yeares, Since thou vouchsaftes, some mercie at the last. But if the fatall dome, be readie past: O praie thy Vultane, he will ease the harme, And take to Ætna, this my flamyng warme. My little flocke, whom I haue loued long, Farewell adewe, your Sheapheard must awaie: Be witnesse yet, of this my mournefull song; And I will chaunge, your feede to morowe daie, Good louyng sheepe, see you runne not astraie, O Pan thou ruler, of the Sheapheards trade: Preserue my flocke, least Wolues doe them inuade. My Prickearde Ewe, since thou doest beare the bell, And all thy mates, doe followe at thy call: Keepe still this laune, this grasse will like you well, And I will come at night, and mende your stall. You knowe my will, this is the summe of all: Farewell my firtell flocke, I must awaie, To bide those panges, as Gods might well affraie. This said, with his Harpe at his backe, his Sheepehooke in his hande, with teares in his eyes, and sorrowe in his hart, like calmie Zephirus , he fled homewarde, whiche when Simonides perceiued, being desirouse to see the whole somme of his fortune, and how the worlde would goe with hym (as fast as his long garmentes would giue hym leaue) followed hym, till at the last he espied the very same Nymphe, whiche the nigth before tormented Titerus , returnyng towardes hym (as it was to bee deemed) to increase his Martirdome, whom he with stealyng pace followed, and so happely couered hym self, that without any of their knowledge, he attained to his olde secrete Chamber, where beyng settled, he behelde the stately Nymph, with how braue a Maiestie she placed her self in her Marble seate, and with how gallaunt a regarde, she behelde passionat Titerus , who findyng opertunitie, beganne most lamentably, to submit hym self in this sorte. O gratious Aglara , the seruant of a soueraigne Queene, Mother to a stately and mightie God, graunt me grace to ope the very marowe of my submission, and with a gratious and feminine looke of mercie, abate some right whiche is inioyned me, and with fauour preferre my humble contrition before the mercie seate of your Ladie and Mistris, the Goddes Venus . Poore Titerus , I sillie Sheepeheard, dutifully confesse the errour, and humbly request pardone for the offence, that vngratiously and in contempt of the dietie, and disparadgment of beautie I haue committed. Which since it is the first poinct to attaine fauour, O delicate Nymph sprong from the loynes of perfect Nature, and wouderfully beautified by the beneuolence of the Goddes, let this by your meanes worke me some mercie. O vngratiouse man that I was, who suffered my self to be swallowed vp with errour, and to be led by contempt, to be disdainefull on her, who might beseeme Apollos loue. O Daphne , thou floure of Loyaltie, when shall I see thee about the water banckes, that commyng to water my flocke, I might submit my self to thy mercie, with how many faire speeches, comely greetynges, and sweete meloudies, would Titerus trye thee, thou shouldest inioye the firstlynges of my flocke, and what greater pleasure my Soule could imagine, thou shouldst not want it. But alas, she is bereft me, my disdaine, my disdaine miserable that I am, hath made me contemned. O Aglara , though thy beauty be ordained to increase my martyrdome, though thy amorous proffers be appoincted to be harte styng to me poore Titerus , yet if any mercie bydeth in a gratiouse and amyable Nymph, tell me what waie maie he wrought, whereby bothe the furie of the heauens may be pacified, and Titerus , maie inioye his Daphne : I am weary to beare these tormentes, yet in mercie vse them good Aglara , the Sheepeheard is to too penitent. The stately semy Goddes, hauyng harde the cordiall confession of Titerus , aunswered hym in this sorte. Thou contemner of Ladies and dispiser of Loyaltie, thinkest thou, the dishonour thou hast open to the Goddesse will be pacified with a teare: imaginest thou, that our Queene of Paphos is mortall to forget an iniurie? No, the wrong thou haste wrought to her Maiestie, will not be wroung out of obliuion: she that hath destroyed hole Nations for lesse abuses, should she pardon thee that hath committed greate blasphemie, as well against her self and courtly traine, as also against her sweete sonne and heyre, my yong Maister Cupid . I am sorie Titerus for thine errour, and it grieues me that amongst so many of her other other Handmaides, that I onely was appoincted to this office: But to comforte thee a while, to the ende thy Purgatorie maie be made somewhat the more easie, when by and by it shall be executed. I will tell thee deffinitiue sentence of my Mistris, and vnlesse by that meanes she hath set downe thou attaine her fauour, I can hardly imagine any waie, whereby thy sorrowes should be aswaged. Venus my amorous Dame, lately discoursyng of thy contemptes, in the Temple of her high Citie, beyng naturally inclined to mercie, and yet mightily moued by thy abuses, pityyng the care of her Nymph Daphne , and willyng the amendment and reconsiliation of Titerus , deliuered me in this darke riddle, the waie of thy redresse, and the remedie that should be incident, to my fellowe Nymphe and your louyng freende, whiche attentiuely giue eare vnto, for I feare me thou wilt hardly vnderstande it, and for Daphnes sake I will leaue it with thee in writyng, that this next night thou mightest take counsaile of thy pillowe, and as I reporte it now, so reade it thou. That neuer knewe, the fassion of this soyle: That hath both sence and soule, and loues a mayde, Shall teache thee that, for whiche thou long didst toyle. Whose to muche loue, doth make hym loath his life, Whose loue and life, consumeth euery daie, Hym seeke thou out, for he must ende the strife: Whiche is a man, whose office is to prate. There growes a mayden tree amid this groue, The whiche a God, doth for his garlande weare: There he and thou, shall finde that thou doest craue, Where Daphne dyed, there seeke thy wedded feare. Two Sunnes shall steape, their heads in occean sea, Two Moones shall shewe their pale and horned hed: Ere thou gaine grace, vnlesse thy bap it be, By chaunce to light, vpon thy louers bed. Loe Sheaperde my Mistres sentence, see here the meanes of your amendement, when you finishe this, your sorrowe ceaseth, if you faile to performe this, the more woe will assaile you, but for that the appoincted hower is almoste paste, and I am to attende on my Mistres this daie, at the spring of Persepolis , for that Diana and she hath appoincted, there to bathe themselues, make thee ready Titerus , for now drawe thou thy tormente, whiche saied, discoueryng her golden bushe of heare and to make her beautie the more pearsyng to the poore Sheperde, she laied open her pure and pleasaunt pappes, thus placyng her self before poore pacient Titerus (the rather to agrauate his greater greef) she proffered hym many louyng and courteous imbracementes, with suche sweete and alluryng inticementes, that he beeyng pricked, with the sharpest shaft of Cupids Quiuer: humbly vppon his knees praied for that, whiche she with coye, and straunge demeanure continually denaied hym, yet still prouokyng hym with her pleasaunt proffers, baityng his hope in all thynges, saue in that he moste desired, when she would spightfully shake hym of, with hygh and foule disdaine. The furie whereof so vehemently assailed the scaldyng breaste of my poore Titerus , that like the mount Ætna, (whiche the Poetes faigne to be the Shoppe of Vulcan ) casteth out sundrie flames, and wonderfull fumes, to the admiration of the inhabitantes there aboutes: so our poore Sheaperd streined out at his eyes, euident firie reflection, and forcibly breathed out at his nostrelles, the fumyng smoke that proceaded from his burnyng breaste. And as the gulfe of Arabia , with many and sundrie entercourses of waues, maketh shewe of an infernall horrour, so the trickelyng teares, that distilled from his eyes, resembled the billowes of a boysterous sea. Harde were it to describe the passion that vexed poore Titerus , and the amorous proffers that passed from Aglaura . Simonides poore soule, beholdyng these incounters, began with teares to lamente the Sheaperdes destenie, and had it not been to the displeasure of Venus whom he serued, or to the dishonour of the Nymphe whiche tormeted Titerus , he would sodainly haue broke out to the rescues of the Sheaperde, but the Ladie seyng her tyme drew nere, and that she must depart, betooke her self to her Harpe, wherevpon she sunge her farewell in this sorte. Farewell poore Titerus, The beautie of the deserte Sheaperdes all, In vaine to amorus, For why Disdaine deuines thou shalt bee thrall: To her whom Goddess appoinct to worke thy woe, Yet should Aglara might not gall thee soe. O Venus graunt mercie. I see his heauinesse, How he lamentes his proude and high contempte, O graunt hym happinesse: His soule from cares and sorrowe to exempte. Submission would o Queene he should haue life, Who craues faire Daphne for his wedded wife. O Cupid some pitie. Behold his miserie, How many thousande woes doe hym assaile: O yeeld to lenitie, For mercie serueth to a Queenes auaile. Poore Titerus I waile that I emongst the reste, Am sent eche daie to bee thy angrie gueste. Poore Sheaperd farewell. This doen, she tooke her Harpe, and hanged it aboute her patiences necke, and thus she departed as swift as the winde, Titerus followyng so faste as he could, although in vaine, and beeyng wearie of his woe and toile, he laied hym doune in a pleasaunt plot, where he might behold his Shepe and Heardes of wilde Goates. Simonides who likewise followed, laied hym doune at the Sheaperdes backe, deuinyng and musyng, bothe of the maners of the Nymphe, and what might bee the riddle, that was left with Titerus . Many similitudes came into his hedde, diuerse imaginiations troubled his braine, sundrie tymes he concluded this waie of his probleame, other tymes his opinion was altered, at the laste it fell out (that to cutte of his dumphes) he heard this discourse whiche Titerus had with hym self, to the whiche moste attentiuely, for the lamentable deliuerie thereof he listened his eare. O poore and infortunate Titerus , why did Nature make thee amiable, and denie thee to be amorous, what harde Fortune haste thou, that emong all the siluane Sheaperdes, thou art seuered from pleasure: Coridon : How fortunate is he in his Sheepe, how well stored of cattell, how well greeted by the water Nymphes: How well vsed by his house Doue: How pleasauntly beholdyng his firstlynges? He doeth with Oten Pipe recorde the commodities of the feeld, the praise of Pan the God of Sheaperdes; the loue of Iupiter with Io , the death of Argus by Mercurie . Onely I poore wretche, emongest all men enioiyng beautie, am of euery one moste despised, and beyng thought moste worthy to imbrace all pleasure, am yet so hardly scantled, that I possesse none. But whence (O Goddes) proceadeth this cause of maladie, from the furie of you, or the folly of my self, you worke no ill, you punishe wrong: from me first sprong my cause of sorrowe, from contempt that possessed my soule, my first plague issued. O that the worlde knewe my misfortune, whiche is ouerwhelmed with my disease, thei would then feare danger in the Courte, as well as feele sorrowe in the deserte. But woe is me that emongest all others louers I am moste infortunate, for thei either are satisfied with their desire, or els dispossessed of their sorrowe by death. Onely I (poore vnhappie Sheaperde) bothe long to dye in Loue and can not, and desire to enioye my Loue and maie not, so I am promised by the Goddes for contemnyng of Daphne , and am tormented in my self, for not enioiyng of Daphne . But my cruell Mistres Algara , the messenger of the angrie Goddes, hath lefte me a named remedie, God graunte it growe to effecte, but I feare me the thing is impossible, and therfore not performable, as though sencelesse bodies in sheepes clothyng, could instructe a naturall and reasonable man, or that feminine substaunces, would bee delighted onely with sencible appearaunces. Farre bee it from my thought, that either a brute beast should instruct me, or Loue which is heauenlie, should bee ledde with that whiche is almoste yearthlie, I will wade no farther in contemplation of this Elenthus , the more plainesse I looke for the more fallaces I finde in it, little bee my ioyes, when appearaunces in shewe, bereue my pleasure and tranquilitie in the ende. O do I liue, nay dye. I hope muche paper lucke pleasaunte in shewe, combersome in substaunce, transitorie are the ioyes I haue, when howers doates it out, and a passion of sorowe bereaues me of remembraunce of happinesse. But Death wilt thou not ende all, the wiseman saieth, thou art equall to all treasures, and wilt thou bee partiall to me, myne eyes that see vaine pleasures desire to be dimmed, and as the paines I indure, are through a Goddes Stygian othe, so by a mercifull Maiesties helpe, thei maie bee dispelled: Faine would I speake more, but my thoughtes are so troubled with many inconueniences, that hardly I can imagine, how to ease my self of my sorrowe. But for that I conceiue no helpe likely, no Aspecte fauourable, no Planet fortunate. O Atropos , decide the controuersie, and helpe to make a breache betweene my paine and passion, let my materiall sorrowe, bee brought to finall exigence, and woorke thou that by thy cold humour, that can not bee brought to passe by my hotte Loue. If Goddes graunt fauour, let them leaue fallaces, Shepherdes loue plaines, sure thei loue purely. I speake not to the Oracle of Apollo gratious Venus , to haue a doubtfull aunswere, but I sewe to the Mother of Cupide , and sole Wife of Vulcan : O pitifull Goddes, O pitie sweete Goddes pittie. These wordes were fumed out with a scaldyng sigh, and sanctified with the twoo springyng Fountaines of his eyes, whiche Nature lent hym, to mollifie his troubled and ouerburthened harte: Whereupon he addressed hym self to serue his malancholy muse, and takyng his Harpe from his backe, beholdyng his feedyng Sheepe with many wofull glaunces, he indeuoured to tune his Instrumet, mindyng to make some mournefull meloudie to feede his sorrowfull fancie. Simonides (our curtiouse Hermite) hauyng with greate sorrowe, bin ouerhearer to the wofull tale of poore and louyng Titerus , and consideryng of the hole purpose, that Aglara had deliuered in verse and probleme, and deliberated vppon euery conuenience and discommoditie, euery pleasure and displeasauns, euery doubtfull in shewe and euery darke worke in operation, he at last by deuine inspiration attained to the knowledge of the truthe, and therefore watchyng his conuenient tyme, whereby he might laie vpon the true purpose and meanyng of the Goddes to the dispairyng Sheapheard; he began to listen to his discourse, for no sooner had our Hermite left his imaginyng, but our Sheapheard fell to singyng, and at the first worde in that he named Eccho , our Hermite thought it not amis to vse the office of Eccho . Thus it fortuned in both, and Fortune wrought in them bothe thus: Simonides willing to doe good, our Sheaphearde desirous to haue good, bothe mist neither purpose, the one had that he sought for in song, the other that he wished for; the releeuyng of poore Titerus , who after all strynges set in vniformitie, in this amorouse and lamentable maner saluted the Muses, and called on Eccho . Eccho thou pleasaunt Nymph, whose pratyng tonge, By openyng tales, of Iuno to her frende: Since thou hast dwelt, within this Forest longe, Vouchsafe some helpe, my sorrowes for to ende: Simonides , attendyng the finall discourse and clause of the dittie with equall tune, beyng helped by the reuerberation of the Rocke and ayre, aunswered Ende : whereas Titerus somewhat astonyed, yet a little comforted replied thus. Ende Eccho why, the ladie of my life, Hath cast me of, and yeeldes me this anoye: And canst thou then, attaine to ende the strife. When Goddes them selues, haue sworne I shall not ioye. Ioy. Ioy Eccho why, the note Aglara gaue, By no deuise, my sillie braine can scare Good Eccho let, me now thy iudgement haue, What meanes the Goddes, either beast or man. Man. Man Eccho why, the style proues nothyng so, For men haue sence, and he must senceles rest: Who shall instruct, me to allaie my woe, And ease my harmes, would he were ready prest. Prest. A senceles man, I can not thinke it true, For none but Louers, Reasons rules doe flye: If it be then a Louer Eccho shew, Who shall procure, the Sheapheardes remedi. I A Louer O ye heauens, yet they saie, That he whiche must, disburden me of feare: Must clothed be in woll, and still doth praie, Eccho tell me, if suche a one be neare. Neare. Neare worthie wight, if loue possesse thy brest, Vouchsafe that Titerus maie view thy face: Who both by loue, is driuen to greate vnrest, And still must waile, till he maie thee imbrace. Imbrace. Our Eccho hauyng vttered this last worde, like an aged Father in attyre, and an Aungell in face, he sodainly offered hym self to the viewe of the Sheaphearde, also wonderyng to beholde Simonides , that in all thynges shewed euident sight of the sence of his probleame, forgettyng hym self, in humble wise he fell vppon his knees before our Hermite, earnestly requestyng hym to make manifest the whole discourse of his commyng thither, and to what ende he aunswered hym in forme of an Eccho , whether thereby be imagined to feede hym with some hope, or determined (beyng moued with pitie) to procure hym some remedie. Simonides perceiuyng the plight that Titerus was in, and how greatly he had forgotten hym self, imbraced the Sheaphearde in his armes, comfortyng hym thus. Titerus , and seemely Sheaphearde, I wonder that thou beyng a reasonable man, and one of singuler beautie, that thou wilt so muche stoope to sorrowe, and leaue thy self destitute of good successe by vnseemely sadnes, if thou seest thy paine to be necessarie, thou art not to sorrowe: for it is more wisedome to beare a misfortune equally in thy self, then to qualifie it in an other by learned perswasion. I see thy memorie faileth thee, when thou forgettest thy last nightes bedfellowe: Loe here the beholder of thy torment, and the despeller of thy trouble. Not without cause haue the Waues ministred me waie to lande, and the powres graunted me possession of this desert, when by my helpe, thou shalt bee rested to thy wonted pleasure, and and by my counsaile Daphne shall bee inioyned to thee, put awaie therefore from thee all care, and let not these or suche like follies induce thee, to the amourous delight of transitorie pleasure, but haue an eye vpwarde, for the better parte of thee is heauenly. My self am the senceles man clothed in fleese as you see, and a louer of a noble and beautifull wight, as Venus well knoweth, whose Habite is Religious, and whose profession is praier. I knowe bothe where Daphne dyed, and where Daphne now liueth, ye where she liueth (if the message that was sent you, be as truely ment as I haue effectually conceiued of it) I will bothe honestly and vertuously leaue you for her bed, and when my duetie is performed (by your aduise) learne the waie how to auoyde this Desert, where (had not your cause required) I haue made longer staie then I desired, that therefore I might furnishe you with all orderly remedies, as my request was the last night, so this daie I praie you orderly repeate vnto me, the whole discourse of your fonner aduentures, that I maie the more aptly prouide for your profite, and further you to that, whiche you so earnestly fancie. Titerus as one raised out of a dreame, in a greate muse behelde Simonides a long space, but in tyme recoueryng hym self, considered how necessarie it was to vse the opertunitie that was offered, he reuerently (yeeldyng a due place of his greene Hillocke to Simonides , and laiyng his Instrument aside, spake thus. Noble Seignior , (for other title I knowe not neither such like clothyng or seemely garmentes haue euer happened to my sight) I must craue pardon, if beeyng but a poore fielde Sheaphearde as I am, I should presume to vtter a homely protestation to you, whose eares haue bin acquainted with the retoricall discourses of the Citie Orator, and perhappes will hardly brooke the harshnesse of our rude rethoricke: yet for that of necessitie I must disclose, and to the recure of my wounded harte vtter the actions of my hole life, I praie you beare with my homely tale, whiche though it shall want vniuersite wisedome, I doubt not but to store it with our fielde Philosophie. I was borne (noble Gentleman) in the confines of Catalonia , in a Uilladge called Badouin , my father Romano Corretty , a Gentleman of Spayne , who by misfortune falne to decaie, was inforced to flye from the furie of crewell creditors, and to betake hym self with suche small prouision as he had into this Countrie, where growyng in acquaintaunce with the Captaine of the Castle Sainct Angello , seuen leagues from Genoua , partly for my Mothers sake a faire gentlwoman called Madame Penillia , and me her faire Ganimede of exquisite beautie in my youth, intreated my father courteouslie, and entertained us as fauourably, till it pleased the Goddes to call my mother, after whose disease, our credite began to decrease, and from a Table freende, my father was made a Stable keper, his poore sonne Titerus a Shepherd, God inioyeth bothe mother and fathers soule, and poore Shepherd I; am reserued & liue to this torment, tenne Winters and more, haue I pleasauntly looked to my flocke, and prouided for my Ewes, I haue been carefull for their fodder, and curious in trimmyng their stalle, and had not a Nimphe chaunced this laste yere to haue loued me (God he knowes) I had been free from sorowe, I had knowen no calamitie, but Fortune your Ci[illeg.]e GOD wrought my woe in this deserte, and by proofe taught me, that sorrowe is as well receptable, in the solitarie soile, as the societie of men, how falsly song the Poete when he versified thus. Fortuuitos homines bona sisua nocint Agricolas. There was a pretie Nymphe, that haunted here aboute, not farre from yonder steepe mountaine, who amorously was sought to by one of my fellowe Shepherdes Coridon , and the maiden beeyng pitifullie mooued, graunted a Mariage, the weddyng daie beyng then named, emogest many other my self was sent for there to bee present, Pan -our-greate GOD that daie caried the bride Cuppe, and Priapus ledde the Bride her self, I yong striplyng, was attendante vpon our newe maried Coridon . O how many pretie Nimphes were there that daie dauncyng, Dianas whole traine, came to visite the Nuptiall, Venus lefte neuer a Shephearde that daie without his Ladie, amongest all, I alone was the man that was chosen, by a delicate Nimphe called Daphne , of the retinue of Cupide his mother, who offeryng vnto me many amorous glaunces, I requited with proude disdaine, and profferyng sweete imbracynges, was martired with my leude refusalles, so that after the mariage daie she began to fall sick, and her accustomed mirthe was tourned to mone. Venus quickly soundyng the cause of her distresse, comforted her with many sweete promises, made her rise vp to asaie my disdainyng humor once more the seconde repulse was more bityng then the firste, (woe is me that I was so froward) so that our poore pitifull Nimphe (with finger in the eye) was faine to praie help of her Mistres who pitiyng her Daphnes case, complained to her soone Cupide , who first somoned me to his Course, to expostulate with me of the wrong doen to Daphne , but findyng me headstrong began with a furious intent, to drawe an arrowe to the head, and wounded my contumelous harte, with the desire of Aglara whom you saw, who the more to vexe me, tickleth my hope with her amorous deuises, and yet requiteth my desire, with moste dispightfull frompes. This is the true reporte worthie Segnior , of my first birth and bringyng vp, my pleasure and my paine, and since I vnderstande, that it lieth in you to dooe me good, and that the fauourable Goddes, by your meanes are determined to ease my sorrowe, in that I am penitente, I beseche you to take the paines, to comforte a poore Shepherde, and to ease his harmes, who is altogether eaten vp with sorrowe, and consumed with amorous agonies. Simonides hauyng vnderstoode that whiche he sought for, tooke Titerus by the hande, and briefly to the purpose discoursed thus. My good freende, thou art to yeeld the immortall powers greate thankes, in that emongest many tormentes, thei haue alotted thee to one that is not remedilesse, where as there bee others, that bothe are wrong with more grater extremities, and yet are altogether without hope of after comforte. Thy contempt hath had a worthie reward, and condyngly thou hast been punished, and since thou art thus beaten with thine owne rodde, and thy experience makes thee wise, thou art sufficiently armed, to warne other of the incouenience that hath bitten thee, but for that breeflie thou shalte bee satisfied in fewe wordes declare, where diddest thou leaue Daphne . Titerus aunswered, I lefte her laste in her Caban, on the butte of yonder Mountaine, hard by a Laurell tree. Simonides no soooner heard this, but assured hymself of the truthe that would folowe, and glad of the Shepherdes conformitie, by his conductyng, he easilie paced to the place before named, to the whiche when thei were arriued, thei might beholde a curious close, compassed with springes of Laurell, and beautified with seated of Primeroses, where into, when Simonides and Titerus had entered, it was their hap vpon a banke of Turues, besett with Uiolet and Primerose, to beholde Daphne , lamentablie complainyng her self to Venus and vppon her Lute, ruthfullie recordyng her misfortune. The whiche Simonides perceiuyng, he secretly withdrewe hym self, with Titerus , to staie a while, till she had ended her sorrowfull dittie, that there by thei might the rather construe her meanyng, who no sooner shrouded in the leaues, but she began sorrowefullie to complaine. Secludes my trust, from hope of after ioye: O teares distill, from Conduites of my vaines, The scaldyng bloud, that breedeth my anoye. O Mistres deare, and if thy mightie sonne, The stately God, the prince of lastyng Loue: By Maidens mone, were moued or ere wonne, Let my distresse, some mercie in hym moue. O scornefull Shepherd, why doeth proude disdaine, Inforce thee stumpe, at her who loues thee well: O Titerus, if nought a Nimphe to gaine, Who in dame Venus, traine doeth beare the bell. O would thou sawest, the tormentes I abide, The wryngyng woes, that doeth my soule assaile: The thoughtes that hope, and fancie doe deuide, The dreadfull dreames, that doe my purpose quaile. Thou wouldest then leaue, thy sillie Sheepe alone, And come and see, the sorrowe that I beare: And at the laste, as maistered by my mone, While I made sute, vouchsafe a listenyng eare. But if no grace, in Titerus will bee, You Goddes reuenge, the wrong he doeth to me. Titerus all this while, who behelde her teares and lamentation, wounded with incredible tormente, he sodainlie rushed in to the Nimphe, and findyng her almoste in a sounde, for lacke of Aqua vitae , he reuiued her againe with amorous kisses, beyng thus come to her self, laiyng her delicate hedde on his shoulders, washyng his face with her teares, she beganne thus to salute hym. O Titerus , what makest thou here to increase my torment, is it not inough for thee in absence to martire me, but when my sorrowes are at full, with thy faire face to preserue my more miserie. O good Shepherde bee pitifull, let not so vile disdaine harbour in thy harte, either absent thy self, or if any bountie bee in Titerus , let me by thine owne handes bee ridde of this combersome life. The Shepherd imbracyng her sweetely with a courteous kisse, sanctified with millions of teares, he comforted her thus. O gratious Nymph (the brauest beautie in our fielde) pardon my contempt, and take pitie of my sorrowfull misfortune, let not my folly that is past, seclude me from my good fortune that is to come, since thou louest, graunt hym loue that equally is amorous: O let thy troubles and my tormentes bee now finished, and since the Goddes do graunt vs their fauour, let not our delaie make vs vnfortunate. She hearyng this vnlooked for, yet pleasaunt and allowable offer, thankfully accepted his conditions: Loue concluded their willes both to one exigent and at one instant, whiche Simonides perceiuyng and glad of this good euent, drewe nere vnto them, and presented himself to their companie, whom no sooner had our Sheaphearde espied, but with many imortall thankes to the Goddes, and courteous gratulations to the Hermite poore Titerus requited: Faire Daphne (for want of better presence welcomed hym with a kisse: all thynges fell out very happely, and our Hermite with the twoo amorous couple were sett downe together, who grauely shewyng the Maiestie of his profession, exhorted the yong couple thus. Gentiles Amoures , you maie see now what power the Goddes haue, who in a momet can bryng that to passe, which is supposed impossible, in mans simple and foolisht imagination, you are now to enioye the pleasure you long looked for, and to couple your selues in the holy and blessed state of Wedlocke, to be partakers of most happie amitie, whereby your seuerall soules and bodies, shall be interchaungably coopeled in one substaunce, you maie therefore sith opertunitie serueth, and I am here of sufficient authoritie, bothe willyng and readie to farther your honest and lawfull desires. Ioyne therefore in Wedlocke, and take your first fruictes of pleasure or daie light. The couple were not so easely agreed, but thei were as quickly maried, with equall ioye and mutuall delight. There came to the honouring of the mariage Aglara, Menalippe , and Philida , three of the Nymphes of Venus , who seyng the matter sorted out to so good agreement, ioyfully imbraced the wedded couple, and fetchyng in some Faunes, Satiers , and M[illeg.]nan Sheapherdes, thei solemnised the Wedlocke daie with Forrest triumphes and Countrie reuell. Pan delighteth the hole companie with his pleasaunt triples, there wanted no pleasure that might bee thought on, euery Nymphe had her Louer, euery Sheapherde his frende, the daunsing continued till bed tyme, and the Bride once brought to her Chamber, with her wedded Housebande laied by her side, the hole companie departed, and for the good seruice of our Hermite, Aglara that tyme entertained hym, passyng the night with pleasaunt discourse. Simonides the next daie beyng wearie of the Desert, curteously tooke his leaue of Titerus , and gently gaue Daphne, Aglara , with the other faire Damoselles a freendly farewell, and beyng derected by a hyred Sheaphearde, he trauailed on his waie towardes Genoua , long thei Iorneied with wearysome pace, till at the last thei came to continuall beaten waie, where Simonides discharged his guide, with many commendations to the amorous couple. He trauailed then by hym self so long, that the Steeples and sumptuous buildynges of Genoua appeared to his sight, and to his greate pleasure. In tyme he attained to the Citie gates, into the whiche he was no sooner entered, but with greate admiration he began to consider of the brauerie of the buildynges, and sodainly he might beholde a greete troupe of gallant Gentlemen, amongest the whiche, one aged father of graue aspect bare the chiefe place. Simonides desirous to question of the cause, in freendly maner requested one of the retinewe, whither that gallant assembly were derectyng their course, freende ([quoth] the seruaunt) these noble men are goyng towardes the Market place, to sit in Iudgement vpon criminall causes: Simonides gently requited his relation, and paced foote by foote with the troupe, till thei came to the place of Iustice, where eche takyng place accordyng to his degree, after silence commaunded by the Officers, our Hermite harde the graue and auncient Segnior discourse thus. Noble Senatours and Gentlemen of Genoua , we are assembled here to decide contemptuous matters that touche our state, and to correct suche vices as are interteined in our communaltie: for mens natures must bee brideled, to the whiche thei are moste inclined, and a Prince must seeke to expell that errour, to the whiche he findeth his people most adicted: therefore our fathers & maintainers of publique estate haue thought it necessarie, that those pleasures that youth were adicted too, should bee soonest anticipated. Poetrie was banished bothe Rome and Athens , because it was lasciuious: Fencers likewise bothe Rome and Athnes , because thei were quarrellous: Excesse out of Rome and Athens , because it was riotous. Our state and the glorie of this Citie, standeth vppon the graue iudgement of fathers, the due obedience of Subiects, and the expert valour of the Soldiour, now if it should so fall out, that either disorder should be in the Prince, or lauishe life in the subiect, or lasciuious demeanure in the Soldiour, the gouerment of our purposes would faile, our Commons would growe stubborne, our Soldiours feminine: we are to haue eyes, to marke and to punishe, we are to esteeme by deserte, and to accompt of wealth but as a minister to paie for Warre: Now if the staie fall, how greate hazarde is the state in, it maie seeme straunge to you noble Gentleme, that at this tyme I discourse largely: but for that necessitie and zeale maketh me long, loth that any good precept should be neglected, I doubt not but you will heare me willyngly, and further an honest cause in the behalfe of our Citie. We haue made lawes priuatly touchyng our owne state, and for publique practise and common plea, we accustome Iustinian , our owne orders bee broken by our selues, no maruaile then the simple and meane men runne amisse: We punishe in other, and let it slippe in our selues, for our lawes thei are disorderly handled, whiche depending vpon the discretion of the Iudge, the daie passeth with hym that proffereth moste money and bringeth least honestie. Truely these daies are perilous, our Nation in to muche warre are to crewell, in continued peace to effiminate: in prosperitie proude, in aduersitie desperate. Thus our whole state runnes vpon extreamitie, and who now is moste wise, but he that can best flatter, and who deserues so greate a praise, as he that is most prodigall. I maruaile that in seekyng for gaine in forraine Countries, we borowe not our Neighbours contenencie with their coyne. O vnhappie Genoua , when our Gentlemen from the studie of sciences, giue them selues to imagine newe cuttyng sutes, to aduaunce their follies in the eye of the worlde: when our women loue gaddyng, our olde men maddyng, our young men lasciuiousnesse, our Soldiours nicenesse. But how maie this wickednesse bee wrong out, truely no otherwise then by reformyng the men of most necessitie, for that our neede shall be to vse them more sooner then we thinke or looke for: withstande occasions, for they growe sodainely: Princes hartes chaunge: Warre dependeth on the desire of gaine or worldly honour, and how sodaine motions are these in our myndes, as the daies be now. Truely wee haue lawes, and since I am by your election deputed worthie to dispose them, I meane by the helpe of the almightie to roote out an euill, whiche (I thinke) if it should growe long, will destroye our millitarie profession. The last daie as I passed the Streate, I mett one Signior Andruchio , Captaine of our Castle Sainct Angello , brauely beset vpo a Horse of force, in steede of Armour of profe meete for a Soldiour, he was aparrelled in Crimsin Ueluet, imbrodered with Pearle and Stone, in steede of a Launce, he bare in his hande a Fanne of Feathers, in place of a stearne and warlike countenaunce, he seemed in my sight a transformed Puppet, his heire friseled like a Curtisans bushe. Alas, I am sorie to make you priuie to the antique fashion of our foolishe, and effeminate captaine. Certainlie, I beheld his straunge demeanure with greate admiration, and beyng pricked in conscience, by reason of my charge, to woorke a remedie for suche euilles, I thought it moste conueniente, to roote this out first, for that I sawe it moste pernicious: whervpon I caused in my name, our feminine warriour to bee arested, and committed to prison, till my farther pleasure were knowne. Loe, here the cause of our assemblie (noble gentilmen) to determine of our Captaines leudnesse: That seeyng him beeyng a gouernour in our Prouince, perpetratyng thinges contrarie to our Lawe, he maie bee punished to the example of the retinewe he gouerneth, and the other Mercinarie Souldiors, whiche our Citie hath now in paie. There resteth now vppon your alowaunce, that the partie bee sent for, and till wee heare his reasons, wee maie suspende our iudgement. The whole Senatours highlie commended, this graue gouernours aduise, whervpon, by publique consent, our Captaine was sent for, who in the verie same order, as is before mentioned, presented him self, with bolde, yet due reuerence, before the Magestrates and State: to whom in breef wordes, the Iudge and Viceroy saied thus. Signior Andruchio , you are called before this reuerent assemblie, to aunswere to a Lawe, whiche you disorderlie haue broken, and by our aucthoritie hetherto, you haue been imprisoned, and iustlie deceiued. We committed you as you knowe for your lauase attire, and your vnsemelie demeanure, whiche by our penall Lawe, is losse of your office, and banishment out of our confines. Now, for that your errour is euidente, before we passe to Iudgement, haue thought good to heare what you can aleadge for your self, if any reasonable essoine or excuse bee readie in memorie, or reason to perswade vs to mitigate the asperitie of our Lawe, let vs brieflie and quicklie heare it. The Captaine aunswered thus. Reuerende Fathers and renowmed gentilmen, the daie long loked for to Andruchio , is now sodainly betide me, wherin I dooe not a little reioyce, that I am to open my minde before a noble societie of discrete hearers, who will imagine of a Souldiers blunt tale, as the equitie of the sence lieth: And not by the mistearmed errours, whiche bee subiect to ignoraunte menne. I am here to make aunswere to a breache of Lawe, I knowe no waie but confession. But since the ende muste make euident proofe of all lette vs consider (worthie Fathers) why Andruchio , was so foolishe. My whole birthe, bringing vp and trade of life, hath been to lie hard, to fare grosselie, to sleape little, to venture muche and hardlie can it be thought that a man of my trainyng vp, should become an Epicure in diet, a Masker in apparell, and a demie harlot in deuises. Your selues noble Citezens haue tried my faithfulnesse, how willyng I haue ventured on swordes poinct for the noble estates of Genoua : How many exploites I performed against Soliman , with my retinue of Almanes, Andrachio before tyme hath been a warriour for your weale, and now straineth not to breake a Lawe for your profite. You see here the coate of an effeminate courtier, but yet the courage of a seruisable Souldiour, these Roabes should perswade you that I loue peace, but this arme shal make you priuie that I dread no angrie warre. Your abuses gallaunt gentilmen bee many, who emongest all thinges that are profitable, forgette one thyng whiche is your owne safegard: Sixe yeres and more haue I enioyed reste: the laste Venetian warres, you had in paie 2000. Souldiours, who beeyng retourned home, hurte, maimed, and lame: what prouition haue you imploied for them, the moste parte the Gallowes hath eaten them vp, and our olde and trained Souldiours, whose bloud hath scarletted the salte sea to your glorie, are now faine to feede the carrion Crowes with their mangeled carcases: Necessitie bites sore in a Souldiours harte, and hunger makes hym venture his necke verse: Of so many men onely there are lefte a fewe, who are disguised from menne to brute beastes: but alas the while, I am sorie Genoua , is the nourisher of abuse. These men in suche like roabes as I vse, haunte the Stewes, feede womens fancies, and scrape vp a wicked liuyng, by practisyng an abhominable life. The Flaske and toucheboxe are transformed into a Flie flappe, or Courtisans Fane, their Caliuer, into a curled Poule. Where their Lauce should be in the refle (the waie to winne them honour) thei vse other seruile Instrumentes, to the woundyng of the soule, and corruptyng of the bodie. I haue seen these abuses, and in gronyng of my soule lamented them, in these priuate men of warre, I sawe no amendement, for thei were not punished. Wherupon I deuised with my self, to procure a quicke remedie, though to myne owne detrement: These roabes were put on for ye cause noble Senatours, these trashe couer a Soldiours backe to this purpose, that your state consistyng as yet in an honourable tranquilitie, you maie prouide still for the maintenaunce of the same. Reforme your Souldiours, and giue them paie out of your Treasurie, 20000. Crounes a yere, will saue many valiant mennes liues, and keepe in practise your warlike youth, let not want make them run to wretchednesse, who when warre shall compasse vs, will stande a Senator in better steade then a thousande of his Crownes. I meruaile that in this state we onely prouide for priuate pence, and practise not to vnderstande the demeanure of our enuious neighbours, who bothe match vs in wealth, and exceade vs in policie, fortifiyng them selues with Bulwarkes an munition, with men and prouision, perhapes not so much for their owne priuate defence, as for the enioiyng of others labours. Thei ouerslippe no daie but their Souldiors are trained, their horsemen exercised: But we little consideryng of thinges to come, let our Souldiors runne at randon, in follie and misbehauior. If sodainly a storme of trouble should growe, either emog our selues, or by forraine quarell (whiche God forbid) I would faine vnderstande how many trained Souldiors, and men of proofe, our Citie were able to set forthe. Those of experience are now effeminate, and for want of exercise, wholie vnfit for seruice: It maie bee that vpon a sodaine Allarme, wee might make 30000. fightyng men, but alas where instruction faileth all runnes to ruine: The Swashebuckler is not the beste man in battaile, he hath no fence for Cannon shot: Alas it greeueth me to open this eye sore to the hole state: I burst out in teares to see the securitie of this Citie, and I must call on you (reuerende fathers) speedily to prouide a remedie: For me, I must yeelde you hartie and dutifull thankes, in that it hath pleased you to bestowe on me for my seruice, the Captaineship of S. Angelo , and as willyngly I render it into your handes, as you gratiously bestowed it on me: And for the rest of my retinewe, there, I dare boldly promise you, that I haue trained them well, and thei are venturous enough. I haue here set downe (worthie Iudge and noble Gentlemen) the whole cause of my breathe of lawe, and the willyng mynde I haue your hole state should be reformed, the penaltie that shall passe, by reason of my contempt, I esteeme it little, since it is to profite muche. No Countrie is infortunate to a Soldiour, what I gained by beyng here, I shall not want by myne industrie in other places: And thus graue fathers, I haue opened to you my mynde, and staie for your rightfull and orderly iudgement. The hole assembly, wonderfully accompted of Andruchio his tale, and praised greatly his zeale towards his Countrie, whereupon consultation being had amongst the Elders, briefly he was aunswered in this force. We haue cosidered ( Andruchio ) of thy reasons and finde in them euident tokens of the zeale thou bearest to our state: we are loth to breake lawes, and willyng to doe thee good, we equally consider of thy contempt and thy good meanyng, and as the one deserueth punishment, so the other is to be rewarded with honour. Whereupon, take this as briefe as our determinat opinion, first we here discharge thee of imprisonment, and will the continewaunce of thy Captaineshipe, and for the more approued zeale wee beare vnto thee, our hole state hath bestowed on thee in enlargment of paie, one thousande Duccats. A breache of a petie lawe, maie well be borne withall, since it is to maintaine a true and loyall Subiect. Moreouer, we imagine it necessarie, that since thy prouident eye espied the errours in our state, thou thy self maiest be put in anthoritie, to take order for the inormitie: the next Court day (by publique consent) thou shalt receiue instruction, till then, wee discharge thee to thy priuate affaires, wishyng thee to continewe thy good mynde, and thou shalt not want increase of thy good name and credite. This saied, the hole assembly gaue hym thankes, and so the Court brake vp, and eche returned to his lodgyng: Andruchio with Simonides , and a fewe more, were left in the Market place, where the gentleme gratifiyng the Captaines good lucke, left hym alone, whiche Simodides espiyng beyng but a straunger, he hasted vnto hym, and courtiously demaunded his freendship, where the best entertainement for a straunger might be had. Andruchio , full of humanitie, aunswered hym thus. Religious Hermite, your entertainement shall not bee otherwise but with myne owne selfe, bothe for that you are a straunger, and one of religious deuotion, whiche are bothe acceptable to me. I praie you therefore, accompanie me to my lodgyng, and what simple cheare you finde there, accept of it, for that you shall haue it willyngly. Simonides yeelded hym thankes, and bothe together past to Andruchio his Inne, where settled in a faire Parler, they set them downe to supper, in their Table talke, thei discoursed of that whiche had past before. After supper tyme, Andruchio desirous to know the Hermites cause of trauell, spake thus. If it be no trouble to you before bed tyme, to driue awaie the toylsome night with some discourse, I beseeche you to let me vnderstand your place of birth and cause of trauell, for that my naturall delight, is to harken after straunge nouelties, for by particuler platformes, I gather an vniuersall cogniscaunce of good and bad. The Hermite loth to refuse hym any good turne, who so frendly without any acquaintaunce, had so gently entertained hym aunswered thus. I will aunswer your expectation (noble Captaine) though to my sorrowe. The Citie I was borne in is Ciuill , my Parentes there honourable, my self their heier: My cause of trauell, and why I inuested my self thus, to the order of a Hermite, though it be a sorrie cause, yet I will make you priuie to it. A Gentilmans daughter (whose parentes are both Neighbours and freendes to my father) of exquisit beautie, who in my youth was my plaie fellowe, and at yeares of mariage, I craued her for my wife, hopyng that our acquaintaunce of so long continewaunce, would haue made her esteeme of my choyce: but alas, she refused me, and wounded me with an incredible surge of sorrow, so that in meare malancholy, I conueied my self from out myne owne Countrie in this attyre as you see, and giuen my self to trauell: Many wonders haue I seene, and paced the pathes of seuerall Countries, and onely but to see, if I could molifie the remembraunce of my Clarinda : but all in vaine, for Loue hath so surely ingrafted in my harte the roote of likyng, that I cannot possible imagine, how to rid my self out of his clouches. Andruchio smilyngly interrupted Simonides , and was it vaine loue (amorous Hermite) that made you dispossesse your good fortune: truely a heauie case, when your Parentes should sorrow, your lande should be left destitute of an heire, and your body should be worne out with trauell, and all for loue sir reuerence, a foolishe desire whiche inioyed for a while, bringeth repentaunce at last: Conquer your corrupt nature (gentleman) giue it not full scope of folly, tho your yeres are giuen to pleasure, yet subdue them, the greatest conquest is to maister your owne will: folly it is (in my conceipt) to be rauished in beholdyng of a earthly Image, whiche though in outwarde shewe is moste glorious, yet in inwarde proofe is the distruccion of our fortunate and blessed estate. I myself ( Segnior ) haue had a desire, and I haue loued intirely, I haue been sicke in folly, and haue worne a Cerchief for a Curtisan, my crownes haue been lauishe to trim vp her disordered bodie, my sworde was at commaunde to incounter her enemies, I haue not failed to fulfill all seruill dueties: she rewarded me with kisses, sometymes with bed pleasures, and so finely fostered me vp in my folly, that if she wept I was passionat, if she laught I was gamesome: She promised me none should inioye but I, but I proued the contrarie, she admitted more freendes. The nature of loue is this, to dessemble his coruption vnder the cloke of continency, and to make shew of vertue, where there abideth naught but vyce. Long tyme I aboade in this errour, till happely an honest fellowe Souldiour and freende of myne, with sundrie exhortations began to pull me backe, and truely at last, ouercame my lust with learned admonitions, perswadyng mee that I hardly could be venturous in the fielde, that was amorous in the Citie. Wherevpon he wrote me certaine verses, whiche I will shewe you, I praie God thei maie doe you as much pleasure, as thei procured me profite. Thus reachyng to a Casket that stoode in his Chamber, he brought me certaine lines, whiche were written to this effecte. And canst thou conquer crewell foes, and set their fortes on fire Who in thy bed art bounde a slaue, vnto thy fond desire: Canst thou endure a hungrie meale, and vse accustomde toile, Who pines at home for lasie Loue, within thy natiue soile. It can not bee for Cupids bowe, is of too feeble might, To wounde or hurt the manly mynde, his arrowes are to flight: He daunteth none but simple sottes, who lulde in Ladies lappes, Doe deeme thei liue in greatest blisse, that plaie with womens paps But he that sawe a Louers Iest, and markt hym in his vaine, When he is courtyng mistres mince, what passions he can faine: Might laugh his fill to see a foole, so finely plaie his parte, When woodcocke once beginnes to woe, he faines his fittes by arte Sometymes a looke will cause hym liue, a loure will make hym die, Thus tymes and howers doe serue his sence, and yet no reason why Sometymes againe with mournefull muse, thei take a pen in hande Thei curse the godes, thei ba the Fates, which doth their loue withstad Thei praise, thei paint, thei feare, thei hope, & eury light desire Doeth breede a flame thus doe thei liue, and dye in fancies fire. Sometymes a gallant sute to please, a womans garishe eye, Sometymes a blacke atire to note, a Louers miserie. Thus sence, thus life, thus goodes, thus tire, are toiling vp & doune, Whilst he that loues doeth liue a foole, that might haue gainde renowne: O sences numde, o bodie bent, to vile and base degree, Who seekes to serue a sithyng dame that will but scorne at thee. Loue whence art thou? the sonne of Lust, whom Poetes Venus call, To whom a womans shape thei gaue, for that her power is small: And though her Cupid long hath liude, and hath seen many yeres, Yet is he counted but a boye, and fit for childishe pheares. Hym Poetes fame a Flaxen head, which is both old and yong, An Iuorie necke with Bowe and Shaftes, that hang his backe along: His eyes besmirde with blinded hope, that shewes he can not see, Whiche opend to a wise mans witte, of trothe thus must it bee, His Flaxen head a yong desire, and yet an aged mase, His youthly yeres declares our fleshe, as foolishe as it was: His Iuorie necke a faire prospecte, that vadyng beautie showes, Whiche though in Sommer is a flowre, yet Winter ouerthrowes. His Bow and Shafts are lookes & shewes, which if thei setled weare, Lord loue would quickly be a slaue, who now doeth ensigne beare And as his Fascia sheades his lookes, so are our sences blinde, We count our choyce though nothing so, the floure of womakinde O pearsyng sight why art thou dimde, by peeryng on the Sunne, Why wilt thou binde thy lookes to Loue, that many hath vndoen: O hart why doest thou yeeld to brooke, the hot and balefull blood Whece comes this flame by which our fame, & honor is withstood When courage, value, vertue, force, and all are made to staie, But for a foolishe womans wordes, vpon her yea and naie, Loe here the state of louyng myndes, vnfit for fight or feeld, Since bothe their hartes and sence be slackt how ca thei chose but yeeld For where the vitall sprites doe want, how can the body saie. I will performe when natiue power, is growne into decaie, How maie it bee that when the launce, is fixed in the reste, And foe in sight that he can fight, that beares a wounded brest, The ende is this the valiaunt mynde, disdaineth Carpet Loue, For vadyng ioyes to valiaunt hartes, doe serue to no behoue: If therefore thou desirest fame, to venter in the feeld, Flie Venus snare whiche midst thy sight, will force thee for to yeeld Simonides hauyng ouer read these lines, and considered of the veritie thei conteined, began somwhat to growe in a muse, whiche Andruchio perceiuing, briefly folowed his quest thus: Now my deuoute and amorous gentilman, what thinke you of my Marciall Poete, hath he not painted out Loue in his colours, are you not perswaded he speaketh true? Dooe not you see how forceable his reasons are? O then betake your self fro your vaine Loue, to honour vertue, and accordyng to the state and nobilitie that the powers haue called you to, returne home and comfort your parentes, manifestly tormented in your absence, and if Clarinda your Mistres liste not wedde, there bee faire Ladies in Ciuell and as worthie of your likyng. Let my perswasions woorke in you, that whiche my freendes good counsaill brought to passe in me. But for that it is bedde tyme, I will referre the hearyng of your aunswere till to morrowe, at whiche tyme if you please, wee will farther discourse our purpose. Simonides with a troubled head, was conueighed to his lodgyng, where laiyng hym self doune to reste, deuisyng still of the speeches that had paste, many tymes ouer readyng the verses, and with as many commendations praised the writer, till sodainly a solemne remembrance of his Mistres, marred his whole determination, his minde daungerouslie, sometymes moued this waie, sometymes had recourse that waie, at this hower he would retourne home, at that present, he sware to continue a traueller, once he would continue Religious in the Fransiscans at Genoua , an other tyme he remembred the impossibilitie, in that he had taken on hym an other order, his minde wauered now this waie, now that waie: sleape could take no holde, his sences were so occupied, his fleshe perswaded hym to bee still amorous, the Spirite instructed hym, that the delightes of the fleshe were vicious. Sundrie thoughtes ouerburdened his fantasie, till the euaperation of the stomacke had procured the sences to silent rest. Luna (the Ladie of the wisemans thoughtes) behelde all this, and amorous Venus (the waiting maide of the night Mistris) laughed not a little, and eight howres imagination renued a twelue monethes malancholy: For no sooner did the Sunne appeare in the East, but the beames were bent on the face of our sleepie Simonides , who wakened in a sodaine began to renewe his ordinarie passion, which wrong hym so, that so soone as he was attyred, and that he had giuen humble thankes, and taken leaue of the courtious Andruchio , but that he departed (with a troublesome soule and a disquiete mynde) towardes Rome , beyng in mynde to searche for wisedome, where there is greatest infection of habomination, three Leagues had he trauelled, yet neuer a steppe without a teare, at the last he ariued at a faire and pleasaunt Cottage, in the whiche inhabited a graue and sage olde father, into whose house when he had entered, he founde all thynges neate and seemely, and passyng through into an Orcharde, he sawe our olde Maister prunyng his Trees, who amased at the first with his sodaine comming, yet reioyced with the sight of his Habite, whiche bare shewe of staidnesse, bad hym welcome, and leauyng his labour betooke hym self to entertaine his guest, who with greate humilitie and modestcie, aunswered and replied in eche cause, such dainties as he had the olde man gaue him: suche pleasures as were to be got in the Countrie he imparted to hym, and when their stomackes were full, thei began to Parle . Simonides tolde hym of his Countrie, of his Loue, and the rest you knowe how foolishe. The olde man made hym priuie to his name, whiche was Thomerchus , his Countrie, which was Genoua , his miserie, losse by Sea, and with teares bewailyng the mishappe of our Pilgrime, admonished hym in fewe wordes thus. I see to my great greefe (Gentleman and amorous Spanyarde) that Nature hath doen to muche for you, since you so wilfully abuse her: And not without sorrowe I complaine me, to see a religious Habite to couer an vngodly purpose: Haue you left your Countrie for loue? doe you goe about to bryng your fathers graie heares with sorrowe to his graue through your folly? will you onely be an open laughing stocke for Fortune to gibe at? O yong man, why runne your eyes awrye? or wherefore were you wanton in dyet, to make you so viscious in your dealinges, your pampered fleshe should haue been subdued with penitencie: these eyes should haue behelde no earthly pleasures, but heauenly and diuine essence, an instructable power, vnserchable, still prouident: Your feete should not haue followed errour, neither should your life haue helde lewdnesse for a Loadestone, if you haue reason, will you be brutishe? if chastitie be deuine, will you followe filthie lust? Small comforte is where muche trouble abideth: I maruaile in women what perfection should moue vs, what delight should intice vs. The greatest is an instaunt likyng, whiche quickly turneth to an after loathyng: For increase Femalles are good, but for decrease none so ill: as you order them so they followe you, if you constraine them thei bee impatient, if you praise them thei are proude, if you please them thei are wanton, if you seeke them thei scorne you, if you flye them thei followe you, if you leaue them you are happie. Their eyes are ministers of muche mischeef, the reflections of whiche, makes our Spryng tyme, colde Winter, who tasteth of their breathyng is Bedleme, who delighteth in their brauyng, will growe a begger. Now consider of this (good gentilman) and take an olde mannes counsaill to your yong witte. Let not your will rule you, least you runne awrie, abuse not this coate, nor make not your habite the shroude of an ill soule. Refuse the worlde, for it is daungerous, and remember your profession, for it is vertuous, you are by your order to cotemne this pilgrimage, in that you looke for a newe Ierusalem. You shall counte of this worlde, as the beautie of a Sommers Sunne, now rising, straight settyng: you ought to be deuoute, and continent, not ereligious and beastly. O abuse not a good name, mangle not vertue, remember your self, and forget not your soule, lette your bodie bee as coole, as your coate is comely, followe vertue, and she will finde you, seeke art and she will nourishe you, vse pacience and it will arme you, flye vice for it will harme you. But dooe I complaine this errour onely in you, no, no, I lament it in the cirquet of this whole Chaos , where I finde to my hartes greef, all tourned vpside doune, the Souldior to slauerie, the Lawman to corruption, the Merchaunt to couetousnesse, the meane man to craftinesse, the Deuine to Hypocrisie: Wee bee Philosotted , not Philosophers . Our hospitalitie is growne to high houses, our deuotions to Macheuelles pollicies, and were not their Magistrate vertuous, the Estate would bee reuinus. Wee will lamente follies vnder couert tearmes, and will ouerpasse many thynges, for that the worlde is giuen to see too muche, and happily he that winketh with one eye, maie see twoo errours. But I will tourne to you gentilman, and in your title I will open my minde, I haue been riche, of great possession. Industrious, not altogether without vertue: I haue marked seasons, I haue vewed oportunities, when I was a worldlyng, I desired the increase of my too muche, I now contemne the worlde, and accompte my pouertie, a happie prosperitie. While I florished I founde faire woordes, many mouth freendes, fine fauners, cunnyng flatterers. The Sea had no sooner swallowed vp my redde yearth, but freendship, pleasure, and companie forsooke me, and beeyng in wealthe compassed with Millions of freendes. In my want, I scarce founde one that would afforde me a good woorde. The state of the worlde is as I tell you, and if it failed me in this, it will not alwaies flatter you in loue. And now (as you see) I am here at rest, I take little care, my pleasure is muche, my recreation farre better then Citie Musicke, my repaste is dressed without vigilante care, I prepare myne owne prouision, and to conclude, if my fruite growe well, I am the more merier. I liue here, and laugh at the worlde, that lowreth on me, and since I haue not long to staie, I prepare my self towardes my iourney, I vse cotinencie to subdue my bodie, and praier to make readie my soule: I leaue the thinges that make worldly, and followe vertue whiche is heauenly. This armour if you would put on you, your Loue would not bee fixed on a woman, but fastened to contemplation. In soothe I see not what one pleasure should disorder thee thus: the commoditie thou seekest for is gotte with care, and kepte without quiet: And when thou art in possession, thou wishest a newe choyce, thou rouest blindfolde at a wrong marke. The glisteryng gleme, is not pure golde, it shall perishe Pilgrim, it shall perishe: Wilt thou then bee passionate, for thinges that are not permanent? Wart thou wrong for Loue, diddest thou trauell for Loue, & thou denied Loue, & yet wilt thou needes Loue? If thou be reasonable, helpe thy self, if thou be brutishe, leaue thy habite, incline thine eare to wisedome, which though it bee better in digestion, yet it is cordiall to the receiuer. Let to bee foolishe, leaue to bee amorous, and striue to bee vertuous, loue contemplation, forsake misdemeanoure, and since thou hast seen muche, practise a little, forget this errour, leaste you incounter with more, if you maister not this euill, it will increase incredible inormitie, as the nature of the Crocodill, is to deuoure in weepyng, so the condition of Loue is to corrupt the Soule. The Salamander delighteth in the fire, in whiche bathyng her limmes, receiueth recreation. A wise man findeth his owne errour, incident to his corrupte nature, will mitigate the humours, and restore reason to his due course. The Icknenmon of Egypte , armeth her self at all poinctes against the sodain assaultes of the Aspis her enemie: A prouident soule will euery waie endeuour to withstande all hinderaunces, the teares of the Bore are sweete, the teares of the hart are bitter, the perswasions of vice, pleasaunt, the countermaunde of vertue corrosiue, eche errour beares a shewe, euery vertue a substaunce, tymes misused, daies misspente, howers misled, all reconed runesse all to ruine. It is Idelnesse made Simonides amorous, where if industrious studie had preuailed, he has quickly lefte his follie. Let youth applie his hedde, rather to be occupied with wholsome counsaill, then with homely conditions, with godlie meditations, then gracelesse actions. A friuolous pleasure is Loue, a bitter sweete, a poysoned humour, a contumelious comforte, a deuilishe intent. Leander swimmes the Seas and sinkes for Heroe, Medea mangles her Infant, and all for Iason, Hercules was poysoned by Neseus , O wicked Minister Dianara : But these be fabulous, will you knowe religious examples, looke on Samson and curse Dalida , bewaile Dauid & mislike Barsabe : if Adam fell thank Eue , if Troy destroyed curse Menelaus Harlot, if Troylus died woe to Cressida : the daie would soner faile me, then examples should not fit me, but I imagine to a wise man that this is sufficient. Apply your mynde therefore (good Pilgrime) to some other profession, and seeke to passe your tyme in vertuouse and profitable pleasures, returne from your accustomed folly, and let slippe your necke out of the coller of this incumberaunce, more easie is it for a wise man, and more praise worthy to conquer fleshe, then to compasse hidden secrete: and impossible it is to be learned, where loue ruleth our affections: for the very badge of loue is idlenesse, the best rest, corrupt delightes, the final ende repentaunce, a right sause to so fonde a dyet. Let this therefore suffice thee Hermite, that experience inforceth thee that loue is foolishe, and lett my perswasions incinuate thus muche, that thou maiest become from a louer of corruption, to be a follower of vertue. There is no errour more pernicious, then that whiche appeareth in the Habite of vertue, no wickednesse more to be eschewed, then that whiche beareth a shewe of holinesse: though thy youth perswades thee, that all thynges shall fall out happily, and thy loue shall be a comforter to thy bodie, and a contentment to the mynde, yet beleeue wisedome, which acknowledgeth the iudgement of youth to be self will, and that bothe the marowe and the bone, are perished by carnall delightes. Easely maiest thou bee aquited of this incombraunce, if thou leade a willyng mynde to the performaunce of the behest of reason. Demostines accoumpted loue repentaunce, O sillie pleasure that is so slidyng: Petrache , a thyng that is honoured vnder the shape of a blindfolde shoter: O disordinat gouernour for reasonable men. Counsaile (my yong traueller) must coole your heate, you shall then finde the vehement misleadyng of vice. I will trouble you no more, I haue spoken this to profite you, now for my self, I am determined to returne to my worke, you maie if you please goe and looke on. Simonides takyng hym by the hand saied thus: nay graue father and good counsailer staie a little while, and it were but to receiue condigne thankes for your courtesie, I would followe your aduise, but I can not, I confesse all thynges you haue spoken to bee most certaine, but woe is me I lett them slipp, by reason of a sodaine remembraunce of my sweete Mistris: Wherefore I most humbly thanke you for my good cheare, and the greate courtesie you haue shewed me, crauyng you so muche to stande my frende, as to set me the right waie towardes Rome , and to tell me if any companie haue past thetherwarde before. The olde Gentleman aunswered him thus, amorous Pilgrime I sorie thou art so fonde, yet glad that my simple dyet pleaseth thee, I sawe a traueling Pilgrime but euen before thy commyng passe that waie, if you hye you quickly you shall soone ouer take hym. The derect waie is this hye waie, which if you keepe you can not misse, and thus hauyng shewed you what courtesie I can, I will goe and occupie my self about my accustomed affaires. Thankes and leaue quickly past betweene them, the one is gone to his worke, and our Simonides with many imaginations, passed on his waies the more speedily to ouertake a companion, he had not traueiled many Leagues, but he ouertooke the Pilgrime that our olde Segnior had tolde hym of; whom he gently saluted, and demaunded the place to whiche he had appoincted his Iorney: the other gently aunswered, it was to Rome : and thether goe I ([quoth] Simonides ) and would be glad of your companie: and I of yours aunswered the other: Thus bothe were quickly agreed, and on thei stalked with as muche speede as thei might. Simonides in his malancholy dumpes, the other with delightfull appearaunce, and many pleasaunt noates, two mates of vnequall disposition. Long thei traueiled ere the one gaue any greate eye to the other, at the last, the yong fellowe Pilgrime perceiued the teares to fall from the eyes of Simonides , whereupon he gently demaunded the cause of his sorrow, to whom Simonides aunswered thus. Truely (courtious freende) I am ashamed to open the truthe, but reason is, I should not dissemble, with a courtious demaunder: It is Loue that maketh me lament, that moueth me to malancholy, and inforceth me to bee solitarie: the remembraunce of Clarinda my Mistris in Ciuill , hath driuen me from my Countrie, made me abandon my frendes, and forsake all pleasures, and now that I am growne to contemplat on her beautie, whose perfect nature hath subiected my sences to thraldome, I am dismaied at my hard Fortune, and wishe that either I had not seen my Mistres, or that she had loued. The other Pilgrime named Anthonio , enterrupted hym thus: Signior , are you fled for Loue, are you subiecte to suche follie, truely your Nature is farre dissidente from myne, who haue left my countrey, for that I could not Loue, but beeyng profered a faire Ladie, exceading, bothe for beautie and riches I refused her vtterly, and to auoide the oportunitie that might followe, and the importaunte commaunde of my Father, I conueighed my self from Mantua , the Citie where I was borne. Did you so ([quoth] Simonides ) truely you were the more worthie blame, I thinke you infortunate, in refusyng suche an offer. And truely I holde you vnwise (saied Anthonio , in esteemyng of so bad a pleasure, I can not see what fantasie should perswade me to Loue, nor what commoditie is in it sufficiente to alure man to likyng, it mangeleth the bodie, distempereth the memorie, and settes all desire of wisedome at a baie, and for my self, I deeme it more fitter for me to bee naturally blinde, then foolishely besotted, for the one bereueth me but the beholding of vaine delightes: the other maketh me to inforce my self and to wrest my Nature to myne owne wracke. Why Anthonio , (saied Simonides ) are you so vnwise to mislike of that, whiche in this worlde is the onely comforte, and greatest blisse wee maie desire, why repugne you against Nature, whiche hath made vs all for societie: the brute beastes loue their females, and should naturall men desire to bee solitarie: Truely, the eye that loatheth to beholde beautie, is vnworthie to contemplate the heauens. Appetide is naturall, and what thyng vnder the cope of heauen, is more earnestly to be sought after then beautie, whiche conceiueth no blemish, and concerneth the light of the bodie, to youthe a wedded faire freende is a pleasure, to age a comforte, to bothe cordiall. How many cares are disburdeined from a maried mannes thought, how many domesticall troubles are asswaged by the procuration of a good houswife. But leaue mariage, speake of mutuall consent, how easily digesteth the man freende his misfortune, by the good aide of the femall? If counsaile faile hym, how is he holpen in the execution of any cause, wherein a womans witte can woorke wonders, and for a readie shifte, who more able, to salue matters none more meete, and to reuenge iniuries they are well armed, by Nature to procure freendship, thei can doe it orderly, to alaie hatred none more speedily. If you loue them, thei are full of mercie. Their Natures are flexible to all impressions, and readie to performe all pleasure: A faire damosell, a double benifite, a bedde freende, a daie counsailer, a night pleasure, a daie profite. How runne you therefore paste the limites of reason) Anthonio ) when you forsake so greate an offer, refuse so faire a Ladie, and let slippe so greate a commoditie. You must leaue misspeakyng of so worthie a delight, and misdeemyng of so precious a treasure as beautie. Flatter not your self in your owne follies, allowe of Loue, for it is benificiall to all, and enemie to none, commodious to them that esteeme it, reconciler of those that doeth hate it. And for you (Pilgrime) caste of your habite, and retourne home to receue so blessed a benefite. But O vnfortunate I, that would enioye suche a commoditie and can not come by it. Often haue I praied, and neuer haue pleased, diuerse tymes I haue seemed humble, and still been shaken of dispightfully, so that worthely shal you bee punished, who seeyng my sorrowe, and will not take example by my mishappe, and esteeme of her, who I knowe sorroweth for you. Well Anthonio , chaunge bothe your coate and copie, retourne home, you were better to bee married to contentment, then trauell to your farther distresse: looke backe yet in tyme, and remember your parentes, who (I am assured) you should wonderfully please, in becommyng obediente to their commaunde, and by fulfillyng the matter thei doe intimate vnto you, accept their offer, and leaue to contemne good counsaill. Signior Anthonio , some what mooued with the opinatiue discourse of parciall Simonides , aunswered hym thus. Good sir, when blinde men begin to iudge of coulers, wee shall haue ill paintyng, and when louers are so foolishe hardie, that thei will become counsailers, I am of opinion, that reason wil plaie banckroute: you haue made a large explication of Loue and Beautie, and yet in verie truthe, to a verie little purpose, for that you take in hande to teache him, who indeede is able to instructe you, your opinion is vnnecessarie, in that it dependeth on self will, I can not allowe you for a rightfull Iudge, sith Loue hath made you bothe blind and partiall. Rethoricall perswasions abounde in your long exhortatorie, but where woordes pase without witte, better and more seemely were it, to close vp your conceiued errour with silence. Loue is good in your opinion, yet moste desolute in myne. Beautie more then acceptabled (perhappes honourable) in your conceipte, but Lorde how loathsome in myne eye, some thynges seeme to be & are not, some other are and seeme not, & for your good in showe, I meane not to make sale of my vertue in substance: You highly growe in praise of women, but how muche faile you, when you accompte of them for vertuous, when sith their firste creation, thei still shewed them selues to bee altogether brittell. How can you commende them for constancie? If not for that, how for witte? A straunge stratageme hath Fortune wrought in you, that hath blearde your eye so muche with follie, and hath linkte your opinion to the worste certaintie that maie be. You praise Beautie, what more vadyng, you honour Beautie, what more corrupt? You sorrowe for Beautie, what more foolishe? I deeme it better to continue solitarie, then to liue in temptyng companie, where eyes bee luers, and euery wanton Lasse a maimed Faulcon. The worlde maie iustly laugh at you, who esteeme of the verie outcastes of Nature, preferryng them before the moste exquisite Paragons of the worlde. Women were made, but to what ende? To keepe manne companie, but thei corrupt hym. Women are loued, for what cause, for procreations sake, and (Lorde) how vnhappie are many of them in their children? No fruite passeth from them, but either bryngeth care, or sorrowe, care to prouide for a toward childe, sorrowe to preuente the practises of a wicked sonne. But because I haue touched the small commoditie that groweth by the mutuall consort of man and woman, you maie bee captious, and conclude that I denaye multiplication in the worlde, whereby the vniuersitie of mankinde should be anichilated: but suche purposes be farre from my thought, and could wishe this, that men would so vse their women, as the Amasons did their housebandes, at two seuerall tymes in the yeare to further nature, for the rest, to leaue them to honest and vertuous occupation, by that meanes it would come to passe that their superioritie would cease, man should bee man in deede, and women should be no more the woe of man. Truely amorous Simonides (for now must I some what discourse with you) you are blinde if you see not the abuses in Loue, and the follies of Louers. How many nightes watchyng, how many daies weeping, how many howers sewyng, and yet how little profiting, how lauase profusnesse in apparrell, and in the ende how little estimation for seruice. Be it, you inioye the thyng you shoote at (your faire Mistris) what gaine you if she bee fruitfull, store of care, if barraine, lost labour, to conclude, you spende both your pence and your perfection. In Loue, your fliyng Aungelles must fleete abroade, to fetche newe fascions from Uenetian Curtisans, to please your demy honest Mistris: who if she mislike, will loure, and if you be some what moued with her madnesse, and beginne to flye out, she will with a fained teare quickly fetch the foole in: then confesse you to her you haue doen amisse, when in deede she hath moste abused you, then beseeche you her, who should bee suppliaunt to you, and serue that Sainct on your knees, that honoureth the Deuil in her harte. Thus in foolishe loue (good Lorde) how many vices, after fallyng out truce, after truce some trouble, now a braule, straight abuse. And are thei not fooles that are besotted with this errour: before God I am ashamed, that where your Countrie affordeth you so many spectacles of this folly, you are yet still enemie to your owne discretion. Did euer the worlde beholde a more president of folly, then in Don Diego , who for a scornefull regarde of Geneuera his compeare, forsooke the state of a Knight, whiche he had worthely achiued before the Emperour, left his widowe mother, and with a base mynde, to muche besotted with an iniurious Ladie, he became a sorrowfull and solitarie Hermite in the Pereneyan Mountaines, and when as the worlde knew most certainly the light estimation of his fleetyng Mistris, yet had not Rodrigo ruled by threatnyng, more then perswasion, the inestimable crueltie of Geneuera , foolish Don Deigo had perished. Truely truely tis a mad worlde, and more then miserable, when yong men, who (in truth) should imploie their daies in achiuyng honour, will tende their indeuours to be effiminat. If men would not sewe to beautie, beautie would seeke to them: but when we giue an vnruly Colt the raines, he will runne hedlong, and so he maie hurt his Ryder, he esteemeth not the spending of his owne fleshe: I could neuer yet finde in any age, that beautie was continuable, the folly therefore is not pardonable, in them which delight in such transitorie pleasures. I would haue Gentlemen vse their eyes in viewyng beatie as Diogines did his Tubbe to take the Sunne, to traine them as the gleme leadeth, and if Alexander (I meane folly) bereaue the heate (I meane reason) let them refuse her offers, and content them selues with sight and be not besotted. If you that heare this ( Simonides ) would now conceiue, if you mynded not to carie an obstinat eare, this were sufficient to perswade you, and make you forsake Loue. Simonides not able to disgest this inuectiue of Anthonio , in these tearmes interrupted hym thus. I must not suffer your high reprochfull tauntes, couched vnder so odious vniuersalities so to slippe, neither maie a reasonable man (consideryng your vnreasonable discourse) beare with you in your madnesse: You dispraise Loue, and count freendes vnited with that inuiolat leauge foolishe. But how vnwisely you minister this reporte, let the worlde iudge: first in fabulous and Ethnick Philosophers, we finde Loue bothe honourable, and inuested with high tytle, so that the Goddes them selues of fained fourmes, and fained authoritie, were said to be sobiect to the Shaft of Cupid , and a sure Maior and Minor maie be made to frame an apt conclusion in this, that the onely frute (whiche you count vnfortunate) is procreation, whiche indoubtedly is necessarie, & therefore profitable. Next, a vnityng and coupling two soules in one substaunce, making them equally passiue and actiue in Nature, whiche how noble a vertue it is, I referre to the decidyng of Schoolemen. To proue Loue to be heauenly, what greater reason then that it is not sublunare, but hath his Spheare within fewe degrees of Iupiter : And this is confirmable by the hole cataloge of Astronomers. If Loue then be heauenly, will you accompt Louers foolishe, are thei not perfected (thinke you) in the atainement of so deuine a tytle. My opinion (therfore Anthonio , is better then yours, who (in deede) is led by that whiche you attribute to be a folly in me, I meane self will: You scoffe at my counsailes, and refuse myne admonitions, and for that I incite you to honour glorious beautie: You gibe at my perswasions, but haue you not (thinke you) runne amisse, is not the eye of your vnderstandyng blinded: yes verely, for beautie is bothe exquisit in it self, and by Nature deliuered for a most precious ornament. For where the Lillie white is poudered with pure sanguine, it is iudicially to be conceiued, that the partie so indued, is possessed of an honourable, liberall, and heroicall mynde. Now that eye whiche beholdeth this faire feauture, if it haue preferred so braue a picter to the conceipt, can it be possible, but straight some impression must followe, whiche once beyng settled in our fantasie, and conceiued in our imagination, must needes procure some mutuall consent and agreement in the soule. Tell me now if this be not the worke of Nature, whom if we followe (as Tully saieth) we shall neuer doe amisse: what though the excellencie and rarenesse of beautie bee subiect to declining, it is therfore contemtible, no certainely: the Sunne that setteth euery night, is more ruddie the next morowe, and that pure sanguine that is resident in some one Paragon, in Nature is lineally imparted to the hole broode of the possesser: Since (therefore) it is still manifest, I count it continuall, and that In perpetuum . I thanke Fortune, for recomfortyng me with the delightfull remembraunce of my Mistres, she hath linkte my imagination, to the beste certaintie that maie bee, in that I am partaker of the contemplation of that whiche is heauenly, the memorie whereof in sorrowe makes vs glad: In mirthe, mendeth our cheare: In companie, makes vs more ioconde: In solitarie aboad, moste resolute. If these bee the fruites of Beautie, if this Cristaline licour proceede from so precious a Fountaine, I compte hym worthie to dye for thirst, that will not drinke of this Nectar. Diana hath vouchsafed you the sight of her sweete self. she is not so iniurious to you as to Acteon , she giueth you leaue vnder her saue condite, to discourse thus at your pleasure, but the tyme maie come, you maie bee well inough met with all. But maie it please you sir, why are women so highly contemned of you, wherefore is their companie odious in your sight. The reason is (I consider) that though the shape you carie, maketh shewe of a manne, yet the speeche you deliuer perswades me, you are more bruite then any beaste. Women, are bothe equall in creation, and of egall vertue, of more seemelinesse, and better vsage. Male and female created he them : and not first male and then female, examples of equall vertue. Beholde Thomiris , the noble Amazonian Queene, how valiantly reuenged she her self, on renowned Cirus , and how iuste a draught alowed she hym, who liuyng was a murtherous incrocher. For seemelinesse, how muche thei excell vs, lette our owne eye bee Iudge. In their vsage, how demure, a gentill woorde requited with a Conge , an iniurious reproche, with a bashefull regarde: All thynges orderly, nothyng indiscretly. And yet these bee thei whom Anthonio contemneth, O to too wise man, whiche confoundest thy iudgement, in that thou seemest to see too muche. These eyes of yours, should (if thei were reflectiue) haue some remorse on exceedyng Beautie, neither if reason were your Maister, should you so muche haue mangeled the honour of renowned Ladies: Euery vertue in Loue, is a vice with you: Euery nightes watching, euery daies walking (and what not) you conclude at your owne pleasure. But tell me now, doe not men of moste wisedome, indeuor with muche trauell to attaine vertue. Dooe not men of valure sleepe littell, labour muche, to attaine honour? Dooe not Marchauntes, toile by Sea, poste by lande, to possesse riches. And should not Louers be readie to beare the burthen of all misfortune, to the ende to achiue so roiall a reward as Beutie? what worldely mucke should holde me, or hard attempt withdrawe me, or humble praier withholde me, but I would attaine the toppe of my desire. If you knewe ( Anthonio ) the ioye, the comforte, and recreation that is conuersaunte with Beautie, you would doe penaunce, and martyre your self, for abusyng so high an estate as Cupids is, had you been but priuie to the aucthoritie of the God, or the furie of his Mother, and knewe by proofe so well as I, how the case standeth, you would with all humilitie retourne home, and kisse your Mistres feete to attaine her fauor. Take my counsaill ( Anthonio ) and bee not obstinate, better were it for you to take the stripes of a freend, then the kisses of a flatterer, to learne your lesson of a man of experience, then to giue self will to muche scope. You make roddes for your owne taile, and perswasions againste your self, and indeuour to bryng examples out of Spaine for your purpose, where wee finde no suche recorde. It maie be in Italie, that Don Diego was amorous and constant, it maie bee Geneuera was cruell and discourteous, and what of this, doe not Princes on hym thei esteme moste, exercise all trialles, prison and promotio, to the ende to trie the secret corners of his Nature, and thinke you Loue hath not the like trialles, to examine the fidelitie of his traine, he smiled firste on our Italians, againe he lowred. He lowred once on Geneuera , at laste, laughed on them bothe, where the conclusion should shutte vp all their sorrowes; and thei bothe were partakers of mutuall pleasures. Therefore, as your opinion is vaine, so bee your reasons of no value, thei carrie small sence, for the vtterer is vnreasonable. You passe further, and compte tyme loste that is spente in Loue, and I thinke Loue moste pleasaunce, that is compassed in tyme, for the harder the aduenture is in gainyng, the more pleasure is there in the achiuyng. For your comparisons, because thei bee odious, I winke at them, wishyng, you had either suckt more milke, or learned more witte of your mother, for your fathers child is to fumishe. Now at the laste you come in with a tale of a Tubbe, and that concludes I knowe not what, the whiche (of trothe) I accompte as friuolous, the fruites of an idell braine, and the imaginations of a yong hedde, wherevpon, in good felloweship ( Anthonio ) I praie thee leaue these vnsauerie inuectiues, and learne this lesson of me, neuer dispraise till thou haste proued, if the faulte bee ministered, thou maiest boldelie accuse, meane tyme, sette a side all contumelious reproches, and vnwiste confutations, and bee not bis puer , before thou hast been semel senex . You are trauellyng to Rome, where if your errour should bee bewraied, you should bee crucified for an hereticke, our curtisans would offer a Ducate a peece, to make thee beare a Faggette, our holie Father would barre thee of his blessyng: and darreigne thee from thy Couent, and vncase a slouen of his habite, no place should bee lefte for you, no pleasure shewed you, no hoste to intertaine you, vnlesse perhappes, some pretie noppes to make a ridyng stocke: would graunt you a breakefaste, and after she had laughed her fill, giue you Iacke Drommes, entertainment, and thrust the contemner of Beautie, the dispraiser of Loue, the despiser of women, and the disparager of their honours, out of the doores. Then it will so come to passe, that with many floutes thou shalt leaue Rome, and bee inforced to retourne home, where with shame inough your parentes will receiue you, and with open exclamations, the Maidens of Mantua will deride you, then will you wishe you had been wise, and remember Simonides was a true Prophet. Take counsaill in tyme, or els bee partaker of your owne destruction, and reclaime your self before you bee espied, otherwise, my self (who at your amendement would reioyce) at your continuaunce will scorne, and account you for an obstinat Hereticke, vnworthie to haue residence amongst the societie of men. Anthonio hauyng giuen hym skope to discourse his fill, to driue the man into more malancholy, replied thus. Now by your leaue (gentle Louer) lett me speake, and giue me tyme to tell a homely tale. You haue bin in Heauen, you haue tryed secretes of Nature, you haue waded as farre as mans witte will serue you, and now in the windyng vp you haue concluded iust nothyng. Certainely, Loue hath made you madde, you imagine euery painted Sepulcher a perfite and beautified personage, or (which is more likely) you are so grounded in conceipt of that whiche is not, that the worlde might esteeme, you haue forgot your self. What wise man would haue delated so farre in praise of his owne foolishe fancie, or what is he (of discretion) would accompt one iot of your circumstaunce reasonable. Beautie hath diuers patternes to set her sutes to saile, and folly hath alowed sundrie sortes of eyes to like and choose. That whiche pleaseth one man, is misliked of an other, and where bothe seeme to see moste, an other that can iudge of colours, will confirme a third opinion. Thus likyng growes ad infinitum , and euery fancie hath his forme, and neuer a forme without a folly. All hookte nosed men are not Ciceroes , neither eche that hath a scarre on his cheeke is Alexander . This simple sotte will haue this good, this curious foole condemnes that for base, euery man thinketh his owne sight and iudgement best: but I esteeme most of his credite, whose eye is not parciall. I will talke farther with you ( Signior Simonides ) and wil call your Queene of folly from Heauen, and let her (if she can) decide the controuersie. The Poetes faine Loue the sonne of a woman, a lasciuious Ladie, her sonne either was borne blinde, or otherwise he is blinded, but see he can not. He shooteth and she derecteth, to conclude, Lecherie aimeth. The Arrowes that wounde are sightes, the sightes that indomage, are the ministers of a licencious bodie, the subiect staieth the Lorde, the tyme and opertunitie is, when the braine is vnoccupied: And now (my louyng Pilgrime) to tell you the very truth, the hole birth, beginnyng, woorkyng and endyng of Loue, it beginneth in corruption, it is continued in folly, and it endeth in repentaunce. And can you (with all your Philosophie) make this heauenly. Now, you that professe to see all thynges, are starke staryng blinde if you conceiue not this. And yet you (forsooth) will be counted wise, who is moste subiect to greatest folly. Doe I nippe you Simonides , naie I will bite you more bitterly, I haue my lesson at fingers ende, naie, I haue truth on my side, and therefore the more able to ouerthrowe your foolishe surmises. When euer sawe you a man of wisedome or staidnesse, a man of studie or discipline, that hath bin beaten with these misfortunes: truely none, Loue hath no force but in twoo sortes of men, the one youthly and idle, the other olde and licencious. A youthly idle man sleepeth in sinne, afflicteth his owne soule, mispendeth his tyme, consumeth his goodes, impaireth his good name, wasteth his landes, consumeth the very marrowe of his bones, he followeth errour, and is eated vp in errour: and thus his daies, his thoughtes, his good opinion, and instinct of vertue, his braue personage and ripe witte, are altogether lenified and laied lowe, by this onely sinne, and fitte of franticke desire. An aged man vnchast, disproueth the heares of experience, if he marrie, he maintaineth a woman to others vse, he liueth in suspicion, in Ielousie, in peruersnesse: the conclusion is, he hindereth his owne healthe, he distempereth his feeble bodie, with how many Ciatticas, Goutes, Stranguries, Coughes Crampes, and suche other, are thei possessed withall. A worthie reward for their vnsaciate demeanures, these bee the fruites of their follies, this is the rewarde of so vile a desaster, this synne cleaueth to the bones, it abateth the benefite of the bloud it dulleth the vitall powers, and euaporateth the commoditie of mannes increase. Now my louer, if reason haue any force in thee, canst thou chuse: but lament at thyne owne indescretion. O that thou diddest knowe, how the worlde laugheth to scorne our Louers: how it smileth at our foolishe practises, thou wouldest then desiste thy follie, and thanke me for my counsaill. Louers haue twoo sortes of followers, whiche wee maie tearme to bee the familiars, that is Baudes, and Flatterers. The firste, how greate mischeef they worke emongest yong Maidens, maried wiues, yea, and sometyme with suche as hath been accompted for staied Matrons. I referre it to the heedefull eyes of the wise, who with sorrowfull contempte, are faine to wincke at those misdemeanours, and to lamente the future ruine of many gallante gentilwomen. For Flatterers, what wonderfull incombraunces, dooe thei procure in a Common wealthe: how greate mischeef in a quiet State, that I wonder thei carrie suche credite, but especiallie, with menne of iudgement. O Loue, that blindest the harte, dullest the vnderstandyng, restrainest all good contemplation, and makest the bodie subiecte to actuall synne. None but vnreasonable menne would admitte flatteryng seruitours, all menne (excepte Louers) haue been able to espie the inormities of luryng tongues, it is fonde hope that leadeth freendlie Lechers to trust muche, to suffer faire speeches, to brooke greate abuses, and to esteeme euery faunyng pleasure, as some deuine commoditie. This ( Simonides ) is true, these are tried poinctes of practise, neuer a Curtisan in your Countrey, but can saie thy lesson by harte, and my thinkes you your self haue learned your lesson without booke, you are a Champion of Cupides , and a sworne Souldior to Loue, and for a little repentaunt pleasure (beleue me) you haue made your self a Mecocke. Be it I haue miste somewhat in declaryng of a Countrey, I am sure I haue little failed of the matter. Your Princely comparisons, are but pettie conclusions, whiche are as easie to decide, as thei are fondlie vttered, and more fitte to bee derided, then necessarie to be followed. For your constancie in women, you haue made a faire proofe, and I thincke for your grounded reasons, our Italian dames, will soner alowe you a Coxcombe, then an Atturnies fee. But (sir) let vs assende vnto your Goddes and Mistres laciuious Venus , looke vppon her Vulcan , he is Cornuted, and Mars had the vse of the feeld bedde to bothe their shames. Now (sir) consider with your self, if your greate goddesse be lauashe of her honour, who is your gouernour, and the directer of your proceedynges (as you saie) what hope of the reste that are but followers vnder that Ensigne. Truely you be accompanie of maimed Souldiors, and GOD knoweth, more hardie then wise: I can but wonder in conceipte, to see the inormities of luste, and the madnesse of those men whiche seeyng the flame, are not yet afraied of the fire, and beholdyng the fondnesse of others, can not yet refraine, from prosecutyng their owne follie to the ende. Well amorous Pilgrime, take my counsaile, leaue your mothers teate for toothlesse babes to disporte withall, and for it, betake your self to your booke, in which you shall finde such store of recreation, suche haboundaunce of comforte, suche increase of good nurture, as no fonde delightes shall sequester your thoughtes from vertue. Tyme draweth on daiely, your yeares multiplie, lett not your vertues decrease. If you had a will that intyced you to Loue, recouer now a witte, to see the errour in Loue, better counsaile can you not haue, more holsome aduise I can not giue you: If you be obstinat you harme but your self, if you accept of my courtesie, I proffer it freendly, if you take it as I meane it, you will followe it willyngly. I neither passe for the enterteinement of Romishe Curtisans, neither yet for the purueiaunce of my dyet, my fare shall be accordyng to my coate, simple and clendly. For our holy father he is mercifull, and I doubt not but if I sende a golden Duccat on my message to him, I shall finde pardon for more greater errours then I haue committed. Therefore ( Simonides ) these pleasaunt iestes of yours are inconuenient, because thei moue not, thei be newe nothynges for children, and no reasons to perswade men. It were good (therefore) you left your sportyng, and learne by my counsaile to keepe a meane, whiche if you doe I assure you, you shall neuer be subiect to Loue, nor subdued by lust, your state shalbe content, and your life shall be continent, no errour shall misleade you, no foolish fantasie shall feede you, no woman shall besotte you, no vice shall withdrawe you, no glaryng beautie shall intice you, and what knowledge but shall serue you. Simonides beeyng grated on the gall, began to spite out this inuectiue. Out dispiser of beautie and disparager of women, will thy railyng tongue neuer be reclaimed from blasphemie, shall I finde thee still contencious: O moste pernicious vice that hath entered his very bones, it is not credible a naturall man could speake thus. Did not these eyes beholde the power of the Goddes, did not this harte pitie the plague of the Sheapherde, did not this witte contriue the release of Titerus trouble, and should then myne opinion wrest with my sences, should I beleeue a shuttle witted Mecock , whom neither modestie gouerneth, nor honestie regardeth, whose broode should be amongst the Hircan Tygers, and birth amidst the sauage beastes of the Forrest. I abhorre thee Anthonio , I abhorre thee, I hate the grounde thou treadest on: Cupid , beare witnesse I speake it from my harte. You Louers, whose desire is to enioye your beautifull delight, to possesse incredible pleasures, to attaine vnto the Hauen of happinesse, where you maie waue your Ore of brittelnesse, despise this Pilgrime, abhorre his companie. Cities, disdaine to harbour hym: Diana , graunte hym no shroude in the Forrest. Ceras , let hym sterue for bread: Bachus , let hym want thy liquour: You droppyng heauens, let hym finde no water to moisten. Pluto , drie vp all the Welspringes of thy palace the yearth, where he commeth. You sacred Heremites, helpe to disroabe hym. Thou Yearth, swallowe hym quicke into thy Center. For me I defie thee Anthonio , I accompte thee an Hereticke, and so will leaue thee: Farewell too precise Puritan : Whiche saied, Simonides in a rage beganne to bee packyng, whiche Anthonio perceiuyng, desirous yet to laugh a littell more, he followed his former discours, and replied to his Inuectiue in this: You call me Puritan Simonides , I take you to bee one of the Famulie of Loue , if I bee to precise, thou art to peuishe: Your cursynges shall tourne to blessynges, and your vngodlie reasons, to your owne confusion: Your little witte makes you so wilfull, and to a man that is besotted in foolishe Loue, good counsaill is as a blaste of winde, you haue tasted of the floudde Lethe , and you haue now forgotten your self, that you are Simonides , and trust me Loue hath made thee madde. And I see there is no waie to reclaime thee, till thou hast been pinchte with pouertie, plagued with necessitie, and pinde with all discommoditie, this must bee the meane, to make Simonides knowe hym self, and this is the onely remedie, whiche you maie perceiue the abuse of your follie. So now Simonides , if you please, you maie to Rome before, and if you like not my companie, you maie passe at your pleasure, and I can followe at myne owne leasure. Simonides , without any woorde, went as faste as his feete could carrie hym, blowyng out in his furie, all the curses he could imagen againste Anthonio , who (indeede) had giuen hym good counsaill. Anthonio , followed easilie on, laughyng verie hartely, to see the follie of our Spanishe Louer. Long traueiled Simonides pensiue, and verie heauie, full of displeasure, euery waie Melancholie, and fretted with sorrowe: euery pace with this passion, euery steppe with that studie. Truely it is straunge to see the weaknesse of men, whiche are infected with this follie, he is apte to receiue no good instructions, but the more he is laboured with wholsome admonitions, the faster he followeth his errour to the ende. Pandora hath opened her boxe, and filled the aire with her infected fumes: for this is now the gise of the worlde, these be the footesteppes of follie, these are the vices, that eate vp all our seedes of vertue: These make the bodie weake, the members vnnecessarie, our hope frustrate, our harte dissolute, takyng awaie bothe the beginnyng and endyng of honeste life, and makyng vs loathsome in the eye of the worlde. Gentilmen and faire Ladies, this is deuised for the pleasure and profite of you, here maie you (as it were in a Mirror) behold bothe vertue and vice, the good and bad, how muche the one profiteth, how greatly the other hindereth: If you se that Loue is daungerous, full of inormities, subiecte to inconuenience, refuse it, and let your owne knowledge make you contemne it, if you finde that vertue is honourable, makyng vs renowmed in the worlde, and to leaue an immortall name of honour to our posteritie, hunte after her, she derecteth all thinges in mediocrite, so that if you seeke her, you shall neuer bee subiect to inconuenience: if you delight in her, you shall haue the wealthe of the worlde, and the perfecte habite of a deuine soule. What made Caesar to be dyefied, but his vertue, what caused Erostratus to be infamus, but his vices, in Caesar honour for maintainyng the common state, in Erostratus shame, for burnyng the famous Temple of Diana, Catalyne , for conspiraces against Rome , chronicled for an enemie to the Empire, Tully , for findyng out his conspiraces, was honoured with the tytle of Pater patrie : Uertue hath two workynges, soule and bodie, the soule by it is made a partaker of deuine intelligence, communicateth with Aungelles, and besides, hath relation to the brightnesse it shall possesse: whiche beyng seuered from the bodie, it shall be made heauenly. The bodie by vertuous demeanure, hath habitude, liberalitie,
