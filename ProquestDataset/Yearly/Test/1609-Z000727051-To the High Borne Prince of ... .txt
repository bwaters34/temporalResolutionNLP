 Offerd to Change, and greedie Funerall; Yet still your Homer lasting, liuing, raigning; And proues, how firme Truth builds in Poets faining. A Princes statue, or in Marble caru'd, Or steele, or gould, and shrinde (to be preseru'd) Aloft on Pillars, or Pyramides; Time into lowest ruines may depresse: But, drawne with all his vertues in learn'd verse, Fame shal resound them on Obliuions herse, Till Graues gaspe with her blasts, and dead men rise. No gould can follow, where true Poesie flies. Then let not this Diuinitie in earth (Deare Prince) be sleighted, as she were the birth Of idle Fancie; since she workes so hie: Nor let her poore disposer (Learning) lye Still Bed-rid. Both which, being in men defac't; In men (with them) is Gods bright Image ras't. For, as the Sunne, and Moone, are figures giuen Of his refulgent Deitie in Heauen: So, Learning, and her Lightner, Poesie, In earth Present his fierie Maiestie. Nor are Kings like him, since their Diademes Thunder, and lighten, and proiect braue beames; But since they his cleare vertues emulate; In Truth and Iustice, Imaging his State; In Bountie, and Humanitie since they shine; Then which, is nothing (like him) more diuine: Not Fire, not Light; the Sunnes admired course; The Rise, nor Set of Starres; nor all their force In vs, and all this Cope beneath the Skie; Nor great Existence , tearm'd his Treasurie: Since not, for being greatest, he is Blest; But being Iust, and in all vertues Best. What sets his Iustice, and in his Truth, best forth (Best Prince) then vse best; which is Poesies worth. For, as great Princes, well inform'd and deckt With gratious vertue, giue more sure effect To her perswasions, pleasures, reall worth, Then all th'inferiour subiects she sets forth; Since there, she shines at full; hath birth, wealth, state, Power, fortune, honor, fit to eleuate Her heauenly merits; and so fitte they are Since shee was made for them, and they for her: So, Truth, with Poesie grac't, is fairer farre, More proper, mouing, chaste, and regulare, Then when she runnes away with vntruss't Prose; Proportion, that doth orderly dispose Her vertuous treasure, and is Queene of Graces; In Poesie decking her with choicest Phrases, Figures and numbers; when loose Prose puts on Plaine letter-habits; makes her trot, vpon Dull earthly businesse (she being meere diuine); Holds her to homely Cates, and harsh hedge-wine, That should drinke Poesies Nectar; euerie way One made for other, as the Sunne and Day, Princes and vertues. And, as in a spring, The plyant water, mov'd with any thing Let fall into into it, puts her motion out In perfect circles, that moue round about The gentle fountaine, one another raysing: So Truth, and Poesie worke; so Poesie blazing, All subiects falne in her exhaustless fount, Works most exactly; makes a true account Of all things to her high discharges giuen, Till all be circulare and round as heauen. And lastly, great Prince, make and pardon me; As in a flourishing, and ripe fruite Tree, Nature hath made the barke to saue the Bole;
