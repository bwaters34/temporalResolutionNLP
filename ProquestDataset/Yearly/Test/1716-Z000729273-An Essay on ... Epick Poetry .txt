 found out the Merit of that excellent Poem; and, by communicating their Sentiments to their Friends, propagated the Esteem of the Author, who soon acquir'd universal Applause. This Curiosity spreading among Persons of Poetical Genius and Critical Taste, and animated by the Treatise of Bossu on Epick Poetry, which about this Time was brought over from France, the finer Spirits of the Age began to enquire into the Nature and Qualities of it, and enter'd much farther into this Subject, than the Grammarians and Commentators had done before; who only hover'd on the Surface, but never ventur'd into the Depths of Heroick Poetry. Now it was that Mr. Dryden adorn'd several of his Discourses in Prose, by interspersing various useful Observations on this Subject. Mr. Rymer at the same time publish'd his judicious Remarks on Epick Compositions, together with his more copious Dissertation on Tragedy. Not long after, the Appearance of Prince Arthur increas'd this growing Ferment, by ingaging the Poets and Criticks to exercise their Reflection on this kind of Writing, that they might be qualify'd, as they favour'd the Author and his Design, to sink or support the Reputation of the Poem. In the Preface to that Poem, I have given a Draught of this Species of Poetry in little; which however, I imagine, exhibits the intrinsick Nature and essential Properties of it in a clear, tho not a diffusive Light; and lately a judicious Critick, in his Discourses on Milton, has deserv'd well of the Polite World, by his curious and rational Observations, which at once have advanc'd the Knowledge of Heroick Poetry, and given an excellent Example of the free Exercise of Reason in Criticism. SINCE that, a very laudable Translation of some Books of the Iliad, with a Promise of the rest, and an accurate Edition of Spenser's Works have been publish'd, with Critical Remarks prefix'd by the ingenious Writers. BY this it appears, that this great and elevated manner of Writing is now study'd, and that at present the Epick Taste is in Fashion. Our Poets apply to this Subject from a Principle of Emulation; and whoever wishes well to Mankind, and desires the Honour of his Country, will encourage their Labours, and give to each his just share of Applause. Nor will the Contests among Poets themselves about Superiority have any ill Effect, if the Patrons of Polite Learning impartially divide their Favours among them, according to their Degree of Merit. This Race of Men are of a delicate and nice Complexion, full of Suspicion and Caprice, and as liable to be jealous of Competitors in Wit, as others are of Rivals in Love; and therefore should be consider'd as Poets, and be indulg'd in their little private Contentions; for it can never be expected, that while they aim at the Laurel, they should look kindly on others who stand in their way. OUR Wits and Beauties, in which this Island does equally abound, will, I imagine, at the same time become Enemies to Envy and Detraction; will caress with sincere Friendship those of the same Rank, propagate the Opinion of their Merit, and take delight in each other's Reputation. IT is remarkable, that about that Period of Time, when this Nation first express'd a greater Relish of Epick Poetry, they likewise began to taste the sublime Stile in Musick. We had, till now, contented our selves with light Tunes, and low familiar Airs, but now we aspire to higher Strains; we take Pleasure in Corelli's Compositions for the Instrument, and Buonancini's for the Voice; and nothing will now please, but what has something of the great Italian Manner: And as these Tastes of elevated Poetry and Musick began together, so they have kept an equal Pace in their Progress. TO accommodate my self to the prevailing Inclination of the Times, and promote the generous Design on foot of improving the Critical Knowledge of Epick Poetry, which is a boundless Field of delightful Contemplation, I have given to the Publick the following Essay; in which I have enquir'd into the Nature and Constitution of this sublime kind of Writing; I have lightly touch'd those Subjects which have already been exhausted by other Pens, and have been copious only, where, as I hope, I have improv'd and strengthen'd by new Arguments and Illustrations the common Opinions, which I believe are just; or where I have endeavour'd to confute others, which, tho generally received, I look upon as erroneous. ESSAY UPON EPICK POETRY . AFTER Aristotle's School, in the eldest Times of Christianity, had prevail'd over Plato , and the Colleges of Learning had universally submitted to their new Master, soon was his Authority so well establish'd, that for many Centuries his Doctrines became uncontested, and were receiv'd as first Principles, that needed no Proof or Demonstration. During many succeeding Ages, the Learning of Europe consisted in the Knowledge of this Philosopher's Opinions; and those only were applauded as eminent Scholars, who were the most laborious and skilful Commentators on his Writings. The voluminous Lucubrations of these idle Students, who only copy'd and expounded their Leader's Sentiments, which they follow'd with a blind Obedience, were esteem'd the only valuable Productions of Philosophy. At length arose some famous Worthies, who, animated by a generous Impulse to deliver Europe from the basest Servitude, that of the Understanding, attack'd Aristotle and his Adherents with great Vigour, declar'd against all arbitrary Impositions on the Mind, and asserted the Liberty of Reflection, and a Power of examining Evidence, and judging for themselves. These excellent Persons, who deserv'd so well of Mankind, by vindicating the Dignity of Humane Nature, and standing up for its Rights and Prerogatives, against the Usurpation of a particular Sect, having by an impartial Search discover'd that the Peripatetick System had nothing in it for its support, but precarious and unevident Principles, effectually expos'd its Weakness, and soon brought the greatest Authority, that was ever establish'd in the Schools, into general Contempt. Reason, had infus'd an active Ferment into the Minds of an ignorant and slothful Generation, by the Operation of which they were excited to throw off the Yoke of Aristotle in Matters of Philosophy, it is wonderful that the Effect was not more extensive. They had as great Reason to have proceeded to the Examination of his Rules in the Art of Poetry, and to have made Enquiry, if those were settled on better Foundations. But I know not how it came to pass, his Notions and Precepts in this Art have still remain'd unquestion'd and untry'd. The modern Criticks, contemning the Examples of the Philosophers, have still proceeded in the old beaten Track, of believing and admiring whatever Aristotle advances on the Subjects, where the Muses are concern'd. They are all like their submissive Predecessors, mere Expositors, scarce excepting Bossu himself, of the Writings of that great Man, and have made no Improvements, nor asserted the Liberty of Poetry, as the other freer Spirits have vindicated that of Philosophy. It's clear, that Aristotle form'd all his Axioms and Doctrines in Poetry, from the Patterns of Homer and other Greek Writers; and, without assigning any Reason of his Positions, relies for the Truth of them on his own, or the Authority of those Authors. But it is not the Authority of the greatest Masters, but solid and convincing Evidence, that must engage our Belief, and make us subscribe to any Maxims in any Art or Science whatsoever. common Erudition; but will no more submit to him as a Law-giver of the Poets, than of the Philosophers. I shall always pay Respect and Deference to his Judgment and Opinions, tho not acquiesce in them as infallible and decisive Decrees. And if Men, from a generous Principle of Liberty, would renounce the unjust, tho prevailing Power of Authority, and claim their natural Right of entring into the Reason of Things, and judging for themselves, it is highly probable that the Art of Poetry might be carry'd on to greater Degrees of Perfection, and be improv'd, as Philosophy has been. celebrated Writers, Men would soon disregard the crude and unreasonable Assertions, frequently laid down by injudicious Commentators and superficial Grammarians, whose Attainments consist in a Collection of Examples, and an Ability to explain the Roman and Grecian Authors: Nor will a modern Heroick Work be any longer acquitted or condemn'd, merely as it bears a Conformity or Dissimilitude to the Iliad or the Ã† neid ; but when future Criticks shall approve or censure an Epick Performance, they will produce clear Evidence from the Nature and Constitution of that kind of Poetry, to make good their Opinions; and not rely on the single Authority of ancient Writers, tho of the greatest Name, to support them: It will no more be allow'd an undeniable Proof of any Poet's erroneous and absurd Conduct, that he deviates from the Examples of Homer and Virgil ; nor will it justify him in any Instance objected to his Writings, that he has the Practice of those excellent Poets to bear him out. greater Judgment and Accuracy in his Discourses on Poetry, than in his Philosophical Productions; and therefore, tho the last, upon a just Tryal, have been exploded, yet the first have been esteem'd in all Ages by the Learned World as masterly Instructions, and continue undisputed to this Day; for this is still to press us only with the Authority of Aristotle and his Commentators. If his Rules and Precepts of Poetry ought to be so highly regarded, it must be upon this Account, That stronger Reasons can be produc'd in Defence of these, than of his System of Natural Science: But how can this appear, if we take his Writings on the Art of Poetry upon Content, and do not by an impartial Examination make it clear, that the Evidence of Reason is on their Side; which was wanting to support his Philosophy? And this, as far as I know, has not been attempted. Rules of Poetry, and was about to set up another System of Opinions and Precepts in their room; my Purpose is, to give them a fair Hearing, and if upon an impartial Tryal they appear to be built upon good Foundations, to confirm the Authority of the Greek Critick by the Force of Reason. But, on the other hand, I shall freely reject any Maxims, whether his, or those of his Commentators, which cannot be supported by any Arguments of Weight and solidity; and I shall use the same Liberty in adding any new Opinions on this Subject, which in my Judgment will improve the Art of Poetry. I have not, from a superstitious Veneration of Antiquity, that excessive regard for the Precepts of Aristotle and the Practice of Homer , as to receive them without Examination; for were they in every Instance just and right, as I believe they are in many, yet I am under no Obligation to submit to them, till they are demonstrated to be so by the Evidence of Reason. I must however acknowledge, that I have so great a Deference and Esteem for the Judgment of Aristotle , and the Examples of Homer and Virgil , that I shall not give them up, but where it is very clear, that they cannot be defended. Some Persons, whether out of a peculiar Curiosity of Taste, or Affectation of Learning, have all modern Productions in Contempt, and can relish nothing but what has an antique cast and an Air of Greece . These would prefer a ruinous Wall, if part of an ancient tho mean Structure, to the most beautiful and magnificent Palace, if newly built. They look on the Fragments of an old Author as an inestimable Treasure, while they allow nothing tolerable that is lately written, unless it bears a Conformity to the Plans of former Ages. Fathers of Learning, that they pay no respect to the Primitive Ages of Arts and Science; at least, they prefer all modern Productions in their several Kinds, to the most valuable Works of remote Writers. I shall endeavour to steer a middle Course between these Extreams. but content my self with a Discussion of those that relate to Epick Poetry; and, according to the Opinions which at present prevail among the Aristotelian Criticks, lay down the Definition of a Poem of that Species. To promote the free Exercise of the Understanding on the Subjects of Poetry, I shall examine the several Parts of an Epick Writing, and, setting aside Authority, will endeavour to shew how far the Rules in Fashion are upheld by Reason, and in what they appear by the same Light to be defective, and then frame a Definition more agreeable to Reason. According to the present Rules, an Epick Poem is a feign'd, probable, wonderful and allegorical Story, of a great Atchievement perform'd by some illustrious Person, extended by various Incidents or Episodes, and related in Verse, of the sublime Stile, to afford Delight and Instruction. excite Religious and Moral Passions, and elevate the Mind above low and vulgar Opinions, is a very reasonable Undertaking; and therefore this Species of Poetry, which has these Ends in view, is a laudable and noble Art; for what can be more desireable, than to cultivate the Minds of Men, and make them wiser and better, by correcting their false Maxims, freeing them from groundless Prepossessions, and inspiring them with generous Instincts and exalted Sentiments? Therefore this kind of Poetry, which of all others conduces most to this end, must be look'd on as highly valuable: And as upon this account it is most excellent in its own Nature, being employ'd upon the sublimest and most important Subjects; so by the almost universal and unanimous Suffrages of the ingenious and polite Part of Mankind, it has in all Ages been esteem'd the most difficult, as well as the most excellent Production of the Mind: Of which more hereafter. Heroick ; the first Appellation is deriv'd from the Greek Term ![](/images/inline/sbEgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , which is so far appropriated to Poetry, that it is scarce ever, or very seldom us'd by the Writers of Prose; for the Truth of which Assertion I rely on the Authority of Henry Stephens , whose consummate Skill in that Language is universally acknowledg'd by the Learned World, and its first and most common signification is a Word . Besides this, it is us'd by way of Eminency to signify an Heroick Poem; so Horace says, Fort e Epos acer, ut nemo, Varius duxit ; as if the Language of that Poetry was so rich, splendid, and sublime, that no other ought to be call'd Diction , or a Scheme of Words. The second Appellation, Heroick , ariseth from the Heroes, whose illustrious Actions are related in these Poems: And therefore Bossu does, in my Opinion, unjustly reject this distinguishing Epithet as improper; because, as he believes, it took its Rise from that Species of Verse call'd Heroick, that is employ'd in this Poetry. But were his Opinion true, as the contrary is evident, notwithstanding this and his other Objection, that Heroes are the Subjects of more kinds of Poetry besides this; yet Custom, which settles the signification of Words, and gives them their Purity and Propriety, has so far obtain'd among Learned Men in all Ages, that I shall not scruple from that Authority to use the Words Heroick and Epick indifferently in this Discourse. Action related in it is the great Atchievement of some illustrious Leader. Tho the first Notion of Heroick Vertue had its Rise from any eminent Benefactors, who had deserv'd well of their Country and of Mankind, by laying the Foundations of Cities and Empires, and by inventing useful Arts; such as planting the Vine, sowing Corn, curing Diseases, and freeing their Country from Plagues and wild Beasts; for which they were consecrated after their Decease, and worship'd as Demi-Gods or Heroes: yet at length it became appropriated to those, who with great Valour and Conduct had attack'd or defended a City, or defeated an Enemy in the Field. to express a Resemblance of any Object, either by Action or Imagination; the last of which taken in a larger Sense, may be subdivided into Imitation by the Power of Imagination, where the Ideas of the Mind bear a Similitude to Objects, that really exist or have existed; and that, where the Ideas of the Mind shew a Conformity or Agreement to feign'd Objects, which however are founded in Probability, and are capable of real Existence. In the first Sense, that is by Action, we are said to imitate when we form our Gestures, Habits, and Schemes of Life, by some Pattern or Exemplar, that we set before us. Thus one is said to imitate another in his manner of Walking, Dancing, or Singing; and one Poet, Orator, Architect, or Painter, one General or Statesman imitates another, on whose Model he endeavours to fashion himself. The second way of imitating, is by Imagination; which is nothing else but a Power or Faculty of framing Images, whence it plainly derives its Name; and this is of two sorts. real Objects which it conceives, it arises from the native Power of the Understanding to create Ideas that represent any external Object, and to draw, for its own Contemplation, Instruction and Delight, an endless variety of such intellectual Idols or Pictures, and to express them in a Scheme of Words; by which this Faculty is distinguish'd from the Arts of Painting and Sculpture, which represent the Archetype by Figures. Lineaments, and Colours. All Imitation, in proper speaking, is the Effect of Art; and 'tis in an equivocal Sense, that we say, when two Things in Nature are alike, as for instance, a Cat and a Tyger, that they imitate one another. Persons, Manners, and Actions, which it does not represent as true and real, but as likely and agreeable to Exemplars actually existing in Nature; and this sort of Imitation is found not only in Epick Poetry, which it has in common with Tragick, Comick, and the upper Lyrick Writings, but likewise in Fables, devis'd Novels, and Romantick Stories writ in Prose. of it, is the Conformity and Similitude between the imagin'd Representation and the Object represented. Then is a Picture or a Statue just and true, when it bears a Resemblance to the Original; when the Artist, by the Power of Imagination, separates and abstracts the Similitude from the Object, and transfers it to the Canvas or the Marble: and the greater the Likeness and Conformity is between them, the more exquisite and perfect is the Work. imitates, are distinguish'd from Symbols, Hieroglyphicks, personal Types, and significant Ceremonies, which do not express any Object by Representation or Resemblance, but only admonish and put us in mind of something that by Custom and common Consent they stand for, and are us'd to signify. diversify'd by their Characteristick Properties. The Poet imitates Nature by Sentiments and a Scheme of Words, the Sculptor and Painter by Lines and Colours: The Poets imitate by Terms and Sentences bounded by Metre; Writers in Prose, which equally aim at a Conformity and Resemblance between the Ideas of the Mind and the Objects represented, imitate by a Train of Words not measur'd and limited by Numbers. And by what essential Boundaries Epick Poetry is separated from the other Species of that Art, which all agree is imitation of Nature, will afterwards appear. feign'd Story, and the Reason is, that it may be distinguish'd from History, which is a recital of a Series of true Actions; and tho the chief Event in an Epick Poem may be real, and so the Poem will be founded in a Truth, yet the Plan, the Incidents, the Digressions, and in short, the Means by which that Event is brought about, are invented by the Author; and if any of the Incidents are true and unfeign'd, yet they are not introduc'd as such into the Poem; for they are not recited as Matters of Fact, but only as they are probable, of which more in the next Article. If therefore the Performance is not cast into a Fable devis'd by the Writer, from which artful Contrivance the Poet originally derives his Name, it would by no means be an Epick Writing. If Livy or Thucydides were turn'd into Verse by the most excellent Pen, let the Numbers be ever so musical, and the Diction ever so splendid and admirable, they would no more become Poems, than a News-Paper would be dignify'd with that Title, tho related in the most correct and beautiful Numbers. Telemachus , tho in Prose, approaches nearer to the Nature of an Heroick Poem, than a true History would do, tho express'd in all the Charms of Poetry, that the greatest Genius could give it. already shewn, that the general Idea of this kind of Writing, which is common to it with all the other Sorts, is Imitation, as its specifick Nature is constituted and distinguish'd by the Properties enumerated in the Definition: But in the first unrestrain'd Sense, as it is only a Representation of Nature, it is evident, that nothing unlikely should enter into it; for whatever is unlikely is unnatural, and for that Reason improbable. We look on every thing incredible, which we judge impossible: Impossible Things, as implying contradictory Terms, are never the Effects of Nature: Things improbable may sometimes happen by an unusual Concurrence of Causes, but since they happen rarely, and when they do, they break the common Course of Things and the Chain of ordinary Events, they are reckon'd monstrous and unnatural. It is not therefore enough for the Poet to introduce an Incident, because it is possible, and perhaps has sometimes actually come to pass; for it may still appear incredible to the greatest Part, who never saw such a surprizing Fact, and are uncapable of discerning the Possibility of it. The Writer therefore should act like prudent Travellers, who forbear in Conversation, to relate some Matters of Fact, which, tho they know them to be true, yet by their surprizing Novelty, and some extraordinary Circumstances that attend them, they foresee will be look'd on by a vulgar Audience as impracticable, and therefore not to be credited. Nothing therefore should be an integral Part of an Epick Poem, but what is easy, natural, and probable; which will be always so, if nothing is admitted that does not frequently fall under Observation, and is the common Result of Physical and Moral Causes. and not actually true; for since Poetry, as in many other respects, so in this resembles the Art of Painting, that it always strives to express some Object, it is very evident, that the Imitation must be form'd by a devis'd Probability of Actions and Circumstances, and not a relation of real Events; for otherwise it would not be an imitation of Nature, but Nature it self. Poetry being a Picture of feign'd or real Objects, Probability, as before asserted, is every where to be preserv'd; and as it should exhibit nothing inconsistent, monstrous, or unnatural, so it should relate nothing as real; for that would be a Transgression on the other Extream, and utterly destroys the essential Idea of a Poem. I admit, that a true Fact or Event may enter into the Work, but then it must not be introduc'd as it is true, but only as it is likely, and bears a Resemblance to Truth. History receives and recites Things true, tho they have a face of Improbability; and Epick Poetry rejects nothing false, provided it has a probable Appearance. This Property must shine in the general Model, in the Contrivance, Symetry, and Connexion, in the Incidents, Episodes and Digressions, and in all the integral and ornamental Parts of the Structure; and by this the Truth appears of what was above asserted, That a true History, tho compos'd with all the Advantages that the Art of Poetry can give, will not become a Poem; for that would be no Representation of Nature, but the very Things themselves, which is inconsistent with the Notion of such a Writing. elevated and refin'd Parts unhappily contracted a false Taste, and grew every where fond of extravagant Romantick Fables, the Original of which may be thus accounted for. the Understanding with Science and liberal Arts; and that this Nation had made great advances in these intellectual Acquisitions some Ages before that of Moses , appears by the Character given to that famous Law-giver in Sacred History, that he was learned in all the Learning of the Egyptians . Hither as to the Source of Knowledge, for the Improvement of their Minds, Men of great Genius resorted from foreign Countries, particularly Homer, Pythagoras , and Plato ; as afterwards the neighbouring Nations, for the same purpose, frequented Greece . These Sages envelop'd their Knowledge of Philosophy in Apologues, Hieroglyphicks, and Symbolical Characters; as they disguis'd their Sentiments of Theology in Allegories and mystical Fables. All Nations, that had any Taste of Learning, either from imitation of the Egyptians or their own native Impulse, which is more probable, affected to convey their Instructions by  Ã†nigmatical Discourses and Allusions. This strong Inclination in Men to express their Sentiments and communicate their Knowledge by Apologues and Fictions, appear'd in the eldest Days of Letters, and spread it self through all the People of the Eastern World. Not only the Egyptians , but the Arabians, Syrians , and Persians , propagated their Opinions and Instructions in mysterious invented Fables. At length they devis'd Narrations on the Adventures of Lovers; which being agreeable to the most prevailing Passion of the Heart, were receiv'd with Pleasure and much applauded. The Milesians , part of the Ionian Colony transplanted from Greece to Asia Minor , a soft and effeminate People, dissolv'd in Luxury and sunk in the Dregs of Vice, were the first that invented, or at least greatly improv'd and encourag'd this kind of Compositions, from them call'd Milesian Fables; which, as they sprung from the dissolute Manners of that degenerate People, so by their immodest and obscene Mixtures with which they abounded, they increas'd and heighten'd that general Depravity, from whence they took their Rise. writing Romances, of which before the Reign of Alexander the Great, there are no Examples. And as these amorous Fictions owe their birth to the most profligate and vicious Nation that ever appear'd on the face of the Earth; so they have a great Influence on all People, where they are generally received and applauded, by corrupting their Manners, dissolving their Minds, and destroying their Taste of useful and solid Learning. Minor to Greece , by the Commerce and Correspondence mutually kept up by the Ionians of the same Stock, tho in different Countries. The Grecians receiv'd them with Pleasure, imitated their Asian Colony, and carry'd on this Invention to greater Degrees of Perfection. Heliodorus and Achilles Tatius , two Christian Bishops, engag'd their Wit on these Subjects: And the Writing of the first is not only chaste and free from the impure and lascivious Blemishes of the Milesian Stories; but it is more perfect for its Incidents, Contrivance, and Probability: Whence it became the Model on which the numerous Authors of Romances in following Times form'd themselves, as the Poets imitated that of Homer. became fond of being Authors of such amorous Writings, which Inclination the more useful Improvements and severer Studies of Philosophy and Polite Literature in Greece and Rome could not extinguish. Persons of a warm Imagination and poetical Genius, apply'd themselves with as much Zeal and Diligence to the compiling of these pleasing Romances, as the Philosophers did to the Advancement of Natural and Moral Science; and as much outrival'd them in the Number of their Admirers, as the Productions of Wit on amorous Subjects are receiv'd with more relish by the greatest part of Mankind, than the dry and difficult Speculations of the Schools of the Sages. Power of the Roman Empire, and carry'd their Arms and their Ignorance over the politer and more enlighten'd Parts of Europe ; the Learning of Greece and Rome , that flourish'd there, was intirely effac'd by the Rudeness and Barbarity of the Northern Conquerors. As soon as Knowledge began to break through this total Eclipse, and before Letters, under the Direction and Encouragement of eminent Patrons, rose to a greater height, it made its first publick Entrance into Europe by amorous Songs and Fables, like those of the Milesians ; and these were cultivated and advanced much sooner than Philosophy, Mathematicks, and Classick Learning. They began in Provence about the sixth Century, if the Arabian Moors did not bring them into Spain , from whence these Natives of Provence , as some imagine, deriv'd them. This way of Writing having taken the first Possession of the World after the Restauration of exil'd Learning, Europe every where was fill'd with these Romantick Stories. The Wits of these Ages were seiz'd with an irregular Poetick Phrenzy, and having Decency and Probability in Contempt, fill'd the World with endless Absurdities; their fertile Imaginations perpetually brought forth some new deform'd and frightful Productions. Phantastick Giants and imaginary Heroes, who made no difficulty of working a thousand Miracles, daily issu'd from the Press. In short, all Europe on a sudden saw it self chang'd into Fairy-Land , replenish'd with Monsters and Necromancers, Castles, Palaces, and delicious Gardens, and many other incredible Effects of Magick Power. Besides this, one every where met with extravagant Knights stroling after Adventures, and unguarded Ladies rambling after their Lovers. And hence it came to pass, that the modern Writers of Epick Poetry, who were train'd up from their Youth in extravagant Romances and improbable and monstrous Narrations, which were the Subjects of all Conversation, and the most fashionable and applauded way of Writing, lay under an invincible Temptation to accommodate themselves to the Relish of the Times, by mingling in their Epick Compositions so great an Allay of Knight- Errantry and extravagant Adventures. While this sort of Writing was in fashion, the Imaginations of the modern Poets, who were the best qualify'd to attempt the sublime Manner, imbib'd a strong Tincture of the Romantick Contagion, which corrupted their Taste, and occasion'd their neglect of Probability. The Age was so far gone in this Delusion, that the best Writers could not free their Minds from the prepossession which they lay under. Hence it came to pass, that there is so great a Mixture of Knight-Errantry, Sorcery, and incredible Atchievements in the Poems of Ariosto, Tasso , and our famous Spenser ; who, notwithstanding they had the Precepts of Aristotle and Horace , and the Examples of Homer and Virgil back'd with Reason to direct their Conduct, were caught in the general Infection of the Times, and accommodated their Writings to the prevailing Opinion; by which they transgress'd one essential Rule of Poetry, I mean, Probability: For Poetry being an Imitation of Nature, that can never be a regular Performance, which represents Things that never did or can exist, and therefore are unnatural and not to be imitated. is, that the Narration be marvellous; and the Reason is, that when the Poet intends to give Delight and convey Instruction, as Admiration engages Attention, so it prepares and opens the Mind to admit the force of the Poet's Sentiments, and receive from them deep Impressions. Hence the beautiful and surprizing Turns, as well in the Diction as the Incidents of a noble Poem, strike the Imagination with resistless Force, break in upon the Soul and excite generous and divine Passions suitable to the Subject. This therefore is a necessary Property, by which the Poet is qualify'd to gain his principal End, which is to afford Pleasure and Instruction; and is a peculiar and inseparable Character, that limits the general Nature of Poetry, and makes the Epick differ from the Tragick, to which however it is more nearly ally'd than to any other Species. Activity, or that break the usual Series of Natural Causes and Events. The first sort, which proceed from Almighty Power, are stil'd Miracles: I shall not here by a strict Disquisition, enter into the Nature and Definition of a Miracle, which some look upon as an immediate Effect of unlimited Might, and others as an Action which the Spectators believe the Supream Being to be the Author of, while they are unable to account for any Natural Cause, from whence it should arise. It is enough, that in this Place, I give this Idea of it, That it is a presumptive, immediate Operation of Divine Power. The other sort of Effects that move Admiration, do not surmount the Limits of created Activity, but proceed from second subordinate Causes; yet then they interrupt the ordinary Course of Things, and deviate from the establish'd Custom or Laws of Nature. strike the Imagination with Disgust and Terror, and others are Sports of Nature, which are often pleasing and beautiful Errors: Other Things raise our Admiration by their singular and extraordinary Perfection; so exquisite and consummate Beauty, extraordinary Strength and Agility of Body, as well as the finish'd Pieces and Inventions of the most excellent Masters in Painting, Building, and Polite Literature, because they surpass their own ordinary Performances and those of other Artists, fill the Mind with agreeable Amazement. Other Objects, tho not irregular, nor more or less perfect than the ordinary Individuals of their Species, are marvellous, because they seldom come to pass. We view a Planet or a Star without Concern or Emotion of Mind, while the sight of a Comet raises our Admiration; not by its being a more excellent Luminary, but by its unfrequent Appearance. Our Wonder is likewise mov'd by common Objects represented in uncommon Circumstances; as for Instance, the Sun when eclips'd, Forreigners in a strange Habit, the Shells of Fishes found on the Tops of Mountains, and Trees and Nutshels discover'd in the Bowels of the Earth. Marvellous does consist. Any thing is therefore admirable, because it is surprizing, and therefore surprizing because extraordinary and unexpected. All unusual Occurrences, especially the Excursions and Transgressions of Nature in her Operations, move the Imagination with great Force, agitate the Spirits, and raise in the Soul strong Emotions, which by degrees diminish after long Acquaintance; and as Familiarity wears off our Abhorrence and reconciles us to frightful Objects, so it abates the Pleasure of constant Enjoyments, and by degrees creates Satiety. Exquisite Musick, delicious Gardens, magnificent Buildings, and ravishing Prospects, after long Possession, do not excite that delightful Wonder which it produces in those who are unaccustom'd to them. Novelty, as before asserted, is the Parent of Admiration; and it is for this reason, that the Sentiments in Epick Poetry, which by their Beauty, Strength and Dignity, are rais'd above the Level of vulgar Conceptions, and are always new, either in themselves or the uncommon Turn given to them by the Poet, act powerfully upon the Imagination, and surprize the Soul with pleasing Astonishment. And hence likewise it is, that the rich, splendid, and figurative Diction, which is proper to that Species of Poetry, like the Magnificence and Pomp of Princes on solemn Occasions, excites the Wonder of the People not inur'd to such Prospects. contriv'd with Art and Judgment, a natural Subordination, and a just Proportion of the Parts mutually inlightning and supporting each other, and the Regularity, Beauty, and Importance of the Incidents resulting, without constraint, from the Subject. Besides this, the principal Persons must be of illustrious Blood or high Station, the Action of great Consequence, the Turns strange and surprizing, the Sentiments strong, noble, and elevated; the Stile figurative and lofty, the Diction splendid and magnificent, and the Machines proper and pertinent. Should the Structure of the Poem want Unity or Integrity; should the Action be of little Moment, the Characters of mean Rank and Condition, the Expression low and poor, the Stile base and rustick, or swoln into the false Sublime; should the Incidents be trivial, the Thoughts weak and vulgar, the Turns in the Action obvious and familiar; or should the Machines be omitted or ill chosen, or unseasonable, the Performance would be contemptible, and more apt to move Laughter than Admiration: And if it be defective in any of these Qualities, the Beauty and Dignity of the Poem will in proportion be diminish'd, and become uncapable of raising Wonder and Delight. undertakes this difficult Province, an elevated, inventive and enterprizing Imagination arising from an inborn Fire, that impels and agitates the Soul with great Vehemence, heightens and inflames the Spirits, and kindles a Heat that approaches to the Nature of Fury and Phrenzy; whence the Ancients affirm'd, That poetical Raptures were the Effects of Inspiration and Divine Impulse. to the Poet, a cool and severe Judgment must however hold the Reins, and preside over this warm and hardy Imagination, to guide its Motions, and prevent its Errors, which otherwise would be numerous and unavoidble; and since this happy Temperament is seldom found, where two contrary Elements, Fire and Phlegm, of which each is demanded in a high Degree, are reconcil'd, and so blended and united, as to constitute a Genius capable of this sublime Species of Poetry, it is no wonder that few Persons have attempted it, and that fewer have succeeded in their Undertaking. sorts, as poetick Energy and Imagination, or Judgment and a true Taste of Propriety and Beauty are predominant in the Mind. From the first Mixture comes forth a Homer , by the second is a produc'd a Virgil ; and if these Endowments should happen to be equally mix'd and ballanc'd in the original Constitution of any great Poet, a third Species would be form'd. Homer and Virgil are two different Genius's of Nature's own making, abstracting from the Improvements and Advantages that arise from Learning, from Observation of the Works of eminent Writers, from a greater Comprehension of the Properties in an Epick Poem, and an accurate Knowledge of the Rules of Writing. If Homer , after he had finish'd his Iliad , could have acquir'd the Erudition and Skill of Virgil , his Genius would have been still the same, tho more refin'd, better govern'd, and more adorn'd by adventitious Embellishments; as an exquisite Beauty is the same, when at one time she appears in a wild and careless Dress, and at another is set off with the greatest Art and the richest Ornaments. Virgil and Homer are not therefore two different Genius's, because the Latin Author has more Learning, and is a greater Master of the Rules of Poetry, that is, is a better Critick than the Grecian ; but their distinct Characters arise from the different Combination of the unacquir'd Qualities and Powers of the Mind, while in one poetical Heat and Inspiration, and in the other, Judgment and Discretion evidently prevail. By an Allegory is sometimes understood a Continuation of Metaphors in the Writing by which it is rais'd above vulgar Expression; and this is necessary to the Species of Poetry, of which we are discoursing: For tho it ought to abound with all manner of beautiful and moving Figures, yet the Stile chiefly is elevated above ordinary Conversation, and the Diction of Philosophers and Historians, by a Series of metaphorical Words and Sentences through the whole Work, as oft as the Subject will bear it; whence the Expression becomes splendid and admirable. These elegant and surprizing Figures enrich, warm, and animate plain and cold Sentences, till they glow with Life and Spirit, and appear in all the Charms of Eloquence. and Vices are represented as Persons either Humane or Divine, and proper Passions and Manners are ascrib'd to their respective Characters: Of this are several Examples in Homer 's Ulysses , and too many in the modern Epick Writers, and there is one Instance of this sort in the sixth Book of King Arthur . In the first Sense an Heroick Poem cannot be too Allegorical, that is, too Figurative in those Parts, which require, or at least will endure to be rais'd from a flat and low Manner by the Ornaments of surprizing Metaphors, beautiful Similitudes, and just Allusions. But in the second Sense, the modern Epick Poets, especially Ariosto and Spenser , have ran too far into Allegory. This sort of allegorical Imaging resembles the emblematical Draughts of great Painters, where Vertues are represented as Goddesses, and Vices as Furies; and where Liberty, Peace, Plenty, Pleasure, and various Qualities of the Mind are exhibited in Humane Forms, with peculiar Properties and Marks of Distinction. An elegant Instance of this kind of Writing is the Representation of Sin and Death in the appearance of two odious and terrible Monsters, by our celebrated Milton in his Paradise Lost ; of which, I imagine, he took the Hint from the famous Spenser . This sort of Allegories, tho not strictly Epick, us'd with Temperance and Judgment, affect the Mind with Wonder and Delight, and enliven and beautify the Poem. There is yet a third sort of Allegory, which if it is not essential, is however very agreeable in Epick Writings, and render them more perfect; which is, when the chief Actors, especially the principal Hero, are made the Types of some other illustrious Persons, whose Actions and Manners are shadow'd forth by the Qualities of those that act in the Poem; and in this Case the artful disguise should be drawn so thin, that the real Characters in the View and Intention of the Poet may appear underneath, and be seen with ease through the transparent Veil; as in the first sort of Allegory, which consists in a Train of Metaphors, the Sense is foreign and different from the direct and usual Meaning of the Words; so in this, the Persons really intended are different from the Persons of the Poem, whose Actions and Manners are there exhibited. of the Trojan Hero, Ã† neas , in the famous Poem of Virgil , by which he is said to have paid him the greatest Complement that was ever made to any Prince: And it is not improbable, that Homer , in his Iliad , design'd to honour some great Persons then flourishing in Greece , under the allegorical Characters of Agamemnon, Achilles, Diomedes , and the other principal Actors in that Poem, tho by the distance of Time we cannot trace the Allusion; for it is not likely that Virgil , who is so exact an Imitator of Homer , would have attempted to have writ in this way, if Homer had not encourag'd and directed him by his Example. Accomplishments and great Exploits of his principal Hero should be so delineated, that in the Series of the Actions and Manners, and the Allusions and Incidents of the Poem, the intended great Man should be plainly pointed out. Thus the typical Hero is introduc'd at once to conceal and discover the real one, who is lightly disguis'd, that he may be shown to greater Advantage. To bear downright upon an excellent Person with Applause, is bold and ill- manner'd, and for that Reason disagreeable and shocking to Men of Taste and Judgment. The Epick Poet therefore exhibits the Person whose Praises he designs to celebrate under another illustrious Character, that by this means he may break the Violence, and correct the Rudeness of bare-fac'd Commendation, and that the Panegyrick thus qualify'd may shine through the allegorical Cloud with milder and more agreeable Lustre. that in this, which likewise is true in some other Instances, the admirable Poem of Virgil , for no Humane Works that are extant are free from blemishes, is defective, which however in the Contrivance, Conduct, and Diction, is the most finish'd of the kind; and perhaps the Time may come, when the learned World may bear an impartial Examination of the Writers of the most establish'd Authority, and not condemn every thing that deviates from the Precepts of Aristotle , and the Examples of Virgil and Homer , as poetical Heresy. celebrate the great Prince above-nam'd under his Typical Hero, Ã† neas . But as the general Character of Piety is not, I imagine, perfectly drawn, particularly in his Behaviour to Dido , and his interesting the Gods in the dishonourable Usage of that Queen, after her obliging Reception of himself and his shipwreck'd Companions; which never fails to move the Reader's Pity to the injur'd Lady, or to make the ungallant Hero the Object of his Censure and Resentment; so neither is this Character of Piety perhaps so well accommodated to the Qualities of Augustus C aesar , if authentick Historians may be credited. But suppose this general Idea does bear a similitude to the Disposition and Habits of that Monarch, there are very few Particulars in the Poem that carry any Resemblance between Ã† neas and the typify'd Hero, or that put the Reader at any time in mind of such a Person. There are no peculiar Manners of Augustus , nor any of his great Actions or Exploits shadow'd forth by those of Ã† neas ; none of his Battles, Expeditions, Dangers, or Successes, represented or alluded to in the whole Story of the Trojan 's Hazards and martial Atchievements, no, not the famous Sea Fight at Actium , which crown'd all the Labours of Augustus , and establish'd him in the Possession of the Roman Empire, tho nothing was more memorable and important, and therefore nothing more pertinent or ornamental could have been introduc'd into the Poem, as might have been done with great ease. any other Hero as for Augustus : The first seem to be Homer 's Battles fought over again in Italy , and not appropriated to the Roman Emperor. The Army of Ã† neas, with which he made his Descent upon Latium , is compos'd of many of the same Warriors, who were engag'd at the Siege of Troy , and those too not Trojans , which would have made it more excusable, but Grecians , their victorious Enemies. This Inadvertency will appear to any, who shall attentively read the Battels in Virgil , and compare them with those of Homer . The truth is, that while Virgil was contemplating Homer , after whom he copy'd, he was so intent on the Grecian 's Model, and so careful to follow him in every Part of his Poem, that he forgot his own Hero. Narration of some one Action. One principal End must be design'd by the Author, and the Contrivance, Disposition, and Dependence of the Parts must be such, that all the Incidents and inferior Actions may evidently conduce to the compassing of the main Event. From the Order and Connexion of the Parts conspiring in their Places to promote the chief Design, arises the Unity of the Action, on which depends the Unity of the Poem: For if any Part is co- ordinate and not subservient to the principal Aim of the Poet, the Unity of the Action is broken, and the Work is no longer one Piece, but becomes as many distinct Poems or Fragments of Poems, as there are found unconnected and independent Actions. The two last Books of the Iliad are therefore superfluous and out of the Poem, because the Celebration of the Funerals of Patroclus and Hector , which are there recited, came after the main Design was attain'd, and the principal Action was ended. Reason is, that it may excite Admiration, which is essential, as before has been shown, to this Species of Poetry. By this Property it is likewise distinguish'd from Comedy, where the Characters are inferior and the Action of little Consequence. Bossu requires no more to render the Action important, than that it should be the Action of an illustrious Person, to which I cannot agree; because great Men may sometimes, for their Recreation and Diversion, or worse Purposes, be taken up in mean and trivial Matters. If the Emperor Commodus should be introduc'd fighting as a Gladiator in the Amphitheater, or Domitian as engag'd in his darling Pleasure of chaceing Files, the Dignity of the Actors would by no means render the Action important; I conceive therefore, that to give Importance to the Action, it is not only necessary that the Actor should be a Person of Distinction for his noble Extraction or high Employment, but that the Action related should be of great Consequence in it self, and such as becomes an illustrious Actor. of an Epick Poem ought to be engag'd in some eminent Action; but this, I imagine, is from their following, in a servile manner, the Dictates of the Stagyrite, and the Examples of the Iliad and the Ã† neid . I have, in the Preface to the Paraphrase on Job , advanc'd a contrary Position, and endeavour'd to prove, that the principal Character of the Poem may be as well unactive and in a State of Suffering and Calamity. It is evident, that none of these Criticks have enquir'd into the Grounds and Foundation of this Maxim, That the Hero must be always a fighting, or at least, an active Person: They have, from one Generation to another, taken this Assertion upon content, and rely'd upon a continu'd Chain and uninterrupted Succession of Authority down from Aristotle 's Days to the present Age, without examining the Matter, or offering any Reason to support their Doctrine. Setting then aside the Veneration of great Names and the Authority of the Schools, I appeal to the Tribunal and decisive Decrees of Reason. I have in the Work above- mention'd demonstrated, that the principal End and all the essential Properties of an Epick Writing may be attain'd, tho the chief Person should be an eminent Sufferer, and no Battle should be fought through all the Poem. As much Divine Instruction relating to Providence, to the Encouragements and Rewards of Vertue, and the terrible Consequences of Irreligion and Vice; as great and illustrious Examples of Piety, Fortitude, and Heroick Firmness of Mind; as noble and useful Morals, and as sublime Sentiments, all fit to inspire the Reader with excellent Notions, to excite the most generous Passions, and to produce the most vertuous Resolutions, may be found in such a Poem, as well as in that which is full of Action and martial Atchievements. And where this principal End of an Epick Poem may be attain'd, and the Characteristick and essential Difference, with all the concomitant and inseparable Properties of it may be found, as they may be, where no Camps are form'd, nor any Armies engag'd, why this should not be denominated a genuine Epick Poem, I am not able to imagine; and on this Plan I take Homer 's Ulysses to be form'd. Besides, let it be consider'd, that many excellent Tragedies have been compos'd by the Ancients, as well as Moderns, where the Hero or Heroine of the Poem has been passive and unhappy; and why Nature in this Instance, may not with equal right be imitated by the Epick Poet, I believe is difficult to assign a Reason. exercise their Sagacity, in finding out the Hero of Milton 's Poem; for then it will be evident, that it must have been Adam himself. Nothing could have tempted learned Men to have search'd after any other Hero, but the Prepossession under which they lay, that the chief Person of the Poem ought always to be active, and in the end prosperous: But by what has been alledg'd I imagine, that Prejudice may be remov'd; and under this view that celebrated Poem will appear more regular and perfect than it has hitherto been allow'd to be. Another Reason why they are not willing to allow Adam to be the Hero of the Poem is this, That they believe the Idea of a Hero implies illustrious Vertue as well as military Fortitude; but this Error is occasion'd, by confounding the Notions of a Moral and a Poetical Hero; the first is always a Person of regular and vertuous Manners, but the other may be a flagitious, unjust, and cruel Man; nothing being requir'd in his Character, but that he should be pertinent and necessary in the Fable; that is, that he should eminently serve to bring about the principal End, whence some useful and instructive Moral shall arise: But more of this afterwards. extended by Episodes. An Episode at first was nothing but an Action interpos'd to diversify the Pleasure of the Audience, and relieve the Satiety of the Tragedy, which then entirely consisted in Musick; and an Episode had its Name from being something superadded to it. At the beginning only one, afterwards more such Actions, bearing relation however to the Tragedy, were introduc'd; till by degrees the Episodes, which before were foreign and superfluous, became the whole Poem, and the Musick was retain'd only in the Chorus. The Episodes then, or Incidents, are the integral Parts of the Poem, which consider'd as united, make up the Matter that is essential to the Constitution of the Work; and if taken singly the Absence of any one would leave it mutilated and defective. make the whole one Action, that where those are wanting the Poem is imperfect and vicious, its Unity being broken; and as oft as this happens the Incident is no part of the Structure, but stands by it self as a divided Piece or Outwork, detach'd and separate from the Building: And therefore, as Rapin observes, the Episode of the Voyage of Telemachus in the Odysses , which has no relation to the main Action, and contributes nothing to the Return of Ulysses , or the Events that follow'd it, is superfluous, and no integral part of the Work. The Poet has scarce enter'd upon his Subject when he takes his leave of it, and for four Books together entirely loses sight of his principal Design. Several other Instances of this Nature might be cited out of the Poems of that admirable Writer, which, notwithstanding the Authority of his Example, cannot be justify'd; for it is evident, that having no Union or Correspondence with the other Episodes, nor any Influence on the chief Action, they make so many Chasms or Breaks in the Poem, and therefore must be impertinent. Nor can this Practice be vindicated, by alledging, that this loose manner of Writing is agreeable to the Custom and Taste, not only of the Eastern World, but of the most eminent Poets of Greece , especially Pindar , who, not solicitous about Transitions and Connexions, frequently start from their main Design, and without any warning or preparation, abruptly pursue a foreign and unexpected Matter, till tir'd with the long and independent Digression, they sometimes return to their Subject, and sometimes entirely forget it. And in this they are imitated by Horace in his Odes , who on a sudden springs from his Theme, and follows another Chase, neither very pertinent, nor of a suitable Proportion: tho these Excursions are perhaps less blameable in the great Lyrick, where the Stile is more passionate, rapid, and violent. If the Beauty and Perfection of a poetical Frame, according to the uncontested Doctrine of the Criticks, arise from the Regularity, Union, and just Length of the Parts, then I shall always believe that Defect and Deformity will naturally result from Disorder, Incoherence, and Inequality: Nor can I give into the contrary Opinion, tho press'd by the Example of the greatest Writers, while the Dictates of Reason condemn their Practice. or are too short, tho the Unity of the Action is preserv'd, yet the Symetry of the Work is blemish'd according to the Degree of such Excess or Defect in the length of the Parts. And here I shall take notice, that the Episode which takes up the second and third Book of Prince Arthur , which how necessary soever it is to carry on the main Action, swells to a disproportionate Size, and is therefore obnoxious to Censure. This I well knew when I writ that Poem, but because the Subject was of such Dignity, Usefulness, and Importance, I deliberately suffer'd that Defect to continue, for the sake of a greater Advantage to the Work. upon his Reader, that Ã† neas and Dido may become Contemporaries, and that the Poet by this means might have a Foundation for the Episode of the second Book, which however does not add any Beauty, as before suggested, unless Ingratitude and the want of Gallantry in Ã† neas to a Queen, to whom in his Distress he had been so highly oblig'd, and his charging upon Heaven his faulty Behaviour, can adorn a Poem: And if this Maxim be establish'd, that an Author with a Design to introduce a greater Beauty, may be allow'd to commit some inferior Error, then much more may a Poet be justify'd, who, for the sake of a considerable moral Good, transgresses a Rule of less Importance, which he would otherwise have observ'd; since that Benefit will better bear him out in doing so, than the mere Entertainment and Diversion of his Reader. constitute the whole Matter of the Fable, there are other Parts call'd by the same Name, which for distinction sake I will stile Digressions. These do not necessarily and immediately grow from the main Action, but result from some Incident, by which it is united to the Body of the Fable. These Digressions, which perhaps best deserve the Appellation of Episodes, are not indeed necessary to the Being nor the Integrity of the Poem, but they add to it Beauty and Ornament; they resemble the Hair on a Man's Head and Eye- Brows, and the Leaves and the Blossoms of a Tree, which spring from the integral Parts of the Individual, tho they are not such themselves, and without which the Essence is preserv'd intire, tho naked, and in a manner deform'd. If these Digressions are forc'd and unnatural, that is, if they do not evidently arise from some Incident or Episode of the Action, by the Mediation of which they are connected to the Poem, they are no more a part of it, than a Worm is of an Animal, to which it adheres, or than Ivy or Woodbine are parts of the Tree, to which they cling. If they are very frequent, they call off too much the Attention of the Mind from the principal Business and Design of the Poet, and instead of Ornaments they become an Encumbrance, and oppress the Fable; and if they swell to a great length, by which the main Action is forgotten and left out of Sight, they are so many Tumours and large Excresencies, that deform the Narration and weaken its Force. Consultations, Conferences, Songs and Speeches, as by those which are entirely active, especially if they are put into the Mouths of the Actors. Some, for want of Judgment, have imagin'd, that the Poem stands still while any of the Persons are engag'd in speaking, and not in Action or the Narration of some busy Story; but this is never true, but when the Poet in his own Person makes Remarks and moral Reflections. We do not find that the Song of Jopas in Virgil , is condemn'd by any Criticks for delaying the Action or interrupting its Continuity, tho many have censur'd it as not pertinent to his Subject, while they allow to that of Homer in his Ulysses greater Propriety. Narrations that are unactive are sometimes necessary to carry on the Poem; and tho they do not strike the Imagination with such Vehemence as military Exploits, or other active Objects, yet in Epick Poetry, which is more sedate than Tragedy, they are not only in themselves beautiful and entertaining, but they temper and reduce the Emotions of the Mind, which would be too violent and unsupportable, if the Vehemence of the Action should be constant, and not interrupted through a Poem of such extent. Action ought to be finish'd and compleat, in which the Integrity of it does consist. Should a Painter delineate the Figure of a Man, either without a Head or without Feet, the Picture must be imperfect and deform'd; in like manner, should an Epick Poet so contrive his Fable, that any integral Parts of the Action should be wanting, the Piece would be lame and defective. And this Error is conspicuous in the Plan of the Iliad , where, if according to the Judgment of Horace , the Trojan War is the Action, that Action is not perfect and entire, because it neither begins with that famous Siege which commenc'd many Years before, nor does it end with it, since it continu'd a Year after the Death of Hector , and the Conclusion of the Poem. If it be said that the Action began with the Anger of Achilles , which Homer mentions in his Proposition that introduces the Fable, then Rapin thinks there would be two Angers of Achilles ; one for the Loss of his Mistress detain'd by Agamemnon , which occasion'd his departure from the Army; and another quite distinct, which arose upon the Death of Patroclus , and brought back the Hero to the Field, that he might revenge the Fall of his Friend upon the Trojans : Whence, says the Critick, it will evidently follow, that the Action or Subject of the Poem will be double; which is at least as great a Defect, as the want of Integrity. should be recited in Verse; the reason is, that it may be specifically limited and diversify'd from Writings in Prose, which is Oratio Soluta ; that is, a Speech or Diction free and unbounded by Metre. I do not affirm, that Rhime is necessary; tho in the modern Languages, which cannot imitate the Numbers of the Greek and Latin Poems, it is a Beauty and a musical Entertainment, and when it is easy, unconstrain'd, and manag'd with Skill, has a good Effect. It is true, as before-mention'd, that a devis'd Story related in Prose, where the Action is important and its Unity is preserv'd, where the Characters are illustrious, the Sentiments great and noble, and the Diction figurative, splendid and spiritful, comes near to the Nature of an Epick Poem, and wants nothing but Numbers to make it such; but without this essential Property it cannot claim that Appellation. If an invented Action recited in Sentences not limited by Metre were a Poem, then all the Fables of Esop , and of the Romantick Writers, would merit the same Denomination: The Truth is, that the Narration of an imagin'd and contriv'd Action without Numbers, is a counterfeit Poem in Prose; as the recital of real Facts and Incidents in Metre, is a true History in Verse. by the Judgment of the Poet, according to the different Nature and various Circumstances of his Subject: If that be violent and full of Passion, or on the contrary, calm and moderate; if it be simple, or less or more implex, the Narration will be shorten'd or more extended. Besides, it is in the Power of the Writer to invent variety of Episodes and Digressions, and to contract or enlarge them, provided he preserves Order and Proportion, in respect of the Parts one to another: And in this his Liberty is like that of an Architect, who may act in conformity to the Rules of his Art, whether he gives more or less, larger or narrower Rooms to his Building, so he maintain that Regularity and Symetry of the Parts, which the Perfection of the whole requires. , and the Ã† neis , is very different; the Extension of the Time, which the Business of the Poem shall take up, being of arbitrary Determination; in fixing, however, of which the Poet is oblig'd to have regard to the Nature of the Action, and the Beauty and Order of the Structure. Action, and to continue the Relation by a regular Succession of Incidents, till the Work is finish'd, which Method is observ'd in the Iliad ; or else at the Beginning of the Poem he may enter upon any subsequent Part in Order of Time, and reserve the first Part of the Action to be introduc'd by way of Recital, which is practis'd by Virgil in his Ã† neis . Both these ways are warrantable, since no Dictate of Reason in this Case, restrains the free Choice of the Poet. It is evident that this Historical Relation, which is made by some proper Actor, is as much an Episode or integral Part of the Poem as the rest, which united, constitute the Matter essential to the Action; since without it the Work will be maim'd and defective. But the Narration of Events that shall happen in Times to come, after the Epick Action is ended, which is sometimes made by way of Prediction, as that of Anchises to Ã† neas , that continues the Story down to the Reign of Augustus , cannot be esteem'd an Incident or integral Part of the Action, but is to be reckon'd a Digression springing from an Incident or Episode, by the Means of which it is united to the Poem, and the Reason is evident; for if the Prophecy were remov'd, there would be indeed a great Beauty lost, but no Episode or material Part would be missing by its Absence, but the Poem would continue unmaim'd and entire. by the Poet, tho they must not be look'd on as necessary and essential, yet when they are interested in the Action, they raise the Dignity of the Poem, and make the Narration more illustrious and important; whence they must be esteem'd highly expedient and useful. This Practice is warranted and encourag'd by the eldest Example of sublime Poetry, which was long before the Age of Homer , I mean, the Book of Job compos'd under the Guidance of Divine Inspiration; in which the Supreme Being and the chief Apostate Angel are engag'd as Parties concern'd; whence it appears very probable, that the Use of Machines in Heroick and Tragick Poems took its rise. to assist the Hero of the Poem, and fight against his Competitor, must highly detract from the Glory of his Actions, and diminish the Opinion of his Bravery and Conduct; for, say they, What Honour can justly redound to the Warrior, who has conquer'd his Enemy not so much by his own Arms, as by the Power of mighty invisible Beings, who aided and protected his Person, and dispirited and affrighted his Rival? If Minerva supports Achilles against Hector , and Jupiter engages on the side of Ã† neas against Turnus , can it be any Dishonour to the Vanquish'd, if they are look'd on as inferiour in Power to the Gods? Had Heaven stood neuter and espous'd neither Cause, who can tell whether Hector or Turnus might not have triumph'd over their Enemies? If two Champions are engag'd in Combat, and a third superior or equal in Strength to either of them, should step in to assist one to subdue the other, would this be a fair Decision, who of the two did excel his Competitor in Strength and Courage? victorious Hero, that in the Fight he was animated and assisted, as his Rival was terrify'd, by supernatural Powers; the Reason is, because the Action is entirely his own, notwithstanding the Assistance of Celestial Beings. But the Case would be quite otherwise did another Champion rush into his Aid, for then the Action would be evidently shar'd between them, and no Honour would redound to either. The Supream Being, as universal Cause, must afford his concurring Power, not only to support the Existence of all his Creatures, but likewise to enable all their Faculties and Powers to exert themselves in Action. Should we suppose a created Being independent on the Creator in any one natural Operation, let it be the slightest sensitive Perception, the first Formation of a Thought, or the least Impulse or Volition of the Will, that Creature would be independent in all his Actions, there being nothing more requir'd for the Independency of all, than of any one Operation, and then it would follow, that this Being would be endow'd with Divine Perfections, and become a Deity. Besides the Physical Necessity of the Concurrence of the Supream Being to enable his Creatures to act, all Men, who have a just Idea of him, will allow that he does actually interest himself in the Government of Humane Affairs, and by his Providence disposes Things in such a manner, that those Events, which he designs, shall certainly come to pass; that he brings about the Rise and Fall of Empires, promotes or disappoints the Schemes of Statesmen, and as Lord of Armies, bestows Victory on which Leader he pleases; that he inspires the Heart of his favour'd General with Courage and Wisdom, shields his Head in the Day of Battle, animates his Troops, and disheartens and confounds the Enemy. Nor is the Hero's Valour or Prudence the less his own, because inspir'd and given by Heaven; nor is his Honour diminish'd by the Intervention of Providence, that dispos'd Circumstances in his Favour; for our Faculties and Powers are freely, and without constraint, exerted in all our Operations; and the Concurrence of Divine Aid does not suspend, much less destroy, the Liberty and Self-determining Power of the Will; and therefore how much soever we are assisted by the Supream Being, as an universal Cause, our Actions are as much our own, as it is possible that a Creature's should be. be interested in the Administration of Humane Affairs, especially of those that are attended with memorable and important Events, by introducing their Machines in all great Actions, design'd, as I imagine, no more than to give au allegorical Representation of that supream Providence, which guides and directs the Universe, and particularly interposes in the Concerns of Mankind; and by this means they suppos'd they should make a greater Impression on the Minds of Men, and propagate more effectually the pious Notion of God's Government of the World in a Moral Sense; and perhaps they might likewise have some regard to him as a Physical universal Cause. assisted by the Gods is so far from debasing, that it very much heightens the Character of the Hero, since it is in it self and in the Opinion of the People, a greater Honour to be a Favourite of Heaven, than to perform the greatest Actions without Divine Aid; it being justly look'd on as the strongest Proof of any Man's uncommon Merit, that he is belov'd and supported by the Gods, to whom an ill Man can never be dear or acceptable. This Assertion has, at first sight, a good appearance, but in my Opinion, if examin'd, it will be found more ingenious than solid. In the first place it is not in Fact true, that the principal Hero of the Poem, how great and successful soever he is, and how much soever encourag'd and aided by the Gods, is, or ought to be a good or vertuous Person. An ill Man may be a very good poetical Hero, and this is the Case of the Iliad. Achilles is not drawn as a Character of a pious and prudent Warrior, but is always furious, cruel, and inexorable, and sometimes unjust and impious: Nor is he favour'd by Heaven for his Piety and Vertue, but for his Cause, and the sake of his Country, whose Interest the prevailing Part of the Deities had espous'd. And this has been actually the Fate of many other successful Generals, who by an uninterrupted Series of glorious Actions have acquir'd universal Fame, notwithstanding they have been eminent for no Vertue, but Military; for Divine Providence often animates and supports a valiant, tho a vicious and profane Leader, and enables him to do Wonders, that by his over-ruling Wisdom he may bring about some great Event that serves the Ends of his Government, which however were never intended by the Warrior, that promoted them. And this being an evident Truth, it is plain, that to be assisted and favour'd by Heaven is not a Mark of extraordinary Merit in the Hero, and therefore cannot redound to his Honour. took part with any Heroes, but those that were eminently Moral and Pious, and that no ill Prince or General was favour'd by Heaven and crown'd with great and wonderful Successes; yet if it be allow'd, that the Deities do any thing more than as universal Causes, which concur and co-operate with the Hero, that is, if their Actions are distinct and separate from the Hero's, if in Person they fight against, or by their menacing Presence terrify the Enemy, as in the Case of Turnus, Dii me terrent & Jupiter hostis : It is clear, that this Action is no more the Hero's than if a third Man had thrust a Firebrand in the Latian ' s Face, to facilitate the Trojan 's Victory. Let the Hero then be ever so much a Favourite of Heaven, and ever so illustrious for his Vertue and religious Qualities, if it be suppos'd that the Gods do actually engage in Combat with his Rival, and personally help to subdue him, the Hero can by no means derive any Honour from this Conquest: But if it be allow'd that the Poet, by interesting Celestial Powers in the Action intends no more, than in an allegorical Manner, to inculcate on the Minds of the People a just Notion of Divine Providence, and the Necessity that we lie under to implore his Favour, and rely on his Assistance in all important Undertakings: If it be likewise acknowledg'd that the Assistance, which he gives the Hero, is by inspiring his Mind with intrepid Resolution, and animating him to put forth his utmost Strength, as well by disposing of Circumstances so as to intimidate the Enemy, or to occasion his Confusion and Distraction; this Concurrence will not detract from the Glory of the Conqueror, but augment it; for this does not make his Actions to be less his own, since the Aid he receives from Heaven is by Co-operation, and by enabling him to exert his Faculties and Powers to the highest Degree of which he is capable, but not farther: And if this Explanation be allow'd, the Difficulty arising from the above mention'd Objection to Machines in Epick Poetry, is remov'd. by Constantine and Maxentius for the Roman Empire, delineates three arm'd Angels flying over the Head of the first Leader; by which he represents the watchful Care of Heaven, in protecting the Persons and assisting the Troops of favourite Leaders; but he judiciously chuses not to mingle them in the Army, or to exhibit them actually fighting against Maxentius or his Soldiers; for had that been done, the Honour of the Victory could not justly have been ascrib'd to his Rival. If therefore Homer and Virgil by engaging the Deities in the Action, meant any thing more than a figurative Representation of Divine Providence, that concerns it self intimately in Humane Affairs, in my Opinion Reason will not bear them out; but that strange Mixture of Gods fighting with Men must be not only harsh and uncouth, but unnatural and absurd. of a superior Order to that of Men, and many Christians of the contrary Opinion, who notwithstanding they are pleas'd with the Machines introduc'd by Pagan Writers into their Poems, and think they impart Ornament, Strength and Dignity to the Work, are not satisfy'd that a Christian Poet should engage Celestial or Infernal Powers, agreeable to the Scheme of his own Religion, either in Epick or any other great Poems. They had rather all Things should be represented as manag'd and over-rul'd by Pagan Deities; and therefore the Poets of this Principle do not make use of Christian Machines in their Writings, tho in a Country where that Religion is profess'd and establish'd, but employ the Idols of the ancient Heathens in all their Works, notwithstanding the Practice is so incongruous and absurd. The Reason I suppose, why the first sort, I mean our irreligious Scepticks, act in this manner is this, That they know the Heathen Deities, whom they interest in their Poems, are no more than imaginary Beings, and they can freely concern themselves with such Gods, without disturbing their Minds, by raising Apprehensions of Divine Justice, Remorse for Guilt, or Fears of Punishment. They can mention Mars, Apollo and Venus with great Satisfaction and Serenity of Mind; for they are past doubt that these are invented Divinities, that have no Existence: But when they name the Creator and supream Moderator of the World, the Celestial Hierarchy and Infernal Spirits, as asserted by the Christian Revelation, not being certain, that is entirely deliver'd from distrust, that these Beings are the mere Creatures of Fancy and Fiction, they cannot think of them without some inward Awe and Disturbance; and this is a good Reason to prove, that tho the Atheist is fully satisfy'd of the Falshood of Heathen Schemes, yet he is not sure of the Falshood of the Christian; for if he were, he would equally be inclin'd to the one and the other, and then he would infallibly prefer the Christian Religion, and out of Decency and Congruity make use of it in his Writings, since it is the establish'd Religion of his Country. their own Religion, is of a different Nature. These Gentlemen are of Boileau 's Judgment, that the Greatness and Majesty of the Christian Religion would be debas'd, by engaging in Epick Poems superior, invisible Beings, according to that System; and Sir William Temple is of the same Opinion. But let it be consider'd, that Epick Poetry is indeed the Theology of the Country where the Poet lives, and every Work of this kind is a System of the Religion, and a sort of Confession of the Publick Faith there establish'd; and therefore it is as great an Absurdity for an Epick Writer to employ any other Scheme of Religion in his Poems, as it would be if a Christian Preacher should form his Discourses upon the Plan of Mahomet , or in Conformity to the Doctrines of the Gentiles . Besides this Objection, that the Christian Religion does not furnish such proper Materials for Heroick Poetry as the Pagan Theology, will fall to the Ground, if it be consider'd, that the Supream Being and the first Apostate Angel have actually been introduc'd in the Book of Job , without debasing the Dignity of Religion; that Milton has, with Success, employ'd in the Action of his Poem Machines suitable to the Christian Scheme, and that the like is done in Prince Arthur , and other Poems that follow'd it, without sinking the Sublimity or diminishing the Majesty of that Divine Institution. without any Allay of puerile and light Ideas. The Gravity and Dignity of the sublime Stile will not endure facetious Expression, much less such Strains as have an Air of Raillery and Burlesque. None of these low and ludicrous Mixtures, which are inconsistent with the Height and Importance of an Epick Action, is any where found in Virgil 's Ã† neis ; so careful was that judicious Author not to debase the Greatness, corrupt the Purity, or sully the Lustre of the Heroick Stile, by interspersing gay Conceptions and Sports of Fancy, which can only be agreeable to a false Taste, that cannot judge of the true Sublime. And when Homer entertains his Reader with the Pleasantry and Laughter of the Gods, occasion'd by the awkward Behaviour of the limping Deity that fill'd out the Nectar at their Feasts, and with the merry Pranks of Mars and Venus entangled in his artful Net, he offends against Propriety of Manners, by representing Celestial Beings engag'd in mean and trifling Pastimes, unbecoming their Divine Character. And as by introducing into Heaven Farce and Buffoonry, an improper Place for such Diversion, he has broken in upon the Congruity and Decency which should be always preserv'd in the Characters, so he transgresses the Rule, that banishes in general from Heroick Works, all comick Manners, witty Conceits and Ridicule; the reason of which Rule is founded on the Nature of Epick Poetry, whose Property it is to celebrate the Actions of the Supream Being, Angels, and illustrious Men, and therefore is too solemn and noble to bear the little Plays of Imagination. agreeable only that it may the more effectually leave vertuous Impressions on the Mind; which useful end is common to this, with the other Species of Poetry. It is not sufficient that some few moral Sentences are here and there interspers'd, but a Divine Spirit should reign through the whole Composition. The Incidents and Digressions should every where convey to the Imagination great and elevated Ideas, fill the Breast with generous Passions, and produce in the Soul warm Resolutions to follow the Dictates of Reason, and obey the Precepts of Religion and Vertue; and besides this, some important Moral should arise from the whole Fable. is founded on good Reason, which is, that the Poet must in his first Intention be dogmatical and pitch upon some considerable Moral, and then contrive his Fable suitable to that Design: If it be well observ'd it will evidently appear, that no Author can form the Narration of any great and memorable Action but some Moral will arise from it, whether the Writer intends it or not: And since Homer and Virgil do not expresly draw any Doctrine from their Fables, it is uncertain whether they design'd any, tho they ought to have done it; and it is still more uncertain, whether they intended those particular Morals which are generally ascrib'd to them, because many such Lessons of Instruction will result from the Imitation of any illustrious and extraordinary Action, either in Epick or in Tragick Poems. As from Pulpit Discourses on Divine Subjects, many useful Inferences may be deduc'd by the Preacher; so in these superior Poems various Doctrines may arise, which the Poet may himself mention if he pleases, or leave them to be drawn by the People for their Improvement. the Tragick often do; and when they mention it, they are not to be censur'd, because others likewise may be nam'd, since many, and those very different too, may naturally spring from the same Subject. But when the Writer mentions these instructive Sentiments at the end of the Poem they are no Parts of it, but are out of the Action, and only result from the Catastrophe; which is evident, since the Action is compleat without it. been the general Opinion of the Poets and mere Criticks; which Rule they have laid down and propagated without consulting Reason in the Case, being led into it by the Iliad and Odysses of Homer , and the Ã† neid of Virgil ; in which the Event is prosperous, and the Hero surmounts all his Difficulties. See here another Instance of the Submission which the Poets and Commentators have made to naked Authority, by which they have advanc'd Maxims out of Reverence to great Names, without any discussion of the Subject, or entring upon any Enquiry into the Foundation that supports their Assertion. I shall therefore reject this Rule, which is unwarrantably impos'd upon Epick Writers, and maintain the contrary Opinion, as more agreeable to Reason. and Renown, if we reflect, that the end of the Epick Poet may be equally attain'd, tho the Event should be unfortunate; various and important Instructions will arise as well from a calamitous as a happy Issue, and which perhaps will have a better Effect and leave a more lasting Impression on the Mind. If Men would not cut off the Connexion of this Life with the next, but would contemplate this State of Probation and that of Immortality and judicial Retribution to come, as one Duration unbroken by Death, which does not destroy and extinguish our Life, but diversify and change its Circumstances: In this View the Mind of the Reader would become easy, tho he finds at last a wicked Prince or Warrior triumph over distress'd Vertue, or a Person endow'd with Heroick Qualities left in the greatest Misery; for he will please himself with the Prospect of their future State of Life, when Rewards and Punishments shall be impartially distributed, when Persons of Merit and Piety shall be ever happy, and the Irreligious and Immoral be consign'd to endless Sufferings. Nature, which is essentially requir'd in this Species of Poetry, as well as in Tragedy and Comedy, than a prosperous Catastrophe: We lament every Day the calamitous Fate of excellent Princes and illustrious Worthies, while cruel Tyrants and impious Generals appear like Favourites of Heaven, blest with Success in all their Undertakings. This, by the Permission of Divine Providence, is most usually observ'd in the common Course of Humane Affairs; and therefore the Representation made by the Poet, of unprosperous Events that happen to the Hero, is the nearest imitation of Nature, as being that which most commonly comes to pass. If it be objected, that this would bring Dishonour upon Providence that suffers Vertue to be ill treated, while Vice and Impiety are not only unpunish'd, but attended with Wealth and Dignity, and raise in the Minds of the People murmuring and discontent, while these Examples of neglected Merit and distress'd Innocence are set before them, which cannot but discourage Men from imitating those generous Qualities, that are like to involve them in Trouble and Ruin. I answer, that there is not the least Weight in this Objection, if Men, as I observ'd before, would look on the Present and the Future State of Life to be one extended Existence, which Death, 'tis true, varies, but does not interrupt or dissolve its Connexion. Take then into one View, those Parts of Life that shall succeed Death, and those that have preceeded it, and regard it as much an entire and undivided Duration, as that of Infancy, Youth and Age, and the Difficulty will soon be remov'd; for then the Reader will see, that Innocence and Vertue, which suffer in one part of Life, will flourish and be rewarded in another of infinitely greater Extent; and Impiety, tho now prosperous and triumphant, will hereafter meet with condign Punishment. distinguish'd by their various Characters, either as Princes or Subjects, Wise or Valiant, Pious or Irreligious, Calm or Turbulent, or otherwise diversify'd by different Inclinations and Habits; and when their Characters are mark'd and settled, their Manners should be suitable and becoming those Characters, that is, every Person should speak and act, where-ever he is introduc'd, as it is reasonable and proper that a Man of such Qualities should do, and that likewise according to the Temper and Circumstances in which he is at the Instant, when he acts. If he is calm and sedate, or agitated by any great Emotion of Mind, he must express his Temper in his Language and Deportment. As the whole Poem is an imitation of Nature, so that Imitation should be constantly preserv'd, and appear every where conspicuous in all the Actors. The Poet therefore ought to observe a due regard to Time, Place and Persons, which is the Foundation of Propriety, Fitness, and Decency; for whatever is improper and unbecoming, is likewise shocking and offensive. The Poet's Pictures, as well as the Painter's, should bear a just and lively Resemblance of the Original: When Dissimilitude and Disagreement is found between the Representation and the Object represented; this is not to imitate, but to bely Nature, and impose a Fraud upon the Reader. And this want of Justness, Uniformity, and a beautiful Representation of natural Causes and Effects in their various Distinctions will be a great Blemish to the Writing, and discover, that the Author is either careless or injudicious. For Instance, should a Person in deep Distress, overwhelm'd with Sorrow, transported with Rage, or burning with Revenge, make a long and elegant Discourse full of fine Similies, quaint Turns, and surprizing Metaphors, he would offend against the Custom and Rule of Nature, which in such Circumstances never acts in that manner. But I shall not enlarge upon this useful and copious Subject, which has been already exhausted by many emiment Writers. Hence it appears how necessary it is for the Poet to study and make himself well acquainted with the various Temperaments, Inclinations, and Passions of Mankind, to penetrate into the secret Springs of Humane Actions, and follow Nature through her minutest Recesses; that by this he may be qualify'd to appropriate to each different Complexion and inward Principle of Action, their characteristick Manners and genuine Expression. Epick Poem and a Tragedy is not so great, but that they may be mutually converted one into another. Should the Epick Poet retrench his Invocation, Proposition, and Introduction, should he speak nothing himself, but express every Thing by the Mouths of the Actors; should he contract his Episodes and reduce their Number, omit his Digressions, cut off the length of his Speeches and Similes, and make his Incidents more vehement and passionate, he would change his Poem to a Tragedy. On the contrary, should the Action of the last be exhibited by Narration, where the Poet sometimes speaks himself; should the Episodes be multiply'd and extended, and the whole Action grow more calm and moderate, it would plainly become an Epick Poem. Composition may be unhappy as well as in a Tragick, the Transmutation of one to another being so easy. nearly ally'd to Tragedy, than to any other kind; and therefore to set the Nature of it yet in a clearer Light, it may not be improper to form a Comparison between them. an imitation of Nature. But the Tragick Poet imitates by Representation, as the Epick by Recital or Narration: The last tells what Things were done, and in what Order by those who are interested in the Action: But the first introduces the Actors doing all Things in their own Persons. The Epick Poet often interposes Discourses of his own, which the Tragick never does; but every Thing is said and done by the Parties engag'd in the Poem; the Difference is the same as between two Authors, of whom one relates a Conference held by two or more Persons, and tells the Reader what was said, and by whom in the whole Debate; and the other, introduces the Parties themselves discoursing and answering one another in the Dialogue, without any Intervention of the Author himself. These Poets likewise agree in their End, which is to improve the Understanding with Moral and Divine Instruction, and inspire the Heart with a pious Ardor and a generous Resolution to aim at Heroick Vertue: But they proceed in a different way to attain their Design. The Tragick Poet to procure his End, represents such Actions, and introduces such Incidents and various Turns, as are most proper and effectual to raise Terror and Compassion in the Minds of the Audience; but the Epick Author contrives his Fable, and forms and connects his Episodes in the fittest way to create Delight and Admiration. Persons should be of illustrious Birth or high Station, that is, Poetical Heroes and Heroines, and that the Action be great and important. But they disagree in this, that Tragedy is very busy and vehement, it works the Soul with turbulent Emotions and endless Transports, and constantly either melts the tender, or agitates the violent Passions; while Epick Poetry is more calm and moderate, where the Reader is carry'd on with a lively and pleasant Gale; but not as in the other Case, hurry'd with Violence, and driven by a Tempest. An Epick Poem being more sedate and quiet, the Action is of long Duration, sometimes of many Years; and the Narration, by multiply'd Episodes, Events, and Digressions, is carry'd on to a great Extent. But the Action in Tragedy being more passionate and impetuous is of far shorter Continuance, being usually finish'd in two or three Days, or yet a shorter Time. An Epick Poem contains as well plenty of Characters, which enliven and enrich the Work, as great variety of Subject Matter in its integral Parts, and frequent Excursions. Tragedy is more close and concise, being straiten'd and confin'd in a narrower compass of Time. but there is some Controversy which of them is superior and to be most esteem'd; Aristotle gives the first Rank to Tragedy, but by the unanimous Suffrages of succeeding Criticks, an Epick Poem is the most noble and excellent Production of Humane Understanding; and it is remarkable, that the Criticks deserted their Master in this Point, when his Authority was at the greatest Height and the learned World servilely submitted to his Judgment in the Arts and Sciences: Nothing can account for this, but that the Evidence was so strong and clear against Aristotle 's Opinion, that they were not able, how willing soever they might be, to resist its Conviction. Rapin , a Critick of the first Class, affirms, that an Epick Poem is the most admirable and perfect Work of the Mind, and assigns this Reason of his Assertion, That it contains in it self the Perfections of all other kinds of Poetry. To strengthen and support his Assertion, he cites many of the most eminent Masters of Criticism. shown in what Instances my Notions agree with, or differ from the receiv'd Opinions of the Aristotelian Criticks, I am now oblig'd by Promise to give my own Definition of such a Work, which I look upon as more just and reasonable than that laid down in the beginning of this Discourse; An Epick Poem is a probable, marvellous, and devis'd Story of an important Enterprize, or great Suffering of some illustrious Person, recited in Verse of the sublime Stile, to afford Delight and Instruction . I have left out of this Definition, the Term Allegorical, because it is not necessary that an Epick Poem should be Allegorical in any other Sense, than that the Narration ought to be Metaphorical and Figurative; which Property is fully express'd by requiring, that the Recital be made in Verse of the sublime Stile . I have left out the Term Action , and have added Enterprize or Suffering , for the Reasons alledg'd in the foregoing Dissertation; and I have said Illustrious Person , to leave the Definition free, and not restrain'd to a Hero; since no Reason, as I believe, can be assign'd, why a Heroine may not be the Principal Person of an Epick, as well as a Tragick Poem, to which it is so nearly ally'd. It is evident, That the essential Properties of an Heroick Work may be all preserv'd, and the principal End of the Poet be as effectually obtain'd, where an illustrious Woman is introduc'd as the chief Character, as well as where a Prince or General sustain that Province. HAVING in the foregoing Pages inquir'd into the intrinsick Constitution and essential Properties of an Epick Work, I shall now proceed to examine the Stile, and other external Qualities necessary to this elevated Species of Poetry. communicate their Sentiments to Persons at a great Distance, and to many at once, and desir'd a more faithful and lasting Preserver of their Opinions than Oral Tradition, the Art of Printing being yet unknown, they found out various ways of committing their Thoughts to Writing: At first they inscrib'd them in Bricks and Stones, and afterwards in Tables overspread with Wax, using a piece of Iron call'd a Stile , which is a Greek Term made English . This small Instrument was pointed at one end, and flat at the other. They employ'd the pointed End to raise up the Wax and form the Letters, and with the flat they effac'd the Writing at Pleasure, by filling up the Furrows and smoothing the Wax, according to that of Horace , S aepe Stilum vertas iterum qua digna legi sint Scripturus. Oft turn your Stile, and use th' unpointed Head , If you would write Things worthy to be read. By degrees the Term Stile came figuratively to express the Way or Character of Writing in general, and was divided into several sorts that arose from the various Modes of Diction, in Discourses on various Subjects. It was likewise us'd to signify the Manner of Expression peculiar to this or that Author: So we say Virgil's or Livy's Stile. So Cicero , in his Book of famous Orators, describes a wonderful Variety of Eloquence in the Romans , whose different Stile he delineates with admirable Distinction. The Word is now likewise translated, and becomes Technical in the Arts of Musick and Painting, by which the Artists express the different Manner of writing Musick, or drawing Pictures, proper to different Masters. the Method and Symetry of the Composition adds Complexion, Vivacity and Decoration, and enlivens the Discourse, which before was an imperfect Draught, with finishing Strokes and beautiful Colouring. Here the Writer exerts his Skill, bestows all the Charms and Graces that his Art affords, and adjusts every thing to the utmost Advantage, that he may raise the Admiration of the Reader. principal Part of Eloquence, belongs to the Stile; so does the ranging of them in a beautiful and harmonious Order, as well as all the elegant and moving Turns of Expression, which adorn their proper Places and give Life and Lustre to the Whole. Hither also is refer'd the Art of touching the Soul, and agitating the Passions by bold and warm Images, Interrogations, Apostrophes, Prosopopeia's, Expostulations, and other pathetick Forms of Diction. Affected, the Flowing or Stiff, the Clear or Obscure, the Simple or Ornamental, and the Concise or Diffusive; but the principal Division is into Low and Lofty. I shall confine my self to the Last, which is the Stile requir'd in Epick Poetry. without the Improvements of Art and a well inform'd Judgment to conduct its Motions, it will not be able to avoid many dishonourable Errors, nor will it ever rise to that Perfection of which its native Faculties are capable. It is true, no Discourse is so masterly and prevalent, as that which appears natural and dictated by the present Passion, and it is for this End that Rules are necessary; for the greatest Art is requir'd to make it seem artless and unlabour'd, and the most effectual Directions for this End shall be afterwards taken notice of. which must be always great and important, the Concurrence of these Particulars is necessary; Elevation of Thought, a due Choice of Words, and a proper Disposition of them; as likewise the use of apt Rhetorical Figures, and a right Address to the Passions. The Defect of any of these abates the Force and Beauty of the Stile, and the want of some wholly destroys it. Manner, and are elevated above obvious and familiar Sentiments; and this Sublimity of the Ideas imparts internal Heat, Vigour and Majesty to the Narration, as the judicious and happy Choice of pure, proper and expressive Words, and splendid and polite Diction, give outward Richness, Elegance, and Magnificence. Matters of such Dignity and Excellence as those which he is conversant about, it is necessary he should fix his Mind upon them, that by Familiarity and long Acquaintance with them, he may stock his Imagination with splendid and beautiful Images. It is the Remark of Longinus , That it is impossible for a Man inur'd only to base and vulgar Thoughts, to reach that Elevation of Mind which is necessary for an Orator of the first Rank; Such a Man, says he, will never speak any thing extraordinary, or write any thing worthy of Posterity; and therefore he advises Men to nourish in their Minds a generous Temper, that will always incline them to form high and noble Ideas: And if it be so necessary for an Orator, it is yet much more requir'd of an Epick Poet, whose Subject is always Great and Illustrious. If it be his Ambition to write extraordinary Things, becoming the Height and Importance of his Subject, worthy of his Character, and fit to be transmitted to Future Times, he should not grovel in the Dust, not breath in thick impure Air, but keep above, and inure himself to lofty Contemplation, till by a constant Correspondence and Intercourse with superior Objects, he gets a Habit of Thinking in the great and elevated Manner, peculiar to the Heroick Poet. By this he will be enabled to rise to the Heights of Heaven, and from thence to cast himself down with a generous Freedom and Resolution, and plunge amidst the Depths of Nature, to discover the secret Springs of her wonderful Operations; and by the same Principle he will be capable of penetrating the dark Walks and mysterious Labyrinths of Divine Providence, in the Administration of Humane Affairs; by which means he will collect rich Materials, and proper Onnaments to embellish his Work, and make it marvellous. up Hoards of lively and wonderful Ideas, is so necessary to inspire the Narration with Life and Ardor, that it is impossible by any Means to supply its Absence. Where this is wanting, all artificial Decoration is idle and ridiculous; but this alone gives such force and lustre, that without the Additions of Art, it will attract our Esteem and raise our Admiration. This is remarkable not only in Poetical Eloquence, but in that of the Pulpit, where some Preachers, tho not curious in the choice of their Words, nor correct and musical in their Diction, by the Sublimity of their Thoughts and Divine Expression, accompany'd with an awful Gravity, a becoming Zeal, and the serious Air of One in earnest, succeed far better than many who are more polite and regular in their Stile. It is the Majesty, Strength, and Vivacity of the Images, the Solidity and Loftiness of the Sentiments, that chiefly penetrate and melt the Audience; and the various Precepts of Rhetorick, which of themselves have no Force, can only assist their Operation: Not withstanding great Poets, as well as Orators, may be defective in some Points that relate to external Embellishments, they abundantly atone for all their Faults by the admirable and excellent Sense which they every where abound with; and as Longinus says of Demosthenes and Plato , one or two of their wonderful Thoughts make amends for all their Errors. Extraordinary Minds, as that Critick remarks, are so taken up with great Objects, that they have no Time or Inclination to attend to the low and minute Affairs of Rhetorick, and therefore their Omissions are not so much to be imputed to want of Skill, as to Inadvertency; not to the Weakness of their Judgments, but to the Strength and Elevation of their Conceptions. regarded, which being only Marks and admonishing Signs to transmit the Sentiments of the Speaker to the Hearer, those certainly are the best, as most adapted to their End, which most clearly, and with the greatest Facility, represent the Mind of the one, and are most easily apprehended by the other; and therefore avoiding all odd and uncouth Phrases, low Language, and vulgar Metaphors on one hand, and the vain Pomp of the false Sublime on the other, the Epick Poet should chuse the middle sort, that is, proper, clear, and significant Words, that will not by their Baseness offend the more Judicious, nor by their Unacquaintedness be unintelligible to Persons of good Sense, tho not of great Learning. As it is a great Mistake to think the elevated Stile is form'd of sounding Words and lofty Diction, which consists chiefly in the Greatness, Strength, and Majesty of the Sentiments; so on the other hand, the Poet must not use course and familiar Expression, on pretence of conveying his Thoughts with greater ease and clearness; for that would destroy the Sublime another way. and ranging of the Words, I will be more particular on this Subject. Words are the Marks and Representations by which we communicate our Conceptions to others; and there are three sorts which we use for this purpose; the Plain, Strange, and Figurative. The Plain and Simple, whose signification is by common Custom sufficiently establish'd, when well chosen and well dispos'd, become the Foundation of all Eloquence: The Poet therefore, that he may write justly and correctly, is oblig'd to use none but pure and proper Words, such as are authoriz'd by the most eminent and approv'd Authors, and are generally receiv'd by Men of Condition, Education, and Learning, in the Age in which he lives. like some of their Neighbours, to refine and embellish their Language, yet the Genius of the Times, and the great Improvements made in the politer Parts of Learning, have rais'd it to a greater height of Purity than that of past Ages. Abundance of obsolete Words and sordid Phrases are banish'd, not only from the Press and Pulpit, but from Conversation likewise; and if there be any who continue fond of uncouth and antiquated Terms, they have few intelligent Persons among their Admirers. The Language of the present Times is so clean and chaste, and so very different from our Ancestors, that should they return hither, they would want an Interpreter to converse with us. And why should any be fond of an old Mode, when the far greater Part are got into another Dress, and especially when the Change is so much more decent and convenient? It is a sordid Disposition of Mind, that makes any Men prefer their rustick and offensive Stile, before those pure and beautiful Forms of Speech which our Tongue abounds with; where none have reason to complain of scarcity of Words, against which there lies no Objection, to express their strongest Sentiments to the greatest Advantage. Should we lay by all base and unbecoming Phrases, and cast off the Rust and Dross of Antiquity, we should still have enough left, not only to put our Thoughts into a bare Habit, but to serve also for Pomp and Ornament. always examines their Purity and Propriety, so in the next place, he ought to have great regard to their clearness and aptitude to represent his Thoughts. All Terms are, by Use and Custom, stampt with their distinct Significations, and when many may be employ'd to express the same Thing, yet some bear a more lively Image of it, and convey it with greater Ease and Advantage than others. Words, like good Pictures, are to be valu'd more for their Likeness and Resemblance, than their Richness and Splendor: For if they are strong and clear they go immediately to the Head, and thence directly to the Heart, and will instruct and excite the Reader more, and with more ease than long obscure Sentences and tedious Circumlocutions; which is the Reason, why Aristotle so much condemns those Orators, who affect always a Paraphrastical way of Speaking, when a few proper and plain Words would have done their Work better, and much sooner. should greatly recommend them to the Poet: And these Vertues are found in them, either in respect of their Sound, or their Signification, or their Number: A judicious Poet seeks the purest and most natural, not the most sounding and splendid Terms. He does not reject these, provided they have the other more desirable Properties: But he is not solicitous to bring into every Line, such as have little else to make them acceptable, but the Pomp of their numerous Syllables. He does not affect always to shine forth in bright Expressions, nor does he soar aloft in ever Period. A decent and masculine Stile abhors the Vanity of such Diction, which, wanting Thoughts and Sense to fill and animate the Sentences, is so far from being strong and majestick, that it becomes feeble and ridiculous. by restraining the Luxuriancy of his Words, which in Reason should be no more than will serve to convey his Thoughts; nor more than are equal and commensurate to the Sense, and adapted to the Capacities of the Reader. And if this Rule were observ'd, many Writers would be oblig'd to cut off great part of their Poems, as altogether useless and impertinent. Some of a poor and shallow Understanding, endeavour to supply their want of Thought, by the redundancy of their Sentences; others who indeed think well, for want of skill, do often so over-charge their Works with unnecessary Diction, that they lose much of the Beauty and Strength of their Performance, while by many synonimous Terms and a Train of long and founding Epithers, their Thoughts are overwhelm'd, and the Sense is carry'd off in a Torrent of Words. from the great Fertility of their Genius, and is mostly incident to younger Men, who have warm and active Fancies, and not Judgment enough to restrain their Excesses. These should therefore study a more sober Conduct, and hold the Reins over their Imagination more steady, that it may not run on with that Violence and Impetuosity, to which it is naturally inclin'd. They should consider, that the Words in which we dress our Sentiments, like the Habits of our Bodies, become beautiful and convenient, by their fitness and exact Proportion; and what is more than this, is ordinarily not only superfluous and useless, but inconvenient and burdensome. Our Garments are made for Defence and Decency, and are not so vast and numerous as to load and oppress us; and if we add Jewels and Ornaments, they are neither many nor ponderous: If in proper Places, as in Epick Works it very often happens, the Poet would appear with greater Splendor, as the most modest Persons do on solemn Occasions, he may give his Fancy greater Liberty, and let it shew its Plenty and Magnificence: He may not only cloath his Thoughts in apt and plain Expressions, but may form others richer and wider for Pomp and Dignity, if his good Sense has Strength and Majesty enough to support them; otherwise there will be such an Excess of Words, as a sober Stile will not endure. without a Metaphor, but not without Surprize and Novelty; and these are either ancient, but not obsolete, or foreign, which are borrow'd from other Languages, or compounded. Aristotle allows the use of these to Poets, and says of the first, That they render the Sentences more majestick and venerable; and the rest, as unusual and surprizing, raise our Admiration, and give us Pleasure in the hearing: Yet he enjoins the temperate use of them, and tells us, that it requires a great deal of Conduct to observe the Decorum, it being very easy to abuse the Liberty of employing strange and uncommon Words; but he forbids the use of them to the Orator; For, says he, only proper, familiar, and metaphorical, in exclusion of ancient and unusual Terms, are profitable and becoming in Prose. has enrich'd it self with many Words borrow'd from other Languages, especially from the Latin , these being insensibly introduc'd and naturaliz'd by Custom, are no longer Strangers. And tho the use of these before they are made free and incorporated into our Language by general Consent, discovers the Writer's Vanity and Affectation , yet afterwards he may safely and laudably employ them; only he should observe that it will be ungrateful to the Judicious, if he shews himself always solicitous to bring in Terms but newly admitted and made English , when we have a sufficient Plenty besides, altogether as beautiful and significant. But for compounded Words, they never succeeded well in English , either in Verse or Prose; and tho some Writers in Imitation of the Greeks , whose Tongue is ennobled and adorn'd by them, have attempted to bring in this Custom, yet they have not been able to establish it; our Language will not bear such Compositions, and therefore Heart-awakening, Nation-destroying , and such like double Words, make but ill Musick to an English Ear. the Ranging of them in the justest Order, and the forming of the Periods, the following Rules may be useful. Since in turning a beautiful Sentence, there is requir'd a just Proportion of Quantity, the Poet is oblig'd to observe a due Mediocrity between excessive Length and Brevity; which he will do, if his Periods entirely and clearly express his Mind, and are no longer than may be comprehended at the first Reading. indistinct Sentences, by which his Attention is broken, his Memory confounded, and his Patience exhausted. Therefore Aristotle condemns the continu'd and uninterrupted Stile of the Ancients as most ungrateful, and gives this Reason for it, That the People can never see it finish'd. The pompous Asiatick manner, where the Period was never compleat, till the Sense was ended, which therefore took up an immoderate Compass, must be very difficult to be apprehended. Few are able to manage such long and unweildy Sentences with the Success that Cicero has done it: We find, when the Language and Judgment of the Romans were rais'd with their Empire to the greatest Height, the Delicacy and Severity of the Age would not bear this tedious and diffusive Stile, tho perhaps the Men that endeavour'd to retrench its Exuberance, especially Seneta , ran into the other Extream, a Fault very common to Reformers. But tho the Writers in Prose were more careful to avoid this Error in the Augustan Age, yet Horace in his Lyricks of the sublime kind, very often by suspending his Sense for a great number of Lines, disgusts and perplexes the Reader; his Excess in the Proportion of his Sentences in his Odes is the more surprizing, because in his other Poems he is so concise and so frugal of Expression, that he becomes obscure by the contrary Extream. To conclude; the Sentences should be so bounded and so distinct in their Parts, that the Thought may at first View be apprehended, without giving any Pain or Confusion to the Mind. then the Stile will be so close and the Stream of the Narration will flow with such precipitation, that the Readers will not have time to catch the Sense; they will be always embarass'd and troubled to find out the Poet's meaning; and the quick and hasty passing from one Sentence to another will so distract them, that they will not be able to keep Company with the Author. Before one Period has finish'd its Impression on their Thoughts, another coming suddenly on, effaces the imperfect Strokes of the former, which must needs disturb and disappoint the Reader. Words be so united as to render them clear and perspicuous; and to this two Things are requir'd, that the Connexion of the Terms be easy and natural, and that the Period consists of distinct Members. As to the first, an English Writer is unpardonable, if the Order of his Words is not plain and obvious, for which perhaps no Language in the World affords such great Advantages; no other admits and preserves that regular Succession of the Words as our own. In the Greek, Latin, Italian, German , and Spanish Tongues, especially in the two first, the unnatural Transposition of the Terms extreamly obscures the Sentiments of the Writer; their Periods are inverted from the Order in which the Mind form'd its Conceptions; and if the Words are the Images of our Thoughts, this is to represent them in a very irregular and distorted manner; as if a Man were drawn with his Head between his Feet, or his Heels in the Air: Nothing being more common with these Writers, than to begin with the End or the Middle, and to leave off with the Beginning. The Nominative Case, which should in Reason, and does certainly in Construction, lead the Sentence, and precede the Verb, in these Languages sometimes conceals it self in the Middle, and is often reserv'd for the End: And there are many other Transpositions altogether as cross and troublesome; and tho perhaps by this means the Period may become more harmonious, yet it grows much darker and more perplex'd, and therefore vexes and distracts the Mind more than it gratifies and delights the Ear: And tho the French are more regular in placing their Words, than those above-nam'd, yet they range almost in every Sentence so many Particles and Relatives before their Verbs, which according to the Dictates of Nature and Reason ought to follow, that it greatly abates the Easiness and Perspicuity of their Stile. But the English express their Thoughts in the same Train and Method in which the Mind conceives them; at least they may do it, if they affect not to be obscure: When we form our Periods, no hasty Words thrust themselves in before their Turn, and none linger or are left behind to trouble and interrupt the Current of the Discourse, than which nothing can contribute more to render a Stile easy and intelligible. Prose; and tho the Poet is allow'd greater Liberty in transposing his Words, yet from what has been alledg'd it will appear, that he has great Advantages from our Language, to enable him to express his Thoughts in a regular Train and Succession, and by that to impart Perspicuity to his Diction. Parts of fit Proportion, and regularly succeeding each other. Aristotle requires this when he says, "A compound Period is a fort of Elocution finish'd, perfect for its Sense, consisting of distinct Parts, and that can easily be pronounced in a Breath." And Cicero tells us, That a Period of more Members or Articles is most delightful, most perspicuous, and most easily retain'd, giving the Orator and the Audience time to breath and rest. Art of Versifying, which consists in a free and natural Order and Connexion of the Words in a beautiful Succession a musical Cadence, and a noble Train of the Periods; the Sentences should be full, but easy and clear, moderately extended, but not drawn out so far, as to keep the Reader too long in suspence; which generally they will do, if they exceed the length of six Lines. To avoid the Error and Deformity of unconnected and independent Couplets, which, in the Writings of some Poets, are so detach'd and unconcern'd with the rest, that the Reader may as well begin with any Two, either in the Middle or the End, as with the first, and quite invert the Order in which they are placed by the Author, without any Injury done to the Poem, by confounding the Sense: To avoid this Error, I say, the Writer must be careful to unite his Lines, and make them, in their Sense and Construction to depend upon one another, and not always to compleat the Sentence at the End of the second Verse. To avoid Monotony and Uniformity in finishing the Sense, and giving a Rest at the End of every Couplet, which is tedious and ungrateful to the Reader, the Poet should often run the Second Line into the Third, and after the manner of the Latines , and Milton , make the Stop in the Beginning or Middle of it; this will vary the Sound that before returned to Satiety, relieve the Ear, and give Dignity and Strength to the Narration. makes all its Pauses and Advances with due leisure, and each Point succeeds in its proper Time and Place, it will appear beautiful, and be fully comprehended; whereas, without this Oeconomy in conducting the Sentence, there will be such a Tumult and Confusion, such a mix'd and disorderly Croud of Words crossing and pressing upon one another, that the Stile must needs be dark and deform'd. As the just Proportion of the Periods hinders the Stream of the Narration from overflowing, so this orderly ranging of the Words and dividing the Sentence into distinct Parts, saves it from being troubled and interrupted. As to the harmonious Course and musical Cadence of the Sentences, which some too much neglect, and others insist upon with too much Care, it arises from a grateful Variety of apt and melodious Words happily intermix'd, and regularly succeeding one another; whence the Period, like a peaceful River, flows without Tumult, and supports it self equally in every Part. If the Objects are noble and majestick, and the Terms significant and well sounding; if they are so artificially connected, that the Strength and Firmness of some uphold the Weakness of others, that are apt to sink and creep; and the Softness and flowing Easiness of these smooths the Roughness and tempers the Rigour of those; the Dignity of the Thoughts, and the Splendor of the Phrases being likewise suppos'd, the Narration cannot fail of being admirable and delightful. whence their Diction is very beautiful and sublime. But tho Horace in his Odes is admirable, and the happiest Writer imaginable in the choice of his Words, yet it is evident he is defective in the disposition of them; for frequently his Sentences are not only too far extended, but by reason of many hard Transpositions, and the irregular ranging of his Words, his Sense is often so involv'd and clouded, that it is difficult to discover his meaning. perplex'd Stile; where the Words so croud and justle each other, and the Phrases have such a staring Look and awkward Pace; where the Links of the Discourse are so broken, the Periods being without distinction of Parts or natural Order, here cramp'd with Parentheses, and there disjointed and gaping for want of Connexion, that the Work instead of a beautiful Structure becomes a rude heap of Words. And this was often the Case of our English Poets, before Waller attempted to cultivate and refine our Diction, and led others, by his Example, to aim at Elegance and Politeness. Expression, so are others for their too great Concern and Labour about it. As a Man may as well be too finical as too sordid in his Dress, so a Poet may easily exceed the Bounds of Moderation and Decency, and bestow too much Time and Pains in turning the Periods, polishing the Stile, and beautifying the Phrases. True Eloquence is not so much solicitous about its Ornaments as its Strength, and tho it loves Decency it despises the Luxury of a wanton Stile. his Stile on purpose, that the People might believe the Agitation and Disorder of his Mind was the Cause of this Irregularity; since 'tis not likely a Man mov'd with violent Passions, should be so elegant and correct in his Diction, as a calm and sedate Writer. forming of Periods, will fetter and restrain the Invention of the Writer; he will compose in such Fear, and his Imagination will be so curb'd and check'd in its Attempts, that he will not be able to form any great and surprizing Ideas; which Effect judicious Men observe in the Discourses and Writings of those, who are excessively curious about their Stile. I confess, I am very much pleas'd with elegant Phrase and fine Expression; but then I would have Quintilian's Advice observ'd, That this shining and beautiful Diction be employ'd to represent Thoughts that are much greater and more sublime. If the Sentiments are generous and majestick, it is but fit they should appear in a richer and more splendid Dress; but when they are mean and common, their Habit should be so too. An intemperate and too anxious Care about the Ornaments is as ungrateful, and as much to be censur'd as our Negligence. Nescio negligentia in hoc, an sollicitudo sit pejor. Diction so close, as makes it dry and barren, and dwell so long on correcting and finishing, that they emaciate and starve the Stile, which by this means wants the Spirit, Strength, and florid Aspect of a masculine Production. While they aim at a clean and elegant manner of Writing, by too scrupulous exactness, they enervate the Expression so much, that it will never rise to the true Sublime; that is, will never become rich, magnificent and admirable. It may please, but will never astonish. It may be without Faults, but then it will have few Beauties; and if there be nothing to be censur'd, there will be little to be admir'd. These Men are not endow'd with a generous, free and daring Genius, which is necessary for elevated Writing, and have too much of the Grammarian and Corrector to attempt lofty Flights. Their Poetry is so bare and spiritless, that it approaches near to Prose; and a prosaick Poet is no more acceptable than a poetical Orator: It proceeds from a false Taste of Elegance and Simplicity, that the Poet is so thristy and parsimonious in his Diction, and allows so little Expence in Ornaments. For fear of redundance in Words, too daring Figures and immoderate Pomp of Expression, they defraud their Stile of becoming and necessary Graces. They always grovel and creep below; and least they should fall, are afraid to rise. These Poets dress their Thoughts as Quakers do their Bodies, whose Garments are fit, clean and modest, but without Ornament. But it is certain, the Habit of a Gentleman, that is richer and more splendid, is more polite and agreeable. Should a Prince, especially on solemn Days when usually he is clad in Robes of State, appear in the plain and cheap Dress of a frugal Citizen, he may look neat and decent, but by no means August and Majestick. Now it should be consider'd, that in the Epick Stile where the Persons are Illustrious and the Action of great Importance, Magnificence and Splendor are always requir'd; and indeed Profusion is here scarce a Fault, or if it be, it is however more pardonable than a niggardly Oeconomy; and for this Reason Homer may in some measure be defended against the Censure of those, who except against his Stile as Redundant. Affectation, and become obnoxious to Pliny's Censure, Such an Orator has no Error but this, That he has none. It is the Vertue of a good Speaker and Writer sometimes to commit a Fault, and by a study'd Carelesness to leave some Blemishes, to avoid the Vice of too great Politeness, that exposes the Art by making it too visible. All the Masters of Eloquence agree, that it is the greatest Regularity sometimes to transgress the Rule, for which Reason we see so many rough and abrupt Places, and so many Disorders in Number, Metre and Syntax interspers'd in the Orations and Poems of the Greeks and Latins , yet with so much Beauty and Art, that they please as much with their Negligence as with their Labour, and from their Faults Posterity has learned to make Figures. polish'd Diction, which the most careful Writers contend for; there is sometimes a Roughness in the true Sublime, like that in the Surface of some stately Buildings, which makes it appear, if not more Beautiful, yet more Majestick. The Epick Stile requires something above Elegance and Neatness, for the greatest Part it should be elevated and marvellous, which it may be, notwithstanding some Neglects and Inaccuracies that the Writer is not solicitous to avoid; and therefore I am apt to think, that the Ã† neid was industriously transmitted to Posterity without that finishing, which the modern Criticks demand. It is evident, that the Author was able to have given as much Correctness to his Epick Poem, as he had done to his Georgicks , and he wanted not Time for it, having employ'd many Years to bring it to Perfection: And therefore that he left it as it is, seems to proceed from Deliberation and Choice. But there is yet a stronger Argument to support my suggestion. Suppose that Virgil , out of Negligence, or from want of Leisure or Industry, left his Poem unfinish'd; yet let it be consider'd, that after his Death the Emperor submitted it to the Correction of two great Criticks, Tucca and Varius , the last of whom was Virgil's intimate Friend, and, as Horace assures us, an excellent Epick Poet; and therefore there is no doubt but these Persons were well qualify'd to execute the Commission they had receiv'd that they were capable Judges of an Heroick Work, and could soon discern the Beauties and Errors of it: And as they were able to find out the Errors, so if they had any regard to the Trust repos'd in them, and their Duty to their Prince; if they had any Concern for the Honour of their Country, or the Reputation and Fame of a deceas'd Friend, they must likewise have been willing to correct them; but since they have left several Imperfections without Amendment and unexpung'd, it is evident that these Criticks did not censure them as Faults, or at least look'd on them as such, as would not blemish the Beauty or debase the Dignity of an Epick Poem. in the Epick Stile is the Use of Figures, or such Forms of Expression as raise the Discourse above that of common Conversation; which are sedate and calm, or vehement and passionate: Of the first sort, which concern the beautiful Order, musical Cadence, and acute Signification of the Words, as well as the spiritful and surprizing Turns of the Diction I look on a Metaphor to be the most useful, as that which principally ennobles and adorns the Narration of an Heroick Action, by making it Figurative and Allegorical. A Metaphor is an oratorical Figure, that represents one Object by the means of another, and is of all others of the sedate sort, the most lively and impressive; the Ingenuity and Sharpness of our Conceptions chiefly consist in joining Notions, that have a great Likeness between them, tho found in distant and very different Objects, in which while the Mind conceives and compares many distinct Qualities and Habitudes, as it observes great Dissimilitude between some, so it discerns certain Relations and Respects in which others are alike; and then singling out those Ideas that resemble each other from the rest, it makes use of one to express the other. It requires therefore a metaphysical Abstraction to form a Metaphor; and whereas other Figures are employ'd only about the Words and the Order of them, this penetrates the Notion of Things, and searches Affinity and Agreement among the most opposite and disagreeing Objects. Therefore to form a Metaphor, as Aristotle observes, is requir'd great Activity and Sagacity of Mind, since it must run through such variety of Subjects, and so many different Respects and Considerations under which they fall, to find out the Similitude of two Notions, from the Union of which the Metaphor results. So that while other Figures cloath and adorn our Thoughts with Words, this enlivens and embellishes the Words by our Thoughts, whence it becomes the most agreeable of all Figures. Others may raise the Narration from a flat and low Manner, but this gives it all that it has of surprizing and extraordinary. The Strangeness and Ingenuity of representing one Object by another, strikes the Reader with agreeable Admiration. We are gratify'd to see an unexpected Idea presented to our Understanding, and wonder at the beautiful Conjunction of Notions so separate and remote before; and whatever is marvellous is delightful too; as we always feel a Pleasure at the sight of Foreigners and their Garments, so the Mind rejoices to see an Object out of its ordinary Dress, and appearing by the help of a Metaphor in the Habit of a Stranger: At the sight of such unusual and wonderful Images, we are as much pleas'd as with the sudden changing of Scenes, or with the curious and extraordinary Works of Art or Nature, which we never saw before. us, this Figure has the Advantage of all others, since it leads the Mind with great swiftness from one Object to another, and in one Word represents more Things: And as this is delightful to the Reader, so it is exceeding useful to the Poet, who by this means will have great Plenty of Ideas in his Imagination, and be always supply'd with apt and lively Expression, which the Poverty of his Language and the Scarcity of Words could never have furnish'd; for when ever a proper Term is wanting, which happens very often in the most copious Tongue, a Metaphorical one is always at hand to make good that defect. beautify the Diction, being dispers'd like so many Stars or sparkling Jewels through the whole Composition. Aristotle makes all that is extraordinary and admirable to consist in these foreign Images, than which nothing can more heighten and illustrate the Sentiments, or give more Force and Dignity to the Stile. Thus as the use of Garments, which is Cicero 's Remark, was at first introduc'd by Necessity, but did soon after serve for Pomp and Magnificence; so translated and metaphorical Words, which the Sterility of their native Tongue and the want of proper Terms oblig'd Men at first to use, were quickly employ'd as Ornaments to give Splendor and Majesty. Beauty, but their Force and Spirit too, if the metaphorical Words should be chang'd: for the Proper are unable to convey the Thoughts of the Poet with such Advantage; and this happens chiefly where Intellectual Notions are represented by others deriv'd from the Senses. The Soul, while immers'd in Flesh, is oblig'd to act iu a great measure dependent on the Body; and having been long accustom'd to receive her Ideas from the Objects that pass through the Senses, she contracts a great Propension to conceive every Thing by that way of Conveyance; and when that cannot be obtain'd, the Mind acts in Pain and seems uneasy and dissatisfy'd. And therefore to assist her, and render her Conceptions more lively, easy, and delightful, we put our Intellectual Ideas into a foreign Dress, borrow'd from the Senses. Hence we say, the Sight or Blindness of the Understanding, the Bent or Biass of the Will, the Sweetness of Knowledge, the Beauty of Vertue, the Deformity of Vice, a muddy or a clear Head, and a thousand other such Modes of Speech may be observ'd; and no proper Word can in these Cases signify our Sentiments so well. Hence in the sacred Scriptures, the supream Being is pleas'd to teach us spiritual and Divine Things by sensible Representations; such as the Kingdom of Heaven, an Incorruptible Crown of Glory, the Breast- plate of Faith, the Sword of the Spirit; and an infinite Number more of the like Expressions might be mention'd. in the first place care should be taken, that it be not obscure, which it will be, as often as it is conceiv'd in Terms not easily understood, or when the Notions are search'd and fetch'd too far; the Mind must be surpriz'd at the Novelty of the Image, but not put to any Trouble to find out the Similitude, which gives Being to the Metaphor; and therefore it must be so represented, that the Understanding may at the first View perceive the Agreement. Nor must the Analogy be founded on too nice and fine Considerations, nor express'd in Terms to which a competent Reader is not accustom'd; for either of these will darken the Metaphor, as that will deform the Diction, the Beauty of which much consists in its being clear, and easy to be understood. A Metaphor must also be exactly proportion'd, otherwise it will be ungrateful or ridiculous. I do not mean, that there should be no Dissimilitude or Deformity between the Objects, for very lively Figures of this sort are found in Things very opposite; but that there should be a just Resemblance or Conformity between those two Notions or Respects, that are abstracted from the rest, and united in the Mind of the Poet, when he forms a metaphorical Idea. Therefore he that has the most active Imagination, and that can with a quick and searching View pass through Multitudes of Objects, examine their Nature, and penetrate their several Qualities, that can readily discern their Agreement and Differences, separate the Like from the Unlike, and join those together that exactly resemble one another, will be the most able to form these just and well proportion'd Figures, which the Masters of poetical Eloquence so much admire. will be, if in the Translation of the Word from its proper Place to that where it serves as a Figure, it may seem to come willingly and not by constraint; otherwise it will appear study'd and affected, and instead of pleasing, will greatly offend the intelligent Reader. But if the two former Rules are observ'd, this Error will be avoided; for Metaphors are then forc'd and unnatural, when they are either fetch'd from Objects too remote and uncommon, or if from others more familiar and known, yet the Notions are not well proportion'd and adapted one to another. If the Metaphorical Image be too little or too short, the Representation will be lame and imperfect; if it be too narrow and strait, it will pinch and sit uneasy on the Object to which it is apply'd, and if it be not sufficiently refin'd and separated from Notions unlike and disagreeing, it will become irregular and deform'd. must not represent one Object by another, whose Image will be justly shocking to sober and modest Readers: For tho the Similitude, which is the Foundation of the Metaphor, may be clear and perfect between the two Notions, which he compares, and tho that Resemblance only is exprest, yet since the Word, which he uses, conveys an associate Idea, which is indecent and offensive, at the reading of it the noxious as well as the innocent Meaning is awaken'd in the Mind, which can scarcely conceive the one without the other. The Gravity and Dignity of the sublime Character will oblige the Epick Poet to forbear such Metaphors, which by their Coursness will be misbecoming his important Subject, and by their Sordidness will disgust the Reader. If Words of a double Signification, of which one is impure, are justly censur'd in Low, Lyrick, and Comick Poetry, then it must be allow'd to be insufferable in Heroick Works, where all Things should be Chaste, Grave, and Great. and too delicate, for that will emasculate the Stile, and instead of instructing, amuse the Mind, and draw it off from the solid and marvellous Part of the Narration, to admire a Train of fine Words, and the Ingenuity of the Conceptions. Many Metaphors are so light and sparkling, and discover so much youthful Fancy, that the Dignity of Heroick Poetry will not endure them. As the Use of these will betray the Levity and Ostentation of the Poet, which extreamly misbecomes his Character; so it tends to vitiate the Taste of the Reader, who will be always hearkening after bright Sayings, and despise the noble Sentiments and moral Instruction of the Fable. tedious and ungrateful; this is a Fault for which Italian Authors are justly censur'd, their Metaphors are often so extended that they tire the most patient Reader; and it is by this means that their Stile grows redundant and obscure. It is an Error to lengthen a Comparison till it takes up great room in the Discourse, and much more is it so to continue and amplify a Metaphor, which is a narrower way of Expression than by a Similitude; for that asserts the Things to be the same, but this affirms only that they are alike, and shews wherein they are so. Metaphors, as said before, when well chosen, give great Life and Vigor to the Narration; but if they are excessive, they make it  Ã†nigmatical and turn it all to Allegory. This especially will be the Event, if they are as intemperate in their Number, as their Length: Figures of Eloquence are chiefly chosen to supply the Defect of proper Words; and when they are sought for Delight, and to give a Relish to the Narration, they must not be so many as will make it luscious. Effect of this will be a flatulent and bloated Stile. Such hardy and swelling Figures sit about the Object which they are intended to express, like loose and wide Garments upon a Man that walks against the Wind; it is more desirable to sink and creep than to be always tow'ring amidst the Clouds. It is enough to be now and then in the second Region, the Store-house of Metaphors as well as Meteors; but to be always in this noisy and tempestuous Place, forming strong and daring Figures, will by no means become the Chastness, Gravity, and Elevation of the Epick Diction. they are, be not chosen and introduc'd purely for their own sakes. As it is impertinent to strain the Fancy upon every Occasion for some ingenious and polite Figure, to gratify the voluptuous Taste of the Reader, so nothing more plainly discovers the Vanity and Ostentation of the Poet, than when he exerts his Genius and shews the Riches of his Fancy, where there is not the least Occasion for it. I allow, that an Epick Poet may, and ought to use Art in adorning his Stile; but if the native Lustre and Dignity of his Sentiments does not break through and eclipse the Splendor of the outward Ornaments, the Narration will be flat and disagreeable. The Beauty of a good Poem resembles that of a healthful Man, which springs from within, and arises from the Abundance and Vivacity of his Spirits, from his vital Heat and the regular Motions of the Blood. A Soldier may polish his Arms till they shine and glitter, and by that may dazle and terrify his Enemy; but it is their Edge and Strength that he will confide in, and not their Brightness. should remember Cicero 's Remark, That as it falls out almost in all Things, so it does in Poetical, as well as Oratorical Works, That those very Things that are most useful and profitable, have always most Dignity and Gracefulness. In the glorious Fabrick of the World, if we contemplate the regular and harmonious Order of the Parts One would think the Author design'd only to raise our delightful Admiration; if their Necessity and Usefulness, that he respected only our Profit and Advantage. In the Structure of Man, all the Parts are form'd with so much Wisdom, are so exactly proportion'd and dependant on each other in such admirable Order, where nothing is either defective or superfluous, and nothing to be alter'd, either for its Figure, Place, or Connexion, but to the greatest Disadvantage, that all Things appear shap'd and united intirely for Beauty and Majesty, and yet nothing seems contriv'd but for Use and Convenience. When in this manner good Sense is set off with the genuine Beauties of Poetry, the Composure will be both admirable and useful, and yet so easy and natural, that notwithstanding there is in it the greatest Art imaginable, no Labour or Mark of Affectation will be seen. they always ought to be vary'd so as to be accommodated to the Subject of the Discourse. Sublime and excellent Things must not be represented by others that are base and vile; nor must a low and humble Matter assume a pompous and magnificent Figure; such a Decorum is to be observ'd in changing these Ornaments, that they may be Magnificent or Modest, Sublime or Humble, Splendid or Plain, Calm or Passionate, as the Subject is to which they are apply'd; and this Variety, as it will render the Diction very Beautiful and Natural, so it will greatly contribute to the Pleasure and Advantage of the Reader. We are soon cloy'd with a Writer that always runs on in one beaten Track, that still entertains us with the same sort of Phrases, and has only the Sun and Clouds, and two or three more stale Topicks to furnish his Discourse with metaphorical Ornaments. An Heroick Poet Should have such sagacity of Mind, and such a sertile Imagination, that he need not be oblig'd, whatever his Subject is, to cloath it still in the same Dress; for tho it should be ever so decent and proper, and ever so well adjusted, yet it will be an Argument of the Poet's Poverty, as well as an Offence to the Reader, if he is always seen in the same Habit. of the Cool and Sedate Kind, I shall pass by the others of that sort, which are not considerable enough to be singly discuss'd. is proper to attain the Poet's End, which is to raise Admiration and Joy; and therefore the Stile should be so far enlarg'd, as a just Impression on the Reader's Mind makes it necessary. In plain Transitions and Historical Recitals, the Diction is to be kept in more moderate Bounds; for in such Instances a few proper, well-chosen, and well-plac'd Words will sufficiently signify the Writer's Mind, where a natural and decent Simplicity is only demanded. much diluted and dispers'd as to weaken its Spirit, and hinder its Effect. Words are but the Vehicles of the Thoughts, and therefore must be in such a measure as the Ideas can well animate; not so numerous as to enfeeble them so far, that they will not be able to move the Reader. As a close and concise Stile imprisons the Sentiments in too strait Limits, so this contrary Error stretches them out into such a thin Expansion, that they hover in the Air without Force and Weight. too much, the Poet should take care to draw Matter from the various Circumstances of the Subject sufficient to support his Stile, and secure it from languishing. Some Persons have an extraordinary Felicity in this way. Longinus observes it in Cicero , and we may take notice of the same in many others, as well Poets as Orators, who, tho they give themselves liberty, and take up a great Compass with their diffusive Diction, yet still they find Supplies to maintain their Discourse in equal Vigour, which they take from all Things that nearly respect and stand about their Subject, where they always discover something agreeable to their Purpose, and fit to furnish them with noble Ideas. more Beauty and Spirit than well-drawn Images and just Descriptions, which are so many lively and clear Delineations of an Object intellectual or sensible. This Faculty of forming Poetical Images, seems to excite an Apprehension of a distant Thing, by giving a Representation of it to the Ear, as Painting does to the Eye; but the former has this great Advantage, that it does not only express the outward Lineaments and Complexion, but also the internal Principles of Life and Motion, not only of Corporeal Beings, but likewise of the Soul and Immaterial Natures. When the Mind of the Poet has by vigorous and intense Contemplation master'd the Object, and form'd a true and bright Idea, it stamps the Impression on proper and well-rang'd Wordsin so strong a manner, that the absent Object seems in some sort present to the admiring Reader: And as this discovers the Regularity and Vivacity of the Poet's Sentiments, and the Extension and Force of his Imagination, so it shews likewise his Skill in choosing and disposing of his Words; both which united cannot but meet with great Success, if the Things, whose Images he represents, are truly Great and Sublime. Descriptions are call'd Pictures, which as oft as they are of a due proportion, pertinent, just, strong, and a lively Expression of the Objects represented, they are not only great Beauties and Ornaments of the Work, but they recreate and relieve the Reader by an agreeable Variety, retard the Rapidity of the Narration, and make it flow with a more gentle and sedate Course, which is necessary to a Writing of such extent, as that of an Epick Poem. If the Descriptions are luxuriant or very frequent, as they incumber the Poem and weaken its Force, so they misbecome the Gravity and Dignity of the true Sublime, and discover a wanton puerile Genius, which is always intemperate in this Article. But when kept in due Limits, the Poetical Images enliven and beautify the Poem, which is observ'd in Homer 's Ulysses and Virgil 's Ã† neid ; in which the Representation of Gardens, Palaces, rich Furniture, magnificent Feasts, Rivers, Embassies, Triumphs, and various other great Ideas, add Splendor and Ornament to the Poem. in some Qualities and Respects in which they agree; and this is a great Embellishment of the Writing, when the Resemblance between those two Objects is express'd fully, clearly, and with Strength and Spirit; but if the Comparison is lame and imperfect, or if it runs off into Circumstances remote and foreign to that Quality or Relation in which the Similitude is founded, it will lose its Effect, and not illustrate, but rather obscure the Poet's Sentiments. And this is evidently a Fault in Homer , who amplifies and swells his Similitudes by the Recital of Circumstances altogether impertinent to his Business; and even where there is some Resemblance, it is often so dim and defective, that it is not obvious and easily discern'd; which made a great Wit in the last Age say, That he never met with any Things so unlike, as Homer 's Similies . If the Similies are extended to a great Length they grow tedious to a judicious Reader, and if they are very frequent they suspend the Action too much: If they are base and course, which many of Homer 's must be allow'd to be, they offend against the Dignity of the Epick Stile. There is no Rule to settle the Length of a Comparison, it must be determin'd by the Nature of the Thing. If it does not fully and clearly express the Resemblance between the Objects compar'd, it is too short; if it does more, it is weak and redundant. It is therefore ridiculous to affirm, that because Virgil and Homer have never exceeded such a number of Lines in their Similitudes, this Proportion must be a Rule to all other Poets, as if Examples and not the Reason of Things were to guide our Choice. Sometimes the Simile may be dispatch'd in a Line or two, sometimes it will demand a greater number; most commonly four or six, sometimes eight or ten Lines, and sometimes yet more will not be redundant. Tho Homer has sometimes crouded one Similitude upon another to illustrate the same Thing, and Virgil has follow'd his Example; yet if one Simile be strong and fully expressive, a second, and much more a third, is, in my Opinion, superfluous and offensive. Similitudes, like other Figures, being the Ornaments and Jewels of the Diction should therefore be sparing; the Garniture and Trimming should be enough to set off and adorn, not so profuse as to cover and hide the Garment; and these Comparisons should be most us'd, where the Subject is dry and uniform, as in Sieges and Battles, where the same Matter often returning, would otherwise grow flat and tedious to the Reader. and which no Poet will manage with Success, without his own innate Fire; I mean, that warm and active Temper which we mention'd before, as requir'd on Nature's Part; give him the clearest Head and the most fertile Imagination, without this Poetical Fervency he will never be able to do any thing wonderful. It is true, this generous Impulse or Ardor of Spirit, if left at liberty and unguided, is liable to many Miscarriages and dishonourable Errors, and therefore I shall lay down the Rules which concern its due Conduct, after I have spoken of the Usefulness and Necessity of the Pathetick Figures to the Sublime Stile. Species of Poetry, and tho it is chiefly requir'd in Tragedy, which is more active and vehement, yet it is likewise necessary in Epick Works; and therefore what Aristotle, Cicero, Longinus , and Quintilian say, of the Necessity and Usefulness of Pathetick Figures in Oratory, is equally applicable to the sublime Poetical Eloquence. Longinus says, I dare affirm there is nothing that raises a Discourse more than a Passion discreetly manag'd. It is like a sort of Inspiration, that animates the Diction, and gives it such Force and Vigor, that it seems altogether Divine. Cicero says, all the Energy and Strength of Eloquence is to be express'd in exciting or quieting the Passions; and in another place says he, who is ignorant that the greatest Force of an Orator consists either in exciting in the Minds of Men Anger, Hatred, or Grief, or in reducing them from these Emotions to Tenderness and Compassion: And he affirms, that Orator will do nothing that is not acquainted with the Nature of Man, and the Means by which his Passions are mov'd and govern'd. prefers this Faculty of the Orator even to his Proofs and Reasons. He says, That Men of a narrow Spirit and slender Vein of Wit may, by the Assistance of Learning and Use, come to some Maturity in the Last; and of these, says he, there has been always a great Number: But for Orators that can command the Audience, and transform their Minds into what Shape and Appearance they please, these have been very few. Let the Orator, says he, study how to storm and impel the Minds of the Audience; this is his Province, this is his Labour, without which all Things will be naked, jejune, feeble, and ungrateful; as if the Spirit and Soul of Eloquence consisted in managing the Affections. Aristotle , who lays the greatest Stress upon the Proofs and Arguments, yet relies not a little on the passionate Forms of Expression, and says, That Men of a warm Complexion are of all others the most successful in the Art of Eloquence. And therefore he teaches Orators to express themselves in a pathetick manner; which they will do, says he, if in treating of an Offence or Injury receiv'd, the Discourse seems to come from a Man in Anger; or if they mention any thing impious or base, they seem to speak of it with Indignation and Aversion; and on the contrary, whilst they treat of any great and laudable Action, they express an extraordinary Joy and Satisfaction; and if the Subject is sad and worthy of Compassion, the Discourse be serious and accompany'd with a becoming Sorrow. Thus likewise speaking of the Choice of Words, he says, that greater Liberty is permitted to the Orator, when he has, as it were, transported the Hearers out of themselves, whether by Praises or Invectives, by his Anger or by his Joy, or the Motion of any other vehement Passion. many Rules and Precepts about the Nature of the Passions, and the most effectual Methods to excite them. For this End Aristotle has given a very exact Description of them, as well of those that predominate in the different Ages of Life, as in the different Ranks and Condition of Men; that the Orator being acquainted with the particular Tempers and Dispositions of his Audience, and the true Ways of speaking to the Heart, he may manage and govern them with ease, and lead them whereever he pleases. And what Breast will be able to hold out against a Speaker that is well appriz'd of all its weak and indefensible Places, who is not only able to possess himself of all the Passages, but knows how to form and keep an Intelligence within, and to attack it with his utmost Force in the very Season when 'tis prepar'd to surrender? That Orator will make himself Master of any Spirit, that can assault it with such Advantages, that can command the Passions, those Storms and Winds of the Soul, and they obey him. Hands of Posterity, that he design'd to write a Tract apart about the Passions . And Cicero , where above-cited, declares his Opinion, That it is impossible to be an Orator without the Knowledge of their Nature, and the Art of moving them. And as this is their general Doctrine, so we find their Practice was conform'd to it. Cicero admires Demosthenes for this, That he never spoke a Sentence but in a warm and pathetick way: Such was the Violence of his Figures, such the Majesty of his Thoughts, such the Force of his passionate Complexion, that a Man might as well stand against Flashes of Lightning, or stem a rapid Torrent, as hold out against his Persuasion. And Cicero , who was call'd the Latin Demosthenes , was like him in nothing more than his artful manner of addressing himself to the Affections. With what Vehemence of Spirit, with what Energy of Expression does he assault Verres, Catiline , and Anthony? With what bitter and sharp Invectives does he pursue them? In how lively and tragical Shapes does he represent their Crimes? What Sentence does not penetrate and wound the Person he accuses? How bold, how strong, how irresistible are all his Figures? Is it possible to stand against the commanding Force of his Exagerations, Exprobations, Threatnings, and Exhortations? Like a Tempest, like a Deluge, like a Conflagration, he seatters, dissolves, shakes, and overturns all Things in his way. Are not Quintilian's Declamations likewise full of these moving and warm Expressions? Does he not every where force his Entrance by the violent Assaults he makes on this Quarter? And had not C aesar's Eloquence been accompany'd with the same Vehemence and Ardor, which he express'd in the Field, he had never been honour'd with such Success. When Cicero gives the distinct Characters of the several famous Orators of his Time, this passionate way of Address makes a great part. " Sulpitius , says he, had such a vigorous Impulse of Mind, so full and so loud a Voice, such Agitation of Body, and Dignity of Gesture, and that Gravity and Plenty of Words, that no Genius seem'd better turn'd by Nature for the Art of Speaking. And afterward, "Do you observe, says he, the Manner of Speaking proper to Antonius , strong, vehement, full of Motion, on every side fenc'd and guarded, earnest, acute, clear, sifting every Thing, pursuing eagerly, terrifying, beseeching, with the greatest Variety of Oration, but with no satiety of our Ears who hear him." persuading, who is thus acquainting with the Avenues of the Mind, and knows how, by the force of his Sentiments, the violent, warm, and active Forms of his Expression, to lie and press like a strong Wind upon the Audience, till he drives them this or that way, as he leans upon them. parity of Reason, be apply'd to all the superior Kinds of Poetry, where Proofs and close Argument are not so much requir'd, as in Oratorical Performances. Persuasive Address, Skill and Capacity to work up the Passions, and touch all the Springs and Movements of the Soul, are so necessary to Tragick and Epick Poets, that it is not possible they should succeed without them. For how shall one of these Writers move Terror and Compassion, and the other Admiration and Delight, without the Art of changing the Soul by these various Emotions? The Instances of this kind are endless, which might be produc'd out of the Conferences, Speeches, and Contests of the Iliad and the Ã† neid , of which that of Dido to Ã† neas is one of the most admirable for its passionate Eloquence: But no Works whatsoever afford more Examples of pathetick Expressions than the Sacred Writings. Is it possible to use more moving Language, and more piercing Figures than those which every where they abound with in the Poetical and Prophetick Parts? How majestick and terrible are the Threats, and how earnest the Exhortations of the Prophets ? How sharp and penetrating their Reproofs? How awakening their Admonitions? How passionate their Expostulations? How few Sentences are there in the Psalms , that are not cast into some of these lively Forms? Nor in the New Testament are they less frequent. St. Paul , the great Apostle of the Gentiles , employs every where this vehement Diction; he intreats, beseeches, terrifies, reproves, exhorts, and expostulates with such variety of violent pathetick Figures, that the Kingdom of Heaven, by such a Management, seems to invade, and take the Auditors by Force. It is observable too, that we find the Forms of Prayer address'd to God by devout Men recorded in the Scriptures, full of these figurative Expressions, as if they were design'd to persuade the Almighty, by moving some Passion to change his Purpose; which manner of Invocation evidently shews, that this is the most effectual way to prevail with Men which we chuse to incline the Will of God. Scripture, for their Greatness, Majesty, and Force in moving the Soul, as superior to any in the Pagan Poets, I will select from them some Examples. What more Tender and Compassionate than this; O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee ? O I srael, what shall I do unto thee? for your Goodness is as a Morning Cloud, and as the early Dew it passes away. How shall I give thee up , Ephraim, how shall I deliver thee , Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeboim? My Heart is turned within me, my Repentings are kindled together .--- O Israel, thou hast destroyed thy self, but in me is thy help ---- As I live, saith the Lord, I have no Pleasure in the Death of a Sinner, turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die, O House of Israel.--- O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the Prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy Children, as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wing, and ye would not ?--- As to Ironical Forms of Speaking, which have great Force to move the Passions, that of Elijah to Baal's Prophets, when they had a long time invok'd their God, in vain, to answer them by Fire, is very sarcastical and cutting; Cry aloud, for he is a God, either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a Journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked .--- And that of the wise King to inconsiderate Youth; Rejoice, O young Man, and let thy Heart chear thee in the Days of thy Youth, and walk in the Ways of thy Heart, and in the Sight of thy Eyes; but know thou, that for all these things, God will bring thee into Judgment. As to the Forms of calling to Witness, which are also very Passionate, we have several Examples of them in St. Paul 's Epistles--- God is my Record, how greatly I long after you in the Bowels of Jesus Christ--- Wherefore because I love you not, God knoweth. been said, to make a stronger Impression of it on the Minds of the Hearers, are such as these; What thing shall I take to Witness for thee? What thing shall I liken to thee, O Daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I equal to thee to comfort thee, O Virgin Daughter of Zion?---Woe, Woe to the Inhabitants of the Earth, by reason of the Voices of the three Angels that are yet to sound ---Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, Hypocrites, for ye shut the Kingdom of Heaven ,  &c.--- Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, Hypocrites, for ye devour Widows Houses ,  &c.--- Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, Hypocrites ,  &c. As to Forms of Admiration, what can be greater than that Epiphonema of St. Paul, O the Depths of the Riches both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God, how unsearchable are his Judgments, and his Ways past finding out !---And that, O Death, where is thy Sting, O Grave where is thy Victory ! bewitched you, that you should not obey the Truth . And that of the Prophet against Jeroboam's Altar; O Altar, Altar, thus faith the Lord, Behold ,  &c. Masters of Eloquence call the Vigorous and Divine Forms of Speaking. All the inspir'd Writings, that are not Historical or Genealogical, so abound with them, that we meet with them in every Chapter, and almost in every Verse. That of St. Paul , wherein he Questions and Answers himself, is a way extreamly apt to touch the Readers; Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Ministers of Christ? I speak as a Fool, I am more. saith, it is not in me.---Destruction and Death say, we have heard the Fame thereof with our Ears ,  &c. O Earth, for I have nourished and brought up Children, and they have rebelled against me .--- And this that follows, which supposes both Hearing and Speaking in inanimate Things; Sing, O ye Heavens, for the Lord hath done it: Shout the lower Parts of the Earth, break forth into singing ye Mountains, O Forrest, and every Tree therein; for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel. set down any Example. all ye that desire to be under the Law ,  &c And the same Figure us'd by Joshua to the Israelites , is very great and impressive; Choose you this Day whom ye will serve, the Gods whom your Fathers served, that were on the other side of the Flood, or the Gods of the Amorites, in whose Land ye dwell; but as for me and my House, we will serve the Lord. others; and if his Expressions are warm and animated with his own Passion, they will easily transfuse the same Life and Energy into the Breast of the Reader, who is always affected as the Poet is; and therefore the Divine Fire must be first kindled in the Writer, who designs to convey his Impulse and Sentiment to the Minds of others. Advantage, That they give Fertility to his Fancy and Facility to his Diction, and the most natural and persuasive Forms to his Expressions. A Man mov'd with Anger, Sorrow, or Pity, never wants proper Words, fit Language, or a successful manner of Elocution. Hence it is that miserable Men have something more persuasive in their Expression and way of Address, than the politest Poets and Orators in the World. And those, who upon other Occasions had very indifferent Rhetorical Faculties, have learn'd that prevailing Eloquence from their Passions, which the greater Masters could never teach them. enlarge the Fancy, by expanding, and, as it were, inflaming the Spirits, or by fixing the Imagination intensely on its Object, that the Mind may be able to view all the Circumstances of the Thing it contemplates, and to form a clear and powerful Image of it. Thus we find that some Diseases, by rarifying the Blood, and giving quicker Motions to the Spirits, make Men fluent in Words and fruitful in their Thoughts, tho most commonly they want Judgment to conduct them. I conclude therefore with what Quintilian says on this Subject, which confirms the Affertion of Aristotle , mention'd before; let those things move our selves which we desire should move others, and let us be affected our selves, before we attempt to affect them: By this means the Poet will accomplish his Design, and not only transmit his Words to the Ears, but his Soul into the Breasts of his Readers. To the true Sublime in one Extream, is oppos'd the swelling and fustian Stile; where weak and trifling Thoughts are set off with all the Ornament that sounding Words and pompous Periods can bestow, while the slender Sense is effac'd with too much Colouring and Decoration. As this often happens on the Theater, when the Tragick Poet, that wants Judgment and Strength of Imagination, would supply the Defect of great and elevated Ideas, by turgid and windy Diction, and attempts to terrify the Audience by the mere Power of raging Words, or melt them into Compassion with tender and gentle Metaphors; so in the other upper kinds of Poetry, this Error is frequently committed by Writers of a low and barren Genius, who incumber and stifle their jejune and vulgar Sentiments by improper and redundant Expression, for which more Authors than Statius are justly censur'd. Tho the Words should be well chosen, and ranged with the greatest Exactness; tho the Figures should be just and splendid, and no external Graces should be omitted, this will not pass for sublime Eloquence, if good Sense and losty Conceptions are wanting, which should warm and enliven the Composition. Stile; where the Thoughts are low and puerile, the Diction familiar, course, and sometimes defective in the Art of vulgar Rhetorick, where the Phrases are base and rustick, and the Metaphors dark, poor, or fulsome, and the whole Discourse is a sad variety of Things ill conceiv'd, ill express'd, and huddled together without Order and Contrivance. MANY Years ago, in the Preface to the Paraphrase on Job , I declar'd against the decisive Power of Authority, and refus'd Submission to the Examples of ancient Writers, unless they were supportby Reason; and since it is evident, that among the Moderns we have no Originals, their Poets being all Imitators, who form'd themselves on the Greek and Latin Models, I express'd my Wishes that some great Genius, qualify'd for such an Undertaking, would break the Ice, assert the Liberty of Poetry, and striking off from a servile Imitation of the eldest Plans, would attempt an Epick Poem, in some measure, of a different Cast, but agreeable however to the Nature and Constitution of that Species of Poetry; such as might bear a Conformity to the Taste of the present Times, and to the Customs, Manners, and establish'd Religion of the Author's Country. I was not without Hopes that some persons of a free Spirit, Learning, and Capacity, would have improv'd the Hint, and by seconding my Attempt, have carry'd on the Design much farther; that by disingaging our Poets from Prepossession, they would have enlarg'd their Freedom, and deliver'd them from blind Obedience to Antiquity, and their Servitude to Opinions, receiv'd only upon the Credit of celebrated Names. But so great was the Prejudice of the polite Part of the Nation in favour of the ancient Poets, that it was look'd on as no less than down-right He-resy in Poetry, to entertain any Notions, that had not the Example of Homer , and the Warrant of Aristotle and his Commentators to bear them out; nor would any Man fail of being universally condemn'd as a Person of dangerous Principles, and disaffected to the Interests of Learning, that should write or speak any thing contrary to the Sentiments of Men of such Erudition and sacred Authority; I had therefore no Followers. The Ancients, especially Homer , continue in full Possession of their Reputation and Power. Criticks, who have lately stood up with great Courage in the Defence of the just Exercise of Reason, in examining the Writers of the most establish'd Credit. I acknowledge it is a Satisfaction, as it confirms me in the Belief of my having pass'd a right Judgment, to fee two Persons of such a polite Taste, of so much Penetration and good Sense, fall in with my Opinion, and warmly engage in the same Design, of vindicating the Rights of Humane Nature, of setting prepossess'd Men at Liberty, and restoring to them the free Use of their Understandings. Their Adversaries exclaim against them, as presumptuous and pragmatical Innovators, Men that from a proud and petulant Temper have reviv'd the Schism of Perrault ; whose Arrogance, say they, was sufficiently chastis'd, while his Notions were abundantly confuted by the able Pen of Despreaux . The other side, in their Defence, disown all Partiality to the Moderns, and disrespect to the Ancients; they declare, they have no other Intention, but to seek and discover the Truth by an impartial Inquiry into the celebrated Poem of Homer , and accuse the Criticks that stand by him, as Persons blinded with Prejudice and guilty of superstitious Adoration of his Writings, arising from the Applauses they have receiv'd from so many learned Men in all Ages. Perrault , say they; was born down by the superior Strength and Judgment of his Rival; and notwithstanding his Cause was good, he miscarry'd by an ill Management; that he was unequal to the Undertaking, and by several Errors and Mistakes, gave an occasion of Triumph to his Adversary. But then, say they, tho this Gentleman for want of sufficient Skill and Conduct, fail'd in his Attempt, at which no Man should be surpriz'd, since it was the first of the Kind; yet this does not bar the Right of any Men to resume the Controversy, who hope they can carry it on with a greater Prospect of Success. Thus a oritical War is broke out in France , and the Muses are engag'd in Civil Contentions, while one Faction is for pulling down the Authority of Homer , and the other strenuously opposes, and maintains the Credit of that Poet. In my Opinion, the Disputants on either side are partly in the right, and have divided the Truth between them, tho perhaps the Aggressors have the greatest Share; while the Poets that depreciate and decry Homer's Poem, stand up for the Privilege of Mankind, and the Reasonableness of examining the Evidence brought in favour of any Opinion before they embrace it; while they affirm, that Example and Authority are not Reason and Demonstration, and that every Man has a Power of deliberating and weighing the Arguments produc'd on each side of the Question, and a natural Right of judging for himself; lastly, while they assert that impartial Criticks may freely sist the Writings of the greatest Name and Authority; and where they believe they are not back'd with evident Reason, to censure and condemn their Practice, thus far their Opinion will bear the Test. For it is certain, that no Man's Understanding was ever design'd as a Standard for mine, any more than mine was intended as one for his. No Example is to be follow'd, but as it is just and reasonable; and how shall it appear so, if we have no Liberty to examine it? Universality and Antiquity are to be look'd on with Respect and Reverence; but since they have been often produc'd to support manifest Errors in Philosophy as well as in Religion, and have therefore been often rejected, why should they be regarded as infallible in Poetry? I shall therefore readily allow, that the Moderns have an undoubted Right to judge of the Works of the Ancients, and to appeal from Homer and Aristotle themselves, to the Decision of Reason. But then it must be allow'd, that great Care and Caution should be us'd that our Determinations be just and solid, when we deviate from the general Practice and Opinion of Men of eminent Learning and Candor through many successive Ages. As in my Judgment the critical Aggressors fall too severely on this famous Poet, and attack various Places, that may well be defended; so on the other hand, their Adversaries engage in too difficult a Province, when they undertake in all things to support him. The first shew a free Spirit, and have, to their great Honour, disingag'd themselves from a servile Submission to the Understandings and Dictates of the greatest Men, and by their Example have encourag'd a disinterested and unprejudic'd Exercise of our Reason. Their Adversaries seem more fetter'd with Prepossession, and by favouring too much the arbitrary Dominion of Authority and Antiquity, would check the generous Efforts of modern Genius's, whose Aim is to improve the Art of Poetry, and allow them only the Honour of being Imitators and Copyers of the Ancients. this Dispute may be brought to an amicable Conclusion, and that for the future angry Invectives, and the unnecessary Effusion of more critical Learning may be prevented, I would propose that each Party should lay by their Prejudice, make some Concessions, and relinquish some Pretensions that now they insist upon with too great Obstinacy. It is not to be doubted but there are great, if not equal Prejudices on both sides: When a Person has spent many Years in studying the learned Languages, and acquainting himself with the ancient Writers, it will be very difficult for him to part with the Superiority which he thinks he has acquir'd in respect of others, who are comparatively unvers'd in those Studies; he will be apt to look with Contempt on those that cannot pretend to so much Learning, and have little to trust to but Reason, a solid Judgment, and a good Taste. If I yield a controverted Point, will he be apt to say, to the naked Decision of Reason, how much Time have I spent in vain? How many Volumes have I turn'd over, and how many Common Places fill'd to no purpose? What will become of all my Reading? What will all my Citations and Authorities avail, if young petulant Writers, without Greek and Antiquity, shall be allow'd to dispute the receiv'd Maxims of Poetry, supported by the general Suffrages of the learned World? It is not, I say, reasonable to suppose, that these Persons will easily recede from their suppos'd Advantage of Erudition, tho it is little more than that of a Grammarian and Commentator, to degrade themselves, and level their Character with that of Men of mere Genius and an arguing Head. Whence it comes to pass, that these Persons (tho of all Learning that of the Commentator and Antiquary, which is the sole Effect of Labour and Memory, is the lowest) are the most remarkable for a fastidious Tempet, and appear always ready to take the Chair and dictate to Mankind. But to compose these intestine Feuds and prepare Terms of Accommodation, it is necessary that these Persons should shew a more candid and disinterested Spirit, and at least be willing to acknowledge every thing that is plainly prov'd against them. the Moderns are always freed from Prepossession; that they are not prejudic'd in the Favour of the present Age, of their own Country, and their own Performances: May they not envy the superior Fame and Reputation of the ancient Writers establish'd by the concurrent Applause of learned Men through so many Ages, and be very well pleas'd to pull down a mighty Power, which has spread so far, and lasted so long, that upon the Ruins of it they may erect an Empire of their own? Some, perhaps, may be willing to sink the Esteem of the eldest Authors, that they themselves may not seem to want any Excellence in not understanding the learned Languages, or to mortify some supercilious Commentators, whose whole Stock of Merit consists in expounding those Authors, and displaying their superficial Beauties. When such Reasons as these have prevail'd with Men of Wit and Letters, to espouse the Interests of the Moderns against the Ancients, their Engagement to a Party, and their Zeal for the Honour of carrying the Cause and triumphing over their Competitors, will still increase their Prejudice, lay a Biass on their Understanding, and prevent an impartial Judgment: We frequently see the greatest Sticklers for a free Exercise of Reason, and the most vehement Exclaimers against the arbitrary Power of Authority, as much enslav'd to their Prejudice against the Ancients, as the other Party is to theirs against the Moderns. weigh the Iliad without Prepossession, premeditated Ill-will, and an obstinate Resolution to be pleas'd with nothing in it; that they would not shut their Eyes to the shining and excellent Parts, and open them only to the Errors and Imperfections. I allow, that the greatest number of the Advocates for the eldest Poets, from an Ostentation of Judgment and Penetration, and to raise the Esteem of their Erudition, can find out nothing but admirable Sense, pure Diction, and inimitable Contrivance in the Iliad and the Ã† neid ; and employ all their Critical Abilities sometimes to extenuate and excuse their Defects, and sometimes to improve them into Vertues and Perfections, while they look upon the modern Writers with Contempt and Pity; and as they can discover no Faults in the first, so they can see no Beauties in the last. But then, on the other side, let not the Champions of the Moderns so far resent this Partiality and ill Usage of the later Poets, as out of Revenge to imitate the Example of their Adversaries, by censuring and condemning the Ancients to an unmerciful extent, and denying them the Praise which is really their due. Let them not enrich and advance the Moderns, by robbing and degrading their Predecessors and Masters; but let them weigh their Merit in impartial Scales, and do Justice to one without defrauding the other. If they discern Flaws and Errors in the first, let them take notice of their Perfections; if in the last they observe many Beauties, let them not be blind to their Blemishes and Defects. Let Candor and Judgment reign through all their Observations on either side, that the Reader may not be tempted to suspect the Equity and Sincerity of the Critick, while he sees him transported to indecent Excesses by an intemperate Zeal in a Party Cause. As to the Concessions to be granted by each Party. In the first place, I should judge it reasonable, that the Champions of Homer should no longer continue in their Intrenchments of Authority and Antiquity, defend themselves by Prescription, and draw about them Legions of Authors of their own Opinion for their Security; but that they should agree to quit their Fastnesses and come forth into the open Field; there let them oppose Reason to Reason, Argument to Argument, and let the strongest and clearest Evidence prevail. For it is no Demonstration that their Judgment is Right, because a Multitude of others have the same Sentiments. Aristotle 's Notions in Philosophy were, for many Ages, as universally receiv'd by the learned World as Homer 's Poetry, and esteem'd as the Dictates of the most profound Judgment and Oracles of Reason; yet, after he had reign'd in the Schools many Centuries with uncontested Authority, upon Examination he was discover'd to have no just Claim to this great Dignity; he was found out to be an Usurper, strip'd of his Titles and Regalia, and not only degraded, but treated with the greatest Contempt. Unless the Admirers of Homer will assert and prove their Infallibility, why may they not be deceiv'd as well as the Disciples and Adorers of Aristotle ? And if so, what Argument can be brought why they should not submit their Poet to an impartial Trial? It is in vain to urge the Suffrages of Antiquity, against clear and solid Argument. In this Case Citations are neither pertinent nor useful, for the Authors of former Ages are disqualify'd from giving their Votes in a Matter of this Nature; no length of Time, no not three Thousand Years, is a sufficient Prescription to bar the Claim of Reason, which has an undoubted Prerogative to seize upon its Rights, when, and wherever they are discover'd. Instances, in which it is too difficult to support him; and since it must be acknowledg'd, that no Production of Humane Understanding is faultless, and that the Intellectuals of Mankind are not more perfect than their Morals, it is no dishonour to any Author, that he is not intirely free from Imperfection; and therefore one has reason to suspect the Sincerity of any Critick or Commentator, that shall obstinately defend every thing in a prolix Author, and not allow, through the whole, the least Error or Blemish, especially when in such a Defence he is obliged to make endless Apologies, and many times such as are forc'd and unobvious, and rather ingenious and subtile, than natural and solid; and this is often the Case with the Advocates of the Iliad. considerable Flaws and Defects in the Contrivance of the Fable, in the Proposition, the Subject, the Connexion and Dependance of the Episodes, which have been detected by Rapin , and by two later French Writers; the last of whom has examin'd the Plan, as well as all the Qualities of that Poem, with more Penetration, Exactness, and just Observation, than all that have writ before him on that Subject. And when their Adversaries object to them the Indecency and Absurdity in the Actions and Manners of the Gods, who are drawn by Homer , not only with Impropriety and Inequality of Character, but with all the Passions and Infirmities, that are the Shame and Reproach of Humane Nature; in this Case they had better, in my Opinion, yield the Point to their Opponents, and demolish all the Works they have cast up for the Security of these paultry Deities, and give them up as defenceless and unworthy of their Care; for it is impossible to make any Apology, that will cover this faulty Conduct of the Poet. sacred Writings from the frequent Repetitions in Homer , and acknowledge that it is an Error that admits no Excuse; for if any other could have been made, I imagine, no Critick would have search'd for one in the inspir'd Books. A Disputant must be hard driven in a Debate about Poetry, that is oblig'd to defend the Practice of Homer from the Stile of the Scriptures, which were no more intended to instruct Mankind in the Rules of Poetical or Oratorical Eloquence, than in Architecture, Painting and Natural Science. It is true, the Sentiments in the Poetical and Prophetick Parts of the Bible are as great and elevated, and the Figures as bold, strong and expressive as can be found in the most celebrated Works of the Ancients; but as that Accuracy, Correctness and Perfection, which the Rules of Poetry and Eloquence demand in a finish'd Piece, are sometimes neglected in the Stile of the Sacred Scriptures, so were they never design'd to be a Model of indefective Writing. Tho they abound with noble and sublime Ideas, yet they were propos'd to the World as a Rule of Faith and Manners, and not of elegant and polite Diction. When the modern Astronomers affirm, that the Earth moves and the Sun stands still, should they be admonish'd that this is to affront the Authority of the Bible, where it is said, that the Sun runs his Race like a Giant, and that it was stop'd in its Course to favour the Israelites , while they slaughter'd their Enemies? For many things are express'd there, as accommodated to the general Conceptions of the People; the Scriptures being design'd by the Divine Inspirer to instruct Men in Religion, not in Poetry and Philosophy. It is therefore an Indignity to the Sacred Volumes, to produce their Authority in Justification of any Defects in Writing objected to the Ancients; for this is to misapply the Divine Revelation, by interesting it in the little Disputes of Wits and Criticks, in which it was never intended to decide. a farther step towards an Accommodation, by acknowledging Deformity and Inequality in the Manners of his Heroes; who often in their Actions, Speeches, and Passions, say and do many things contrary or improper to their respective Characters, of which their Adversaries produce many evident Instances. not allow to Rivers the Privilege of making Speeches in an Epick Poem, which is distinguish'd from other Fables by its strict observance of Probability, it may not be look'd on as an unreasonable compliance: For tho Virgil has made the Horses of Pallas to shed large Tears at his Funeral, the Latin Poet's Authority will no more bear down Reason, than Homer 's can do; and tho Virgil , while he follow'd the Greek Master, corrected many of his Defects, yet here it is plain, that to imitate his Model he misrepresented Nature, and transgress'd the Bounds of Verisimilitude; and it is in vain to produce the Error of one great Poet, to justify the same in another. The Case is quite different, when by eloquent Figures a Poet or Orator attributes Speech to Animals or insensible Creatures. For Instance, that in the Sacred Writings cited before, Hear, O Heavens, and give Ear, O Earth, for I have nourished and brought up Children, and they have rebelled against me ! And that of one of the Persons in the Book of job , enquiring after the Place where Wisdom makes her Abode: The Earth and the Sea say, she is not here; Death and the Grave say ,  &c. For the Reader immediately apprehending the Figurative manner of Speaking, is in no danger of being deceiv'd; but in the other Case, the brute Animal is engag'd as an Actor, and not brought in by a Figurative Expression. Homer , by this Management, inverts the Order, and confounds the Subordination of Beings. By endowing with Humane Speech and Passions, Beasts and inanimate Creatures, and introducing them as Parties acting in the Poem, he raises them to the Dignity of the Humane Species; as by giving to his Gods the Infirmities and Indecencies belonging to Humane Nature, he degrades and sinks them from their high Station to that of degenerate Man; and while he bestows on his Heroes incredible Power, gives them Courage and Strength sufficient to ingage in Combate with the Gods, and to inflict terrible Wounds on immortal Beings, he advances them to the Rank and Character of Deities: Thus he makes Men of his Beasts, and Gods of his Men, and Men of his Gods. The Poet, I imagine, was tempted to bring in this Confusion and Disorder by an affectation of raising Wonder and Surprise in every thing he represented, by which means he often blemish'd his Poem with the false Marvellous; for where there is not a just observance of Decency and Probability, a judicious Reader will always be shock'd, not delighted: And notwithstanding Aristotle , sway'd by the Authority of Homer 's Example, asserts, That in an Epick Poem, for the sake of raising Admiration, one may sometimes strain it to an unreasonable pitch, I cannot submit to his Opinion; for nothing that is unreasonable can please Reason, and nothing that is unnatural and therefore incredible can be acceptable to a discerning Taste. the great Honour of being the original Work of the most excellent Kind of Poetry, as far as appears by any Models now extant; and that if it be not absolutely perfect, it is nevertheless a wonderful thing, that the first Attempt of so difficult a nature should succeed so well, and come so near to a finish'd Piece. Besides, a candid Judge will attribute the Failings in so long a Work, struck out and labour'd in the Poet's Imagination without the help of a Model, to the Infirmity of Humane Nature, which is never capable of a faultless Production. full of noble and admirable Ideas, a sertile and exhaustless Invention, and great Vivacity and Splendor of Expression: That they observe a copious Variety of Characters well distinguish'd, while his Warriors, tho all Valiant, are judiciously diversify'd by mingling their Courage with various Qualities of another Kind, which is the best demonstration of a rich Genius. that it is far from being a finish'd Work; yet it is so perfect, that none of the Moderns dare set up any of their Performances in Competition with it. The French must not produce their Clovis , nor the Italians their Tasso and Ariasto , as Rivals to this Poet, notwithstanding his Blemishes and Defects: And if Virgil himself be compar'd with him, since it must be acknowledg'd that this great Poet is not an original Contriver, and no more than an exact Imitator, I had almost said a Translator of Homer , the first Rank of Honour must be due to the Greek Poet. It is true, that Virgil has avoided some of the Errors which he observ'd in Homer 's Model; but that he has retain'd others, and committed many of his own, and a greater number, perhaps, than his Admirers imagine, will, I believe, appear, should any Man with the same Penetration and Severity examine that Poem, with which two new French Authors have search'd and sifted the Iliad , to discover its Faults. their Competitors, that the principal Actors in an Epick Poem may be unjust and impious, violent and perfidious Persons; and therefore Homer is by no means to be condemn'd for introducing Warriors of such Qualities and Manners. The Idea of a moral and poetical Hero are very different; the first must always be represented as a Person of eminent Vertues and superior Merit, but the last may often be as much distinguish'd by his enormous Vices; for an Heroick Work being a devis'd Action or Fable, irreligious and wicked Persons may be engag'd in it, as oft as they influence the principal Design, and are necessary to bring about the Moral, which results from the whole. It is true, when the Characters are settled, the Poet must observe Uniformity and Congruity; and whenever those Persons are introduc'd in the Poem, he is oblig'd to make them act and speak in conformity to the Idea under which he represented them at first; and therefore they must every where appear like themselves; for whenever there happens, through Negligence or Defect of Judgment, a Disagreement or Contrariety in their Expressions or Manners to the first establish'd Character, the Conduct of the Writer will be justly condemn'd: And in this Case the Censurers of Homer have sometimes too great Reason to complain. But as to the Objection above mention'd, it arises from a false Notion of a Poet's Hero; the generality of Persons think, that the Conception of a Hero denotes, besides the Idea of Courage, some extraordinary Vertues; and 'tis hard to free the Mind from this Complication when that Term is offer'd to it; and therefore I wish that in speaking of Epick Subjects, Men would lay aside the Word Hero, because of its ambiguous Signification, and use in its place, either Chief Person, Actor, or Warrior, which would not tempt the Reader to expect a Man of uncommon Merit. Achilles and Mezentius , tho Cruel and Impious, may be as useful to promote the Morals of the main Action, as Nestor and Ã† neas with all their Piety and Wisdom. To require that all the Men in the Poem should be Persons of Vertue, is as unreasonable, as that all the Women should be ill Characters, according to Aristotle 's Maxim; which Assertion, since no Reason can be assign'd to support it, I reject as Arbitrary and Absurd. be greatly valu'd for their free and generous Spirit, in asserting the Right of Mankind to judge for themselves; and that they have detected many Errors and Defects in the Iliad , I acknowledge, seems to me very evident: But as it falls out, that many active and subtile Politicans, who with Vigilance and Art have pull'd down a settled Frame of Government, want Skill and Ability to erect a better in its place; so it happens to these Criticks; they strive to sink the Reputation of Homer and demolish the Iliad , before they have contriv'd a wiser Scheme. loose and crude Definition of an Epick Poem, that it will take in the whole Story of any Hero's Life; nor does he see, so he says, why a History of such a long Train of Events, should not be comprehended in the essential Idea of such a Work. King of France , by writing the great Atchievements of his Reign, and drawing the Character of an excellent Prince at a fuller Length than what has been yet attempted, as he himself suggests in his Discourse upon Homer , was willing that such a History in Verse should be called an Epick Poem; and therefore stretches the Definition of it so wide, that it might include an Historical Recital of the Life of any Illustrious Person. But when he shall consider with greater Attention, the Constitution and Essential Properties of an Epick Writing, and reflect that it is but one Fable, I believe he will, without difficulty, allow, that the Unity of the Poem depends upon the Unity of the Action; and therefore that a Poem that recites a long Train of independent Events, is not one Poem, but in the same Sense that a Heap of Grain is one Heap, or a Crowd of People is one Crowd: And there is yet greater reason to believe, that he will quit this as a defenceless Place, when he observes, that the judicious Author that has since embark'd in the same Cause, has declar'd against that Part of his Definition. given to the World as faulty a Definition of this kind of Poetry; but, as I suppose, upon a different View. The Poets of the French Nation, tho ingenious and polite Writers, not having yet attempted an Epick Work with Success, this Gentleman, that the Nation may not want an Heroick Poem, resolv'd to set up one written in Prose, and to make Quantity and Metre unnecessary in the Sentences of such a Narration, by which the Ideas of Oratio Soluta and Metrica are confounded. History in Verse, for the Reason, perhaps, above-mention'd; so on the contrary, the other has given such a dress'd and forc'd Definition, that a Fable in Prose may claim the Title of an Epick Poem; nor do the Precepts of Poetry, laid down by Aristotle , bear a greater Conformity to the Example of Homer , than the Rules of Poetry which these Criticks advance, are accommodated to the two several Designs, which I imagine, they had in view. is a more perfect Epick Poem, than those of Homer , or any other which he ever read. I allow that Book is the Production of a great Genius, that it contains many extraordinary Beauties, and an excellent Moral; but it can by no means claim the Appellation of an Heroick Work. A very great, if not the greatest part of it, tho the Diction is pure and elegant, is however entirely Prosaick, and not elevated above the familiar Didactick Stile; and therefore does not rise to the true Sublime requir'd in an Epick Writing: And tho some Parts contain a great deal of Poetick and splendid Expression, yet the Sentences not being measur'd nor limited by Quantity and Metre, it is no more a Poem than a Novel or Romance are such, in which the Unity of the Action is tolerably preserv'd. It had therefore been reasonable, that the Critick should have made it appear, that this Book was a Poem, before he had affirm'd that it was one of the Epick Kind. It is true, a Comedy is term'd a Poem, notwithstanding it is writ in Prose; the Reason is, because the Actors have vulgar Characters, and the Subject or Action is low and familiar, and therefore not proper to be represented in a figurative and lofty Stile: But if the Upper Lyrick and Epick Poetry, as well as Tragedy, where elevated Diction is demanded, is not rais'd above the Comick Dialogue and familiar Prose Expression, the essential Idea of the Sublime Stile is lost and confounded with that of the Low. has not acted in Conformity to his Character; for since in an Epick Poem, the Author often speaks in his own Person, there is as great reason why he should preserve Uniformity and Congruity of Manners in respect of himself, as in regard to his Actors. If the Actors in Telemachus , who are Grecian Pagans, should be introduc'd with the Manners of Jews, Egyptians , or other Nations remote from Greece , this Conduct would presently appear absurd and ridiculous; nor would it have been less incongruous, had Homer when he speaks in his own Person, always spoke as a Jew , an Egyptian , or Chaldean , and not as a Pagan Greek . Let it then be consider'd, that this celebrated Author evidently destroys the Congruity of Manners, while he never speaks in his own Person as a modern Christian, but as an ancient Heathen: He employs all their paultry Machines, engages Jupiter, Venus , and Cupid himself in the Action, and in the Character of Mentor , his Conduct seems as much absurd and inconsistent with the Properties of a Divine Nature, as that of Homer in the Management of his contemptible Deities. Certainly that Author should not be imitated, who has introduc'd Celestial Beings into his Action in such a way, as would tempt one to believe, that he was impious in Principle, and that to avoid the ignominious Character of an Atheist, and the Punishment of the Magistrate, as some of the Philosophers have done, asserted indeed the Existence of the Gods, but describ'd them in such manner, and engag'd them in such unworthy and oft immoral Actions, that they might appear ridiculous, and Religion be expos'd to Contempt. acknowledg'd in Greece and Rome , and such as were look'd on as imaginary Beings that had no real Existence, it must have been condemn'd as an unpardonable Error; yet this is the Case of Telemachus . The great Archbishop of Cambray does not appear in that Writing a better Divine than the Pagan Poet; and tho the Moral contain'd in it is fine, and very useful, is that sufficient without the Concurrence of other essential Properties to constitute an Epick Poem? Pagans with great Propriety, and without offering Violence to his own Character; because the Actors in Tragedy are introduc'd speaking and doing all Things themselves, while the Poet is intirely silent and unactive: But in Epick Poems the Author has a great Part, and speaks often himself; and therefore, as I have said, he ought every where to maintain his proper Manners, and is oblig'd by the Rule that enjoins such Uniformity, always to speak as a Christian, as much as his Actors, if they are Pagans, are bound to act and speak as such Idolaters. To set this Matter yet in a clearer Light. If this Writing is an Heroick Poem, the Author, no doubt, might have invoak'd, as is usual, the Assistance of some Deity. Now I ask, what Divinity could he have address'd himself to? Not to the Christian, for that would have been inconsistent with his Pagan Plan: And on the other hand, should he have call'd on any Idol or Abomination of the Heathens, how shocking must such a Prayer have been from the Mouth of a Christian Prelate? Whence it is evident, that no Invocation could have been made by the Author. And tho it should be said, that the Invocation is not necessary to an Epick Poem, yet none will affirm that it is impracticable, which plainly it is in the Prose Poem, of which we are discoursing. the System of the Pagan Theology, without commiting the most offensive Absurdities. Should I undertake a fuller and more strict Inquiry into the Defects of that Writing, I mean, as it is produc'd for an Epick Poem, it would swell this Discourse to a greater Extent than is proper in this place; and were it as perfect a Performance of that Kind
