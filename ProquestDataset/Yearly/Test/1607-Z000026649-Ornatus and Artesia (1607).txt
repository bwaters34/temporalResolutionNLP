 by the worthinesse hereof, but the qualitie of my well affected intent, which is deuoted vnto you in the bands of perfect goodwill, and will be readie to shewe it selfe constant in any triall you shall make thereof. And for that I know your wisedome and curtesie to be such, as that you wil not misconceiue me, but esteeme well hereof, and my affection to you, to bee exprest in the dedicatio, I haue aduetured to dedicate the same to your protection, though altogither vndeseruing the title of your patronage, which your further kindnesse shall binde me hereafter to requite the same, with some worthier worke collected by my labors. Thus being loth to be tedious and troublesome vnto you, I commit this silly present to your gentle acceptation, and your selfe, to the gratious protection of the Almightie. Your Worships most readie at commaund, Emanuell Ford . familiar friends, beeing at the first collected with no intent to haue it printed, for as yet hauing taken but one flight, I durst not too boldely venture againe, lest my vnskilfulnesse might cause my repentance. But beeing supported by the assistance of your gentle fauours, I shall grow hardie,  & hereafter labour to procure your further delight: the rewarde I expect, beeing your kinde acceptance. But if contrary to my thought, this my summer fruite be gathered before it be ripe, I promise amends with olde fruite, that hath bene a yeare in ripening, and in the beginning of the next winter comming forth. In the meane time, peruse this Historie, which sauoureth more of pleasure, then Eloquence: & although hastily compiled, yet let it passe vnder your fauourable censure: and by your courtesies, be shrowded from the variable dislikes of Momus vaine imitators. The learned, wise, and curteous, will according to the qualitie of their dispositions, esteeme well of this vnwoorthie worke, valuing the same, not by the worth, but by the will of the wryter. As for such as either rashly condemne without iudgement, or lauishly dislike without aduice, I esteeme them like the downe of Thistles, inconstantly dispearst with euery blast, accounting their discontent, my content: not caring for to please those that are pleased with nothing. But did my gaines, counteruaile my labours, I would then frame my fancie to fit their humours, but getting nothing, I can loose no lesse, onely to haue a good opinion of the well affected to learning, is all I craue: and that I hope your good mindes will affoord. As at a Banquet there are seuerall kindes of meates, some pleasant, other sharpe, yet all tasted. Amongst Grapes, some sowre, some sweete, yet all esteemed, so with indifferencie, amongst varietie of eloquent Histories, let this serue as one dish to furnish out a Banquet, and like sowre and sweete intermingled, make a pleasant taste, by your courteous construing of my good meaning, and your fauourable opinion of Ornatus loue. So shall I account my debt to you great, my labours wel bestowed, and my selfe bound to requite your kindnesse. You shall shewe your affection to learning, vertue in fauouring good indeuours,  & giue incouragement to more worthie labours. I rest well contented, my reward rich, and hereafter be both readie and willing to deserue your curtesie. But if Ornatus loue breede my blame, as it bred his banishment, then may I wish I had neuer knowne thereof, and crie out of Mala fortuna , as my reward. With the bird Celos bred in Affrica , who wandring far from her nest, by forgetfulnesse cannot return: and so for euer after abandoneth company. So I too boldly building on your curtesie, may bee wounded with repentance, and by my ouersight bee brought in dispaire, vnlesse your curtesie preuent the same: on which my hopes depend. And so I cease. E. Ford. How Ornatus was enamoured of the faire Artesia . In the rich and renowmed countrey of Phrygia , in Prouinces not farre distant from neere neighbourhood, dwelt two auncient Knightes, the one named Allinus , the other Arbastus , men of great possessions, and much honoured. Betwixt whome, such extreame contention and hatred remained, by reason of the death of one Reno , brother to Allinus , long since slaine in a quarell by certaine gentlemen belonging to Arbastus , that neither their owne wisdome, nor the sundry perswasions of friendes to eyther partie allied, were of any force to mittigate the same. Both of them being inriched with innumerable blessings, especially in their faire progenie. Allinus hauing a sonne of goodly stature, and commendable gifts, named Ornatus . And Arbastus a daughter called Artesia , of exceeding comelinesse, exterierlie beautified with aboundance of gyfts of nature, and inwardly adorned with aboundance of diuine perfections. Yet by reason of their parents discord, they remayned as farre ignorant in knowledge one of the other, as if they had bin separated by an innumerable distance of straunge countries. Ornatus aboue all thinges delighted in Hawking, and on a day, being wearie, he wandred without company with his hawke on his fist, into a most pleasant valley, where hee shrowded himselfe vnder the shaddowe of a tuft of greene trees, with purpose to rest himselfe, and euen when his eyes were readie to yeelde to slumber, hee was reuiued from his drowsinesse, by the noyse of a kennell of hounds, that past by him in chase of a Stagge, after whome Arbastus and diuers in his company (though to him vnknowne) followed, who being passed by whilest he was in a deepe studie to thinke what they should be, he espied a beautifull damsell entring the same valley; who being somewhat wearie, liking the prospect of that shadie tuft of trees, alighted there, which Ornatus seeing, withdrew himselfe from her sight, whilest shee tying her steed to a bush, laide her dilicate bodie downe vpon the cooling earth, to breathe her selfe, and drie vp her swet, which the sooner to accomplish, shee vnbraced her garmets, and with a decet and comely behauiour, discouered her milke-white necke  & brest, beautified with two round precious teats, to receiue the breath of the coole winde, which was affected with a delight to exhale the moystened vapors from her pure bodie. Ornatus seeing all, and vnseene himselfe, noted with delight each perfect linament of her proper bodie, beautie, sweete fauour, and other comelinesse, which filled his heart with exceeding pleasure, therewith growing into an vnrestrained affection towards her, and a great studie what shee should be, when suddainly his hawke feeling his fist vnmoouable, thinking to pearch her self with quiet, primde her self, and with the noyse of her belles, made Artesia start, who as one halfe agast, with a fearefull behauior arose fro the ground, looking round about her from whence that sound came, she espied Ornatus (who vnwilling she shuld perceiue he had yet seene her, laie as if hee had slept) Artesia maruelling what he should be, & accordingly thinging he had slept, closed her naked brest with great haste, and vnloosing her horse, thought to go away vnespied. Which Ornatus perceiuing, and vnwilling without speaking to her to loose her sight, seemed to awake, and raising himselfe, stedfestly beheld her, which infused such a redde vermillion blush into her bewtifull cheekes, and withall such a bashfull confusion spred it selfe in her conceits, that shee stood like one halfe amazed or ashamed. Which Ornatus perceiuing, drew towards her, and greeted her with these speeches. Faire Damosel, be not abasht with my presence, though a straunger, which shall no way if I can chuse offend you, but rather commaund mee, and I wil be readie to doo you any seruice. Artesia notwithstanding his speeches, withdrew her selfe, leading her horse to a banke, where with ease shee mounted, and so rode away, not giuing him any aunswere at all. Ornatus maruelled thereat, yet rightly imputed her vnkinde departure to her feare, not discurtesie. And seeing himselfe depriued of her sight, the night approching, departed home to his fathers house. After supper, betaking himselfe to his chamber with intent to rest, he was possessed with such remembrance of the bewtifull Damosell he had seene, that his sleepe was transformed into continuall cogitations of her bewtie, forme and fauour, and the pleasing sight he had seene in the discouery of some of her hidden bewties, imprinted such a delight in his affectionate conceits, that hee could take no sleepe, but continued all that night in those meditations. The next day thinking to shake off all further remembrance of her, he gate into company of his most chosen friends, wherein before time hee tooke most delight, yet nowe by reason of his distemperature, hee rather seemed weary thereof. Hee had not continued long with them, but he was saluted by a gentleman named Phylastes , with whome he was familiarly acquainted: this gentlemen belonged to an auncient Duke named Turnus , who in honour of his birth day, from which Allinus excused himselfe of purpose, because he thought hee should meete Arbastus there, but because the Duke should take no offence at him, hee graunted that his sonne Ornatus should goe to doe him honour. Which Phylastes acquainted Ornatus withall, who glad therof, departed thither in companie of diuers other gentlemen: the Duke likewise had sent another messenger to request Arbastus copany, who being of a more milde nature then Allinus , willingly went, and with him, his Lady, and faire daughter Artesia . How Ornatus came to knowledge of Artesia ,  & intreated Adellena to make knowne his loue to her, and of the rebuke Artesia gaue her. After the feast was ended, and the Duke had honored his guests with all manner of curtesie, he  & the principallest, amongst whom Arbastus was one of the chiefe, according to the custome vsed in ye countrey, seated themselues to behold certaine games and exercises to be performed by the young Gentlemen: which was, runing, wrastling, and diuers other exercises, for triall of the strength, and nimblenesse of the bodie: amongst the rest, Ornatus (hauing neuer before made triall of himselfe) had such good successe, and behaued himselfe with such agilitie and strength, that he woonne the chiefest honour, and was presented before the Duke, to receiue a rich reward. Which when hee had receiued, casting his eyes vpon the beholders, hee espied Artesia whome hee perfectly knewe againe, readie to depart with her parents, who had bidden the Duke farewell. Ornatus comming to Philastes , asked if he knew that damosell, shewing him Artesia , who tolde him what shee was. Ornatus was glad of that small knowledge, which could adde litle meanes to his hopes, yet somewhat discontented that shee was daughter to Arbastus . And thus the day being ended, euery one departed to their abodes. Ornatus hauing againe attained his chamber, spent his time of rest in sundrie cogitations of his loue, and howe to giue her knowledge of his affection, noting euery daunger, and pondering how discontentedly his parents would take the same, if it should by any meanes come to theyr knowledge, finding so many lettes to hinder him, that hee was oftentimes in vtter dispaire of attaining to the least hope of good successe. But finding his affections to increase more and more, and burning with a feruent desire, which nothing but onely her fauour could extinguish. After that night was past, earelie the next morning hee wandred towardes the place where hee hadde behelde her with such exceeding content, and by the way as hee went, hee met with a gentlemoman named Adellena , of meane birth, and small liuing, yet of good education, who oftentimes resorted to Arbastus house, and was going thither at that instant, into whose company hee insinuated himselfe, for that hee sawe her alone, and said as followeth, Gentlewoman, I am bolde to intreat a word or two with you. Sir replied she, with a good will, I will satisfie you in what I can. Know you not (quoth he) Arbastus? I do quoth she, both know him, and am very well acquainted with him, vnto whose house I am nowe going. So woulde I quoth hee if I durst, for I serue Ornatus , sonne to Allinus , whome I doo not doubt but you know well, of whom I would tell you more, but that I feare to commit his secrets to them I knowe not, and thereby vnwillingly doe him iniurie: but woulde you vouchsafe but to heare them, keepe them secret, and withall adde your helpe to further him, which you may with safetie performe, you shoulde doo him an exceeding pleasure, and withall, bee so highly rewarded, and thankefully gratified, that you shoulde thinke your labour very well imployed: doo a deede of pittie, and binde him to you in the perpetuall bands of kinde friendship. Sir replied Adellena , I knowe not the Gentleman, yet I haue heard him much commended, in whome if I coulde any way pleasure, I woulde vse both diligence and secrecie, promising you vpon my faith and credit, if you will make mee acquainted with your minde, I will either doo my good will to further him, or else conceale what you shall commit to my priuitie. Then said hee, my maister not long since walking in yonder valley, beheld Artesia , faire Artesia , daughter to Arbastus , to whose beawtie hee is exceedingly inthralled, that vnlesse some meanes of comfort be found to ease his torments, I feare mee it will indaunger his life: whom you onely may pleasure, by making his loue knowne to her, in such sort as, shall best agree with your wisedome. This is all, and yet so much, that the reuealing thereof may doo much harme. And to effect such a contract, might procure peace and vnitie twixt their parents. Therefore I intreate your aide and furtherance herein: with which good newes, if I returne to him, I knowe it will breed no little comfort to his disquiet heart. Sir (said shee) since I perceiue his loue is grounded vpon vertue, not drawne thereto by any desire of reward, I vndertake to bee his assistant therein, and will to the vttermost of my best indeuours labour to procure his content: Which this day I will in some sort put in execution. And if you returne to mee to morrow, you shall knowe her answere. I wil said he, and so they departed. Ornatus hauing left her, entered into many cogitations of his rash attempt, accounting himselfe ouer credulous to commit his secrets to her priuitie, of whose fidelitie hee had neuer made tryall: sometimes comforting himselfe with hope of good euent, and againe dispairing of comfort, for that hee supposed Artesia would rather esteeme him as an enemie then a friend, by reason of their parents hatred, and therefore would the more hardly bee drawne to giue any credit to his sute. And reuoluing a chaos of these and such like confused cogitations, he attained his fathers house, thinking the time tedious vntill his appointed meeting with Adellena : which hee ouerpast with great care. Adellena after her departure from him, soone attained to Arbastus house, vsing herselfe as shee had formerly done, yet withall, carefull how to execute the charge shee had in hand, which shee could by no occasion vtter, till after dinner when shee found Artesia all alone in the gardein, insinuated her self into her company, which Artesia kindly accepted, entring into varietie of discourses, and continuing some time in giuing certaine hearbes their proper names: amongst the rest, Artesia espied an hearbe with partie coloured leaues, demanding of Adellena if shee knewe the name thereof, which she told her she did not. I haue oftentimes quoth Artesia seene this hearbe, and it hath two prettie names, it is by some called Loue in Idlenesse, and by some Harts Ease: with that Adellena fetcht a deepe (thogh counterfeit) sigh, which Artesia noting, said: What maketh you sigh to heare it named Harts Ease? Mary (quoth shee) one way because those two names so ill agree, an other, for by the same I call to remembrance the hearts griefe I heard a young man complaine of procured by loue, which was not in idlenesse, but I think in good earnest. Why quoth Artesia , can loue procure such hartes griefe to any, and not rather content? Yea said shee, because the partie in loue, hath no hope to attaine the good liking of the partie he loueth. The quoth Artesia , I account him a foole that will loue so deeply without hope of reward: and that to bee rather fondnesse then true friendship, that pleaseth his affections with such inequalities. But I pray tel mee what is he into whose secrets you were so suddenly admitted? Not admitted (quoth she) for vnawares I heard his complaints, which afterwardes I promised him not to make any acquainted withall, but the partie whome he so intierly loueth. Then quoth Artesia , I may not know, neither doo I care, for it is but a vanitie that troubleth ones cogitations. Yes quoth shee, you may and shall if you please, know who he is, conditionally you will neither be offended with me for telling you, nor reueale what I shall impart. Why quoth she, am I the pretie, or doth it any way concerne me, that I should be offended? If it be, then keepe your counsels vnreuealed, for it will proue vnsauorie to my stomacke, for be it far from me to be troubled with the vaine sutes of doting louers. Yet let me answere quoth Adellena , you beare too greeuous a conceit of loue, which is the diuine puritie whereby heartes are vnited in vertue. Without the which, neither mortals can attaine heauen, nor other creatures haue their being: therefore not to bee abhorred: and for that any shoulde loue your selfe, can that be an offence to you, but rather bee accepted in kinde sort? wee should by nature loue them that loue vs, then will you contrarie to nature, yeeld hatred for loue? For you indeed are the partie that is beloued, and the partie that is so farre in loue with you euery way to be commended, & one way discomended, whose name I will not reueale, & then I hope I shall breed no offence to your eares. Doe so quoth Artesia , for in concealing the same, you please me, & if you will be welcome into my copany, vse no more of these speeches. Had I thought quoth she, they would haue bin offesiue, I would not haue vttered them, but in so doing, I did but fulfill your request: then at my request againe quoth shee, giue ouer. After this communication ended, they parted, Adellena home to to her house, and Artesia to her supper, and afterwards to her chamber, where at first, some colde thoughts of those speeches past in her fancie, but afterwards shee spent the rest of that night in quiet sleepe. How Adellena coueied Ornatus letter into Artesias Casket, and with what impatiencie Artesia tooke the same. The morning being newly approched, Ornatus who had long expected the same, arose and soone gate to Adellenas house, where he arriued before shee was vp, who hauing knowledge thereof, soone came downe to him, (taking him to bee no other then Ornatus man) to whome shee declared the very truth of all her speeches hadde with Artesia . Which nipt him at the heart, but being put in some hope by her perswasions, at last giuing her a purse full fraught with Gold in recompence of her paines past, and to entice her to vndertake more, hee saide as followeth. Good Adellena be not dismaied to prosecute my sute for Artesias first frowne, for I am not Ornatus man, but poore Ornatus himselfe, that languish with desire to attaine her loue, which I would my selfe prosecute, if the discords betwixt our parents did not hinder the same. Therefore I beseech you once againe doo something in my behalfe, for you see how cruell desteny hath shut mee from all meanes to bee put in practise by my selfe, and you may pleasure mee without any hazard at all: for which I wil rest so thankfull vnto you, as that you shall account your paines taken wel bestowed. Sir replied shee, I would vndertake any thing to further you, if I knew which way, but I perceiue Artesias frowardnesse is such, that nothing I shal bring her wil bee welcome: but if you wil aduise mee what I shal do, I wil once againe hazard the losse of her good liking for your sake. Which said, Ornatus wrote a Letter, which hee desired her by some meanes to conuey to her sight, the contents whereof were these. fauourably censure of my good meaning: for being bound to honour none but most vertuous, I thought it my dutie to giue you knowledge thereof, desiring you to pittie the extremitie of my passions, procured by the attainture of your conquering perfections. I confesse you may alledge many things as reasons, to disswade you from giuing credit to my speeches, or yeelding me the least fauour in your conceits: yet I beseech you, make but triall of loyaltie, loue, and dutie, so farre as shall agree with your liking, and you shall finde mee constant in the one, and perseuerant in the other, as one that hath submitted himselfe to your commaund, vowed his deuotions to purchase your fauour, and euerlastingly bound himselfe to be onely yours: vnable to expresse my humble meaning: vnwilling to be offensiue, and desirous of fauour: then I beseech you be fauourable to me, though bearing the name of an enemie, in whom you shall finde the true heart of a constant friend, whose safetie, comfort, and preseruation, resteth in your power. The first viewe of your bewties (which was in the valley when you were last hunting) surprised my heart with such humble regard to your vertue, that euer since my heart hath indured the bitter torments of feareful dispaire, which vrgeth me to this presumption, desiring from your sacred lippes to receiue my sentence of comfort, or affliction, rather then to spend my life in languishing vnreuealed torment. Then be you gracious to him, that is otherwise most miserable, and shewe fauour to an vndeseruing vnknowne friend, so shall you not onely shewe that you are mercifull, but also saue a miserable louer from vtter ruine. Your humble friend Ornatus . Adellena hauing receiued this Letter, tolde him shee would deliuer the same, which the next day shee performed in this sort: Being come to Arbastus house, shee continued most part of the day in Artesias company, not once renuing the least remembrance of the talke shee had with her the day before, but espying her open her Casket wherein shee put her workes, whilest Artesia was busie, she priuily conueyed the Letter vnseene into the same, which by and by Artesia locked, for none but her selfe had the vse thereof. Adellena thought long till she was gone fearing least Artesia should vpon some occasion open the Casket againe, and so find the Letter, whilest shee were there, therefore shee soone founde meanes to depart. When the time of rest was come, and Artesia alone in her bed, taking a booke (according to her vsuall manner) to reade a while, shee suddenly fell a sleepe, and in her sleepe was possessed with a dreame, wherein her thoughts called to remembrance Adellenas speeches, which mooued such a disquiet conceit of anger in her brest, that thinking shee had chid her, with the motions of her spirites shee awaked, feeling an exceeding distemperature in all her parts, and seeing the light stil burning, she maruelled at her drowsinesse that had before forgate to put the same out, and by this meanes called to remembrance Adellenas speeches, maruelling what hee should bee that was in loue with her, and suddenly againe, reprouing her selfe for giuing her mind libertie to think of loue, she would haue banisht al further remembrance thereof out of her minde, but the more shee laboured, the more vnable shee was to preuaile in ouer maistring her fancies, that being both vexed with her selfe, and Adellena , shee vttered these speeches. What disquiet is this possesseth my heart, procureth such vnwonted cogitations to rise in my fancies, and disturbeth my rest? I was not wont to trouble my thoughts with such vaine cogitations, which the more I labour to suppresse, the more they encrease. Coulde Adellenas speeches haue such force (which I had welnigh forgotten) as thus long to sticke in my remembrance? Or what reason haue I to regard them that were not worth the regarding? but rather tended to demonstrate the affection of some ouerfond louer, that seeketh to intrappe my chastitie? Accursed be her lippes for vttering them, and would to God I had bene deaffe that I might not haue heard their inchaunting sound. This saide, she catcht vp her Booke, thinking by reading to driue away all remembrance thereof, but her heart was so fully possest with a kinde of cogitation what hee shoulde be, that she neither coulde reade, or when she did reade, remember what shee did reade: and finding this meanes not auaileable, shee started from her bedde, opening her Casket to take out her sampler, wherein shee tooke most delight, when suddenly shee espied the Letter, and reading the superscription, was halfe astonished thereat, especially howe it should come there, and what the contents should bee, beeing oftentimes in minde to teare the same in peeces and not to reade it, which her hearte woulde not suffer her to doo before shee had seene what was the contents: yet striuing to ouermaister her affections, shee tore the same in the midst: which done, such a remorse rose in her fancie, vnited with a desire to know further thereof, that leaping into the bed, shee closed the same togither, and betwixt a willing and vnwilling minde, redde the same throughout. With that, fetching a deepe sigh, shee said: Aye me poore soule, how are my affections betraied to mine enemie? Was it Ornatus shee ment? can it bee that hee wil proue my friend, that is my professed enemie? O no: hee intendeth nothing lesse then loue, but rather vnder colour thereof, seeketh my ruine. Was it hee that I beheld in the valley? or it is possible that hee shoulde bee so deepely in loue with mee vpon that small sight? No, no, I wil not credit his speeches, but stil repute him as an enemie, as indeed hee is: and henceforward abandon Adellenaes company, by whose meanes this Letter was conueyed into my Casket: then tearing the same into a thousand peeces, shee abstained (so neare as shee could) from all thought of yeelding the least consent to loue, and sought to increase her disdaine, and suspect of his falshood, spending the rest of that night in cofused contrarieties of doubtful thoughts. Early in the morning shee gat vp, and within short time met with Adellena (who was come as desirous to know what issue her deuise had taken) and finding occasion fitte when none was by, she vttered these speeches. Adellena , I maruell what follie ruleth your minde, that you (whom I had thought had bene vertuously giuen) should seeke my ruine: wherein haue I showne my selfe so vnkinde, that you should requite me in this discourteous sort? You remember the speeches past betwixt vs the other day in the Gardein, when I finding out your intent by your speeches, desired you to giue ouer to vse any more talke to that effect, which you faithfully promised, but now most vnfaithfully haue broken, and more impudently haue betraied my quiet with your disquiet & ill sounding news: if your rudenesse had beene such that you could not desist, you might then haue deliuered Ornatus false and fained inchauntment into my hands, and not so secretly haue conueyed the same into my Casket, wherein you haue made me amendes for my loue, to seeke to betray my life into the hands of mine enemy: for otherwise I neither can nor will esteeme him. Therefore henceforwards come no more into my company, for I forsweare your familiaritie, hate your counsell, and wil cause my father to banish you his house, and alienate his friendship from you for euer. Adellena would haue answered, but Artesia refusing to hear her, departed, and left her so much greeued, that for extream vexation, she immediately departed towards her owne house. How Ornatus dispairing, left his fathers house, and disguising himselfe, was entertained of Arbastus . Adellenaes house, and found her weeping for anger, desiring to know the cause thereof, which shee declared to him at large, which wrought suche an exceeding passion of griefe in his mind, that without yeelding her either thaks for her paines or other speech, hee departed: being so much ouercome with inward sorrow, that finding a solitarie place, hee laide himselfe downe vpon the earth, vttering these lamentations. O miserable caitiffe, what haste thou to do but lament when thy ill fortune yeelds nothing but cause of lament? Why shoulde thy life last to endure these tormentes, and not rather to dissolue into vnseene essences? Could any thing haue happened to mee more miserable, then to beholde Artesia , and now to endure her crueltie? or more fortunate, if shee had bene mercifull? But my Destenies haue drawne mee to like her that hateth mee, and to become thrall to a cruell vnrelenting enemie. Well, my loue is sweeter then my life, and therefore I wil venture life and all to purchase her liking. Hauing said this, hee a while sat silent, when suddeinly to fauour his extremities, hee behelde certaine of his familiars passe by, with whome he departed home. Earely the next morning (being exceedingly troubled in minde and impatient of delaie) hee left his fathers house to visite Adellena againe, whome hee had the day before left so vnkindly, whome hee founde readie to goe to Arbastus house againe: saluting her, saide: Adellena , bee not offended at my last vnmannerly departure, for my hearte was so muche disquietted at the ill successe my sute tooke, that I coulde not vse that behauiour towardes you your paines deserued, but nowe I am returned to craue your counsell what is further to bee done herein. Syr replied shee, I know not what further meanes to vse, neither dare I any more attempt to trie Artesias curtesie, who is alreadie so much offended with me, that I feare to loose her friendship for euer, if I should vtter that againe that is so vnwelcome to her. Ornatus hearing her speeches, thought shee was vnwilling to prosecute his sute any further, with a heauie hearte left her, entering into many thoughtes and cogitations which way to comfort himselfe. Oftentimes vtterly dispairing, and yet purposing to leaue no meanes vnassaied, nor daunger vnattempted, though with hazarde of his life to purchase some rest to his troubled heart. At length hee thought with himselfe what should make Artesia so hard hearted as to giue no credit to my speeches: it is not her want of lenitie, pittie, or wisedome, for shee is yong, and therefore subiect to loue: bewtifull, and therefore to bee wonne wise, and therefore wil with consideration pittie my sorrowes. What then should alienate her good liking from mee, more then from an other? My Name: for by that shee reputeth mee an enemie: then were I not Ornatus , she woulde peraduenture giue some regard to my sutes. Therefore I will chaunge my name, and bee an other then I am, that shee not knowing mee, may (if not loue mee) yet disist to hate mee: then beganne hee to studie what meanes to vse to enioy her sight (without the which hee could not liue) and yet not be knowne what he was. Amongst many other deuises, this tooke deepest roote. Within fewe dayes after (hauing prouided all things necessary) he attired himselfe like a virgine of a straunge Countrey (which hee might well be esteemed to be by his youth.) And taking with him his Lute, whereon he could play exceedingly well, in the silent of the night he departed towards the sea coast, which was neare vnto Arbastus house: and seating himselfe vpon the Rockie shoare, beganne to play vpon his Lute. Early the next morning, a shepheard happened to passe by that way, and espying his straunge disguise, and hearing his sweete Musicke, was so exceedingly delighted therewith, that he stayed to see what he was. Ornatus turning himselfe about, espied the olde man stand gazing vpon him, wherewith he drew towardes him, and saide as followeth. Good Father, muse not to see me in this vnfrequented place, being by shipwrack cast on this shore, and preserued from a greeuous death by sea, to perish for want of comfort on the land, in a straunge place, where I neither haue friendes, nor know which way to get comfort. Therefore I beseech you, yeeld comfort to my distresse, and succour to my want. Faire Damosell quoth the shepheard, if my homely Cottage can yeeld you any comfort, so please you to accept therof, it shalbe at your command, whither so please you go, without more circumstance of speeches, you shall be most hartily welcome. I thanke you quoth Ornatus , and I accept your gentle proffer; so they departed togither. And when they were entered, and the shepheardesse in the best maner she could had welcomed him, and he had tasted of such foode as was set before him, hee tolde them his name was Syluia , and telling a tale of sufficient countenance to beare credite of the maner of their shipwracke, and the cause he vndertooke that voyage by Sea. Which the olde folkes beleeued. Likewise framing himselfe to such a kinde of behauiour, that it was almost impossible to discerne but that he was a woman indeede. Where Syluia (for vnder that name he shall a while passe) staied some two daies, yet without any hope how to enioy Artesias company. But the third day it fortuned Arbastas being abroad hunting, was by a violent storme driuen to seeke shelter, and most fortunately lighted on the shepheards Cottage, where he boldly entered without calling, and suddenly espying Syluia , was halfe astonisht to beholde a damosell so bewtifull and richly attired in that homely place, but after that he had a while viewed her well, ( Syluia being alone) with a curteous behauiour he thus spake. Faire damosell, pardon my boldnesse, if I haue disquietted you, I little thought to haue found such guestes in this homely place. Syluia knowing him to be Arbastus , arose, but made him no answere: when presently the olde shepheard came in, vsing great reuerence to Arbastus , who demaunded of him, what damosell that was, whereupon the olde man declared all that he knew. Arbastus then thus said: Damosell, I vnderstand by this shepheard some part of your misfortunes, which I so much pitty, that offer to do any thing resteth in me to do you pleasure. And for that this homely place is not agreeable to your birth, which may be greater then I can iudge of, let me desire you to accept of such entertainment as my habitation yeeldeth, whither you shall be welcome. Syluia being glad of that profer, yet fearing to be discouered by his willingnesse to yeeld, made this answere. Sir, this homely place is best agreeing to my poore estate, being by misfortune brought to miserie: which I am also vnworthie of, for that I know not how to make my hoste amends, desiring rather to liue in this quiet pallace voyde of care, then in places of more dignitie: but for that I shall be too chargeable to this poore man, and you so earnestly desire me, I wil be so bolde as to take your profer, though vnable to be so grateful as I would. Many other speeches past betwixt them, and in the ende they departed towards Arbastus Castle: where Syluia was kindly and worthily entertained, hauing his hearts desire, which was to enioy the sight of faire Artesia . Ornatus being alone by himselfe, began to meditate of the good successe he had in this attempt, and how fortunatelie all things had fallen out to further him in his loue. But most of all hee meruailed how the eyes of all that beheld him were blinded, that they could not perceiue what he was. In these & many such like comfortable meditations he spent some three or foure dayes, taking most great content in beholding Artesiaes perfections, that he was more and more inthralled in the bands of vowed affection, hearing her speech, noting her behauiour, admiring her vertue, commending her curtesie, affecting her bewtie, and imprinting each liniament of her diuine torme, in his deuoted affection, with such immooueable resolue of constant loyaltie, that hee did not onely loue her, but also honor her as an Idoll, beeing by Arbastus admitted her companie, that at all times hee was with her. Artesia likewise tooke no little pleasure in Syluians company, in whom so much curtesie abounded, that euery one both liked and commended her. How Adellena brought newes to Arbastus house of Ornatus suddaine departure. How he naming himselfe Syluian, a long time enioyed her company, and what successe he had in his loue. the exceeding care and grief his parents tooke, fearing least he might by some trecherie be murdred, with which newes shee came to Arbastus house, and soone published the same, that the newes came to Arbastus hearing, who was exceedingly sorie to heare the same, for that hee esteemed well of Ornatus . And now comming into the garden where Artesia was walking with Syluian , she could not withhold her selfe from speaking, but vttered her minde in these words. Artesia bee not offended with that I say, but rather bee displeased with your selfe, who are the originall of this woe. Ornatus whom you supposed your enemie, though indeede your most faithfull friend, taking your vnkind refusall most heauily, and accounting himselfe not worthy to liue if you dispised him, eyther hath wrought his owne vntimely death, or dispairing to finde fauour at your handes, hath abandoned both this parents, countrey and acquaintance, to liue in exile. What will bee sayd of you when the cause of his sorrowe shall be knowne? how may your owne concience accuse your selfe of hard-hartednesse, that would not yeeld pittie to the distresse of so woorthie, vertuous,  & curteous a Gentlema, who for his humble sute, was spightfully disdained, and his heartie good will, disdainfully reiected? Which cruell deed of yours, no doubt will be one day repayed with the like disdaine, where you shall most affect. I know his loue was firme, constant and immoueable, which maketh me so much the more pittie his estate: I know his meaning was both vertuous & honorable, his birth you know, what vertues abounded in him, all can witnesse: and how hartily he loued you, the heaues ca witnesse. Poore Ornatus farewell. Hard was thy hap, to place thy true loue so firmly, where thou reapest so little reward. Artesia hearing her speeches, could not tell whether shee might blame her, or accuse her selfe, sometimes doubting whether she spake this of pollicie to try her, or of truth. Being as readie to blame her selfe, as Adellena , and yet willing to do neither. For she thought if she spake true, shee had good cause to say that shee did, and her selfe more to be blamed then any. For notwithstanding she had giuen Adellena so flat a denial, yet her conscience knewe, that some sparks of loue were kindled in her breast: That her heart being somewhat opprest with these thoughts, caused the water to stand in her eyes. Ornatus seeing all this, took no little comfort therat, especially whe he perceiued Artesias heart to relent, but for that by his disguise, being known no other then a woman, he kept silence, when faine hee would haue spake, least he should discouer himselfe. Adellena seeing she had disquieted Artesia , being her selfe full of griefe, and vnwilling to vrge her any further, departed. And Artesia withdrawing her selfe from Syluians company, into an Arbor, vttered these speeches. And can it be that Ornatus loue was so great, that for my sake hee hath done this? Coulde hee loue her so constantly that was his professed enemie? is loue of such a force, to draw one into these extreames? Then may I compare it to the hearb Artas , found in Persia , who being but holden in the hand, causeth a heat through all the bodie: so loue but entertained in thought, disquieteth all the sences. But why do I conceiue so well of Ornatus , when I know not the truth of Adellenaes report: it may be he hath hired her to doe this, and thereby I may be deceiued, yeelding to pittie, when there is no cause, and with the bird Akanthus, readie to come at euerie call. Admit it were so, I am not bound to fauour him, is he not my enemie, & sonne vnto my fathers cheefest foe? what reason then haue I eyther to giue credit to his loue, or her protestation, when both may be fayned? Well I will be aduised before I yeelde my selfe to loues intangling baytes, and before I loue, I will know whome I loue. I but Artesia thy fancie yeeldeth remorse alreadie, and thy conscience bids thee pittie him because he loueth thee, for loue in a reputed enemie may be as constant and loyall as in an open friend, and an enemie becomming friend, will be the more constant: then what hast thou to do, but make further proofe of his constancie, and finding him true, yeelde reward to his desert? Soft Artesia , wade not too far: if he be constant, if hee be loyall, if he loue thee so intirely, if nowe thou hast made him forsake this countrey, or procure his vntimely death, then is there nothing else to be don for thee, but to pittie his death, and accuse thy selfe of some discourtesie. All this while Ornatus shrowding himselfe from her sight, by the thicknesse of the greene leaues heard her speeches, to his exceeding comfort, and againe closelie withdrew himselfe. Artesia hauing ended her speeches, her hart being opprest with many doubts, arose and came to Syluian , to whom she said: My minde is much troubled with the newes Adellena told me of Ornatus absence, whom for that you know not, I wil tel you what he was. There dwelleth not far hence, one Allinus , that mortally hateth my father, and al that belong vnto him, whose sonne Ornatus was, whome if I should commend, you might thinke me too cruel to refuse his loue so vnkindly: onely thus much I wil say of him, he was euery way worthy to be beloued, though my fancie coulde neuer be drawne to like of him: who vpon what occasion I know not, but as Adellena tolde me, made his loue knowne to her, which she likewise told me of, but I refusing to heare her, answered her plainly, that I was greatly offended with her, for making any such motion: and forbad her for euer to speake of him againe. But now this day you haue heard what shee hath told me, which I can hardly beleeue to be true, or that Ornatus would be so rash without wisedome to enter into such extreames. But if it bee so (as I would it were not) it greeueth me for him, and I wish that I had not refused to heare his sute, though I am not willing to yeeld thereto. For I would not haue it said of me, nor my name so much blazed, that my crueltie procured him to that extremitie, though his wisedome might haue foreseene such mischeefe, and he more moderatelie haue tempered his loue. Ornatus taking occasio said, I neither know the gentleman, nor how constant his loue was, but thus much my mind perswadeth me, that had not his loue bene great, he would not haue greeued so much at your vnkindnesse: but loue is of this force, that it turneth the minde into extreames, or vtterly breaketh the heart, which force belike it had in him, else would he not haue done himselfe so much harme. But it may be (as you say) Ornatus hath not done himselfe outrage, but onely abandoning company, liueth in dispaire, and so meaneth to die: which if it bee so, then in my fancie, you might do well to let him by some meanes vnderstand that you did pittie him Stay there quoth Artesia , you must first know whether I can do it or no: for If I should say I pittie with my lips, and he not find it so, it would driue him to more dispaire, and therefore I will leaue off to do that, vntill I can finde whether I can do so or no. These her speeches draue Ornatus into a perplexed doubt what to thinke, being no way assured of her loue, nor yet vtterly dispairing thereof, for that her speeches gaue likelyhood of both. Therefore hee durst not speake too boldlie, least shee should suspect him, but onely rested in good hope to finde comfort, and by other meanes to trie her. Then taking his Lute, he began to play so sweetely, as would haue rauisht a comfortlesse minde, with great content: to heare which harmonie pleased Artesia so well, that when hee left, shee would request him, calling him Syluian , to play againe. Whilest he sat playing, Artesia sitting close by his side, fel fast a sleep, which hee perceiuing, left of his play, to surfet himself with beholding her sweete bewtie, in which hee tooke such delight, as almost rauisht his sences, sometimes thinking whilest she slept, to imprint a kisse vpon her sweete ruddie lippe, but fearing thereby to wake her, and loose that delightfull contemplation, hee desisted, beholding each part of her visible forme, which was most diuine, his minde was affected with inward suppose, what perfections her hidden bewties did comprehend, which his fancie perswaded him, he did in conceit absolutely contemplate. Then seeing her stirre, he suddainly catcht his lute againe, striking his sweete noate, to continue her in that slumber, and then againe, laying by the same, to enter into his former contemplation. Comparing his delight to exceed all heauenly ioy, and wishing though Artesia coulde not loue him, yet that shee woulde alwayes graunt him so to beholde her. When hee had a good while continued in these meditations, Artesia awooke, which somewhat greeued him, but when hee beheld her bewteous eyes fixed vppon him, he thought himselfe inriched with a heauenly happines, to whome Artesia said, I thank thee good Syluian , for thy sweet musicke hath somewhat eased my heart, by this quiet sleepe. O what content do they enioy, that liue voyde of care, and how happie was I before I heard Ornatus name? With that she arose, and they togither went in: when night approched (which Ornatus thought too soone come, for by that he must loose Artesiaes sight) euery one betooke themselues to their seuerall lodgings. Ornatus studying what meanes to vse to further his loue, wherein he found many difficulties, sometimes in thinking Artesia was in hope neuer to heare of him againe, and sometimes supposing she did pittie him, and being ouercome with contrarieties of doubts, he vttered these complaints. What shuld I do to procure my content, when my miseries are one way great, & my ioyes as exceeding: when my dispaire exceedeth, and yet my comfort aboundeth? I enioy not Artesiaes loue, yet she loueth me not: I enioy her sight, and yet not her sight. I haue as much comfort as fills me with ioy, & yet I am desperate with dispaire. How can that be? She loueth me as I am Syluian , but hateth me, because she loueth not Ornatus . Under the name of Syluian , I enioy her sight, but not as Ornatus , and so am I depriued of her sight. I reape exceeding comfort by beholding her bewty, but I liue in dispaire, that shee wold shun loue if she knew what I were. Though I enioy many thinges by being Syluian , yet am I depriued of all comfort, as I am Ornatus . For she deemed him either dead or fled, hath no hope euer to see him, and if I should shew any signe that hee were liuing or neare, shee would presently eschew my company: which being as I am, I may enioy: & thus am I voyd of all meanes of attayning her loue, yet liuing as I am, I shall still enioy her loue. Why Ornatus , thou hast better meanes to giue her knowldge of thy loue in this disguise, then if thou liuedst as Ornatus . Suppose thou shuldest make knowne to her what thou art, thinkest thou shee would bewray thee, considering thou offerest no other behauiour towardes her, then that which agreeth with vertue? Or what if shee did betray thee, wert thou not better to indure the greatest extremitie by her don, then pyne away with griefe in her absence? Yes Ornatus , in being as thou art, thou art more happie, and therefore maiest thou be in some better hope of comfort. What if shee will not loue thee, yet for thy good will shee cannot hate thee. And though shee know what thou art, shee will rather conceale thee, then bewray thee: then try whether she loueth thee or no, but how? Make my selfe knowne. No. I will write a letter, which I will leaue in some place where she may finde it, and so by that meanes I shall see whether shee will loue or no. And taking pen Inke and paper, he wrote as followeth. greeting. were you willing to know my truth and loyaltie, you woulde though not yeeld to my sute, yet pittie mee, I cannot vse protestations, nor dissemble greefe: but be you most assured, that what proceedeth out at my lippes, commeth from my heart: xtremitie maketh mee ouerbolde, and dispaire maketh me more desperate, in vttering my minde: I cannot chuse but say I loue you, for that I loue indeed. I cannot set foorth my loue with fyled termes, but in plaine truth, protest that my loue is constant, loyall, vertuous,  & immoueable: and though you hate, I must loue: and though you for euer denie to loue, yet will I persist in constancie: for the woorst I can indure is death: and that my soule alreadie inwardly feeleth. I haue forsaken my parents, friends, and all to become acceptable to you: for whilest I was Allinus sonne, you did hate me, then I beseech you, now that I am not Allinus sonne, nor Ornatus , pitty mee. For without your pitie I die,  & litle can my death profit you: but letting me liue, you shall for euer enioy a faithfull seruant, So most vertuous Artesia , I commit my cause to your wise consideration. Yours inseparablie, neyther Ornatus , nor himselfe, but your poore seruant. When hee had written this Letter, and sealed the same, the next morning he laid it in a place of the garden, where he knowe Artesia would walke. And from thence comming to her chamber, he found her readie to go forth. Artesia welcommed Syluia kindely, and forth they went together, and walking vp and downe a prittie while, Artesia espied the white paper, and desirous to see what it was, took it vp, reading the superscription, marueiled what the contents shuld be, and how it should come there, and turning to Syluian , see you this letter, it is directed to me, I maruell how it should come here, vnlesse it were laide of purpose: well howsoeuer that was, I will reade the contents, and you shall be partaker of them. When she had redde the same, and well vnderstood that it was Ornatus , at the first shee was so exceedingly vexed, that she said: I now perceiue, that Ornatus was wiser then I tooke him to bee, for I see he hath committed no outrage vpon himselfe, but wiselie will trie me first, and if I will not yeelde to loue him, what will hee doo? marrie returne to his father againe. This is Adellenaes doing, and according as I thought they are agreed: shee left this letter here, and her may I blame, and not him. For did not she promise him to do it, he would neuer of himselfe attempt it. Syluian I pray thee counsaile me, what I should do herein, for my heart is oppressed with many thoughts, that I will not vtter vntill I know thy minde? Syluian thus answered: since you haue giuen me licence to speake that which my heart thinketh, first I say, if Ornatus loueth according as he protesteth, as no doubt but he doth, you haue good reason to pittie him, for that by your owne report, he is euery way worthy thereof, which if you doo, you shalbe sure of a constant friend, preserue his life, and make vnitie betwixt your parents. As for Adellena , if it were her deede, she did but the part of a friend, but it was very vnlikely, for that shee was not here since yesterday. Neither can I think any man can dissemble so much as to make these protestations, and yet be false. For his words in my fancie, beare an euident likeliehood of truth. Therefore, if I may counsaile you, yeeld to that which is vertuous, and in so dooing, you shall purchase your owne good, his content, and perpetuall quiet to both your families. Would you haue mee then (quoth shee) yeelde to loue mine enemie? How is hee your enemie (quoth Syluian ) when hee loueth you? Hee is mine enemie, because his father hating me, how can he loue me? Nay rather (quoth Syluian ) his father not louing you, how can hee chuse but loue you, because he seeth them hate you, that are worthy to be beloued: besides their hatred being vniust, it sheweth his vertue the more, to loue those his parents hate: and it is commonly seene, where there is hatred betwixt the parents, the children haue loued most dearely, as in common experience it is seene: haue you not red the Histories of Pryamus and Thysbe, Romeo and Iuliet , and many other? whose loue was the more constant, by so much the more their parents hatred was deadly. I remember such Histories (quoth Artesia ) but what was the end of their loue, was it not most miserable? I grant it was, (quoth Syluian ) which was procured by their parents crueltie, but not their loue, wherein, notwithstanding, they tooke such felicitie, that they rather chose to die togither then to be parted: which argueth, that the enmity twixt parents, canot break off loue twixt the children, yet might such tragical euents haue bin preuented by wisedom. But how know I (said Artesia ) whether Ornatus loue bee so constant or no? Can you haue any greater proofe thereof, then his own letters, the forsaking of his parents, and liuing peraduenture in pennurie: but if you doubt of that, once againe trie him. Well (said Artesia ) I asked but thy counsaile, but in stead thereof, thou vsest perswasion: but seeing thou art so forward to doo me good, which I hope is thy intent, if thou wilt keep my counsell, thou shalt know both my minde, and what I intend. Assure your selfe (quoth Syluian ) I will rather loose my life then prooue vnfaithfull. Then said shee, I confesse to thee Syluian , that loue hath made entrance into my heart, that I would willingly both pittie Ornatus , and grant him his request: for that with often remembring him, I cannot forget him, neither doth any thought please mee, but when I thinke of him. But there are so many slips to hinder our loue, that though I loue him, I shall neuer enioy him. For should my parents know hereof, they woulde prie so warily into my actions, that it were impossible for mee once to haue a sight of him, whome I doo scarce remember, I haue so seldome seene him. You may (quoth Syluian ) both loue him, and inioy him, and since you haue begun to like of him, he being worthy thereof, and equalling you in affection, increase that loue: & might I but once come to speake with him, I woulde not doubt but affect all things with such secrecie, that you should with quiet enioy him. Well quoth Artesia , I commit all to you, my life, for that dependeth on my loue, being willing to doo any thing that shall not disagree with modestie. Desiring you to keepe my counsells secret, for to bewray them, may indaunger both his and my life. After many other speeches past betwixt them, Adellena entered the garden. Artesia espying her, at the first thus greeted her. God-morrowe Adellena , I know not whether I may salute thee as a friend, or a priuie foe, for that by thy meanes I am brought into bondage. I pray thee tell mee without dissembling (which I feare mee thou canst doo too well) when thou sawest Ornatus ? and yet I know thy answere before I aske. Dost thou not know this letter? didst thou not hide it in this garden, that I might finde it? did not Ornatus hire thee to say, that hee was departed from his fathers, whilest he lyeth at home in thy house? I knowe thy aunswere will bee no: but howe may I beleeue that? Doest thou not likewise say hee loueth mee when thou knowest the contrarie, and doest but dissemble? If thou harborest any vertue in thee, tell mee the truth and dissemble not? for in doing so, thou shalt greatly content me, discharge thy conscience, and peraduenture doe Ornatus a good turne. Adellena hearing her speeches, was so astonish at theyr strangenesse, that for a good while she stood as one sencelesse, but at the last, she made this answere. Your demaunds are such, as that I know not how to answere them: but heauens punish mee, if I dissemble. I saw not Ornatus since the time hee came to mee, to know how you accepted the letter I conueyed into your Casket. For that Letter I am altogither ignorant therein, neither did I euer see the same before now: I neuer spake with Ornatus , sawe Ornatus , or heard from him since I last gaue him your answere: neither doo I know where hee is: but this I know, that hee is not to bee found: but poore Gentleman, languisheth in loue, which I dare protest, loueth you most dearely, neither neede you misdoubt that hee is absent, or thinke that hee is hidden at my house, for it is too true, hee hath taken such greefe at your vnkindnesse, as will I feare me indaunger his life. I would it were not so, but that he were at my house, then would I counsaile him rather to forget to loue, then indaunger his life thereby. May I beleeue (quoth Artesia ) that this thou sayest is true? Heauens let me liue no longer (quoth Adellena ) if I dissemble. Then (quoth Artesia ) howe should this Letter be conueyed into this garden, but by himselfe? With that the Christall teares fell from her eyes. Howe Ornatus loue was hindered by the newes of Arbastus death. Howe Floretus to attaine Syluians loue, both confest hee slew Arbastus , and intended to poyson Artesia . To augment Artesiaes teares, a messenger hastily running, came in and brought this newes, vttering the same with a gastly countenaunce. O Artesia , heare my tragicke discourse, your Father as you know, rode forth this morning to chase the fearefull Deere, who wandring from his company, at last by his long stay was mist, and all of vs comming together, studied amongst our selues, what should be become of him, at last wee were commaunded by Floretus your Unckle, to poste seuerall wayes in search of him: whom at last we found most greeuously wounded and dead. Artesia hearing his words, with suddaine greefe, fell downe deade. Which when Syluian perceiued, caught her in his armes, rubbing her pale cheekes, vntill shee was reuiued againe. Then they conueyed her to her bed, in such extremitie with that suddaine greefe, that they feared to loose her life, which exceedingly tormented Syluian to behold. Then was there such an vprore in Arbastus house, as al seemed in vtter dispaire, one coniecturing this, an other that of Arbastus death, but all in generall concluding, that it was done by Allinus in reuenge of his brothers death. Arbastus wife, likewise conceiued such sorrow at this vnexpected euent, that with very greefe thereof shee dyed. Artesia with both together, was readie to yeelde vp her latest breath, and had done so, had shee not beene carefullie preserued by Syluian , and Adellena . Who by their counsaile and indeuours, pacified the extremitie of her perplexitie. This newes was soone spred into most places of the countrey: but because there was no iust proofe of the murtherer, there was no great question made thereof: Arbastus hauing neuer a trustie friende to prosecute reuenge. Floretus now tooke vpon him to rule and gouerne all that belonged to Arbastus , as his brother, and soone caused him and his Lady to be worthily interred, and built a sumptuous monument in their remembrance. Which being ouerpast, he came againe to Artesia , (as in the meane time he had oftentimes done) and finding her very weake, vsed many speeches to comfort her, giuing such as were about her speciall charge, to minister all things necessarie to restore her to her former health: Seeming to bee most carefull of her guard, promising and protesting to bee vnto her in stead of a Father. Syluian all this while was exceedinglie greeued in mind to see his loue growne so weake, and in such danger of life, not once forsaking her in all the time of her siknesse, but continually comforting her with heartie speeches, carefull tendance, not so much as once departing her chamber, but taking exceeding pains to pleasure her, that shee tooke great comfort in her supposed Syluian , who oftentimes would steale a sweete kisse from Artesiaes lips, which she permitted, taking the same to proceede from a curteous minde, when Syluian did it of deepe affection: accounting the estate wherin hee liued, to exceed all ioyes, and his delight past compare, profering many familiarities that Artesia tooke in kind part, which otherwise she would haue refused, had shee knowne whom her companion Syluian had beene. Ornatus marueiled that all this time she spake not of him, which he deuised to vrge her to do, by many occasions: but these extremities had bannished all remembrance of him out of her minde: Which exceedingly tormented Ornatus , fearing this delaye would some way turne to his ill. That wheras before time, he was pleasant, mery, and oftentimes would mooue Artesia to myrth by his disporte, now that humour was alienated, and he became continually melancholly and sad, oftentimes when Artesia was from him, getting into a sollitary place, to bewayle his hard fate. Which shee noted and woondred at, thinking the same had proceeded from being so long absent from his countrey and friends. One day she found her deemed Syluian sollitarie alone, and comming vnawares, heard her vtter these words. Oh how vnhappy am I, to loue and not to be beloued. Syluian espying her, left off: to whom Artesia said. Why how now Syluian , are you in loue, can it be, that your mind is attainted with that venemous serpent, that poysoneth the sences, altereth the complexion, & troubleth the head and heart? Shake it off, and cast it out of your sight, for it neuer did any good, but hath brought many to perpetuall miserie. Since you haue ouerheard me (quoth Syluian ,) I must needs confesse I am in loue, which doth not any way worke any such effect in me as you speake off, but I take all comfort therein, my sences, heart, head, & all my parts, take exceeding pleasure therein. Why then (quoth Artesia ) sit you thus pensiuely alone, as it seemeth to me bewayling your estate to be in loue? I do not (quoth Syluian ) sorrow that I am in loue, but that I am not beloued againe: for being in loue, I haue vowed to liue so euer, and sooner shall end. What hard-harted man (said Artesia ) is he yt knowing you loue him, wil not loue you againe? Such is my hard estate (sayd Syluian ) that the partie whom I loue, knoweth I loue, and yet causelesly doth hate me: neither am I farre absent from him, but inioy his company, without which, my life would decay. Is he in this house you loue? can it bee you are intangled since you came hither? No (quoth Syluian ) I loued before I came hither. How can that be, when you are a stranger, and cast in this country by shipwracke? eyther you must needes be some other then we take you for, otherwise, these things are impossible. But if you dare put trust in my secrecie, impart your minde to mee: and I promise you I will do the best I ca to further your loue. You may do much therin (quoth Syluian ) and none more then your self, but I beseech you pardon me for reuealing the same, before you assure me of one thing, which you may do without any harm to your self and be not offeded with me if I ask you. Tel me what it is (quoth she) & I will answer you? Then (said Syluian ) I wold first know whether you loue Ornatus or no? With yt she started? saying: Ay me, that name bringeth death to my heart, & thou woundest my soule with greefe, to heare him named. Dost thou thinke I haue cause to loue & not rather aboue al men to hate him: dost thou not see my father lately murdred by him, or some by his appointment, and thinkest thou I can loue so deadly a foe, by whom I am brought to this miserie? No assure thy selfe Syluian , according as I haue iust cause I do hate him, as the greatest enemie I haue. Whose very name affrighteth mee with terror, and if thou hadst loued me as I was perswaded thou didst, thou wouldst not haue troubled my heart with that omnious name. And yet for all this mischiefe that he hath done me, didst thou not see how he sued for my loue, and had so much preuailed, that my heart beganne to yeeld to his sute? With that she pulled out of her pocket the letter, saying: these lynes the frutes of his dissimulation, were actors in his villainie: with that she tare them into a thousand peeces. Syluian seeing the same, was readie to sound with greefe, breathing foorth a hart burning sigh, said. O how is poore innocencie suspected. And being readie to say more, was disappointed by Floretus comming, who euen then entred the garden, and finding them out, vsed many curteous speeches to the both, especially coforting Artesia . To whom he said. Dear coozin, since these mishaps canot be remedied, let wisdome now ouersway your passionate sorrow: and with patience remit all further greefe, for things past cure are not to be lamented: but now commit the care of your safety to my trustines, yt will as tenderly regard your good as mine owne life. Therfore be of comfort, & whatsoeuer you desire, shalbe to ye vttermost accomplished. Artesia yeelded him many thanks, and so they went in. Artesia being alone by her selfe, could by no means forget what speech she had with Syluian : eyther thinking shee did dissemble, or was some other then she seemed: or else that she was in loue with Floretus . Then she remembred her speeches, saying. Howe is innocencie suspected. Which she knew she spake by her accusing of Ornatus : which draue her into many doubtfull cogitotions, and troubled her sences exceedingly: but by reason of her little suspect of Syluians disguise, shee could not iudge any thing thereof. Syluian likewise not daring to offend her, and louing her so dearely, that hee could not indure to see her disquietted, vsed no more speeches tending to loue, but frequenting her company wherin hee tooke his whole felicitie, accounting himselfe most happie to liue and enioy her sweete presence, beeing out of hope to attaine her loue, refreshing his heart with many sollaces of sweete delight, in beholding that which shee little thought he had noted. Many daies continued Syluian in this disguise, in which time, Arbastus death was almost forgotten. And Floretus drawn by Syluians manifolde vertues, began exceedingly to affect her, shewing such kinde behauiour towards her, that she suspected that which afterwards she found true: for Floretus cocealing his loue, felt the flame to burne the more inwardly, and liuing in that scorching pennurie, thought it better for him to manifest his loue, the by hyding the same, augment his torment. Assuring himselfe to obtain his desire, for that Syluian was a stranger, far fro friends, and without his friendship, likelie to come to pouertie, which hee thought woulde bee a meanes of importance to drawe her to like of him: besides, hee thought that hee might do as hee list with Artesia , for that shee was onelye in his custodie. And on a day finding Syluian alone in the garden, comming to her with a submisse behauiour, he said as followeth. My deare Syluian , I would gladlie vtter a matter of an importance, if you will vouchsafe me gentle audience: So it is fayre Damosell, that my heart hath long time been inthralled to your bewtie, which I haue refrained to vtter, fearing to be refused: but knew you how faithfully my heart is deuoted to your seruice, and with what torment I haue concealed the same, you would pittie me. My estate is sufficient to maintaine you well, though not so worthily as you deserue: you shall liue with me in contented ease, and haue so faithfull and constant a friend, as no torment nor affliction shall alter. Therefore I beseech you, let me receiue some hope of comfort by your gentle speeches, which shall expell many cares from my troubled heart. Syluian had much adoo to abstaine from smiling, to thinke how vnfit he was to yeeld such a reward as Floretus expected: committing further consideration thereof, to time more conuenient, gaue him this answere. My minde sir is vnapt to entertaine loue, considering how farre I am from my countrey, and how soone I may bee ouertaken, therefore I pray you seeke not that at my hands which I wil not graunt, but if with your fauour I may liue so quietly as since my comming I haue done, I shal thinke my selfe more beholding to you for that, then for your porfered loue, which I cannot yeelde vnto. Floretus thinking her soft answere was a signe she would soone yeeld, stil prosecuted his sute with earnestnesse, in so much that Syluian tolde him that as yet she could not fancie him, because shee had no triall of him, but that she would consider further thereof. And so for that time they parted. Floretus in hope to attaine that which was not to bee had, and Syluian in hope by this meanes the sooner to attaine Artesias loue. First considering that Floretus had the disposing of her, and therefore he must please him: least otherwise he might bee depriued of her company. Then he began to thinke of Arbastus murther, knowing assuredly, that it was not acted by his fathers counsel, but rather by some secret foe, that might as well bee Floretus as any other, for that hee was the next heire, if Artesia hindred him not: which conceit tooke such effectuall instance in his fancie, that with that his suspect, beholding Floretus behauiour, countenance, and little inquiry for the murtherer, he plainly suspected him, which by the diuine prouidence, rather then by any euident proofe, was stirred in his opinion. Such murther is neuer vnreuealed, and though neuer so closely done, yet God by some extraordinary meanes or other reuealeth the same. So came it to passe with Ornatus , although hee was no way priuie to any such act, or had any probabilitie thereof, yet hee thought that Floretus countenaunce be wrayed his treacherie, and therefore hee longed to haue some conference with him, to see if hee could gather the truth, whereby he thought both to discharge himselfe of that suspect Artesia had of him, and also when shee sawe his innocencie and constancie, she might yeelde to loue him: purposing to leaue no meanes vnattempted to trie him: which he did the next time he spake with him, in this sort. Early the next morning, Floretus not vnmindfull of his loue which kept him from his sleepe that night, neuer left till hee had found Syluian , and comming to her, with manifolde submisse speeches, sollicited his sute: whom Syluian cunningly handled, stil putting him in hope, and yet making him no promise, which set him the more on fire, being so farre ouergone with affection, that hee purposely determined eyther to win her loue, or hazard his owne life, and to leaue no meanes vnattempted, were it neuer so dangerous, to procure his owne content. That the more vnwilling he saw Syluian , the more importunate hee grew. Till at last Syluian sayd as followeth. Floretus I know no reason you haue to bee so importunate, when I see in you no token of fidelitie: but once hauing attained your purpose, you will esteeme mee as lightly as easily woon: besides, I see not wherein you can performe any such matter as you promise, for I beeing in a strange countrey, haue nothing: and you for ought I see, as little: then by matching with you, I shall but bring my selfe to pouertie, and miserie, and then your loue now so hotte, wil be as colde: and I as reiected, cast off to vtter miserie. Floretus not suffering her to proceed any further, made this answere. Syluian do you not see Arbastus wealth, wil not yt bee sufficient? the great possessions I now enioy by him, are of substance to maintaine you in all quiet, and yeeld you your heartes content. Arbastus wealth said Syluian , that is Artesiaes by right, then how can you possesse the same she liuing? Doo but graunt me loue, sayd he, and I will quicklie satisfie you in that. I haue a meane to get all into mine owne hands: and therefore I beseech you, let no such matter trouble your minde, but be assured, that in enioying me, you shal haue al happinesse and quiet, by my humble, dutifull, and constant loyaltie. Do but assure mee of this (quoth Syluian ) and you shall knowe my resolution afterwards. Artesia entring the chamber, brake off their speeches, whose presence vexed Floretus at the heart, beeing scarce able to speake, by reason of his inward rancor: for indeed hee hated Artesia , because she onely kept him from possessing his brothers liuing: the want whereof, kept him from attaining Syluians loue: therefore he resolued by some meanes to worke her downefall which within short time he acquainted Syluian withall by this occasion. One day finding her alone in a secret place in the garden, after many speeches past betwixt them: whereby hee perceiued the chiefest things that hindred him, was his want of wealth, and after that Syluian had in some sort made him a grant (onely to trie him,) he began to vtter his intent in this sorte. My deare Syluian , I am so well perswaded of your vertue, and put such confidence in your trustinesse, that I will reueale to you the very depth and secrets of my heart, would you but sweare to keepe my counsell: for to purchase your content, I haue determined to put in practise a matter of secrecie, which concerneth my life to bee reuealed. Syluian hearing that, thouught it better to sweare a thousand oathes and breake them all, then by nicenesse to indanger the life of Artesia , which she supposed he aymed at promised him by many protestations, to keepe secret whatsoeuer he tolde her: whervpon Floretus vrged with hope to win her loue, and imboldned in mischief, cared not what he did to attain his wil, said as followeth. Syluian , you see Arbastus is dead, which was one stop that kept me from inioying great possessions, and my purpose is, so you wil but vouchsafe to ayde me therrin, to be ridde of Artesia : and then all that belongeth to her by her fathers death, shall bee yours to dispose of. Syluians heart throbde to heare his speeches, but determining to sift him to the full, said as followeth. Floretus I am sure you speake this onely to trie me, and so intrap me, and not of any intent you haue to performe the same, wherein you shall doo me great wrong, and your selfe no good: for I cannot beleeue you beare the least thought to do it. By heauen quoth hee, it is my full intent, and for that you may be assured thereof, it was I that slew Arbastus , howsoeuer the matter is imputed to Allinus , and purpose likewise to be rid of Artesia , onely for your sake. Therefore make no doubt of my resolution: for I am absolutely purposed to do it. (O thought Syluian ) rather shalt thou see my blood, then spill one drop of hers: why Floretus would you haue me do any thing therin? You onely may doo it (quoth he) with more safetie then any other, and the maner how is this. Within some mile from this Castle, Arbastus hath a banquetting house in his Parke, where oftentimes hee would for his recreation lye, whither I will perswade Artesia to goe for a season to take the aire, and to recreate her sences dulled with greefe? and none but you to keepe her company, and some two seruants whose trustinesse, I am assured of. This done, I will get a drinke to be made, the force whereof, shall expell life, and yet by no meanes nor any cunning or skil be found out, when you shall thinke it most conuenient giue vnto her: & being once dead, who will make any enquirie, but that she died of a naturall sicknesse? and then you shall be mistresse both of her heritage and my selfe. Syluian said, when shall this be put in practise? Within these two daies at the farthest said he: in the meane time frequent you Artesiaes company, in such familiar sort as heretofore you haue done, and my selfe wil vse her with no lesse kindnesse. Many other speeches being past betwixt them at that time, they parted. How Ornatus told Artesia of Floretus intent, and vpon what occasion he discouered himselfe. his secrets to Syluian , entring into these meditations; Doth Syluian thinke that my policie exceedeth not her shallow capacitie: poore simple straunger, she hath vndertaken a matter of great importance for me, that meane nothing lesse then good wil to her, she for my loue hath promised to poyson Artesia , and is likely that once done, to taste of the same sawce, for loued she me neuer so well, I will not trust her with my life, but peraduenture she hateth me, and will reueale my drift to Artesia . No Floretus thou art deceiued, she is so farre in loue that she doteth, and would I am sure do any thing at my request. What a world is this, what villanie can be intended, that some either for fauour or reward, wil not execute? If I should trust her that is so easily wonne to do such a hainous deed, might I not be accounted madde? yes, and therefore I wil not trust her: Artesia being once dispatcht, she shall follow next. Ornatus on the countrary part, was glad that he had felt the depth of Floretus counsell, thinking likewise that he was so farre in loue with him (taking him for a woman,) that for his sake he sought Artesias death: which was the onely meanes to helpe him attaine her loue, which he likewise determined to giue her knowledge of, and discouer himselfe, hoping that when she sawe his innocencie, his faithfull loue, and how by his meanes her life was preserued, she would yeeld him due guerdon for his good will. Whilst he was in the depth of those cogitations, he espied Artesia enter the garden, and taking his Lute, founde her seated vpon a flowrie banke, vnder the shade of a mirtle tree, and perceiuing that she was somewhat heauily inclinde, he satte downe by her, and with his sweete melodie, brought her a sleepe, when she had slept a good while, being exceedingly affrighted with a dreame, she started vp, looking earnestly vpon Syluian , saying; I pray thee Syluian do not poyson mee. Syluian seeing her so affrighted, was exceedingly amazed, and she her selfe not yet fully recouered, seemed to be affraid of him, till at last Syluian said. I beseech you what is it that affrighteth you? O Syluian said she, I drempt thou wouldst haue murthered me. Heauens forbid (quoth he) that I should attempt so hainous a deede: But woulde you vouchsafe to heare my tragicke report, you should be rid of that doubt, though Syluian is much tempted to do such a deede: who esteeme your life more dearer then mne owne, and would rather with my owne hands teare out my wofull heart, then thinke the least thought to wrong you. But because I haue so fit occasion, and I hope your patience will permit me, I will reherse a most monstrous and hainous intended mischiefe. The other day I remember you were exceedingly offended with me for naming Ornatus , for that you supposed him to be an actor in Arbastus death, but both he and Allinus are innocent, and farre from any such thought, for your vncle Floretus was his murtherer, which hee tolde me himselfe: he hath beene oftentimes importunate to win my loue (which an other possesseth) but I suspecting as much as I now find to be true, held him of with this delay, that he had not wealth to maintaine me. Which when I had often alleaged, hee tolde me all that belonged to Arbastus was his: then I demaunded how that could be, since you were liuing? Quoth hee, sweare but to be secret, and I will tell you how. With that vpon my protestations, he tolde me that he had murdred Arbastus , and ment to poison you: perswading me to consent thereto, for that hee said, I onely could do it: with that (I not purposing to do it, but to preserue you) promised him my vttermost assistance, which he tolde me should be done, in this manner. I will (quoth he) perswade Artesia , to forsake this Castle, and to soiourne some few dayes in a house Arbastus hath in his Parke, where none but you  & two others seruats, whose secrecie I nothing doubt, shall keep her company, where I will giue you such a potion, as shall end her life, and yet by no means be perceiued, neither can there be any doubt thereof: for that I and none else am left of her kindred, to search the truth. This is the summe of that he tolde me. Artesia hearing her words, sate like one without sence a good space, being so farre ouercome with greefe and feare, that she could not speake a word, but at the last burst foorth into these lamentations. Ay mee, vnknde, and most vnnaturall Unckle, canst thou speake me so faire and intend me so much harm? Who would haue thought so foule impietie, had ben shrowded vnder so faire pretext? Couldst thou be so vnnaturall, as to murther thy owne most naturall louing and dear brother, and not contented with his tragedie, to seek my vntimely death? What frenzie or follie doth possesse thy brest, that I esteemed replete with vertue? How canst thou suffer so impious and haynous a thought to sink in thy brest, much lesse to act such a notorious outrage against him yt loued thee as his life, & her that honoreth thee as her friend? O Syluian , may I credit thy words, and not rather accuse thee, and excuse him? May I thinke him so simple, to trust thee with his secrets? no I feare mee this is some pollicie inuented by thee to some bad end. Yet I pray thee pardon me: for what canst thou get by telling me so vnlesse it were so? or not rather haue kept his counsell, & then thou mightest haue been my heire. And pardon I ask of thee good Ornatus , though thou art absent, for that I accused thee as accessarie to my fathers death, when thou art innocent. With that a floud of teares stopt ye passage of her speech, & Syluian said. Artesia , yet vouchsafe to heare my counsel, which shal preuent al these imminent euils. You may peradueture make some doubt of the truth, of that which I haue spoken: but I take heauen to record, no word is false: for I regard your good aboue all thinges, and your quiet aboue mine own content: for shuld you dye, I could not liue: for by you I draw my breath. I diued into Floretus counsails, not to ayd him, but to preuent them: for that I knew Ornatus was no way guiltie of any such treason, but would haue ventured his owne life, to haue preserued your Fathers, whome hee both loued & honored as himselfe. Of whome I could haue told you more, but that fearing to offend you, & partly seeing how vehemetly you accused him, I durst not, whose loue is loyall, & theron I will pawn my life. Syluian (quoth Artesia ) thou tellest mee things of woonder, but especially yt thou art so priuie to Ornatus , thoughts, and yt thou darest so boldely affirme he loueth me, when thou maiest be deceiued. Most vertuous Artesia (quoth he) were you but so priuie to ye thoughts of his hart as I am, you would say as much as I, & beleeue all yt I tel you: and to put you in assurance of what I know, I giue you knowledge yt I am Ornatus , yt in this disguise haue sought to attaine your loue: for which boldnesse, I most humbly beseech you to pardon mee. With yt a ruddie blush spred it selfe in Artesias cheekes, before pale with feare, being so much ashamed yt hee had bin so priuie to many of her actions, that she could not tell with what countenaunce to behold him. Then Ornatus said, I beseech you pitie my torment, which hath vrged mee to this boldnesse, being frustrated of other meanes to enioy your presence: my meaning being no other then vertuous, but resting at your mercifull disposition. Desiring you to put assured confidence in me, for preuenting Floretus intent, which you need not doubt of, for to my greefe I know it to bee too true. Artesia maruelled exceedingly at the straungenesse of these newes, but most of all admired Ornatus loue, which shee could not tell how to reiect, for that she both well knewe, hee deserued loue, and the necessitie of time was such, that her safetie rested in his secrecie: yet being not willing at that instant to yeelde without further assault, said: I know not by what name to call you, when neither I know whether you are Syluian or Ornatus , but which of both, your words beare great shewe of true friendship, which I feare me is not grounded in your heart, neither do I greatly care: for since my vncle seeketh my life, let him take it, for I am weary thereof. Let not your gentle heart (quoth Ornatus ) make any doubt that I am Ornatus , though my counterfeit disguise doth shewe me other, but either vouchsafe me loue, or giue me leaue to die for Artesia , for that potion that should dispatch you, shall ende my life: for my life is bound to your commaund, and all my felicitie resteth in your fauour. Which vnlesse you graunt, my life without the same will be but shorte, and the time I haue to liue, an endlesse labyrinth of sorrow. Adellena by occasion entered the garden, and found Artesia weeping, and Syluian in a heauie dumpe, readie to torment himselfe to see her sorrow, but Artesia espying her, said: Adellena , doest thou loue Ornatus ; so much, as that thou wouldest hazard life and credit to doo him good? for that I knowe him to bee a most vertuous & honest Gentleman? I but wouldest thou quoth shee, keepe my counsell if I reueale a secret of importance to you concerning Ornatus ? And vpon Adelleanas promise, she said: doo you know Ornatus if you see him? behold there he is. Adellena was at the first halfe astonisht at her speeches: but at last she perfectly remembred that was he indeed: reioycing most exceedingly to see him there, especially with Artesia . Then they declared vnto her all that had happened, and of Floretus intent, desiring her to be secret, and make no shewe of discontent, least he should suspect Syluian had bewrayed his secrets: and after some other speeches past, they went in togither. How Artesia departed to the Lodge with Syluian , and from thence secretly departed to Adellenas house, and how Ornatus taken to be Syluian , was by Floretus accusation, and Artesias want, banished. It fel so out the next day, that the King with diuers of his company, amongst whom was his only sonne and heire Lenon , being wearied with trauell, arriued at Arbastus house, thinking to haue founde him there, but the King hearing of his suddaine death, was exceedingly sorie, perswading himselfe as all men else did, that he was slaine by some of Allinus house? which made him make small tariance there, but departed to his Pallace. Now it fortuned that Lenon behelde Artesias bewtie, and was with the first view thereof, exceedingly bewitched, that after he was gone, he could by no meanes forget her? but determined ere long, to returne to see if he could attaine her loue. Now the time was come that Floretus had appointed to set abroach his villany, and (according as Ornatus had before told Artesia ) he came to her, perswading her for a season to lie in the Countrey, which she as forearmed consented vnto, and so the next morning, she with Syluian, Floretus , and diuers others, departed: at night Floretus returning, and leauing with her accodring as he had promised Syluian , and onely two seruants that were to prouide them necessaries, but knew no part of the conspiracie. When Ornatus and Artesia were alone togither, for that she was vndoubtedly assured of his loue, faith and fidelitie, she vsed these comfortable speeches to him. Ornatus , whereas alwaies before this time too vnkindly I haue reputed you as a foe, I now craue pardon, being sorie that my heart hath done you so much wrong, which now I will requite with kindnesse. I confesse it was strange to me to entertaine loue, but now I willingly yeeld my selfe to be her subiect, and your true and faithful friend: committing my life to your custodie, and my loue and selfe to be yours to dispose of. Ornatus hearing her speeches, was rauished with a heauen of ioy, with a gentle and kind behauiour, foulding her in his armes, and imprinting a sweete kisse vpon her rosiate lippes, he said. Neuer was poore wretch exalted to more happinesse then I am, by being inriched with this inestimable treasure of your loue. O how rich a reward haue I now reapt for my cares, and what glorie, ioy or wealth, can be compared to the riches of your loue? O heauenly Artesia , how fortunate haue you made Ornatus ? how haue you blest Ornatus ? how full of ioy is Ornatus , by your sweete consent? was euer any so vnworthie, so exalted, for his kindnesse and loue? I wil performe more then my tongue can vtter, and bee more faithfull then your heart can wish. Then began they to imbrace each other, and to surfet themselues in the sollaces, true loue yeeldeth. He sometimes lending her a kisse, and she with interest paying two for one: for one sweet looke two, and so many imbracings as are not to be explicated: their hands and hearts ioyned in such firme bandes of true affection, as is not to be dissolued: and surfetting with such exceeding content, as is impossible to be described. These stormes of loue somewhat mittgated, they began to consult of their daungerous estate, and to deuise how to preuent the intended mischiefe. In this place they continued some two dayes in exceeding content, still expecting to heare from Floretus : who the third day fearing to trust any with a matter of such waight, came himselfe to bring the potion, (yet in shew of kindnes to visite Artesia ) deliuering the same to Syluian , willing her the next night to giue it her, which she promised him faithfully to accomplish. When he was gone, Artesia came to Ornatus to knowe what newes Floretus brought, who tolde her all, and shewed her the poyson in a glasse, which he had charged should be giuen to her the next day. With that Artesia beganne to wayle and exclaime against her Unckle, in most extreame sort. But Ornatus intreated her to cease such vaine griefe, which could not hurt him, but her selfe, promising her to preuent the same, if shee would follow his counsell, which she willingly yeelded vnto. Then quoth hee, let vs presently depart hence to Adellenaes house, which you know is not farre off, who you know is agreed with vs alreadie, where I will leaue you, and returne. Which said, while the seruants were absent vpon some speciall occasion, they departed with little labour, arriuing at Adellenas house, who was readie to receiue them, and after many farwels, Ornatus returned backe to the Lodge. And when it was supper time, the seruants brought vp meate, but Ornatus tolde them that Artesia was scarce well, and therefore they would not sup that night. And being alone by himselfe, he studied what excuse to make for Artesias absence, when Floretus should come, spending that night in much care, and many vnquiet cogitations, which tooke away his sleepe. Floretus was no sooner returned from the Lodge, but hee met Lenon , who of purpose came to meete Artesia , whom Floretus kindly saluted: maruelling much wherefore hee came: to ease which doubt, Lenon said. My friend Floretus , I come to visite the faire Artesia , to whose beawtie I am inthralled, not as regarding her wealth, but her sweete loue, of whome you onely haue the gouernment: therefore I pray befriend me so much, that I may come to speech with her. Floretus was so exceedingly amazed to heare his speeches, that he could not tell what answere to make, nor how to excuse her absence. Lenon seeing him in such a studie, continued his speeches, saying: Floretus be not vnwilling I should match with Artesia , for that shall no way hinder your preferment, who think peraduenture the longer shee liueth vnmarried, the more wealth you shall get by her, but to rid you of that doubt, be but a meanes to win her consent, and I vowe by heauen, I will not take one peniworth of Arbastus substance from you, but freely giue it you all. For it is not her possessions I regard, but her loue, therefore I pray resolue me of your minde herein. My Lord replied hee, your offer is so bountifull, besides my dutie vrging me, I am readie to performe your will to the vttermost of my power. I thanke you good Floretus quoth Lenon , then I pray thee bring mee to her, for my loue is impatient of delay. My Lord replied he, that can I not do instantly, for Artesia some two daies past, with the straunge damosell Syluian , departed thence, and are nowe at the Lodge: whither (if you please to to take such entertainment as this place yeeldeth) wee will both goe to morrow morning. Agreed quoth Lenon , I will accept your profer. When the time of rest was come, Floretus being alone by himselfe, entred into these cogitations. What inconueniences hast thou runne into Floretus? Thou hast hyred one to murther Artesia , in hope to get her wealth, and made Syluian acquainted with thy counsell, which wealth thou maiest now attaine by preseruing her life: and besides, winning her to loue Lenon , thou shalt finde him thy faithfull friend for euer. What wert thou then best to doo? if thou shouldest murther her, hee would make enquirie of her death, and so thou bee vndone: If not, then wil Syluian bee displeased, and so bewray thy drift: that the mischiefes thou by folly hast runne into, are so intricate, that thou knowest not which way to shunne them. Were it not better to saue her life, and winne her Loue for Lenon , then to poyson her, and so to die my selfe? If I saue her life, Syluian will be discontented: what of that? then let Syluian smart for it, for if she wil not bee contented with that I shall doo, she shall neuer liue to bewray my counsell. And therefore wil I first trie her, and finding any suspition thereof, I will stabbe her my selfe, whose death I may easilier answere then Artesias . Early the next morning, Lenon and he rode to the Lodge, where no sooner arriued, but he met with Syluian , to whom he said: How now Syluian , I haue newes of importance to bewray to thee, Lenon whome thou here beholdest, is sonne to the King, who is deeply in loue with Artesia , and hath giuen me assurance of all Arbastus liuings, if I can win Artesia to match with him, now I thinke it good to deferre our purpose as concerning her death, vntil wee haue made triall whether shee wil loue him or no. Which if we can effect, we shall be quit of so cruel a deed, enioy her heritage, and haue an assured friend of Lenon whilest we liue: therefore let me know your opinion herein. Syluian was exceedingly amazed to heare his speeches, thinking that if he did tel him where Artesia was, she should be wrested from his possession, and so himselfe disappointed of her loue: and on the other side, he thought what mischiefe would arise if he should say he had already giuen her the poyson, yet his loue ouermaistring the feare of any daunger, made him say, All this I like: but Floretus , it is now too late, for I haue caused Artesia to drink the poyson you deliuered me, and she is dead, which was of such force, that all her bodie purpled into blisters and swellings, which because I knew would bewray what we had done, I tooke her bodie and conueyed it into a deepe pit, where it is impossible to be found. Floretus now fearing to haue his treason bewrayed, thought to stabbe Syluian ; and so to be rid of them both, that in a monstrous rage he drew his dagger, and vnawares strooke Syluian in the left arme, who feeling the smart, with violence more then Floretus expected, stept to him, and in spite of his vtermost strength, wroong the dagger out of his hands, and with the same wounded him in three places, and had not Lenon stept betwixt them, Floretus had bene slaine. With that Lenon parting them, demaunded what the matter was: Floretus thinking rather to accuse, then be accused himselfe, and terrified with affright, saide that wicked woman hath murthered Artesia . Syluian made no answer vntil Lenon laid hold on her, demanding where Artesia was, she answering, that by the intisemet of that wicked Floretus , I gaue her a drinke that vnknowing to me hath poysoned her. O wicked creature saide Lenon , thou hast condemned thy selfe to death. With that he began to drawe his sword, but Ornatus thinking it now no time to dally lest hee might by them be murthered, caught holde on Lenons sworde, hauing such aduantage, that he easily wroong it from him, and said; Worthie Lenon be aduised, do not thou seeke to spil my innocent blood, without further cosideration, least for the same thou loose thine owne. Thinkest thou I am as faultie and guiltie as Floretus is? be assured I am not. But if thou louest Iustice, laie hands on that Traytor, for he not I, is culpable of sheading her innocent blood. By this time Lenons seruants perceiuing their contention, came running in with their swordes drawne, by their Lordes commaundement, apprehending Floretus , and afterwards seeking by violence to take Syluian , but he standing in his owne defence, resisted them, alledging innocencie, till Lenon vowed and protested if he were not accessary thereto, he should haue no other then iustice, and that his cause should be heard before the King. Ornatus thought it better to yeelde by faire meanes, rather then by compulsion, and esteeming it lesse griefe to be made a prisoner, then to bewray where Artesia was, and so haue her taken from him, yeeldeth: both of them being conueyed to the Pallace, and for that night comitted to seuerall prisons. Floretus conscience so deeply accused him of villany, that he continued cursing and exclaiming against his hard fortune, with bitter bannings raging against himselfe for trusting Syluian , seeming with extreame feare of death, desperate. Ornatus on the other side, tooke that trouble patiently, as endured for Artesias sake fearing nothing, for that hee knew himselfe innocent, and could easily acquite himselfe of such accusation, purposing rather to hazard the worst, then bewray what he was: which to conceale, was his greatest care. The next day they were brought before the Prince, where Floretus vpon Syluians accusation confest the truth, both concerning Artesia , and how he slue Arbastus , for which hee was adiudged to die within two daies. And quoth he to Syluian , for that thou art a stranger, and by his counsell rather then of thine owne inclination, wert drawne vnwittingly to doo that deed, I will pardon thy life, but adiudge thee to be banished this Countrey: and quoth he, because I feare that some wil seeke thy life, thou shalt presently be conueyed hence. Which doome shall stand irreuocable. Then gaue he commandement, hee should be conueyed to the hauen presently, committing her to the custodie of certaine rude Moores. Who not staying to heare what answer shee would make (whereof poore Ornatus was not readily prouided of, in that extremitie) immediately carried her away: to whom Ornatus would haue tolde the truth of all, but hee spake to them that vnderstood him not, who with speede executing their soueraignes commaund, rudely haled him aboord, and hoysing saile, neuer rested vntill they arriued neare the coast of Natolia , where they were commaunded to leaue her. Of the sorrow Artesia tooke for Ornatus banishment, and of the seuerall aduentures befell him in Natolia . Ornatus according to his promise, which draue her into some doubt of his safetie, that comming to Adellena , she desired her to haste to the Lodge, to intreate him to come to her, for that by her hearts misdoubt shee suspected some heauie newes. Adellena immediately hasted thither, finding the seruants in great sorrow, whom shee asked for Syluian . Ay me, quoth one of them, by this time shee is past speaking withall: for such heauie newes is befallen since your departure, as greeueth me to vtter, yet notwithstanding hee told her all that was happened. Adellena brooking no delay which in those affaires was daungerous, stood not to immitate of those greefes, and how contrarily euery thing fell out, but with all haste returned to Artesia , who espying her comming, thought her countenance bewraied some vnwelcome accident; hastily enquiring how Ornatus did. Adellena for want of breath could not speake a good space, but at the last shee said. Artesia , tedious lament is not now to be vsed, but speedie counsell how to saue Ornatus , for hee is carried before the King, is accused by Floretus to haue murthered you, for comming to the Lodge with Lenon the Kings sonne, who pretendeth great loue to you, and not finding you, Ornatus tolde Floretus he had giuen you the poyson, whereupon Floretus wold haue slaine him, but Ornatus taking his dagger from him, had done the like to him, had not Lenon stept betwixt them. Then Floretus accused him for your death, and he Floretus : and both were yesterday carried before the King. Ahlas poore Ornatus , said Artesia , what miserie is befallen thee for my sake? howe art thou rewarded for preseruing my life? Good Adellena , counsell me what is to be done: Ornatus being amongst them a reputed straunger, hauing no friend to pleade for him, and peraduenture ouerswayed by Floretus periurie, may haue his life indaungered, and the rather for that he is taken to be a Natolian . Therefore Adellena , if thou louest him or me, will saue both his and my life, and discharge him of that false accusation, runne to the Court, and finding out Lenon , tell him of my safetie, and request him for my sake to pittie poore Syluian. Adellena according to her commaundement, mounted a Horse, and with great speede by that time it was night, attained the Court, and finding out Lenon , vttered these speeches. Most worthie Lenon , vouchsafe to heare me speake: The faire Artesia whome you suppose dead, is aliue and in safetie at my house, who hath sent me vnto you in the behalfe of Syluian , fearing some wrong might bee done to her, as suspected to bee her death, when she onely hath preserued her life. Lenon was so amazed at her speeches, that hee could not tel what to say, being exceedingly greeued for Syluian , but at length tolde her what his Father had done: which appalled her sences with deadly feare. Lenon , notwithstanding it somewhat greeued him for Syluian , yet his heart was glad to heare of Artesias safetie, and therefore hee determined to goe with Adellena to visit her, which likewise hee performed, and entring where shee was, making exceeding lamentation, he said. I beseech you greeue not faire Damosell for Syluian , for no harme is done to her, onely my father vppon her owne confession and Floretus accusation, hath banished her, to her owne Countrey. Artesia hearing his speeches, with verie greefe fell into a deadly traunce, both Lenon and Adellena hauing much a doo to bring her life againe. And being conueyed to her bed, when her sences were come to their perfect vse, and Lenon standing by her, whose sight was most greeuous to her, shee turned her head from his sight, sheading such aboundance of teares, that shee bedeawed the place where shee laie. Lenon perceiuing that shee was displeased with his presence, withdrew himselfe, giuing Adellena this charge. Adellena , since Artesia is in thy custodie, I charge thee let her not depart hence, vntill thou hearest of mee againe, for if thou doest, thou shalt answere the same: but if thou wilt stand my friend, and in my behalfe intreat her fauour, I will proue so gratefull a friend, as thou shalt account thy labour wel imployed. Hee was no sooner gone, but Artesia vttered these lamentations; Most accursed wretch that I am, to bee thus separated from my deare Loue, whose curteous minde is the fountaine of all vertue: how vnfortunate am I made by my fathers death, and my Unckles crueltie, but especially by his losse, that is vniustly banished into a straunge Countrey, where hee prooe true and loyall Gentleman, neuer set foote? how vnhappie was hee made, when hee first beganne his loue? but now most miserable, by seeking to preserue my life, hath cast away his owne; and fearing to be disappointed of my loue, hath quite disseuered himselfe from my sight, to hazard his person by sea and land. Is it possible that hee should euer returne, beeing so farre conueyed from his natiue soyle, and left to the mercies of straunge people, that will be readie to destroy his guiltlesse life. No I feare mee, neuer shall I bee so happie as beholde him, and though I doo not, yet shall my loue to him remaine immoueable. Therefore nowe will I arme my selfe to endure all perilles, to liue in care, and continuall lament, for want of beloued Ornatus , whose heart I knowe is replete with sorrowe, and peraduenture misdoubteth my loyaltie, hauing bene so vnkinde to him before: and knowing Lenons affection, may suppose his dignitie might alter my constancie. But sooner shall Ornatus heare of my death, then that I haue altered my loue, or yeelded his right to an other, were hee the greatest Potentate in the worlde. Which saide, another flood of brinishe teares ouerflowed her eyes, and her passage of speeche was stopt by heart- pearcing sighings, which in confused multitudes issued with her sweete breath, neuer ceasing her lamentes, but still bewayling her true Loues absence, that it pearced Adellenaes hearte with suche sorrowe, that shee wept as fast as Artesia , both being so much greeued, that they seemed to striue howe to exceede one another in laments. In which sorrowfull estate, Artesia remained so long, that shee waxed extreame sicke; and grewe to that extremitie, that Adellena feared her death. Lenon likewise being come to the Court, gatte pardon of his Father for Floretus death, but notwithstanding hee remained in prison all the dayes of his life. Lenon likewise hearing of Artesias sicknesse, refrained from visiting her, onely he would oftentimes repaire to Adellenaes house, to enquire howe shee did. Ornatus being left in the Countrey of Natolia , tooke his misfortunes in such heauie sort, that had not his hope to see Artesia againe withheld him, hee had offered himselfe some outrage, for a season giuing himselfe to forlorne and carelesse desperation, neyther regarding which way to prouide for his safetie, nor otherwise respecting what daunger hee might runne into in that straunge Countrey, for the Moores had landed him in a waste and desolate Coaste of the Countrey. Thus carelesse did hee continue a whole night and a day, not so muche as seeing foode to preserue him from famine: but in the ende, hunger constrained him to seeke succour, but when his stomacke serued him, hee coulde finde no meate, that with the extremitie thereof, calling to remembrance his estate, hee vttered these plaints. Thus contrary is Nature to her subiects, sometimes hoysing them to the toppe of all felicitie, and then with violence tumbling them downe headlong into the depth of extreame miserie. Was euer more fortunate, and suddenly miserable then I am? Coulde euer any man whatsoeuer, attaine more heauenly felicitie and happinesse then I did, by being possest of Artesia ? and now againe more accurst being thus far absented from her: and banished my natiue soyle into a straunge Countrey, readie to be famished or deuoured by wild beasts, or that which is worst, neuer likely to see Artesia againe. How could any man containe himselfe from desperatenesse, being so miserable as I am? How can I withholde my hands from murthering myselfe, when by doing it, I should bee ridde out of a wretched life? What should I doo, which way should I goe? Here I am in a desolate and vnfrequented place, where no humane creatures inhabit, but wilde beasts, without foode, without weapons, in womans apparrell, and without hope of comfort. Shall I staie here? then shall I bee famished: shall I leaue this place and trauell further? then I goe further from my beloued, and meeting with some rauenous beast, may be deuoured. Now being hungrie I want foode, and here is none, vnlesse I will eate the earth, leaues of trees, or rootes of the grasse. Well I will seeke my fortune, bee it good or ill: and in this desperate moode hee trauelled on, and by good fortune founde a Tree laden with exceeding, pleasant, and goodly fruite, with which hee stenched his hunger: not farre from which place, he tooke vp his nights lodging. Early the next morning he arose, first filling his belly, and then his lappe with that pleasant fruite, the taste whereof, was lyke pleasant wine, that being drunke in abundance, will make the head light: which made Ornatus hearte merrie, that he trauelled on apace, but Fortune not contented with the miserie he had endured alreadie, sent him in an other affliction: hee entered into a place like a Forrest, beset with Trees of huge proportion, scattered here and there, where hee met with a wild and fierce Boore, that haunted those Desarts, who espying Ornatus , with a terrible groyning bristled himselfe comming towardes him, Ornatus being now driuen to his vttermost shiftes, beganne to runne with all his force from the beast, but hee making the more speede had almost ouertaken him, when one of the Apples Ornatus carried about him fell downe, and the Boore espying the same, staied his haste to take it vp, whereby Ornatus had gotten some little ground of him, and seeing him so much affect the fruite, cast downe another Apple after which the Boore ranne, with greedinesse deuouring the same. Ornatus was glad of this poore shifte, and still cast downe one Apple and then another, that in the ende he had almost throwne away all, and notwithstanding that, feared to be destroyed, but the Boore feeling his belly full, and his hunger stauncht, left off his egar pursute and followed him more cearelesly, whom he still fedde with Apples, so long as his store lasted, that in the ende the Boore being drunke with the pleasant fruite, began to reele and stagger, and lying downe fast a sleepe, which Ornatus seeing, hauing no other then a knife about him, with the same approached the Boore, and without feare, violently thrust the same so deepe into the Boores bristled side, that it pearced his heart, and he after some strugling died. Ornatus then helde vp his hands to heauen for ioy, exceedingly applauding this his fortunate and vnexpected escape; which he tooke as a fortunate presage of good successe. But yet before he could determine what to doo, Fortune once againe shewed her mutabilitie, for when Ornatus had parted the Boores head from his huge bodie, and with the same was readie to depart, there past by as it seemed, a knight gallantly mounted, in green armor, who espying a woman bearing the Boores head, drew towards her, and said: Woman where hadst thou that Boores head? I pray thee deliuer it me. Ornatus made this answere. Sir I need not doo either, vnlesse I know more cause then as yet I doo. The Knight hearing that short answere, alighted, and saide: I will shewe no other reason but that I will haue it: with that he beganne to striue for the same, but Ornatus hauing more minde to his sword then to keepe the Boores head, suddenly caught holde on the Natalians sword, and drew the same out, which when he had gotten, he said: Disloyall and discourteous Knight, now wil I keepe the Boores head in despight of thee, with that hee thrust at him, and contrary to his thought, wounded him so deepe that he left him for dead, wishing that he had not done that deed, but not knowing how discurteously he would haue vsed him, let passe all further remorse, and casting off his womans apparell, put on the Knights apparell and Armour, mounted the steede, and with the Boores head, roade backe the same way hee sawe the Knight come, and within a little space, found a beaten way that conducted him to a goodly Towne, whose Turret toppes he sawe long before hee came to the same: then began hee to studie what to doe, sometimes thinking it best not to enter into the Towne, from whence it is likely the Knight hee slewe came, and so he beeing taken for him might bee knowne, and so afterwards indaungered for his death. For peraduenture the Knight might be of good estimation, and of purpose sent to slay the Boore, and if it should be knowne that he had slain him, his friends would for the same, and the rather for that he was a straunger, prosecute sharpe reuenge against him. Whilst he was in these meditations, he came neare the Towne, not fully resolued what to doo, where he was soone espied of some of the people, who seeing the Boores head, came running towards him making exceeding ioy: which when he saw, he thought it too late to turne back, but that he must go on and hazard the worst: and being entred the Towne, a number of the Inhabitants flocked about him, some with garlands, some with praises, and all with ioy, vttering these speeches. Welcome home most braue Alprinus . Ornatus then perfectly knew that the Knights name was Alprinus , and went of purpose to slea the Boore, whome they tooke him to be, and that he must of necessitie be knowne? which draue him into exceeding care what excuse to make, to auoide the danger of death. Then presently he beheld a troope of bewtifull Damosels, with the sowndes of sweete Musicke comming towards him, (amongst whom, one as chiefe and more bewtifull then the rest, was crowned with a wreathe of flowers, bearing another in her hand) who all at once applauded his victorie, dancing before him, vntill he came into the middest of the Towne where satte the chiefe Magistrates, where the Damosell that was crowned, thus spake to him. Syr Alprinus , your conquest hath released these Inhabitants of care, extolled thy fame, preserued thy life, and wonne me for thy Loue. You haue well performed the taske you vndertooke, and according to your desert, I come to Crowne you with these flowers, and to yeelde my selfe as yours for euer. Ornatus hearing her speeches, thought to trie the end of this aduenture, which could be no worse then death, which of force he must now hazard, alighted, laying downe the Boores head vpon a Table that stood before the Auncients, with humble and comely behauiour kissing the Damoselles hande, who set the wreathe of Flowers vpon his head, and taking him by the hand, brought him before the Auncients, one of whome stoode vp and said? Worthie Gentleman, whereas before thou wert by vs adiudged to die as worthie thereof, for this thy valiant deed, we freely pardon thee, and acquite thee from all trespasses that thou hast commited against any whomsoeuer vntill this present houre. And taking the Damosell by the hand saide, Lucida , according to thy desire, and his desert, I yeelde thee vp to be his wife. And Gentleman quoth he, take her as thine owne, as freely as she was by birth adopted mine: and after my death, be thou inheritour of my land. To all this Ornatus gaue a reuerent consent, and the night now approaching, he with Lucida went to her fathers house, where was a great feast prouided, from which Ornatus excused himselfe in this sort. When he was entred the house, being still Armed, only lifting vp his Beuer, he tooke Lucida by the hand, and withdrawing her aside, said. Lucida , I nowe finde your loue to bee infallible, and your constancie to excell all women that I haue knowne? and that Alprinus is so farre indebted vnto you, as that he shall neuer (might hee liue a thousande yeares) bee able to recompence this inestimable fauour of your loue, which hath preserued my vnworthie life from destruction. But notwithstanding your Loue Alprinus , his debt is so great as can no way bee gratified, I request one further fauour at your handes, wheron my cheefest felicitie dependeth, yea my life, your loue, and perpetuall good, which I feare to vtter, lest you should misconceiue the same, there being no other thing to hinder the content Alprinus seeketh, but onely your fauourable consent, to banish all mistrust of my faith. Lucida maruelled at his speeches, indeed louing him so well, that she would haue spilt her owne blood for his sake, saying: Alprinus , what neede you make doubt of my consent to any thing whatsoeuer it be for your sake? knowe you not howe faithfull I haue continued, though you slue my onely brother? and that I esteemed your loue farre dearer then his life, and when you should haue died for that deed, obtained this at my fathers and the rest of the auncients handes, that slaying the Boore that destroyed many people, you should saue your owne life, and winne me as your Loue. And notwithstanding all this, doo you make a question whether I will yeelde consent to any thing that shall be for your good? O Alprinus , if your loue were so constant as mine, if you intended to continue my loue for euer, if your heart felt so deepe a sting of loue as mine, you would not make such a doubt of my loyaltie, of my truth true loue and constancie. For you knowe whatsoeuer you should aske, I will graunt: whatsoeuer you should request, I will performe: and wherein soeuer a Louer may shewe infallible tokenes of her truth, I will doo as much as any: but since you will not beleeue mee without an oathe, I sweare by my loue, my vnspotted virginitie, and by all the good I wish my heart, I will consent, agree, performe, or doo any thing: not be offended with any thing, be the newes neuer so vnwelcome, so it be for Alprinus good: nor leaue any thing vnperformed you shall require. Ornatus hearing with what constancie her speeches proceeded from her, and how greeuously shee conceiued it, that any doubt should be made of her loyaltie, thought most certainely that he might put his life into her hands, and therefore hauing alreadie studied a deuice, said, It ill agreeth with my nature to dissemble: and hardly could I haue beene drawne thereto, but that desire to preserue loue, drewe me thereto for knowe most worthy Lucida , that I am not Alprinus , but one that for his sake, hath vndertaken this: The truth whereof, if you will heare with patience, I wil declare. Yesterday, I trauailed through the Forrest, or desart, where I met Alprinus , sore wounded, and flying from the Boore that pursued him with celeritie: which when I behelde, to rescue him from death, I set vppon the Boore, and by good fortune flew him: which when he behelde, he declared to me the cause of his coming: which when I heard, pittying his estate, I bid him take the boores head, and withall, helpe him to mount his steed, but his woundes would not suffer him to ride, that I was in some feare of his life. When presently wee beheld an auncient Hermitte comming towards vs, who liued in a Caue in those woods, who vndertooke to cure his wounds, being glad of the Boores death. To whose Cell I conueyed Alprinus : At whose request, I haue performed this which you see, and haue vndertaken to hazard my life, to discharge him of death, and to win the assured possession of your loue. Now I most humbly intreat you for his sake, to conceale what I am, that I be not knowne: and so both disappoint your selfe of his loue, and him of safetie. Onely deuise a meanes to excuse mee from this feast: which I trust you will doo for Alprinus sake, and then wee may haue time to studie for your further content. Lucidas loue, made her beleeue that all hee said was true, and therefore saide: Syr, I trust there is no cause why I should mistrust you: and therefore relying vppon the truth of that which you haue sad; I will tell my father you are wounded, and desire rather to goe to your Chamber, then to the feast, who I knowe will denie mee nothing. This said, she went to her father, and so preuailed with him, that he was contented shee should haue the tending of him: whome she tooke to a chamber, suffering none to come at him, but her maide, whome shee trusted: and well might trust for her fidelitie. Afterwardes Lucida came to Ornatus , to determine how shee might come to see Alprinus , being most carefull of his health: and amongst many other speeches, they concluded, that Ornatus the next morning should depart towardes the Forrest, to Alprinus , and that shee by some meanes would come thither the next day after, if hee would meete her, to giue her directions where to finde him, which hee promised to doo. According to this agreement, Ornatus very earlie the next morning, armed himselfe, and as Lucida had instructed him, tooke his leaue of his father, who little suspected he had beene any other then Alprinus , gaue his consent, and so Ornatus in Alprinus armour againe departed the Towne, being glad that hee was escaped from death, which he was sure to haue indured, if it had bin any waies knowne that he had slaine Alprinus . And being nowe alone by himselfe, hauing the wide world to trauell into, but neuer a friende to go too, voyd of feare; but not of care: hee studied whither to direct his iourney: sometimes his conscience accusing him of too much disloyall dealing towardes Lucida , in betraying her vertues by his dissimulation, in telling her Alprinus was liuing, when hee knewe it to the contrary. Then hee contrarilie, thought it was lawfull for him to dissemble with her, to saue his owne life, and though he had slaine Alprinus , he did it but in defence of his honour. Amongst at these, this cogitation seemed most to acquite him of dishonour, that fortune and the destenies had by that meanes ordeined him to escape. Whilest hee rode on in these deepe meditations, he met with an ancient hermit, who comming towards him said: Discurteous gentleman, how cammest thou by that armor? and yet I need not aske thee, for I know thou slewest the worthy gentleman Alprinus , which I beheld to my greefe. Father (quoth Ornatus ) if thou didst beholde the same, thou canst witnesse I did it against my will, and in mine owne defence: for whose death I am so sory as thy self, and would as willingly haue done any thing to preserue the same as any man liuing. Will you then (said the Hermite) doe this for him, vouchsafe to come and speake with him, who is in reasonable good estate in my Cell? I would to God (said Ornatus ) thy wordes were true: for if hee be liuing, it will reuiue my heart with ioy, that is almost vanquisht with care: desiring nothing more then to see him. Hee is liuing said the Hermit, and if you will goe, I will bring you to him presently. Ornatus being come to the Cell, accordingly found Alprinus very weake, by reason of his greeuous wound, to whom Ornatus declared al that happened betweene him & Lucida : which added no little comfort to Alprinus heart, that hee thought himselfe of sufficient strength to go and meete with her: and therefore told Ornatus he would goe and meete with her, and withall yeelded him so many thankes, as if by his meanes, his life had bin preserued. In the meane time they continued in the olde Hermittes Caue, Alprinus in great comfort, and Ornatus in no lesse care, for the absence of his deare Artesia , breaking foorth many a scalding sighe, and vttering many a sad and mournefull lamentation: sometimes vtterly dispairing of attaining her loue, and then againe by remembring her vertues, growing into some better confidence of her constancie. Yet most of all, fearing that Lenons loue to her, might eyther by perswasion of his death, force, affect of dignitie, or other meanes, winne her to consent to him, especially for that shee hadde no parentes to gouerne her, nor hee neuer a faithfull friende to counsaile her. The next day Alprinus and hee went out to meete Lucida , whome they met at the entrance into the Forrest, and after many kinde salutations past betwixt the two louers, they altogether went backe into the Towne, to Lucidaes Fathers house, who that morning was departed to a Hauen, about businesse of importance. Ornatus was most kindly vsed of them, remaining there vntill Alprinus had wedded Lucida : but then hee thought it high time for him to depart: And on a time finding Alprinus alone, who had showne sufficient tokens of his friendship, hee declared vnto him, the whole truth of his forepassed loue to Artesia , requesting his helpe, for his passage into Phrygia . Alprinus with great regard, attended the whole discourse, promising his vttermost assistance: which (quoth hee) none can effect so well as Lucida , whose father is a merchant, and sendeth for ships into sundrie Prouinces, who onely may pleasure you: which charge I will vndertake, and cause her to deale so effectually with him, that you shall attaine your desire. Ornatus continued in good hope, somewhat abandoning his former dispaire, whome for a time wee will leaue, attending the time that some of the ships should depart, to speake of Artesia his carefull Louer. How Lenon caused Artesia by violence to bee caried from Adellenaes house, to the greene Fortresse: of the miseries she indured there. How shee was rescued from thence by Allinus , and from him taken by Pyrates. And how Allinus accused by Lenon for her death, was imprisoned. After that Artesia by Adellenaes carefull tedance had somewhat recouered her health, Lenon began to visit her againe, beeing vnable to indure the heauie burthen of burning loue: thinking her sicknesse had proceeded from feare of Floretus , not for want of Ornatus company, finding an occasion, saluted her in this sorte. Most fairest Artesia , my heart is so firmely inthralled to your beautie, and my affections so admire your vertues, that I am constrained to vtter my minde, and to tell you, I loue your Beautie, Uertues, and other most rare perfections wherewith you are adorned. That I humblie sue to you for fauour, and prostrate my selfe your thrall, desiring to be inriched with those Iewels of inestimable price: which hauing once attained, I shall thinke I had more wealth in my possession, the all the world besides my selfe, doth conteine. Your vnkinde vnckles crueltie, you need not feare, nor other misfortune: neither haue you any parents to ouerrule you in making your choyse: then vouchsafe to accept my sute, and yeelde consent to my loue. My Lord, (replied Artesia ) I thanke you for your good will, but I know not how to accept of your loue, being yet so far from knowing what it is, that if I should but dreame thereof, my heart would be out of quiet: besides many cares continually attend the same, and my meane estate so farre vnworthy thereof, with innumerable other discontents and cares that I would make my selfe subiect vnto: that I had rather a thousand times remaine in the estate I am now in. Therefore, I intreate you to settle your loue elsewhere, more agreeable to your estate and fancie: for I shall thinke my selfe most fortunate, if I neuer fall into that labyrinth of disquiets: but will during my life, labour to keepe my selfe free from loues bands. Lenon would not take this for an answere: but with many other speeches continued his sute, whom Artesia still put out of hope: that he departed for that time exceedingly disconteted, leauing her no lesse disquieted in her thoughts how to auoid his loue. In this sort did he daily visite her, still growing more importunate, amongst many other, this conference past betwixt them: Artesia (quoth he) how long shall I sue, and be frustrated in my hopes, by your vnkindnesse? is your heart hardned against me? Or am I of so base conditions, that you cannot conceiue well of me? Or is it possible you beare so hatefull a conceit of loue as you make shewe for? then may I accuse mine eyes, that haue betrayed my sences, in making them your thrall: then may I thinke my woe began, when I first began to loue. O Artesia be not so cruel, as to punish me with this disdaine. My Lord (replied shee) I seeke not your disquiet: for at the first motion I tolde you my minde, which shall neuer alter, neither is my heart hardened against you more then others: for I am determined not to loue: then seeing you see my intent, it were a point of wisedome in you to shake off this fonde and foolish loue, which is but a toy, and an idle fancie, that is bred by vanitie: and doo not seeke to make loue growe without a roote, for in my heart it shall neuer take roote: but rather when it is rooted, I will pull out heart and all, but I will roote it out. Then (quoth he) you are led by obstinacie and not by reason, for that you are subiect to loue, you cannot denie: then why not me before another, considering my loue is more faithfull then any other? And I being most worthy, why should I not be first accepted? Artesia was wearie of his speeches, hauing her constant thoughts onely bent on Ornatus : therefore to rid him from her, she said; It is in vaine to vse many words, neither am I like to those that will at the first seeme coye, but afterwards yeelde: but I desire you to bee satisfied with that which I haue alreadie sayde, that I cannot loue. Faire Damosell, how can I be satisfied with that vnreasonable answere, when my life dependeth on your consent: which your deniall will finish: then giue mee leaue to say, I cannot bee so satisfied: but being extreamely refused, I must growe perforce to be as vnreasonable in my request. Consider you not what dignitie I might aduance you too, by making you my wife, consider you not the pleasures, ioyes, and aboundance of all contents you might enioy with me, and how faithfully I loue you, and with what humilitie I seeke your loue, and yet notwithstanding you remaine obdurate? My power is great, that whereas I sue, I might commaunde, and by authoritie compell you to consent: then bee not so ouerconceited, as so obstinatelie to reiect your good. And think, that if my loue were not constant, I might vse extreames, which would soone alter your minde. Suppose (replied Artesia ) I were so peeuish as you terme me, yet being borne free, I am not to be made bond by constraint: and were you the greatest king in the world, you could not rule the heart, though you might by iniustice punish the bodie: for it is not kingdomes, wealth, nor crueltie, can turne hatred to loue: but it may sooner turne loue into hatred. But by your speeches I may partly know your thought, and the lippes vtter what the heart intendeth: doo with mee what you will, I cannot loue: neither will I loue you, were you Monarche of all the world. Leanon was so much greeued and vexed at her speeches, that hee was readie to tare his hayre, his loues extremitie making him rather madde then sober, that presently hee departed, saying no more but this: Farewell hard-harted Artesia . Shee was glad hee was gone, presently telling Adellena all that had past betwixt them: and how peremptorilie shee had answered his importunate sute, telling Adellena , that since Ornatus was for her sake bannished, shee would neuer loue any but him, and preserue her life in hope to see him once againe: but the first knowledge of his death, should bee the latest date of her life: both shee and Adellena thinking that Lenon would neuer returne to prosecute his loue. But hee beeing come to the Pallace, betooke himselfe to his chamber, raging more like a mad man, then a passionate louer, sometimes swearing, cursing, and stamping, yeelding so much to that mad fancie, that in the end, he vowed to obtaine Artesiaes loue, though he hazarded his life, honour, and good name: that ranging in this sort, vp and downe his Chamber, hee espied an olde Gentlewoman, named Flera , going by his windowe, whom hee called vnto him, and thus saide. Flera , because I haue assured confidence in thy fidelitie; and purpose to reward thee liberally, I craue thy counsaile, and with it thy consent, to be faithfull in concealing my secretes, and very diligent in dooing my commaunde. The olde hagge making an euill fashioned lowe curtesie, sayd: My deare sonne Lenon , be it to do you good, I will hazard my life, and rather bee torne into a thousande peeces, then reueale what you shall vouchsafe to tell me. Then (quoth hee) counsaile me which way I should begin to win a faire Damosels loue. Marrie my Lord (quoth she) giue her knowledge thereof: and then with faire speeches woe her: if that will not preuaile, giue her gold, and there is no doubt, that faire bayte will catch her. No no (quoth he) these are of no force, I haue made my loue knowne to her, by humble sutes, submisse behauiours, and by all kinde of curteous meanes, intreated her consent: yet for all that, she remaineth obstinate: she is rich, and therefore gold with her is of no force: she is fayre, vertuous, noble, and chaste: then what engine hast thou to vndermine that chastitie? Meanes enough (quoth she) peraduenture shee is ruled by others counsell, which may preuaile more then your sute: but might I haue accesse vnto her, I would not doubt but to alter her minde: for being faire, young and rich, she cannot chuse but delight to be praysed: subiect to loue, and therefore yeeld to desire. Doest thou thinke (quoth he) thou couldest winne her, wert thou her keeper? I warrant you, (quoth she) I would doe it. Then shalt thou bee her keeper, see that thou beest to morrowe at my fathers Castle in the greene forrest, where to morrow by night this Damosell shall be, whose name is Artesia , daughter to Arbastus lately dead: vse her kindly, let her want nothing: nor be not in any wise knowne that thou knowest mee: nor that the Castle belongeth to my Father: nor speake not of loue in any case: vse her in this sort vntill I speake with thee, for thou onely shalt haue her custodie. Flera being gone about her businesse, he foud out two of his trustiest seruants: to whom he imparted both his mind and intent: willing them the next morning with speed to go to Adellenaes house, and either by force or faire meanes to take Artesia from thence, and carrie her vnto the greene fortresse in the green Forrest, where they should find Flera , to to whose custodie they should commit Artesia : and themselues should remaine there to prouide all things necessarie vntill his comming. Early the next morning, the seruants rode to Adellenas house, whereinto they boldly entred, and comming to Artesia , first spake her faire, but afterwards tolde her shee must goe with them, if not willingly, by constraint. Artesia then began to burst into teares, weeping and lamenting exceedingly, vpon her knees intreating them, not to offer by violence to carry her from thence, but if they would needes, that they would take Adellena with them: but all was in vaine, for they constrained her to mount vp beehinde one of them, and away they rode in great haste: this heauie parting was so sodaine, that Artesia coulde not a bid Adellena adue, but with teares, nor Adellena speake a word for griefe, their sences being so farre confounded with care, that their harts were readie to burst therewith. Artesia thought this was Lenons dooing, and therefore sorrowed the more: not that hee vsed her vnkindly, but that hee loued her, not fearing his crueltie, but his lust: not regarding what crueltie hee could vse by hatred, but fearing his loue would make him seeke her dishonour. Beeing come to the Fortresse, and committed to the custodie of Flera , the olde woman began to speake her faire, and vse her kindly, yet her verie wordes and countenaunce bewraying her guiltie conscience, to whome Artesia would not speake a word, least thereby shee should giue her occasion to prate: meate shee brought vnto her, but shee refused to taste thereof, and when shee came to her Chamber, shee laie on the rushes, refusing the bedde, tormenting her heart with care, vexing her head with thought, and busying her sences, or meditating to what issue this vsage would sorte, sometimes calling on Ornatus name for comfort, sometimes accusing Lenon of barbarous crueltie, and cursing her crooked destenies: vttering such plaints as would haue turned tyrants to ruth, weeping her eyes drie, and her garments wet, tearing her haire, and tormenting euery one of her sences with vexation, refusing sleepe, rest, ease, or quiet. The next day Lenon came thither, asking Flera howe shee fared, who tolde him that she would not speake, eate nor sleepe, but fared like one madde and sencelesse. But let her alone quoth shee, and you shall see this fitte will soone bee ouer, the extremitie whereof, being once past, I will vse my skill to trie her. Lenon giuing order to haue all thinges necessarie prouided, departed. Dinner time being come, and meate set before Artesia , she refused to eate: likewise supper time being come, she determined to do the like. Which Flera perceiuing, said: Fayre gentlewoman, to behold your outward appearence, would make one iudge your minde harbored many hidden vertues, but I comparing your actions with your apparant shewe, suppose that you are either mad or carelesse: this behauiour, to seeme dumbe, to refuse sustenaunce, and to refraine from sleepe, are instances of follie, not of wisedome. What if you speake, what if you did eate, or take rest, should you be euer the worse? or refraining, can that doo you good, or banish griefe, and not rather make your estate worse? doo you thinke to preuent any thing by dooing your selfe harme? no fonde Childe, eate thy meate, and preserue thy life: for liuing thou maiest attaine thy desires, but dying thou art past hope. With that she departed smiling. Artesia hearing her speeches, beganne to consider indeede what follie it was to refuse her meate, and for feare to shorten her selfe by distemperating her selfe, which might bee the meanes to further Lenons intent, whome shee knewe would seeke her life, if hee coulde not winne her loue, shee presently left off suche desperate behauiour, and with well wayed consideration, attended the euent of the worst misfortune, that from that time shee both eate her meate, and did all that shee coulde to comfort her selfe, still liuing in good hope of Ornatus returne. Some fewe dayes after, Lenon came to the Fortresse againe, enquiring of Flera howe Artesia fared. Well quoth shee, but you willed mee to conceale that it was your dooing to bring her hither, and some bodie else hath tolde her thereof, for shee knoweth the truth as well as your selfe or I, and therefore I would wishe you to visite her, and after that let me alone to perswade her. Lenon was ruled by the olde woman, and came where Artesia was saluting her, but shee disdaining either to looke on him, or heare him speake, withdrewe her selfe from his presence. Wherewith hee departed, willing Flera to doo that which shee had vndertaken. And Flera finding her as shee thought in a fit moode, beganne to commune with her of many thinges, amongst which loue was one. Artesia a while heard her, but in the end, perceiuing her drift; cut her off with these speeches. Olde iniquitie, I knowe whereto thy talke tendeth: thinkest thou I will euer harbour a thought of Lenon , that hath vsed mee thus dishonourably? no rather will I rent my wofull heart from out my brest before his face: neither needest thou tell mee that hee hath intreated thee to speake for him, for I knowe too well both his and thy intent, which shall nothing preuaile, but harden my heart against him. Therefore doe not speake to me, for I will not heare thee, nor answere thee: but hate him, thee, and thy counsell, and remaine so constant in despising him, that a thousand deathes shall not alter mee. Is it loue that hath made him with violence carrie me from my friendes, make me a prisoner, and commit me to the custodie of such a hellishe hagge as thy selfe? If that be his loue, let him turne it to hatred, and neuer trouble me, but with hating me: for in so dooing, he shall better please me. Often Flera would haue replied, but Artesia would not suffer her, that shee beganne to waxe angrie, and in the ende to plaine furie, that running to Artesia , she caught holde on her, and beganne to teare her garments from her bodie, and withall, caught sometimes such firme holde on her pure fleshe with her nayles, that the blood followed: that Artesia began to crie and shrike for feare, and smart. When the olde Beldame had executed some part of her intended reuenge and crueltie vpon her in this sort, shee saide: Proud girle, thinkest thou to beare it away with out-facing mee? No, do not thinke I will leaue thee thus, but thou shalt repent that euer thou cammest heere, and before I goe, I will haue my minde of thee: then puld shee out a knife, and catching holde on her, swore, that vnlesse she would promise to vse Lenon kindly, when hee next came, shee would cut her throate: which draue Artesia into that feare, that shee began to intreate her and speake faire, promising to condiscend to any thing that agreed to her honour. Stand not vpon those nice tearmes with mee quoth Flera , but here sweare to yeeld to loue him, for so thou maiest delay him, and frustrate his hopefull expectation, whom thou art not woorthie to touch, much lesse to beare such a presuming minde as thou doest, in scorne of his loue. Therefore yeelde to that which I request or stand to my mercy. Canst thou bestowe thy loue better then on so honourable a Prince? Canst thou attaine more dignitie, reape more content, or enioy more quiet with any then with him? Then do not denie mee, for I purpose not to be denied. Artesia trembling for feare, made this answere onely to satisfie her, I am contented to bee ruled by Lenon , whose meaning I knowe is honourable. Therefore I pray do not offer mee this outrage, but suffer me to liue in quiet vntil his comming. If this will not satisfie you, then do the worst you can: for death is more welcome to mee then life in these extremities. Well quoth shee, I will trie you, but if you dally, beware what will ensue, for I am resolued what to doo. Artesia was glad shee had satisfied her, though it were with vttering words which shee neuer intended to performe. Adellena seeing how suddenly Artesia was taken from her, caused one of her seruants priuilie to followe them to the greene Fortresse, who returning, tolde her what he had seene. Then Adellena began to studie how to release her from thence, and with all haste rode to Allinus house, where being arriued, she declared al that shee knew as concerning Ornatus , and how Lenon had carried Artesia by violence into the greene Fortresse. Allinus being glad to heare that Ornatus was aliue, promised to redeeme Artesia from Lenons custodie, and that to effect, the next euening caused his men to mount themselues, and himselfe with some fiue of them, disguised from being knowne, came to the greene Fortresse, and one of them knocking whilest the other hid themselues, the seruants little suspecting any such ambush or intent, opened the gate, when presently they rushed in, and soone found out Artesia , whome Allinus told who he was, and to what intent hee came: Artesia was glad thereof, and willingly yeelded to go with him, but the olde woman made such an outcrie, that all the place rung thereof: one of Allinus seruants seeing shee would not bee pacified, drew his sword and thrust it through her bodie, and so with a yelling crie, shee gaue vp the ghoast. Then presently Allinus departed with her, intending to carry her to his owne house, to keepe her there vnknowne, vntil he could heare of Ornatus . And remembring that the two seruants were fled, and would no doubt certifie Lenon what was done, would not go backe the same way hee came, though the readiest, for then hee thought hee should meete them, but went a more secret way, thinking by that means to passe vnseene, and entring into the plaines where cattell fed, Allinus espied a company comming towards them, whom hee presently suspected to be Lenon , which in reason he could not thinke, but that feare perswaded him thereto? the company likewise espying them (who were certaine Pyrates that were wandred from their shippes to steale cattel) wondred what they should be that were so late abroad, and being readie to any mischiefe, set vpon Allinus and his company, who thinking it had bene Lenon would by no meanes yeeld, nor speake, fearing he should descrie them, but resisted the Pyrates, who being vsed to many such meetings, soone slew two of Allinus seruants and had giuen himselfe many greeuous wounds, enforcing him to yeeld. Who taking from him all that was good, constraining Artesia to go with them, and hasted to their ships, when hauing conueyed her aboord, to preuent the worst, hoysed saile, and launched into the deepe. Then was Allinus left in most miserable estate, with all speed hasting to his house. Lenons seruants likewise were by that time it was mindnight gotten to the Pallace, and called their Lord out of his bedde, to certifie him what was happened, who presently mounted himselfe, and with a sufficient company rode to the Fortresse, and entring, found Flera slaine, and all else fled, then began he to muse who should do that deed, and what they should be that had carried away Artesia : by this time it was day-light, and Lenon rested in exceeding vexation to be dispossest of his bewtifull Loue, yet he commanded his men to poste by companies seueral waies, if it were possible to finde those that had done that deed: whilst he himselfe remained there bewailing that misfortune, his seruants had not rode far: but (by the light of the day, which discouereth things done in darknesse) they found Allinus two seruants, whose dead bodies they carried back to the fortresse. Lenon seeing them, presently assured himselfe that Allinus was a partie in this action, and that hee had taken away Artesia to seeke her death To preuent wihch mischiefe (as he thought then or neuer to be done) hee presently rode home to the Court, and humbly vpon his knee, intreated his father to graunt him licence with a sufficient power to rescue Artesia from Allinus , who intended to murder her, declaring how he himselfe found her in Adellenas house, and how that he had placed her in the greene Fortresse, to defend her from Allinus and others crueltie, being left fatherlesse: and how that night Allinus had taken her from thence by treason, and intended no lesse then her ruine. The king hearing his sonnes speeches graunted his request. Then presently diuers to the number of three hundreth men, with as much speed as could possibly be, armed themselues, and in haste with Lenon , went to Allinus Castle, into which they violently and vnawares to any within entred. Lenon presently laide hands on Allinus , whom he found sore wounded asking him for Artesia , who thinking some of his seruants had before bewrayed what he had done, presently confest the truth of all, both of his intent, and howe Artesia was rescued from him, but by whom hee knewe not, and howe at that time two of his seruants were slaine. Lenon giuing no credit to his speeches, neuer left till hee had searched the whole Castle throughout, but not finding her, accused Allinus that he had murthered her, commaunding his men to binde him, and carry him as a Traytor to the Court. Who being come before the King, confest the truth as before he had done, vtterly denying that hee neuer sought Artesias death, but her safetie: but yet notwithstanding the King was so ouerruled by Lenons accusations and perswasions, that he committed him to prison, his goods and lands were seized vppon as a Traytor, his Ladie wife turned out of doores in poore array, and al crueltie and outrage committed against his seruantes and kinsfolkes, and commaundement giuen, that none should succour them. Allinus being in prison laden with yrons, and hardly vsed, yet endured that affliction patiently, but hearing of his Ladies calamitie, and how she was vniustly constrained to beg, that all her life long had bene tenderly brought vp, thought those sorrowes woulde soone bring her to an ende, and entered into many bitter lamentations for her and his owne misfortune which were too tedious to recite, his seruants were constrained to disguise themselues, and trauell into farther places of the Countrey to liue vnknowne, otherwise none would haue entertained them. His Ladie was compelled to seeke out kinswomen of hers, that liued in the countrey, of whom she was entertained, and there liued a poore life, far differing from her former life, which she tooke most patiently. And thus was Allinus house defaced, his goods and lands seized vpon, himself imprisoned, his wife in poore estate his seruants driuen to wander from place to place, readie often to perish for want of succour and all his dignitie turnd to miserie, onely by Lenons malice: who had no ground for those accusations he vsed against him, but onely of a vaine suppose, and mad franticke affection that ouerruled his heart, which so much preuailed with him, that he sought by all meanes he could, his death. How Ornatus gatte shipping into Phrygia . Howe Allinas was set al libertie: and how the Pyrates cast lottes who should possesse Artesia . and Lucida , in great griefe, for want of meanes to depart into Phrygia , to see what was become of his deare Loue Artesia : but being a long time frustrated by reason none of the ships that were at sea came home, he began to dispaire, thinking that Artesia supposing him to be dead by reason of his long absence, would now marry Lenon , which griefe, and many other doubtfull thoughts opprest his heart with such passion, that he began to waxe sicke, and afterwards fel into an exceeding feuer, which held him for the space of three moneths in great extremitie, which surely had abridged his dayes: had hee not bene most carefully nourisht by Lucida , who had an especiall care of his good. During which time of his sicknesse, certaine ships of Phrygia arriued on the coast of Natolia , some fourteene miles distant from the Towne where Ornatus was, of which he had intelligence by certaine Factors belonging to Lucidas Father, which newes reuiued his spirits with ioy, before drouping with care, that within few dayes he recouered his former health, which greatly reioyced Alprinus and Lucida , whose hearts were linked vnto him, in hands of vnseparable friendship: who likewise dealt so effectually for him, that they attained warrant for his passage, and furnished him with all kinde of necessaries, and sufficient store of gold to beare his charges. Lucida likewise intreating her father to agree with the Phrygian Marchants for his conuoy, for that himselfe would not be knowne, disguising himselfe into the habit of a Pilgrims, which kinde of people, might without disturbance passe vnexamined, and without molestation. And the time of his departure being come, he tooke his leaue of Lucida . Who tooke his departure with such exceeding sorrow, that the abundance of her flowing teares stopt the passage of her speech. Alprinus likewise with many curtesies bad him farewell, and wished his prosperous successe. Thus departed he the confines of Natolia , where he was in so short space so well beloued, and so kindly vsed, that had not his, loue to Artesia , and hope to finde her in safety constrained him, he could haue bene contented to haue spent the terme of his life in that place. The Merchants of Phrygia had not sailed many dayes, but they arriued in a hauen some ten myles distant from the Court, whither Ornatus determined to trauell, and hauing taken his leaue of the Marriners, and paide them their due, furnished with all things fit for his disguise, he tooke his iourney, and the first night lodged at a village neare adioyning to his fathers Castle, the custome of which place he well knewe before, and therefore framed his behauiour accordingly. And beeing set at supper amongst such guests as lodged in that house with him, the Hosts named Mylo , suddenly sight, which one of them noting, demanded what inward griefe draue him thereto. Marry sir quoth he, if you haue not alreadie heard the newes, I will tell you so much as I knowe, which I would I had neuer knowne. Within fewe dayes there dwelt an auncient Knight heereby named Allinus , exceedingly well beloued of all men, who is lately fallen into great miserie, the occasion whereof was this, then did hee declare the maner of all that had happened vnto Allinus , how Artesia was taken from him, but by whom no man knowe, himselfe in prison, his goods confiscated, and his wife & seruants turned out of doores, with commaund that none should succour them. Ornatus heart was so pincht with this newes, that hee was readie to fall vnder the Table, which olde Mylo and the rest noted, perceiuing such a chaunge of countenance in him, that they all denied him to be exceedingly sicke: but hee fearing to discouer himselfe, told them it was but an ordinarie course with him, to be so troubled: but being vnable to mittigate that passion, hee rose from the table, and gat to his chamber, where being alone, he began to meditate the depth of these mischances, imputing the originall thereof to proceed from himselfe. That he entred into these bitter plaintes. My misfortunes are without compare, and I more miserable then any wretch liuing: By my euill destenies, Artesia was first left in miserie, afterwards imprisoned, and now surprised by those that will intend her ruine, or dishonor. My father imprisoned, my mother bannished: all his landes, liuings, seruants, and friends, taken from him, and he subiect to Lenons mercie, that is mercilesse, cruell, deceitfull, and malitious. Onelie by my follie, are these mischances befallen. Can there then be any more wretched then my selfe? hath not my father cause to wish that hee had neuer begotten mee, and my mother that shee had neuer borne me? Hath not Artesia cause to accuse me, hate me, and forsake me? When for my sake, by my follie, and want of wisedome, she is brought to so many miseries? What shall I doo? or what remedie shall I seeke, when all things is past recure? Whome may I blame, but my selfe? Is there any that is interressed in the cause of these woes, but my selfe? Lenon, Lenon , as well as my selfe, hath procured these euils: his affection to Artesia , hath caused my banishmet, my parents wo, and her losse. To trauell in her search, and leaue my father in prison, the one would be in vaine, when I knowe not whither shee is conueied, and the other dangerous to his safetie: for Lenon no doubt of malice will seeke his death. In these and suche like plaints hee spent most part of that night. Earlie the next morning comming out of his Chamber, hee heard a great tumult in that Uillage: the occasion whereof, was this: Such as were Tenaunts and friendes to Allinus , hearing of his vniust imprisonment, and with what crueltie Lenon sought his ouerthrow, assembled themselues togither, with purpose to intreat the King for his release: that in the end there was three hundred of them assembled. The common people, and such as were idle persons, and readie to any attempt, misconceiuing their intent, and bearing a minde desirous of libertie, which they thought they were restrained from, by certain strickt lawes the King had made, gathered vnto them, that contrarie to theyr expectation, there was a multitude: the intent of whose assemblie, being demanded, they answered, that they meant to redeeme Allinus : amongst whom, Ornatus in his disguise, thrust himselfe, vsing many forcible perswasions to vrge them forwardes to that attempt. That they were readie to runne confusedlie to the Court, not regarding daunger, nor the displeasure of the King. One of Allinus friends named Thrasus , standing vppe amongst the rest, craued audience, to whom they all listned, whilest he said. I perceiue your intent is to release Allinus , wherein you shall shewe your loue to him, and doo a deede worthie to be eternized, for that hee hath not at all deserued to haue such iniustice ministred vnto him: therefore be wise in this attempt, and first know against whom you beare armes: that is, against your lawfull King, who may punish this fact with death: for that wee vndertake to breake those lawes which he hath ordained. But followe my counsell, and I will sette you downe a course, whereby you shall attaine your desire, and bee voyde of any such daunger, which is this. First lette vs all repaire to the Court, and humblie intreate the King for his release, if hee will not graunt that, then that hee woulde haue his cause tryed by the rest of the Peeres of the land: Which if hee also denye, then may wee with good cause venture our liues in his rescue: The multitude hearing Trasus , in signe of consent, all cryed, Trasus, Trasus , shall be our Captaine. Then presently euerie one with such furniture as they had, hasted to the Court, and comming togither, would not seeme to enter by force, but with a full consent yeelded to Thrasus directions. Who desired one of the guard to certifie his Maiestie that there were a number of his subiects gathered togither, with no intent of euill, but onely humbly to craue a boone at his highnesse hand. The King being certified hereof, was much troubled in his minde what the thing shoulde bee they would demaund, and being perswaded by Lenon , would not himselfe come out, but sent one of his Knights to demaund what was there request. Thrasus declared vnto him the cause of their comming, and what they demaunded. Which when the King vnderstood, beeing exceedingly inraged at their boldnesse, bad the knight make them this aunswere, that he was not by his subiects to be controlled, and therefore denied to performe the least at their demaund: commaunding them presently to depart euery man to their seuerall place, least hee punished their presumption with death. The messenger had not scarce ended his wordes, but presently the vnruly multitude began to rush in at the Court gates, some carelesly ruinating whatsoeuer came next hand, some breaking downe windowes, some assayling such as resisted them, and euery one bent to doo mischiefe. The King fearing the peoples vnruly rebellion, would turne to some greater mischiefe then coulde suddeinly bee preuented, and might also indaunger his person, not knowing who had instigated them thereto, with the Queene and Lenon fled. Which when Thrasus knew, calling to the multitude, hee willed them in any wise not to destroy the Kings house, nor attempt any thing more to displease his Maiestie, for that the King was departed, and he had Allinus at libertie. But notwithstanding some bent onely to inrich themselues, spoyled the Kings treasure, and vtterly defaced the house: by which time the night drew nigh, and euery one began to withdraw themselues. Allinus seeing what exceeding mischiefe this attempt had bred, which was done contrary to his thought, and without his consent, yet thought it best not to trust to the Kings mercie, though hee were neuer so innocent, for notwithstanding that he would suppose it was done by his procurement, therefore (after Thrasus had willed the vnruly multitude to depart as secretly as they could, euery one to his house, to preuent further daunger & saue their liues, by keeping themselues vnknowne) hee and Thrasus that night, without delay disguised themselues, and fled towards the coast to get shipping for Armenia , whither they intended to trauell. Ornatus was by and beheld all this, glad of his fathers escape, not purposing at all to discouer himselfe, vntill he had found Artesia , in whose search he meant presently to trauell: but such confused thoughts, whither to direct his steps, did so ouerwhelme his conceits, that hee rested like one metamorphosed, not knowing whether he would seeke her by sea or by land. By sea he thought his labours would be in vaine, and if he should go to finde her by land, he knew not whether she might be at sea, and so conueyed into forraine Countries. At last remembring he had heard Mylo say she was rescued from Allinus in the desert where his Cattel fed, hee determined to trauell thither, though he had little hope to finde her there. And being come thither, sometimes bewayling her absence, accusing his hard fortune, breathing foorth bitter sighs in remembrance of her losse, and renuing the remembrance of their loue, he spent some three daies in that place, vttering those plaintes to the trees and birdes, for otherwise there was none to heare him. Where for a while we will leaue him. The Pyrates hauing as is before saide, taken Artesia from Allinus , and with her such wealth as they could find about them, hauing withall furnished themselues with the spoyle of such Cattell as fed in those places, returned to their Ship, and with haste hoysted saile, the night being nowe past. One that was chiefe amongst the rest, named Luprates , went downe to viewe Artesia , hauing as yet not seene her beawtie by reason of the night, and now comming neare her, and beholding her diuine forme, his mind was presently rauisht with that sight, and he thought that none but himselfe should enioy her, which tooke such efficacie, that whereas before he intended nothing but her dishonour, his minde was now altered, and he intended to vse her in most reuerent and decent sort, and not by crueltie, but curtesie, to winne her loue. But beholding her teares, and exceeding lamentation, and how impatientlie she indured the extremities shee was driuen vnto, comming towards her with a most submisse gesture, friendlie countenaunce, and gentle speech, hee said. Faire Lady, be not any thing disquieted that you are made captiue to suche as delight inspoyle, for though our mindes are otherwise bent to all inciuilitie, yet to your selfe shall no wrong be offered, such vertue hath bewtie imprinted in my heart, and whereas heretofore without mercie, both I and the rest of my consorts haue not regarded the plaints, distresse, nor what wrong wee haue offered either to Ladie or damosell, yet towards your self is my heart altered, and my meaning honestly bet: that I assure you not onely of quiet, and to bee voyd of all wrong by vs to be done, but also, wherein soeuer I may work your wil, quiet, ease, or desire, I wil most willingly imploy my vttermost indeuours. Then I beseech you mittigate these cares, bannish this sorrow, & drie vp your teares: for you haue no cause of care, nor occasion of sorrow: but rather to say, this vertue resteth in me, to alter rude and barbarous mindes, to ciuill & vertuous behauior: Artesia looking earnestly vpon him, being indued with an exceeding wit, and thinking it best to speak him faire that vsed her so kindly, said. Sir, I know not how to mitigate my grief, when it increaseth: or how can I be voyd of care, vnlesse I should grow altogither carelesse, being only subiect to woe, & none so vnfortunate as my selfe, hauing indured so many afflictions & crosses in all respects, that I know not how to assure my selfe of the least quiet? Then giue me leaue to continue my endlesse plaints, & doo not blame me of impatiencie, nor think I suspect your speeches, or distrust your fidelitie, if in some sort I continue my sorrowes: for I haue so long continued in them, as I can better away with the then mirth: for that to me is a stranger. Yet notwithstanding my hart will harbour some quiet, if by your curtesie I may rest in securitie, and bee sheltred from wrong. By this time they were arriued at their place of harbour, which was betwixt the hollow of two Rocks, or rather Rockie Ilands, where their ship lay safe from weather, and so farre vnder their shadowe, that it could not bee seene. Themselues conueying such wealth as they from time to time got into hollow Caues, of great largenesse, where was al things necessarie, and the rest of Luprates fellowes called him vp. When hauing fastned their ship, Luprates brought Artesia into the Caue, who beholding the same, was surprised with an exceeding discomfort, of euer getting from thence. Some of the ruder sort liking Artesia , began their rude behauiour towards her, but Lupratus stepping vnto them, vttered these speeches. My maisters, thus long haue I liued your Captaine in this place, with care respecting your good as much as mine owne, and taking but an equall share with you, of such prizes as wee haue taken, and rather the least part, now onely in respect of my faith and fidelitie, I request to haue this Damosell as my prize, the rest of the wealth take you. In dooing which, you shall binde mee vnto you for euer. One of the rest liking Artesiaes bewtie as well as hee, and of a more rude minde, disdaining that hee alone should haue her possession, said. Captaine, all which you say wee confesse to be true: neither hath our care bin any way lesse the yours: therfore, there is no reason why you shuld claime any peculier priuiledge aboue any of vs: besides, you knowe wee made a law, and bound our selues to performe the same by oath, which was, that none should possesse any thing without the general consent of vs all. Then performe those conditions, and let her belong to vs all, or to the chiefest of vs, & in so doing, neither of vs shall sustaine wrong: thus began they to contend about Artesia , euery one desirous to possesse her, & yet neither willing any shuld haue her but himselfe, that they were likely to mutinie and fal out, till at the last they cocluded to cast lots & she fel to Luprates share, that was the most worthy of that priiuledge, for that hee bare the most vertuous mind. Thus for a time this strife was ended, and Artesia was by Luprates kindly vsed for many daies: in the end their victuals began to waste, & they thought it high time to seek for more, yt they determined to fetch in some as before they had done. But then began Luprates to take care in whose custodie to leaue Artesia , least in his absence they should do her wrong. Amongst the rest he chose out one whome he thought fittest, and to him hee committed her, by whose meanes Artesia rested voyd of disturbance, though not void of exceeding care that continually tormented her, fearing neuer to see Ornatus againe, nor to be released from that place of bondage. How Ornatus found Artesia , and preserued her life: and how shee was againe taken from him by Lenon , and what afterwards befell. steale Cattell, and by chaunce lighted on the place where Ornatus haunted, being directed to him by the sound of his lamentations: Luprates demaunded what he was, I am (quoth he) a most miserable forlorne creature, by misfortune drawne to all extremitie. Then quoth hee, art thou not for our company: and with that they departed, leauing him there. Ornatus heart began presently to misdoubt that they were the verie same that had taken Artesia from Allinus which made him presently studie how to haue them apprehended: remembring that he had heard many complaine that their cattell were often stolne, hee supposed verily them to be the theeues, that with all the haste hee could, he ranne to the next village and raised the Townes-men, telling them what he had seene, who presently issued out, and with such weapons as came next to hand followed the Pyrates, and soone found them, setting vppon them, tooke two of them, and the rest, some sore wounded  & hurt, fled to their Shippe, and with all the haste they coulde gat to their harbour. Early the next morning, the Inhabitants conueied the Pyrates to the Court, who being come before the King, confest the manner of theyr life, and where they liued. Then Lenon presentlie supposed, that they were the very same that had taken Artesia from Allinus , and demaunding the same of them, they tolde him that there was suth a Damosell in their Caue, and that shee tolde them her name was Artesia . Then Lenon without delay strogly accompanied, rode to the next Hauen, and there gat shipping by the Pyrates directions, to finde out their fort. Ornatus likewise, after he had raised the people, secretlie followed the Pyrates vnto the place, where their ship lay, and amongst the rest entred the same: who by reason of their haste & exceeding feare, regarded him not, who thrust himselfe into that daunger, onely to see if Artesia were in their eustodie, not reking how his life might be indangered thereby, but the Pyrates by Luprates directions hasted to the fort, and from thence tooke Artesia into their shippe, not daring to stay there, for that they knew some of their fellowes were taken, who might by compulsion be constrained to reueale the place of their abode. Ornatus no sooner espied Artesia , but he knew her, and his heart leapt within him for ioy to see that happie sighte, but he durst not speake to her, nor scarce settle his eyes to behode her, for feare of suspect, for that Luprates meruailed how hee came amongst them: demaunding what hee was, and what hee made thrre? I am (quoth hee) a poore Pilgrim, that against my will was by some of this company constrayned to come aboord. Luprates beleeuing he said true, made no farther question, but with hast sayled from Phrygia , conueying Artesia into his Cabin, vsing many speeches to comfort her. They hadde not sayled many houres, but a contrary winde began to arise, and the Heauens were darkened with thicke Cloudes, and such a mightie tempest arose, that the shippe was by violence driuen backe, theyr maine Maste broken and throwne ouerboorde, and all in daunger of destruction, had not the land beene neare, for the shippe driuen by violence of the Sea, ranne a grounde, and there splitte in sunder, and the Pyrates with great hazard escaped drowning: none of them nor Luprates once regarding Artesia , but Ornatus seeing in what perill she was, caught holde on her, and getting on to a planke, being withall somewhat skilfull to swimme, with much a doo gatte on to the firme lande, and preserued her from a miserable death by drowning. He was no sooner past daunger, but Luprates would haue taken her from him, but Ornatus seeing none but himselfe there, & all the rest fled for feare, tolde him since he had forsaken her in extremitie, he was not worthie of her, and therefore should not haue her. Uillane (quoth Luprates ) yeelde her me with quiet, or else thy life shall not deteine her. With that Ornatus caught holde on a boord which he cleft in sunder with his foote, and with the same gaue Luprates so suddaine and deadly a wounde, that the braines fell about the place, and he died. By this time the storme was quiet ouerpast, and Ornatus seeing his deare Loue verie weake with feare and distemperature, by the arme led her vnto a mossie banke, where the Sunnes bright beames had full force to drie her garments dropping with wet. Artesia seeing howe tenderly this straunger regarded her, and with what paine he had preserued her, when she was of all but him forsaken, being willing to shewe that she was gratefull, said. Sir the paines you haue taken, and friendship you haue showne to me, deserue more thankes and recompence then I am able to giue: and therefore I desire you to thinke, that if I were able I would requite the same: but my misfortunes are so exceeding, that they withholde me from dooing that I would: onely thankes is the small requitall I can yeelde in token of a gratefull minde: being by your meanes at more quiet then many dayes I haue bene, though more disquietted then you would iudge: but now I relie vpon your vertues, with hope thereby to be preserued, and not driuen to further miserie. Faire Ladie, (quoth Ornatus ) my life shall be spent in your defence, neyther will I parte from you vntill I haue brought you to the place which you desire, requesting you to make no doubt of my loyaltie. I suppose your name is Artesia , because (quoth hee) in my trauels I haue met a Gentleman of this countrey named Ornatus , of whome I learned the truth of many of your misfortunes: who I assure you is in good health. O blessed newes (quoth shee,) then will I hope once againe to see my deare Ornatus , whose absence hath beene my onely cause of woe. She had scarce ended those words, but Ornatus espied a ship euen then come a shore, where theirs was cast away, most of the men landed, which was the shippe wherein Lenon was, who beheld the other shippe cast away, and the storme being ceased arriued there. From whome Ornatus knewe not howe to hide himselfe: and Artesia not so much as thinking Lenon had bene in it, but that it was some ship that likewise by the storme was driuen to lande there. Presently the men beganne to spredde themselues euery way, and some of them soone espied Artesia , giuing Lenon knowledge thereof, who immediately came towardes her, most kindely saluting her, but shee beeing exceedingly dismayed with his sight, whome shee most mortally hated, for verie griefe burst into teares, that in aboundance gusht from her eyes. Lenon maruelling thereat, (and little thinking howe much shee hated him, and how vnwelcome he was) rather expecting thankes for his paines then reproofe, said; My deare Artesia , bee not now discomforted, since there is no further cause of care, I haue most diligently laboured to release you from griefe euer since Allinus by treason conueyed you from my custodie: taking your absence in great heauinesse, for that it pinched my heart to thinke you shoulde fall into suche distresse: but nowe that all those misfortunes are past, I beseech you goe with mee to the Court, where I will labour to procure your content. Artesias heart was vexed to heare his speeches, that she made him this answere. Most discurteous Lenon , none but your selfe are cause of my woe, whose sight more tormenteth mee, then all the afflictions I euer endured: Allinus carried me indeed from the greene Fortresse, not by treason, but to shelter me from dishonour, which you did intend, else would you not haue suffered mee to endure such miseries as I did by my hellish keeper. Thinke you I haue cause either to thinke you intend my good, or take any comfort by your presence, when you onely disquiet me, not suffering me to enioy my libertie, but would perforce constrain me to that I cannot like. Had you left me in Adellenas house, then had I not fallen into such miseries as since that I haue endured, nor Allinus for his vertue haue bene brought to pouertie, that being before my professed enemie, seeing my miserie, it so mollified his heart, that he hath pittied me, and sought my libertie, and onely by crueltie, not by iustice, haue you sought his ouerthrow. Then I beseech you leaue me here, for I had rather indure the hazard of my misfortune, then liue to be tormented with your Importunacie. Lenon was so amazed to heare her vnkind reply, litle thinking he had bene so much out of her fauour, that he could not tel what to say: sometimes thinking to leaue her there, and vtterly to forsake her, but that thought was soone ouercome by his affection or violent sting of desire to enioy her loue: that once againe he said; Why Artesia doo you regard my good will no more, then for my paines, to yeelde me rebukes: and for my loue, disdaine? That I caused you to be brought from Adellenas house, was, for that being there you were subiect to many misfortunes. And if I imprisoned Allinus , it was for that I supposed him your enemy, and feared he would haue done you wrong: so that whatsoeuer I did with intent of good, you repay me with dislike: & conuert all my doings to the worst meaning: wherein you shewe your selfe too cruell, that will not yeeld me the least fauour for my constant loue. O Artesia be not so hard hearted, Artesia notwithstanding many faire promises, vowes, and protestations he made, would not yeeld to go with him, but desired rather that he would leaue her there. Lenon tolde her, though not for his sake, yet for her safetie, it were best for her to goe: which said, he commaunded his seruants to place her in a Litter. Which when shee sawe shee must needes doo, shee called to Ornatus , saying: Good Palmer go along with mee, that for the kindnesse you haue showen in preseruing my life, I may yeeld you some recompence. And (quoth shee) to Lenon , I request nothing of you for my selfe, but for this straunge Pilgrim, who when by the storme the ship was cast away, I readie to perish, caught me out of the water and preserued my life: and do not for his good will to me, vse him as you did my deare Syluian , whom you banished, for that she preserued my life from my vnkind vnckle, with that shee wept exceedingly. Then Lenon asked Ornatus what hee was, I am (quoth hee) as you see, a Pilgrim, that was forced to come aboord the Pyrates ship, and (amongst the rest) was readie to perish, but that by the diuine prouidence, I was ordained to preserue that vertuous Damosels life. For that deede quoth Lenon , I will reward you most kindly: therefore go along with vs. Then they all departed to the Court. Lenon presently caused Artesia to bee lodged in a most sumptuous place of the Court, appointing diuers Damsels to attend her, thinking by those meanes to win her to consent to loue him: but all proued vaine, his care was cast away, his cost to little effect, and his kindnesse vnregarded. For Artesia was so constant to Ornatus , that shee hated Lenon : her heart was wholly imployed to wish his good, and Lenons ill. For she determined neuer to loue him, though shee were assured of Ornatus death: that she spent her time in continuall care & sadnesse, shewing no signe of ioy, no shewe of comfort, but euen as one that regarded no rest, nor tooke felicitie in any thing, that Lenon both admired the same, and laboured by many meanes to alter that humour: but the more hee sought to please her, the more she was displeased: and more discontented at his kindnesse then any thing else. In this sort she continued many dayes, without the least shewe of alteration. Ornatus all this while remaining in the Court, (making the cause of his staie) to receiue Lenons promised reward, whereas indeed he staied to see what would become of Artesia , or by what meanes to get her from thence To effect which, he sawe no possible meanes, nor could in many dayes came to see Artesia , which filled his heart with griefe: only comforted himselfe with remembring her constant loyaltie. And one day being by himselfe alone, hee entered into these cogitations. Ornatus thou hast remained many dayes in this place, kept from thy Loue, and sought no meanes to set thy heart at rest, or her at libertie. Doost thou make no more account of her loue, then to attempt nothing to attaine the same? or are thy spirits of no more courage? then they will do nothing: thy wit so shallow, thou canst deuise no stratageme, or thy mind so cowardly, thou darest not reuenge the wrong Lenon doth thee? What though hee be the Prince and heire of this land, is not both hee and his father hated, ruling by vsurpation, and with crueltie, not with iustice, hath sought the downe-fall of thy house? Can Artesia thinke either valour or vertue to rest in thee, when shee shall know how neare thou art her foe, but darest not touch him? will shee not esteeme thee a coward and vnworthie to enioy her loue? Nay when shee knoweth this, will she not alter her loue? Why shouldest not thou seeke thy owne content, though it bee with his discontent? thou art euery way as good as hee by birth, though hee now rule the land: hath not thy father said, that his father was but a Captaine in the last Kings dayes, and by treason put his lawfull King to death, and so wanne the rule? Then Ornatus reuiue thy spirites, seeme not dismaied with any daunger feare not misfortune, seeke to release thy Loue, and venture thy life therein: for liuing thus thou shalt be depriued of her loue. Lenon will by force or faire meanes ouercome her, and then maiest thou blame this delaie. The King is now sicke, and hee being dead, Lenon must raigne, who then may do what hee list. Then take the aduantage of the time, and do not frustrate thy blessed hopes with slothfull delaie. Hauing ended this meditation, he then began to studie how to performe his will: wherein hee found many contrarieties. But presently he beheld Lenon entering the Court, before whome he stood so opposite, that he could not chuse but note him, and withall remembred how earnestly Artesia had intreated him on the Pilgrims behalfe, whome he thought she esteemed, and therefore suddenly this cogitation arose in his fancie, to vse him as an instrument to win her loue: that calling Ornatus vnto him, hee said: Pilgrim, I pray thee blame me not for forgetting to performe my promise made to Artesia as concerning thee, which I haue not neglected for want of good will, but by reason of thousands of cares that daily torment me, only procured by her vnkindnesse: but if thou wilt vndertake on my behalfe to perswade her to yeelde to my iust request, for that I thinke thou maist preuaile with her aboue any, I will not onely reward thy former kindnesse so shewen to her, but also for thy paines herein, promote thee to high dignitie. Therefore I pray thee giue consent to follow my counsel herein. Ornatus was willing to be imployed in that businesse, which fell out according to his hearts desire: and therfore made him this answere. My Noble Lord, for that I perceiue your intent is good, I will be readie to follow your directions, and do you any seruice I can: wherein I know not whether I shall proue fortunate or no: but assuring you that I will deale both faithfully and effectually in that which I shall vndertake. Lenon was as glad as he, that he yeelded to do that which he thought least to performe: and therefore presently gaue command, that the Pilgrim onely should haue her in custodie, Artesia maruelled that her keepers were chaunged, misdoubted some intent of hard vsage, but seeing it was the Pilgrim that now had her custodie, her heart was comforted. How Ornatus had the custodie of Artesia : how he discouered himselfe vnto her: how Allinus and Trasus arriued in Armenia , and gat the King to send Ambassadors into Phrygia . the Chamber, bewayling her misfortune, with salt teares bedeawing her purple cheeks: her ornaments disorderly put on, and her golden tresses hanging carelesly downe, which added bewtie to her sweete beawtie, and though disordered, most comely. Leaning her arme vppon a Chaire, and her cheeke laide vppon the backe of her hand: when hee beheld her sitting in this discomfortable sort, his hart was ready to melt with remorse: and hee breathed forth so bitter a sigh, that shee heard the same, which he perceiuing came towards her with humble behauiour, saying. Most vertuous Ladie, pardon my presumption, in presuming thus vnmannerly to interrupt your quiet: Lenon the Prince hath appointed me to be your attedant, therefore I beseeche you, notwithstanding I am his substitute: commaund me in any doubtful sort, and I will most willingly imploy my vttermost indeuours to purchase your content. Artesia raising her selfe from the ground, said. Pilgrim, I thanke you for your kinde profer, and am glad you are my keeper, for two causes: one, for that I trust your vertues will not suffer me to be iniured, the other, for that I would heare out your discourse of my deare friend Ornatus , which I was hindred from by Lenons suddaine finding me. Ladie, (quoth he) you shalbe assured of the one, and heare more of the other, if first you will vouchsafe without offence, to heare my speech, and suffer me to execute the charge Lenon hath giuen mee, and I haue vndertaken. Why what is that (quoth Artesia ) I wil not be offended? Lenon hath made knowne to me his loue, and how long, and with what constancie it is grounded, commaunding and intreating me in his behalfe to become an humble suter vnto you: he telleth me that stil you vngently disdain him without cause, reason, or consideration. Therefore I humbly desire, both for that he is constant, a Prince, and of good and vertuous gifts, yeelde to his loue or else to satisfie me of the chiefest reasons that withold you from the same. Pilgrim (quoth she) for that my minde perswadeth me, you in wisedome will conceiue of reason: and will be faithfull in concealing that which I shall disclose: I answere you thus. First, admit Lenon did loue mee (yet by his vsage I finde the contrary) nor I cannot fancie him, for that I alreadie haue plighted my faith to another, more worthie then himselfe, which is that most vertuous  & kinde Gentleman Ornatus , who likewise equalleth me in affection: and therefore I should dishonour my name, breake my faith, and reape perpetuall infamy, if I should shewe my selfe so inconstant. These I thinke are reasons (to a reasonable creature) sufficient, and of such force, as none can contradict: and therefore no more can be said therein. Besides were not all this so, you haue no reason to perswade me to that which I haue so often denied, and will neuer yeeld vnto. Your reasons indeed (quoth he) are great, and the cause such, as should no way be violated: but now you are subiect to his mercie: and he may inforce you to that which you are most vnwilling to haue done: then what remedie haue you, but rather to yeelde, then indure such extremitie as he may vse? Yes (quoth she) when I can preserue my selfe no longer from his lust, death shall rid mee from his power, which I will execute vpon my selfe, rather then condiscend to yeeld him so much as an outward shewe of fauour. Therefore I pray vse no more words tending to the breach of my faith, and furtherance of his loue, for knew you but how hatefull his name were vnto me, and howe odious to thinke of his doting loue, you would of pittie desist to torment me with the sound of that ominous monster, but rather seeke to comfort my distressed estate, and poore pining heart, almost drowned with sorrow: being more vnfortunate, then euer any was by these afflictions, and the losse of my deere Ornatus , whose presence should release me from this thraldome, and labyrinth of discontent. O whom if you can tell me any tidings, I beseech you impart them vnto me: thereby to adde comfort to mittigate my care. Ornatus was so rauished to heare her vtter such heauenly speeches, that he had much adoo to refraine from imbracing her: vttering these speeches. How happie is Ornatus by attaining the loue of so vertuous and constant a Ladie, worthy to be admired, eternized, and foreuer honored? what comfort may these pleasing words bring to his heart? What torment can he not account pleasure, indured for so sweet a Ladies safety? and what paines should he refuse to procure her sweet content? O Artesia , diuine Artesia, Ornatus is not able to expresse his content, nor your desert: vnable to recompence your kindnesse, and euerlastingly bound to you in all firme hands of faithfull loyaltie. In your heart is the harbor of true loyaltie, grounded vpon vertuous loue. Then how happie is he by being inriched, and possest of such a loue? His reward is greater then his paine: his pleasure more then euer his sorrowe could be: and his gaines a thousands times beyond his losse. Why shuld I then conceale the troth of his safetie from you? With that he said: Behold Artesia , your Ornatus : with that he discouered himselfe vnto her, & she perfectly knewe him. Being almost amazed with that heauenly sight: when with a sweete behauiour, they both imbraced eache other, intermingling their kisses, with teares of ioye that in aboundance distilled from their eyes, surfetting so much in that sweete delight, that they were loath to part, but that feare to be espied, compelled thm. Taking such exceeding comfort in each others presence, as is not to be exprest: withal, vsing many kindnesses vsuall betwixt faithfull friends, to expresse their ioy, hee somtimes imbracing her, & she againe with a sweet kisse, welcoming him, being so many, kinde, and hartie, as wold ask a skilfull discretio. At last hauing somewhat recreated themselues, and with sodaine ioy bannisht some part of their care, they though it time to studie how to procure their happinesse, least ye same might againe be crost by Lenon . Who by that time expected to heare from him. Therefore Ornatus said? My most deare and kind Artesia , by whose loue my life is preserued. I am not able to expresse the ioy my heart conceiueth, by this fortunate meeting, beeing likewise as sory to thinke of the misfortune you haue indured by my carelesse ouersight, and how to get you from this place, and from Lenons affection, whom I know to bee of such vnciuill a disposition, that he will leaue no disloyall meanes vnattempted to further his intent. Therefore in this vrgent extremitie, if you will be contented to esteeme me as your friend, and follow my directions, I will labor all that I can to get you from this place. My true friend Ornatus (said Artesia ) I haue dedicated my self to your disposition, and made my selfe all one with you, both in heart, body, and minde, that whatsoeuer you would wish your selfe, you do to me, & whatsoeuer pleaseth you, canot displease me, for I am your selfe: therfore I commit all things to your wisdome & rest to be ruled, counselled and ordered by you, in whatsoeuer you shall thinke conuenient: and will doo any thing you shall counsaile me vnto, both for our escape from hence, or otherwise: accounting my blisse yours, and yours mine, your cares mine, and your quiet, my content. Lenons loue is most hatefull vnto me, and iniurie to you, then what meanes can you work to ridde me, of that and reuenge your owne wrong, performe, for my consent is readie to yeeld to any thing you shall thinke conuenient. I most humbly thank you, said Ornatus , and first I think this is the best course, to procure my good liking with him, and to rid vs from hence, that at his next comming, you shewe a little more friendly contenance vnto him, then heretofore you haue done, as shall best agree with your wisdome, and he perceiuing that my seruice hath done more for him then euer he could attaine, will not only credit me, but also be ruled by mee in any thing I shall counsaile him vnto. Which if you will performe, comit the rest to me My deer Ornatus at your request I will do this, which otherwise I would neuer of my selfe yeelde vnto, for that my loue to you, and hate to him, would not suffer me so much to dissemble: but I pray God deliuer me well from forth of his power, that I may in quiet enioy your sweete company. These speeches being ended, they parted with a sweete kisse, he sighing, and she for griefe shedding teares. Not long after Lenon came to Ornatus , requesting to know whether he had preuailed any thing with Artesia in his behalfe? My Lord (quoth he) I haue vsed many perswasions to her, which in some sort haue preuailed, but hereafter I doo not doubt by my perswasions, but to winne her full consent: if you with wisdome will be directed by me, and not with rashnesse marre all: therefore goe in vnto her, but not to rashly, and see if she be not altered, Lenon imbraced him in his armes, saying: thou bringest me tydings of exceeding comfort, for which I will reward thee most bountifully, With that he gaue him a purse of gold: which Ornatus tooke, thinking that should be a meanes to further him, and hinder the giuer Lenon entred Artesia chamber, vsing many kinde speeches and submisse behauiours, whome she vsed more kindly then euer she had before done, which both filled his heart with ioy, and made him according to the Pilgrims directions, more carefull of his behauiour, least by any boldnesse he might offend her, that hauing past some small time with her, he departed. Now was Ornatus studying how to release Artesia , to further whose intent, the occasion thus fell out. Allinus and Trasus as is before said, gate shipping for Armenia , and arriued there with safetie: first directing their course to the Kings Pallace, where Allinus was most honourably entertained, being somewhat allied to the King, to whome he declared both the cause of his exile, and the iniury done to him by Thaeon , king of Phrigia. Turbulus the Armenian King, comforted him all that he could, and bad him withall, request any thing at his hands & hee would graunt it him. Allinus alledging many things to perswade Turbulus to yeeld thereto, requested him to send Ambassadours into Phrygia , either to request performance of certaine articles, or else to giue him open defiance for war. The articles were these: that Allinus shoulde bee restored to his lands, and the dammage and losse he had sustained, should bee repaied to the full, that his wife should bee recalled from banishment, and that he should yeeld vp Artesia to Allinus , if shee should bee in his custodie, and that the King and Lenon should bee sworne to performe all this. Turbulus was easily wonne, and therefore presently sent foure of his Noble men as Ambassadors, to request the performance of those conditions. Who euen at that instant were landed in Phrygia , and newes thereof brought to the Court, the King being himselfe somewhat sickly, sent Lenon to meete them, and giue them entertainment: who was loth to go from Artesias sight, but assuring himselfe of the Pilgrims faith, committed her wholly to his custodie. Ornatus thought it now the fittest time to seeke to escape, but he was hindred by other of Lenons seruants, whome he had secretly appointed as ouerseers to looke into the Pilgrims action: that it was impossible for him to attempt any thing that way, but it must needs both be discouered and preuented. Ornatus seeing himselfe disappointed of his purpose that way, made Artesia acquainted with what hee intended, and how he was preuented, spending the time of Lenons absence continually in her company. But hauing met the Armenian Ambassadors, brought them to the Court, where they were honourably entertained, and hauing declared their Embassage, Thaeon the King, tolde them they should receiue answere within two daies. Lenon hearing the articles, counselled his father not to yeeld to performe any such conditions, but rather to send Turbulus defiance For (quoth hee) your Maiestie are as absolutely King of Phrygia , as hee of Armenia , and then what dishonour were it vnto you to stoope to his commaund, and shewe your selfe as it were affraid of his threats? for to binde your selfe to this, were to become his subiect: which would soone be published through the whole world to your dishonour. The King being ouerruled by his perswasions, gaue the Ambassadours this answere, that hee ment not to performe the least of those articles they demaunded, nor feared their Kings threats of warre, for that hee was able to deale with a mightier foe then hee. Using many other words, and some of reproach, that the Armenians denouncing open warre according as they were commanded, departed. How Ornatus staying too late in Artesiaes chamber, was accused by Lenons seruants, whom he slew. How Allinus with a band of Armenians landed in Phrygia: and how Ornatus was imprisoned. therefore gaue Lenon charge to muster vp men throughout the whole land: comitting the chiefe charge of the Armie and ordering of these affaires, vnto him, who more hardie bold, then wise, vndertooke all, and within short space, had gathered an exceeding great Armie, and furnished certaine shippes, to meete with the Armenians by Sea if it might bee possible, to vanquishe them before they shoulde land. These troubles filled the Commons hearts with griefe, and their mouths with murmurings: for they vnderstanding that the King of Armenia did offer warre to Phrygia , in the behalfe of Allinus that was generallie beloued: there was fewe of those that were prest to those warres, but came vnwillinglie, and rather by constraint, being more readie to turne their swoord points against Thaeon , then against Allinus . Ornatus likewise hearing of these warres, by his wisedome found out the opinion of the multitude, and with what vnwillingnesse they came to the warres, which when hee was in some sort assured off, hee came to the Campe, and amongst all the rest of his Familiars, espied Phylastes , who alwaies loued him most dearely, him hee knewe to bee of a most faithfull and constant resolution, in performing his promise, and was by Lenon appointed one of the cheefest leaders. Ornatus finding him remote from the Camp, came to him, and after salutation, said: Sir Phylastes , I am sent vnto you by a deare friend of yours, named Ornatus who trusteth so much in your vertues, that he is willing to put his life into your hands, which you shall hazard, in denying him one small fauour, which with safetie you may graunt. First therefore, I request but your promise for your warrantie, and then I will declare what I haue in charge. My friend (quoth Phylastes ) thou tellest me newes of wonder, when thou sayest thou comest from Ornatus , whom I feare is long since dead: but if thou knowest the contrary, and canst resolue me thereof, I promise and sweare to performe whatsoeuer thou shalt demaund: for I am sure Ornatus knoweth that I loue him, nor maketh any doubt thereof, which if hee doo, he iniurieth that loue and friendship that hath past betweene vs. Then kinde sir (quoth he) that Ornatus is not dead, but in safetie, and I am that Ornatus , that notwithstanding my speech, make no doubt of your loue. Phylastes beholding his countenance, knewe him well, and for ioy caught him in his armes. My deare friend Ornatus (quoth hee) I am gladde of your safetie, and accursed bee my soule if I doo not any thing that you shall commaund. I thanke you (quoth Ornatus ) to enter into the tedious discourse of my afflictions, would be tedious: but in few words I will tell you all. I loued Artesia long, but found no hope nor meanes to attaine my loue, which made mee disguise my selfe into womans apparell, naming my selfe Syluian , and was fortunately entertained by Arbastus , whose death I founde to bee acted by Floretus , who falling into loue with mee tolde mee for my sake he would poyson Artesia at the Lodge, whither hee conueyed her, I fearing to haue her taken from me, and hauing wonne her loue, tolde her his intent, and conueyed her to Adellenas house: then Floretus and Lenon came thither, demanding her of me, whom I tolde I had poysoned her, according to his counsell: wee striuing, were brought before Thaeon , who banished me into Natolia , from whence I came backe, and by good fortune haue the keeping of Artesia in this disguise, the manner I will tell you at more leisure. Now my deare friend Phylastes , my desire is to chaunge my place with you, you to haue the custodie of Artesia in my Palmers weedes, and I to march into the field in your Armour, which if you graunt, you shall bind mee vnto you for euer. Phylastes yeelded to fulfill his request, and so for that time they parted, appointing to meete the next day. Ornatus being come to Artesia , told her where he had bene, and what hee intended, which made Artesia sad, disswading him from his purpose in this sort: My deare Loue, what need you venture your person in the daungers that are incident to war? will you leaue me heare in doubt, and not rather staie with me to my comfort? there are inough besides and too many in the field, and Phylastes is able to execute his own place: then I beseech you do not leaue mee in discomfort, for how can I be voyd of care, when I shall thinke you are amonst so many enemies readie to be slaughtered? My deare Loue (quoth he) that which I will do shalbe without any hazard at all, but shall procure both your and mine owne content. Then I beseech you remit this care for my safetie, for I will preserue my selfe from daunger for your sake. Besides Phylastes vertue is such, that you need not once so much as thinke amisse of him: who I knowe would venture his life for my sake. Besides, my honor vrgeth mee, reuenge of iniuries done to your selfe and me, and my fathers safetie, are reasons sufficient to perswade your consent: besides many other causes more forcible then these, too tedious to recite. Then I beseech you denie me not: for when it shall be knowne that my father was in armor in the field, and I in this place not regarding to aide him, it wil turne to my great dishonour: and those which before did esteeme well of me, will then begin to hate me: then let not your doubt and true loue to me, hinder my determination: for on that mine honour, your safetie, and my fathers life dependeth. Artesia seeing shee could by no meanes disswade him, thought not to let him depart so suddenly, but clasping her tender armes about his necke, a thousands times kist his lippes, whilest with her abundant teares shee bedeawed his manly cheekes. Ornatus tooke great sorrow at her heauinesse, and delight in her imbracings, that the contrarieties of his conceits were exceeding: pleasure it selfe, seeming more pleasant intermingled with care, and care a pleasure to be endured with such delight. Artesia was loath to let Ornatus depart that night, for that shee deemed hee should be in daunger the next day, and hee as vnwilling to leaue her in sorrowe: shee on the one side sollacing her selfe in his company, and hee by her kindenesse making him forget to depart, that before they were aware, night was come and well spent, and Ornatus then bethinking himselfe, thought it was too late to depart. And Artesia , hearing him make a motion to be gone, desired him to staye. And yet my deare Ornatus (quoth she) doe not you indaunger your selfe for my sake, for should Lenons seruants finde you heere, it might redound to our great disquiet. Ornatus likewise well considering the incouuenience, tooke his leaue of her, and left her sheadding aboundance of teares. Ornatus being gone, found the seruants awake, and watching his comming out, one of them saying; Pilgrim what maketh thee so sawcie as to court my Maisters Loue? Is this a fitte time of the night to be in her chamber? my Lord shall vnderstand your behauiour, and what familiaritie is betwixt you: wee take you to be some counterfeit, else would not such behauiours passe betwixt you as we haue behelde. Therefore heere shall you staye, vntill we giue him knowledge of your dooings and fidelitie: with that they lockt fast the doore, not suffering him to goe out or in. Ornatus by that perceyued that they had seene the kindenesse betwixt him and Artesia , which he knewe if Lenon should vnderstand, hee would finde out what he was: these thoughts troubled his heart exceedingly, that hee was assured vnlesse he could bee rid of them, there was no meanes to escape death, if Lenon should knowe him. With these studies hee sat a good while silent, till hee perceiued them inclinde to sleepe, and casting his eye aside, espied a bill hanging by the wall, to which hee stole secretly, and taking hold of the same, he drew towards them, entring into these meditations. And shall I now commit murder, and indanger my soule by so hainous a sin? what will Artesia say if she know thou art so bloodily bent? and that thy heart is so hard, as to shead thine own countrey mens blood? Ornatus be wel aduised before thou do this deed, and bethink of some other meane: auoid the danger thou art readie to fall into. Other meanes Ornatus , yea but what other meanes hast thou? none at all, dost thou not see how they haue betrayed thee, and made thee prisoner, what then needest thou make a question, to saue thy selfe, and by their deathes preserue thine owne life? which thy liuing, will be indangered, and being once done, thou art safe, but by delay, thy owne life may perish. With that lifting vp his armes with more then woonted force, hee smote the one on ye head, & beate out his braines: wherewith ye other began to awake: but in his awaking, he strooke him so full on ye brest, that the bill piearst his heart, and hee laye breathlesse sprawling in his gore. This done, Ornatus foud a vawte, and into the same hee conueied their dead bodies, purposing neuer to reueale what he had don. Then returning, he bethought himself of the keies of ye dores that hee had thrown into ye vawte with their bodies, deuising how to get out, without inspition of the deed he had done, yt hee was inforced to take the bill, & by maine force, and often striuing, wroong asunder the locks. His minde being exceedingly affrighted with these cares, he entred into Artesias chaber, to see whether he had disquieted her or no with the noise, her he foud in bed, & fast a sleep with the light still burning by her beds side, her brest vncouered downe to the waste, and nothing to shrowde her from his perfect view, but the single sheete, that lay carelesly cast ouer her tender bodie, her armes cast to either side of the bed, and her head leaning on the one side, with so sweete an aspect, as would haue rauished a thousand beholders. Ornatus heart was reuiued to behold this sweet sight, that the remembrance therof had bannished all remembrance of his troubles past, and affected his heart with incomparable delight: that he stood like one amazed to behold her sweet beawtie, and to take a surfetting viewe of those her perfections, so amiably laide forth. Artesia sodainly awaking blusht to see him so nie, yet therwith more comforted then dismayed she caught the clothes and couered her selfe, whilest hee folding his hand in hers, desired pardon for his boldnesse: but she viewing him well, behelde his pale and gastly countenance, which draue her into feare, and raysing her selfe vpright in her bed, caught him in her armes, asking what he ayled to looke so pale: my deare Artesia (quoth hee) since I parted from you, I haue endured great danger, & past through a hell of calamities, which now I feare not. With that he let his head fall into her sweete bosome, and there made the period of his speeche, feeling her tender heart pant, with the motions of her troubled spirits. In which pallace hee rested it a good while, whilest she wt her soft hand curled his haire, and with sweet kisses, mollified his lips. Using many other familiarities, & sweete fauors, proceeding from the depth of kinde loue, wherwith Ornatus was so rauished, that hee not onely took heauenly comfort therin, but also desired a further content, & possession of her loue, which he neuer before asked, nor thought she wold grant, but being hartned by the assurance of her Loue, hee vsed more bolde behauiour, which shee permitted: but at last growing more bolde then shee thought conuenient for her modestie to permit, with a kinde and louely behauiour, shee both blamed and hindred him, but the motions of affection so far preuailed with them both, that hee desired, and shee inwardlie yeelded, though outwardly shee refused, but his behauiour, her owne Loue, the present occasion, so fitte opportunitie, their hearts vnitie, and other sweete enticements, so farre preuailed, that shee yeelded vp her vnspotted body, & pure chastitie, to his possession, and the impression of his attempt, dissolued her Uirgin zonne, giuing full interests of her heart, Loue, and body, to him, that pursued the possession of those riches, with earnestnesse: Sometimes blushing, sometimes shreeking, and yet yeelding, denying, and yet graunting, willing and vnwilling: yet at last, she gaue that she could not recall, and let him possesse her spotlesse virginitie, which beeing past, her heart panted with the motion, and she felt her sences sadde, a little repenting, yet not altogither sory: sighing for sadnesse, and yet not sad at all: whilest hee bathed himselfe in that hauen of Blisse, passing the rest of that night in such vnspeakeable pleasure as cannot be desciphered. Early the next morning hee arose, taking his farewell with a sweete Adieu, leauing Artesia sad for sorrowe, and lamenting his absence, but yet with earnest and hearty prayers, innocating his happie successe: bathing her heart in luke-warme sences, thinking she had beene too prodigall of her fauours to him, and yet esteeming him worthie of a thousand times greater gyft, if shee had it in her possession, with repentance reioycing, though deeming herselfe metamorphose, and other then shee was wont to be, beeing glad shee had no more companie to conuerse withall, least her guilt should make her blush, and so bewraye her fault. And when Phoebus began to lighten the Chamber with his splendor, she hid herselfe within the bed, as if the day-light had accused her of that shee had done in the darke. Ornatus beeing come to the Campe, found out Phylastes , and brought him to Artesias lodging, by the way instructing him howe to order their businesse when Lenon should come. Where beeing entered, Phylastes hauing saluted Artesia , and a while conuersed about their affaires, they chaunged their habits. Ornatus with many a sorrowfull sigh taking his leaue of her, whilst her heart bled warme drops of blood. Ornatus againe tooke his leaue of Artesia , and entered the Campe, framing himselfe to such kinde of behauiour, that hee was of all taken for Phylastes . Newes came that the Armenians were landed, and had brought their Forces within a dayes march of Thaeons Campe, the King assembled all the chiefe Leaders together, to appoynt euery man his charge, and consult what to doe. Ornatus in Phylastes stead, had vnder his charge foure thousand men, whom by his owne seeking hee was appointed to conuoye into a wood that stood fitly to offend the ennemie, and the rest appointed to other places that seemed for most aduantage. Ornatus hauing his souldiers alone, thought it time to execute what he intended, and therefore called vnto him such as were Captaines and chiefe vnder him, vttering these speeches. Fellow souldiers, I would willingly vtter my mind which is troubled in some sort with remembrance of the inuries. Allinus hath alreadie causelesly indured, against whome now wee addresse our selues to fight: wherein in my mind wee deale vniustly: for he was neuer traytor to his countrey, nor now commeth to disturbe the land with oppression, but only to claime his own inheritance and libertie, which our selues do permit: therefore I thinke it best before wee drawe our weapons, to consider against whome we drawe them, and whom we offend, one that loueth vs, his Countrey and people, and would not willingly shead a drop of our blood. Now if I could find a remedie for all this, which standeth with equitie, would you follow my directions? With that they all at once said, they would be ruled by him Then hee said, Thaeon that is now our King, destroyed all his familie, and such as are in any degree neare to him in blood, the last of whome is Allinus , whose vtter ruine hee now seeketh, not by iustice, but that neitheir he nor any of his progenie should hinder his succession. Therefore if you wil follow my counsell, when the armies are met let vs not offer to offend the Armenians , but keepe our selues from fight, vntill Lenon affrighted therewith, and fearing the peoples reuolt, will peraduenture yeeld to performe the articles the Armenian Embassadors demaunded: and by this meanes shall wee restore Allinus to his right, saue the effusion of blood, and yet not wrong our reputation. The people hearing his speeches, generally gaue their content: crying, Phylastes, Phylastes . With that Ornatus bestowed the golde among them that Lenon had before giuen him, which preuailed with the multitude exceedingly. Ornatus hauing effected this according to his desire, went vnto the Armenian Campe, desiring to speake with Allinus the Generall, to whom he declared what he intended in his behalfe, not discouering him to be other then Phylastes . For which Allinus yeelded him many harty thanks. Whilest Ornatus was absent, a Captaine named Ortonus , drawne by desire of reward, and aboue the rest fauouring Lenons party, stole from the wood, and comming into the Campe to Lenon , bewrayed what Phylastes intended, and how that hee was now gone to the Armenian Campe, to confer with Allinus . Lenon hearing that, thought it best, not to send for him by warrant, but amongst the rest, to assemble him to councell: and to that effect, sent a Herault. Ornatus being returned, had knowledge of the generall assemblie, and willinglie went, little suspecting what Lenon intended, and being entred the Camp, & Lenons Tent, he was before all the Estates, by a Herault arrested of high treason. Ornatus the thought his intent was bewraied, demanding what they could lay to his charge: Wherevpon Ortonus before them all, declared what he had done, which he could not denie, vppon which accusation, he was presently sent to the Court, and there imprisoned. Howe Ornatus was deliuered out of prison  & carried Artesia from the court. How Ornatus in a single combat, ouercame Lenon , and caused Th aeons flight. And how Artesia to escape Th aeon , fled to Adellenaes house. The newes of Ornatus imprisonment was soone blazed through the whole camp, court, and country,  & at last came to Artesias hearing, who with exceeding lamentations bewailed his misfortune, but Phylastes comming vnto her, coforted her all that he could, promising to set Ornatus at libertie (if quoth he) at Lenons next comming, you will request his signet, to keepe as his warrant for your safetie. The next day the armies should meete, and therefore Lenon that night visited Artesia , finding her very sad, demanding the cause thereof: my Lord (quoth she (how can I be otherwise then sad, when I am ready euery houre to fall into more miserie, not knowing whither your life may be indangered by these warres, and I thereby subiect to some misfortune. Therefore in signe you loue mee, graunt me your signet, to bee my warrant and priuiledge, against all iniurie yt may bee offered mee: with yt shee kist him, which she had neuer before done, not drawne by any good will, but with desire to helpe Ornatus. Lenons heart was so ouercome, that hee presently gaue her the same, staying sometime with her, intreating her consent to his loue. He was no sooner gone, but Phylastes taking the ring of Artesia , went vnto the place where Ornatus was, and comming to the Iayler, tolde him that hee must deliuer Ornatus to his custodie, shewing him the Princes signet, as his warrat: the Iailer seeing the same, and knowing that the Pilgrim was of great credit & trust with Leno , made no doubt, but presently deliuered Ornatus vnto him: both departing together, to Artesia , who seeing her beloued so fortunately deliuered shead teares of ioy for his escape. After salutations in the kindest sort past, Ornatus declared what hee intended, and howe hee was betrayed by Ortonus. Phylastes then counselled Ornatus , that night to conuey Artesia from thece, vnto some place of better securitie, who sometimes thought to carrie her to Adellenaes house, but he thought Lenon wold misdoubt ye place, at last he concluded to conuey her to her castle, where Arbastus her father dwelt, which was still kept to her vse, by certaine of her fathers seruants. Both Artesia & Phylastes liked this well, and therefore leauing the court, they departed thitherwards, Artesia not woonted to trauell, could scarcely indure to holde out, but by their help, they arriued there at midnight, & knocking, awaked the porter, who looking ouer the battlemets, demanded who was below at that vnreasonable time of the night: My friend quoth Ornatus , it is Artesia that commeth in time of her most need, for harbor in this place. The Porter viewing her well by the bright light of Scynthia , & knew her, calling vp the rest of his fellowes, came running down, and opened the gate, where he and the rest, receiued her in with great ioy. Ornatus was glad of this happie escape, but yet exceeding sad that he could not assist his father against Lenon , but that he must perforce be absent from his rescue, which filled his heart with such care, that all that night he could take no rest, and though hee enioyed Artesias company without controll, he could harbor no rest or quiet to his distempered thoughts: that Phylastes demanded the cause of his sadnesse. My assured friend Phylastes (quoth hee) the remembrance of my fathers estate, and feare of his mishap, maketh me thus sad, and griefs exceeding torment possesseth mee, that I cannot be present to aide him against Lenon , that by cowardly malice, not with valour, will seeke his ruine before any others. O were I but present to defend him, though I offended none, my heart would bee at quiet. Artesia hearing his speeches said; Good Ornatus do not againe hazard your selfe, as you lately did: for had not fortune and Phylastes wisedome, assisted vs, both your life, and with it mine, had bene cast away. My deare Artesia (quoth hee) that misfortune hath taught mee wisedome, and by remembring it, I wil learne to eschue such mischiefes, and know whome I trust: therefore I beseech you, grant I may once againe go to do my dutie in ayding my father, which I will nowe do without daunger, for that I wil make none priuie to that I intend, nor attempt more then I am able to performe. Artesia seeing howe fully hee was bent to goe, preferd his will before her owne desire, knowing her dutie not to contradict, but to counsell him, and therefore said; My deare Ornatus , my dutie bindeth me to consent, but my loue willeth me to denie: feare of your mishap maketh mee vnwilling, but will to fulfill your desire, maketh mee giue an vnwilling consent: onely let me request this, that you will take Phylastes in your company, and leaue me to the custodie of my seruants, whose fidelitie I am assured of: for hauing him with you, his aide and counsell may much auaile to preserue your life, which if you loose (as heauens forbid) with the same shal mine expire, for it is impossible Artesia should breathe, Ornatus being breathlesse. Ornatus with a fewe teares that by exceeding griefe were wroong from his heart, participated her laments. First requesting the seruants to be carefull of her good, and then without delaye, both furnishing himselfe and Phylastes , with rich armor and horse, of which there was great choyce in that Castle: and for that the day began to appeare, they thought it time to depart, least their comming from thence might be discouered: There might one behold sorrow at parting in his right forme, hart-breaking sighes, breathing sad Farewels, and sorrowfull teares at so sad a parting, when their lippes were parted, their hands still fast, their hands disioynd, then their voyces oftentimes vttering, that woful word, Farewell: and when they were past hearing, their eyes vnwillingly leauing each others sight, he being without looking backe, and shee within looking after, so long as she could perceiue the glimering glance of his bright armor, and he being past sight of her, with watry eyes beholding the place of her abode, thus parted they, as if they had parted neuer to meete. Drawing nigh the armies, they beheld them met and in hot skirmish, standing still a good space, to see to whether partie it was likely the victorie would incline: and in the ende they beheld the Armenians begin to retrait, and Lenon with Thaeon his Father in the midst of the throng, making exceeding slaughter, and proud of their deemed conquest: which set Ornatus heart on fire, that hee rusht amongst the thickest of his Countrey men, yet not once offering a blow, nor sheading a drop of the bloud he loued, but onely making way to come to Lenon , which made them not offer to staye his passage: but admiring what he was, let him goe free; after whom Phylastes hasted. The Souldiers seeing those two newe come Knightes offende none, admired what they should be, not one of them all offering a blow, because they offered none. By this time Ornatus was come to the place where Lenon was, who euen then & not before had met Allinus , betwixt whom many blowes and some woundes were giuen and receiued, but Allinus had the worst by reason of his age. Ornatus knowing his Father by his armour, came betwixt them with his sword drawne, saying: Lenon staye thy hand: let age goe free, and let thy youth cope with mee, that am come to challenge thee before both the Armies: and therefore as thou art the Kings Son, a knight and honorest arms, giue order by thy Herault, to staye the furie of the Battailes, till thou and I haue tryed our valours, otherwise this Knight and I haue vowed to hunt thee from place to place, and neuer giue ouer, vntil wee haue spilt thy blood. Lenon , hearing this Champions proud challenge, sayd: If thou art a knight, a gentleman as I am, and canst shewe wherein I haue wronged thee, I will answere thee, otherwise knowe, that I scorne thee, although I know my selfe of sufficient strength to abate thy haughty presumption, were it neuer so great. With that two heraults were sent from either General, to part the souldiers, which done, Ornatus before the open assembly said. Lenon , first I saye I am a Gentleman, as absolute and as good as thy selfe: Prince I am none, neither art thou by right, but that by tyrannie and vsurpation thou holdest the same. I come as Artesias Champion, to challenge thee of disloyalty, as the outrages thou hast committed, by detaining her libertie, do manifest. I challenge thee for dooing iniustice against Allinus , whom thou withholdest from his right, by trecherous malice. I challenge thee, as a partaker of Arbastus death, for that thou sufferest and vpholdest his murtherer Floretus , that hath deserued death. I challenge thee for oppression laid vpon this whole land. And lastly, for detaining Ornatus liuing, who neuer was impeached of treason: and therefore if thou darest answere my challenge, I am here readie, otherwise, I here pronounce thee for a coward, & a miscreant, not worthie to beare Armes. Lenon made this replie. Being accused by a straunger, without cause, I regarde it not, and beeing iudge my selfe, will not by thee be adiudged: but for thy proude challenge. I will answere thee, as little regarding thou canst doo, as thou boastingly dost vaunt of thy valor. Therefore euen now before I depart, I will without delay abate thy haughtinesse, though thy accusations are manifestly false: for I both loue and esteeme Artesia as deerely as I doe my selfe: my title to the Crowne, is iust: for Allinus hee is both a traitor at home, and abroade: first in causing his complices to seeke my fathers life: and lastlie, for bringing these Armenian bands, to destroye the Countrey. For Floretus pardon, it is mercie, not iniustice. As for oppression done to Ornatus , all knowe, I neuer iniuried him: but if hee take the Iustice that is done to his traiterous father, as done to him, I cannot helpe that: but reuenge it thou, since thou art his Champion. Ornatus had much adoo to stay to heare out his speeche, which galled him to the very heart, that without speaking a word more, hee smote at Lenon , and Lenon with courage, answered his blowes, beginning a most fierce and forceable incounter, and with like furie continuing the same, til both had receiued many wounds, and their steeds beganne to be furious and madde, with the smart of some strokes that mist their ayme. Ornatus calling to remembrance, first the iniuries he had receiued, and that Lenon & none else could dispossesse him of Artesias Loue, and many other wrongs he had done him and his parents, thought nowe to reuenge them all, and dispossesse Thaeon of the Crowne by Lenons death, reuiued his spirits with such courage, that he began with renewed strength to assaile Lenon , who euen then began to fainte, & would haue yeelded, but that shame withheld him. Which when Ornatus perceiued, hee thought at once to ende the strife, that with one forceable blow, hee gaue him so deep a wound on the right arme, where the Armour was broken away, that hee let fall his sworde, and fell sencelesse on his horse necke. Thaeon perceiuing his sonne in that danger, with his guard came rushing in, & rescued him from Ornatus sword, which otherwise had parted his head from his bodie. With this, both the Armies ioyned battel againe: the Armenians with new courage rushing vpon their enemies, whose hearts began to faile, seeing Lenon so neer death, which made such a confusion among the that they were readier to flie or yeeld to Allinus , the to fight it out: that on a sodain, the Armenias had slaine an infinit number of them, & all the earth was dyed to a purple colour, with their blood. Ornatus heart was vexed to see so much of his Countres blood shead, that hee intreated Phylastes to perswade the Souldiers to giue ouer, and himselfe rode betwixt the two Armies with a Herault, desiring them to staie their furie for a while. Long it was before they would giue ouer, but at last by the Drums and Trumpet sound, hauing called backe the Armenians, Ornatus placing himselfe in the midst of his Countrey men, that a multitude might heare him, said. Renowmed people of Phrygia , heare my speech that am tormenmented to see so much of your blood shead, the effusion whereof, I seeke by all meanes to stop, hauing as you see for the loue I beare to you, not lifted my hand against any of you, but onely Lenon : the causes that vrge me to challenge him, is the manifest wrongs he and his father hath done to your selues, this Countrey, and all the Nobilitie: for the true testimony whereof, let euery one inwardly examine his owne conscience, and they will not deny my words, but finde themselues exceedingly greeued with his oppression. Doo you not see what destruction he hath brought vpon this land? Are not almost all the Nobilitie slaine and destroyed? Are not your liberties, goods and friends, taken from you? Is not the whole land in an vproare, and euery one driuen from his quiet at home, to venture his life in the fielde, and all this for satisfaction of his will and selfe commaund, not grounded vpon lawe nor iustice? Examine your consciences, is he your lawfull King? did he not murther your lawfull King, onely to make you his vassels? Againe, doth Allinus seeke to do his Countrey wrong? doth hee come to oppresse you? doth hee seeke to abuse your libertie? No: hee onely commeth to claime his possessions, by iniustice taken from him: he commeth as vrged by griefe, not to liue as a banished man, being himselfe, his wife, children and familie, driuen to liue in miserie and slauerie, for the satisfaction of his Lust. Then I beseech you good souldiers, consider well what you do, whom you defend, a traytor: and whom you resist, a deare friend, that loueth and tendereth your liues as deare as his owne: whose estate the Armenians pitie, to whome he was neuer gratious: but his own Countrey mens harts are hardned against him, repaying crueltie for his loue, and resistance to withhold his right. I could alledge so many reasons to disswade you from following Thaeons will, as would aske a tedious recital, but I know you are of wisedome to conceiue the right: your hearts mercifull to pittie him, and your mindes apt to doe Iustice: then giue him ouer, discharge your mindes of care, and disburthen your selues of his oppression. I stand heere as an Aduocate to pleade for Allinus right, that hath indured too much wrong. I stand heere as Artesias Champion, that is imprisoned by Lenon , abused by Lenon , and withhelde from her libertie by Lenon . I stand here to intreat you saue your owne liues, to preserue your libertie to execute Iustice, and to doe Allinus right. Then I beseeche you, lay aside your armes taken in defence of wrong, and turne your hearts to pittie innocencie: whereby you shall saue many of your liues, shew your selues men that are ruled by wisedome, and not by rage: and purchase libertie, freedome, and peace, for euer. Then you that beare the true hearts of Phrygians , follow me, and giue ouer to follow that vsurper, and staye such ruines and destructions as are like to ensue by your refusall: and let the rightfull heire possesse the Crowne, who will loue you, cherish you, and seeke his Countreyes peace. The peoples hearts were so altered with his speeches, that many came running to him, crying, Allinus, Allinus : and the rest that were not yet resolued, stood in a doubt what to doe. Whilest Duke Ternus commaunded his Forces to follow him, who withdrew himselfe from the Campe, espying so fit occasion, determined likewise not to followe Thaeon longer, whom he neither hated nor loued, but yet esteemed as vnlawfull vsurper of that Kingdome: and rather desiring Allinus should possesse his right of inheritance, then any way willingly contradicting the same: beeing as many others were, forced to come to those warres, fearing Thaeons displeasure, who cared not in what sorte his will was performed. Ternus therefore drewe himselfe apart with this pollicie that if Thaeon preuailed, yet hee could not impeach him: and if Allinus had the best, yet he could not alledge that Ternus withstood him, thinking it the greatest poynte of wisedome to keepe himselfe vpright. Thaeon had no sooner conueyed his Sonne to his Tent, and with much adoo recouered him to his sences, but there came a messenger Poasting from the Court, with newes that Phylastes was two dayes since escaped out of prison. And presently after him, an other brought newes that Artesia with the pilgim, was fled, but no man could tell whither. Lenon hearing the newes, became almost mad, and raged so extreamlie, that his wounds burst into fresh bleeding: and to fill vp his heart with sorrowe and vexation, another messenger from the campe, came running in, crying, Flie Thaeon , flie, we are betrayed to the enemie, the leaders captaines and souldiers are reuolted, and the enemie is neare at had to surprise thee: Flie and saue thy life, for thine own subiects haue left thee, and refused thy gouernment. Thaeon was so amazed and terrified with feare, that without regard of Lenons life, he fled to saue himselfe. Euery one sauing those that were fled with Thaeo , with haste running to their reuolting fellowes to saue themselues. This newes was brought to Allinus , who hearing the same, and being past feare of Thaeons rage, sent a Herault to Turnus , to know whether hee were his friend, or still continued those bands to resist him as his foe? who returned this answere, that he was neuer foe to him, but alwaies wisht his good. Afterwards dismissing his souldiers, and sending euery one well rewarded to his owne house, himselfe comming backe to this Tent, where he met Allinus whome hee kindly saluted. Thither were assembled the chief states of the land, to whom Allinus said. My Lords, since Thoeon & Lenon are fled, & none left but your honours in place of iustice, with right and equalitie to minister the same to such as haue sustained wrong: I as one that haue abode the greatest losse, commit my cause to your wisedomes: you know what iniuries I haue indured by his malice, onelie for that I sought to set Artesia at libertie, that was by Lenon imprisoned, and badly vsed: requesting nothing of you, but that which by right is mine, and belongeth to me by inheritance. The nobles with a generall assent, granted that he should enioy his former possessions: and that his losse should be repaid out of the Kings treasure. Ornatus standing by, said: Most noble peeres, you stand here debating matters, whilest the cause of your woe is liuing, and farre inough from yeelding to that you graunt, who now peraduenture is mustering newe forces, to make frustrate what you intend, and to worke reuenge. Which to preuent, giue mee your consents to pursue him, and he being once taken, then may you without controll, either establish him, or chuse a new, that should by right be your king. To this all the nobles gaue consent, and Ornatus with three thousand horsmen, followed Thaeon , who first took the green Fortresse, with fiue hundred men, who continued firme, wonne by great rewards, but hearing of the Armenians approach, vnder the conduct of the stranger, that slue Lenon , in the night hee fled with a hundred of his nearest friends and allies, to Arbastus castle, where he thought to liue secure and vnknowne, for that he thought his enemies would least of all suspect that place. Hee arriued there in the dead time of the night: but knocking, was denied entrance, which made him almost desperate, that hee assayed to enter by force, and preuailed so, that hee gat in with the rest of his company, making fast the Gates againe after them. Artesias seruants knowing what hee was, some ranne one way, some another, to hide themselues from him. One amongst the rest, came running into Artesias chamber, declaring to her what had befallen, & how that the king had taken the castle. Artesia hauing not yet heard of Lenons death: nor what successe Ornatus had in the campe, wringing her hands made this lamentation. Twice hath my deare Ornatus left me in this danger, and hazarded his owne life, hoping to attaine good successe, but cruell fortune hath still crost his laudable attempts, & left both him and my poore selfe, in extreame miserie. Now am I assured hee is take prisoner againe, and my selfe am like not long to go free, for I am sure the king hath heard of my beeing heere, which maketh him come thus late. Well, might I but bee made prisoner in the same place my Ornatus lyeth inthralled, that I might yet enioy his sight, then should I thinke my selfe happie in miserie, but I feare mee too much, they will priuilie murther him, and neuer let mee knowe thereof, whereby I shall bee helde with long frustrated hope to see him, and in the end be deceiued. Neuer was poore mayden brought to such miserie, nor I thinke true loue neuer crost with such pitter aduersities, which both he for me, and I for him, haue bene continually subiect vnto euer since our first acquaintance. As shee was still continuing her laments, the same seruant whose name was Thristus , came running in again, saying Deare mistresse, I haue found a meanes for your escape from hence vnespied, if you will attempt the same; which is without any danger at all. Neuer tell me what it is (quoth she) but be thou my guide and I will follow thee: for I will attempt any thing to escape from him. Then (quoth he) feare nothing, but follow me. Then tooke he her by the hand, leading her out of that roome nto a darke entrie, where by reason of the night, there appeared not the least glimse of light, and through that into many backe roomes and vnfrequented places of the Castle, vntil hee came to a postern gate which he opened, and after hee was out, shut the same fast againe, saying. Now mistresse you are out of the Castle, and past feare of the King, who litle knoweth you can passe out this way, therefore I pray tell mee whither I shal conduct you? I thanke thee good Thristus quoth she, for this thy good assistance, for which I will one day bee thankful vnto thee, and now I pray thee direct me to Adellenas house, who is may faithful friend, and will rather die then discouer me. This said, they began their iourney, which was but three myles, and therefore they soone ouercame the same, euen by the morning light arriuing at the wished place. Adellena hearing some knocke at the gate, commaunded her mayd to rise, to see who it was, the Damsel comming downe, before shee would open the gate asked who was there? Artesia knowing her voyce, said; It is Artesia , good Anna let me in. With that the Damsel opened the gate, conducting her to her mistresse Chamber, who espying her, was so surprised with ioy, that she imbracing her, shed abundance of teares, saying: Welcome my deare Artesia , I was afraid I should neuer haue seene you againe, you haue bene so long time absent. Indeed (quoth she) I haue bin long absent from shee, though stil not far from thee: but I haue news of importance to tell thee, which I will forbeare to speake of vntill I haue refreshed my selfe, for care and trauell hath made mee exceedingly weary. Then Adellena brought her into a sweet and pleasant Chamber, where she layde her downe to rest. ¶ Howe Ornatus surprised Th aeon in Arbastus Castle, who was slaine by one of his Seruants. round with horsemen, who tooke certaine of the Kings followers, that beeing brought before him, tolde him the King was fled with some hundred in his companie to Arbastus Castle, which when hee heard, without delay hee rode thither, fearing leaste Th aeon getting in and finding Artesia , would offer her some iniurie: hee was no sooner come, but hee sound it so: for hee was denyed entrance, nor could see one of Artesias seruants, whom hee left as keepers of the same, which so much disquietted his heart, that hee could not tell what to doe: thinking it best to intreate Th aeon kindely, least hee should seeke reuenge against Artesia , though she were innocent, and no way to be blamed for any thing: and such a multitude of contrarious feares arose in his fancie, that hee seemed therewith metamorphosed. Which Phylastes soone perceiued, and comming to him said; How now Ornatus what hath feare taken away your courage? O my friend Phylastes (quoth hee) Thaeon is within, and thereby possest of Artesia , whose minde is so farre from the least thought of vertue, that no doubt hee will seeke reuenge on her. Feare not that (quoth hee,) but summon him to the walles by the sound of a Trumpet, and will him to yeelde him selfe, and stand to the courtesie of his Nobles, and promise him with safetie to conduct him thither. Ornatus allowed his counsel, and therfore commaunded a Trumpet to sound a Parley, and therevpon one from the King appeared on the walles, demaunding what hee would haue. To whom Ornatus said: Tell Thaeon the King, that wee come to him from the Peeres of the Realme. The messenger told the King what he said. Wherupon Thaeon came in sight, demanding what he would haue. Quoth hee, I would haue you yeelde, least by resistance, you procure a greater mischiefe to your selfe, then is by vs pretended. Suppose I should yeelde (quoth he) how would you vse mee? Like a King (quoth Ornatus ) honourablie. I haue found (said hee,) so small cause to trust you, that it were fondnesse to put my life within compasse of your mercie: therefore I will keepe my selfe where I am, not doubting ere many dayes, to haue so many friendes, as shall both chase thee, and the Armenians from the walles, and so out of this Countrey: which hee spake vpon the confidence he had in certaine friends, that had promised to gather newe forces, but meant neuer to performe the same. Ornatus was much troubled in his minde, to thinke what was become of Artersia , maruailing that hee spake not of her, nor could heare of any of her seruants, that hee might giue him knowledge howe shee fared. But seeing his faire words would not preuaile, said. Thaeon , since thou refusest the curteous profer I make thee, know, that my intent is altered, and since thou wilt not by faire meanes yeelde, I will inforce thee to submitte thy selfe to my mercie, or abide my rigour: for not all the friends thou canst finde shall shelter thee from my reuenge: for I haue sworne thy death, and nothing but that shall satisfie mee. Which vowe I will once againe reuoke, if thou wilt yeelde without inforcement, and deliuer mee Artesia in safetie, that is within that Castle. Artesia , (quoth Thaeon ,) had I her in my custodie, I would be reuenged on her, because thou wishest her safetie, but shee is farre inough from me, therefore thou seekest her in vaine at my hands, who would as readily deliuer her vnto thee, as thou couldest ake, for that I esteeme her not. But as for my selfe, it shall neuer be sayde, my minde would stoupe to base submission, nor that a King yeelded to a slaue and base vassal as thou art. Doest thou think that a Royall minde can put on so degenerate a habite? no I tell thee, whatsoeuer thou art, I had rather by inforcement die, then by submission liue: but be thou aduised what thou doest, nor stay long before these walles, for there are so many whetting their swordes, and putting on Armour in my defence, as ere the mornings Sun arise, will scare thee from hence. Ornatus heart could not indure these braues, and being withall vexed for feare that Artesia should sustaine some iniurie, thought speedilie to worke reuenge. Which by Phylastes counsalle, hee remitted vntill it were night, that then vnawares they might by some meanes get entrance into the Castle, and so surprise them. Ornatus thinking to walke alone by himselfe, to breathe forth in sighes some part of the feare that possest his heart, and withall, determining to viewe the Castle, howe hee might with conueniencie get into the same without destroying it, for that it belonged to his dearest beloued, hee espyed the Posterne gate, whereat thrusting, it presently flewe open, which way as yet, neyther Thaeon nor any of his company had found. Ornatus heart was glad hee had found so good a means to accomplish his will, putting the same too againe, came to Phylastes and told him thereof. Then both of them presently agreed to enter that way and surprise them: conueying a hundreth of the best Souldiours secretly vnder the wall of that Posterne, and placing all the rest in the open viewe of the Castle, as if none of them had bene wanting. Ornatus and Phylastes entered, and after them the rest followed, who passing along through the waste roomes, at last came to the place where they had left Artesia , but found her not, and such successe had they in their attempt, that Ornatus comming behind Thaeon , smote him with his hand on the backe, before hee had any knowledge of his approache. Thaeon therewith starting, and looking backe, was amazed, but running forward, drewe out his sword, crying; My Friends saue and defende your selues: wherewith those that were about him drewe their swordes: To whom Ornatus said in this manner. Howe nowe vsurping King? where are those mightie Forces should chase me hence? wil you yet yeelde, or stand to the triall by sight? I yeelde (quoth Thaeon ,) but much against my will, for had friends dealt faithfully, I had not bene left in this misery. But since fortune so much fauoureth thee, as to make mee thy prisoner, vse me well for that I am a King, and to none but thy selfe am in thrall. Tell me (quoth Ornatus ) what is become of Artesia , that not many dayes since I left in this place? I sawe her not (quoth Thaeon ) nor know I where shee is, onely I found certaine seruants in this place, whom I haue put to death, least they should bewray my beeing heere. Tyrant quoth Ornatus , thinkest thou their death shall goe vnreuenged, couldest thou be so cruell as to murther those that were innocent? with whom I feare me, thou hast made away Artesia . Why what art thou (quoth Thaeon ?) that vsest such vndecente words to a King? that art thy selfe not worthie to speake to a King? and why makest thou such enquyrie after Artesia , that for ought I knowe hast no interest in her? suppose I haue slaine her, that was the cause of all this woe, what canst thou challenge at my handes for her? it had beene good shee had neuer beene borne, for shee onely hath caused the originall of these troubles. Art thou a King quoth Ornatus , and bearest so vnkingly a minde, as to slaunder true vertue? No, thou art a villain, a murtherer, a Traytour to this Land, an vsurper of the Crowne, and a most wicked and cruell homicide: but for that thou wouldest knowe what I am, knowe that I haue more interest to the Crowne then thou hast, my name Ornatus , and thy enemie, to whom by right that Crowne belongeth: which thou shalt no longer enioye. Therefore said hee, such as are my friends lay holde on this Trator. Hee had no sooner spoken those words, but Thaeons owne Seruants were the first that apprehended him, beeing weary of his gouernement: and one amongst the rest, thinking that hee had commaunded them to slaye him, and withall, hoping for some reward for that forward exployte, hauing his sword readie drawne, suddenly (whilest Ornatus did but turne backe to confer with Phylastes ) thrust the same through Thaeons bodie, that giuing a pitteous grone, he gaue vp the ghost. Ornatus turning backe, demaunded who had done that deede, with that the murtherer drew backe, fearing to come before him, vntil he was compeld. To whom Ornatus said; What art thou that hast done this deede, art thou not one of his seruants, hast not thou bene maintained by him, did hee not trust thee with his life, was he not thy king, then howe durst thou presume to strike thy maister, be ingratefull to him that gaue thee gifts, proue false to him that trusted thee, and slay thine annointed king? My Lord (quoth he) I did mistake your wordes, and hope to preserue my owne life, made me to do that deede, which I thought would haue pleased you. I am not (quoth he) sorie he is dead, but for that thou slewest him, whom thou in all dutie oughtest to haue defended: for which thou shalt die a miserable death. Then he commaunded that hee should be drawne in peeces with horses, which before he departed thence, was performed. How Ornatus was chose King. How he departed vnknown in search of Artesia . How Lenon sought againe to betray him,  & was disappointed. How he was banished. Tyresus pardoned. And Ornttus and Artesia royally married. The King dead, Ornatus with Phylastes , returned to the Court, where all the Peeres were assembled, who before his comming, had by a voluntarie messenger, vnderstood the manner of Th aeons death, the care whereof was alreadie past, for that fewe or none at all loued him: but now their care was whom to chuse as their King, but first they welcommed Ornatus , none of them all knowing him, nor once suspecting what he was, who now could find no further occasio to coceale himself, but humbling himself before Allinus , he said. My renowmed Lord, the cause I haue so long cencealed my self, hath bin feare of the kings crueltie, and Lenons enuie, who both wold haue indangered me, but now being voyd of that misdoubt, your poore sonne Ornatus , submitteth himselfe, humbly crauing pardon for my neglect of dutie. With that hee vnarmed his head, and his father knowing him, in most louing wise imbraced him, sheading teares for ioy of his safetie, whome he thought had bene long since dead. Duke Ternus and the rest, reioyced to see him, and with imbracings exprest their ioy, entring into admiration of his honoured parts and noble chiualrie. Phylastes being likewise known, was much commended, whom they deemed had bene murthered in the prison by Lenon , for that hee could not be found. Allinus beholding Ornatus , and with what valour he had behaued himselfe, reioyced exceedingly, the Commons clapt their hands for ioy, and the Peeres amongst themselues began to relate howe vertuously, valiantly, and prudently, hee had behaued himselfe in all that he had vndertaken. After many welcomes past, Ternus crauing audience stood vp, vttering these speeches: My Lordes, we need not now defer giuing of Allinus his right, because there is none to contradict what we establish: besides, we being all now assembled togither, & our late vsurping king dead, there can be no fitter time to chuse a new king, and such a one as by right of blood, and by our generall consents may rule vs. Thaeon you know was no way interessed in the Crowne but by vsurpation, and hath rooted out almost all that hee knew to haue any title or interest in our late kings blood: of wich house Allinus issue is the last, by marriage of the Ladie Aura , neece vnto our late king, therefore the right being in him, if there be any man in this assembly that can contradict that which I haue said, let him speak. Which when he had said, he again sat downe. Upon his speeches the Nobles conferd, the people consulted, and at last the common souldiers cryed out, Let Ornatus be our king, Ornatus is our king. The nobles likewise gaue consent to that the multitude liked, and Ornatus was chosen king, whom they wold haue crowned: but at his desire they defered the day of his Coronation for a month. In the meane time, esteeming him as their king, and that day with great royaltie setting him in possession thereof, all businesse for that day being ended, the Armenians richly rewarded, feasted, and with ioy readie to returne, Allinus in quiet but for the want of his Ladie, and all things in good order, Ornatus being alone by himselfe endured much disquiet for Artesia , maruelling what was become of her, sometimes thinking she was slaine by Thaeon , and then supposing she was escaped out at the posterne gate which he found open, that in these contrarieties of doubts he continued, sometimes dispairing, and then again feeding himselfe with hope. After Artesia had rested her selfe, and receiued some part of her sleepe she had lost that night, though but with broken slumbers, she began to declare to Adellena what miseries she had indured, and troubles she had past since she was by Lenon carried from her house, how she met with Ornatus againe, and euerie thing that was befalne, with the cause of her flight at that instant. But Adellena said she, I feare me I shall neuer see him againe, for had he not bin take, and his father ouerthrown, Thaeon could not haue had so much leisure as to come to surprise mee there, but the heauens granted me a fortunate escape. And if I could be so happie as to heare that Ornatus were in safetie, though he had not that successe his desires did aime at, my heart would bee at some rest, which is now pinched with suspitious torment. His aduenterous valiant hart could not be withdrawne by any perswasion to leaue to aide his father, but notwithstanding infinit perils hung ouer his head, yet to shew the dutie of a louing son, and the mind of a vertuous valiant gentleman, he would not desist to hazard his person: which now I feare me is falne into the hands of his enemies. But yet Phylastes I hope wil by his good & friendly counsel be a meanes to keepe him from danger. Many other speeches Artesia vsed: and Adellena vsed as many on the contrary part, to perswade her that Ornatus was in safetie, the truth wherof she told her, she shuld soone know: for (quoth she) I haue sent one of my seruants to learne the truth of all that is happened, who I know wil shortly returne. Which fel out euen as she had told, for the seruant returned, bringing newes of Lenons death, acted by a strange knight, and how that Thaeon was fled, and being likewise by the straunge knight surprised in Arbastus Castle, was slaine by one of his owne seruants. Which Knight, was now knowne to be Ornatus , and was elected King by the Peeres, but he had deferred his day of Coronation, by reason of some speciall griefe that troubled him. Artesias heart was reuiued with these newes, knowing the griefe Ornatus endured was for her absence, that presently she determined to send him word of her safetie: and wrote a Letter, the contents whereof were these. safetie, and nothing more vnwelcome, then to heare of your heauinesse, which I would intreat you to cease, for that I am in safetie at Adellenas house, being by one of my seruants the same night the King tooke my Castle, at a posterne gate in safetie brought hither, where I trust ere long to see you: which wil replenish my soule with exceeding comfort, for on your safetie, my life and felicitie dependeth. Yours for euer, Artesia . Hauing wrote this Letter, shee gaue it to Thristus , willing him to deliuer the same to Ornatus with all speed. Destenies do allot many to exceeding misfortunes, and some men are of that dishonorable and vnmanly dispositions, that they account all meanes to attaine their desires lawfull, not regarding the shame and peril wil ensue thereon. Of which nature was Lenon , who being conueyed from the Campe by his frients, soone recouered, and kept in a secret place, least he might be knowne, hauing no other meanes but by absenting himself to saue his life: whose supposed death, caused Thaeons flight to the greene Fortresse, from whence likewise he was departed before Leno could come to giue him knowledge of his safetie, and knowing that it was then too late to salue those miseries, he still concealed himself, following Ornatus (though vnknowne to him) with intent to murther him, if he could by any meanes take him at aduantage. But he was still disappointed, and withall sawe the death of his father done by his own seruant, stil intermingling hinself amongst the souldiers, that he was taken to be one of them, & neuer suspected. But Ornatus being returned to the Court, Lenon was then compelled to leaue to follow him, and harboured sometimes in one place, and sometimes in an other, hauing knowledge of Artesias absence, he could not tell whether she were aliue or dead: but dead hee thought she could not be, but rather by some meanes escaped. And euen when Thristus was newlie come out of Adellenaes house, Leno espied him, & knowing him to be one of Artesias serseruants, he suspected his Mistresse was there, to whom he came, saying: My friend well met, I take you to be one of Artesias seruants, vnlesse I be deceiued: which if you wil resolue me of, I will do a message to you, that I am willed to deliuer to her from her dearest friend Ornatus . Indeed (quoth Thristus ) I serue Artesia , and am now going to Ornatus with a letter from Artesia , who is in safetie in Adellenas house. Lenon hearing his speech, being before determined what to do, drew out his dagger and suddainely stabbed him, casting his body into a pitte, and taking the letter fro him, brake off the seale and red the contents, which when hee had done, he beganne to studie which way to reuenge himselfe on Ornatus , and afterwardes to get Artesia inio his possession, and for that he thought delay might hinder his intent, he first wrote a letter in Artesias name, the contents were these. of your enemies, is come to my knowledge, then which nothing could haue beene more welcome vnto me. Likewise I heare, that much heauines possesseth you for my absence, that am in safetie: and desire you to meete me to morrow night, and you shall finde me with Adellena , at the lodge in the Parke neere vnto my Castle: in the meane time, remitting all further report of my escape,  & manifestation of my Loue, vntill the happy time I may meete you. Yours in all Loue, Artesia . When he had written this letter, and imitated therein Artesias own hand so neere, that it could hardly be discerned, he went to the Court,  & behaueed the matter so cunningly, that hee was no way suspected, but was admitted into Phylastes presence, to whom hee deliuered the letter. For Ornatus himselfe being exceedingly troubled in his minde, had left the Court, with some three in his company, to go in search of Artesia , & left Phylastes in his chamber, and in his stead, to answere such as shuld come with any suites to him. Phylastes beeing taken of all, but of some certaine that attended him, receiued the letter, promising to meete Artesia there, at the same time appointed, giuing the messenger a reward. Lenon beeing departed, went to a place where he found a certain kinsman of his named Lucerius , to whom he declared both what he was, and what meanes hee had wrought for his reuenge on Ornatus , who without respect ioyned hands with him, and promised with many oathes to explore his life in pursuite of reuenge, who with Lenon included before Ornatus comming, to be in the lodge with a sufficient company to surprise him, & worke the premeditated reuenge. Lenon beeing assured of his aide, next determined to take Artesia from Adellenas house, and to bring her to Lucertus Castle, vntill the time appointed staying with Lucertus , to see him depart with his ambush to the lodge, which he saw effectually performed. Phylastes presently vpon the receipt of that letter, sent out a messenger to seeke Ornatus , & to certifie him, that Artesia would meete him at the lodge wt Adellena that euening, & that he should find Phylastes there: who (beeing by Artesias messenger taken for himselfe) had appointed to be there, least he shuld not conueniently be found. The messenger with great haste departed, & inquiring after foure Pilgrims (for in that habit Ornatus & such as were with him wet) by that time the day drew neere to an end, the messenger found out Ornatus , to whom he declared what Phylastes had giuen him in charge, only mistaking the place, for wheras he should by his direction haue said at the lodge, mistaking Phylastes words, he said at Adellenas house. Ornatus hearing that heauenly tydings, leapt for ioy, presently hasting towards Adellenas house, which was not far off. Lenon to further his attempt (which he thoght he could not with violence execute: for he thought if he should carrie her away perforce in the day time, he shuld be preuented) deuised an answere of the letter, that he had take from Thristus , which he determined to deliuer to Artesia , as fro Ornatus , ye contets wherof were these. me by your seruat, whom I haue imployed about a matter of great importance, that none could so fitly execute as himselfe, which newes was moste welcome to the comfort of my heart, that was almost ouercome with dispaire of your safetie, wheron my chiefest felicitie depedeth. Therefore omitting further recitall of my ioy for your safetie, which this paper cannot expresse, therefore I will meete you soone, where this my seruant will bring you, whose fidelitie I assure you to be such, as that he will do nothing but what I haue giuen him in charge: vntil which time of meeting, I cease all further circumstance of speeches. Yours, Ornatus . With this letter Lenon went to Adellenas house & knocking at the gate, was brought to her, to whom hee deliuered the same, who reading the contents, & being before not well acquainted with Ornatus hand, nothing at all suspected the contrary, but both beleeued that it came from him, and determined to goe with the messenger to meet him: whilest she was preparing to go with Lenon, Adellanaes maide came in, telling her, that there was another to speake with her from Ornatus : with that Lenon changed countenance, and Artesia willed her to bring him in. Ornatus beholding her, had thought to haue imbraced her, & discouered himselfe, but seeing a straunger there, and a letter in her hand, hee stood in a studie. Artesia noting well his countenance, thought it was Ornatus himselfe, but standing in a doubt thereof, said, I haue receiued this letter from Ornatus alreadie, and therfore if you haue any further message from him tell it mee, for any newes from him shall be most welcome. Ornatus thought that it was sent by Phylastes , but not knowing the messenger, meruailed therat, saying: I cannot beleeue that it came from him, for while within this houre, hee had not knowledge of your beeing heere. With that Artesia gaue him the letter, willing him to read the same. Ornatus soone knew that it was inuented by some trecherie, and therfore said: I know this came not from Ornatus , for this is not his hand, nor hee that brought it any of his Seruants, for himselfe sent mee before, appointing to be heere within this houre. Lenon hearing his speeches, wisht himselfe a thousand myles off, fearing to be discouered, for that he could not tell how to excuse himselfe, nor by any colour auoyde that daunger. To whom Ornatus said: My friend, when did hee deliuer thee this letter? Yesterday (quoth he.) Thou lyest said Ornatus , for he hath not beene at the Court these three daies. Lenon thinking with impudencie to outface, hauing no other meanes left, that was likely to helpe him and therefore said: This letter came from Ornatus , and thou lyest in saying the contrary, being some villain that art set to betray this Ladie, therefore (quoth he) speaking to Artesia , beleeue him not for he is come with some euill intent. With that Ornatus had those that were with him lay hands on him, who presently apprehended him, and pulling of his hat, & a subtile disguise that he wore, knewe him to be Lenon , at the first being halfe afraide to touch him, for that they would haue sworne he had bin dead. Ornatus seeing Artesia in an exceeding flight, discouered himselfe, and with great ioy imbraced her, desiring her to feare nothing, Artesia knowing him, soone forgat her feare, embracing him wt exceeding ioye. To whom hee said: Feare him not my deare Artesia , for be it himselfe or his ghost, I care not, it shall goe hard, if hee nowe escape my handes. To whom he said: Most discurteous and cowardly Uillaine, couldest thou not be contented, to liue in quiet, hauing once escaped my Furie, but that thou must by further complots seeke to betray this Ladie, that neuer did iniurie thee? How often hast thou interrupted her quiet, and from quietnesse brought her into misery? and knowing that she could not like thee, yet thou wert so impudent, as neuer to giue ouer thy sute: but to attaine thy desire, first depriuedst her of libertie, banishedst me in the disguise of Syluian , and soughtest to betray my Fathers life: & not satisfied with all these, like a cowardly miscreant, seekest by villanie to betray her: and notwithstanding thou haste beheld thy fathers wofull downfall and meritorious punishment, thou seekest to betray this Ladies life, by some vnknowne trecherie not yet reuealed. For all which, thou shalt suffer such punishment as I haue deuised, and haue power to execute. Lenon seeing himselfe discouered, grew desperate, and scorning to be so rebuked at his hands, whom he still esteemed his inferior, but especially vexed, that it was hee that had so long hindered his Loue to Artesia , saide: Ornatus , I thinke thou hast either forgotten thy selfe, or else what I am, that at thy pleasure rebukest me in such vnciuill and ill beseeming termes. Am I not thy better, and one that not long since, might haue commaunded thee, and is thy minde so much eleuated & proud, that thou wilt not acknowledge it? Thou makest brags of toy victorie, when thou mayst rather with shame keepe silence, & with remorse, repent that thou hast sought the death of thy lawfull king, beeing thy selfe a traitor. As hee would haue spake more Ornatus interrupted him, saying: Hold thy peace, & do not stir my mind to more sharp reuenge by thy replie, for I scorne to heare thee speake, therefore giue ouer, least I punish that tongue of thine for vttering such high words in defence of vice. Since (quoth Lenon ) thou wilt not heare me speak in defence of my selfe, let me be conueyed from thy presence, for thy sight is as odious vnto mee, as mine to thee. Whilest they continued in Adellenas house, a messenger came running in breathlesse, vttering these speches: Behold most worthie Ornatus , I bring a message of much woe and heauie import: yesterday there was a messenger came to the court, that brought a letter in Artesias name to Phylastes , as supposing him to be your selfe, wherein shee requested you to meete her this night at the Lodge in her Parke. Phylastes , who presently sent out a messenger to giue you knowledge therof, not hearing of his returne, went himselfe with some twentie in his company, to the place appointed, and entring, hee found not Artesia there, but a crew of Rebells, amongst whom Lucertus was chiefe, who all at once set vpon him and his followers, taking him for your selfe, hauing so many aboue the small number that were with Phylastes , that they had soone slaine most of them that were with him, and himselfe not able to withstand such a multitude, had receiued many grieuous wounds, & had bin surely slaine, but that the heauens sent them this ayde: It fortuned that day, that Duke Ternus was going from the Court to his owne house, who by great fortune hearing the noise, with his men hasted thitherwards, & hauing knowledge of what was done, most valiantly both himselfe & his men set vppon Lucertus , whom they soone vanquished, hauing first slaine manie of his complices, and him hath he carried prisoner, with the rest of such as were aliue vnto the Court, & with them Phylastes in great daunger of death. Ornatus heart was exceedingly vexed to heare of his deere friende Phylastes hurt, but especially, to thinke that hee had not before attached Lucertus , which he was once in minde to haue done, which would haue preuented all these mischiefes. The night nowe beeing come, Ornatus caused Lenon to be bound hand and foote, and put into a strong place of the house, wt some to to watch him, least hee shuld doe himselfe violence: himselfe with Artesia spending that euening in many speeches, relating the maner of all these misfortunes, but especially comforting themselues in each others loue, with Adellena , calling to remembrance the whole manner of their troubles onely procured by Lenon , which sadde relations made the renuing of their Loue more pleasant and delectable. Early the next morning, Ornatus putting himselfe in his Palmers weedes, and couering Artesias face with a vale, & carrying Lenon with them bound, departed towards the Court. The next morning the Peers of the Land being still there, assembled theselues, amongst whom was Allinus , that likewise had found his Ladie, who hearing of his happie successe against Thaeon , was that morning newly arriued at the Court, and by him entertained with exceeding ioy. By that time they were assembled, & had called Lucertus before them, Ornatus with his companie, were likewise come, thogh vnknowne and standing by, heard Lucertus confesse that Lenon had instigated him to worke that reuenge against Ornatus , himselfe being likewise gone to betray Artesia . The whole assembly maruelled when they heard him say that Lenon perswaded him to it, that Allinus stood vp, saying: Is not hee dead, then how can this bee? Lenon (quoth Lucertus is not dead) with that Ornatus stopping in, thrusting Leno before him, said: Here is the man that hath procured him to all this mischiefe. The Nobles beholding him, were amazed at his sight, but beeing assured it was he, by the perfect knowledge they had of him, Ternus said: Lenon , I had alwaies thought thou hadst borne the mind of a Gentleman, but now I finde the contrary in thee, and that in the most shamefulst degree. What furie led thee to such mischieuous attempts, to hire Lucertus to slay Ornatus , which he hath almost performed? and thy selfe to seeke the death or miserie of that vertuous Ladie, that hath alreadie indured too much wrong by thy folly? Allinus had not as yet heard of Ornatus hurt, nor any knew the contrarie but that Phylastes was he, for hee according to the minde of a most vertuous and constant friend, stil cocealed himselfe. Nor the Lady Aura had yet seene her sonne, whom she had but heard of, that Allinus said: Is my son Ornatus almost slaine? O trayterous villaine. with that Aura likewise began to make exceeding lamentation: which Ornatus was not able to behold, and therfore pulling off his disguised habit humbly reuerenced himselfe before the vpon his knee both his Parents knewe him, and with exceeding ioy imbraced him shedding abundance of teares for his safetie. With that, Duke Ternus and all the rest came to him, vsing him with such behauiour as belonged to him they had chosen King, seating him in an Imperiall chaire. Hee being set thus, said: My Noble Lords, I thank you for intituling mee with this exceeding honour: therefore my desire is, since you haue elected mee of your free and bounteous hearts to be your King, let mee this day and instantlie, be installed with possession of the Dyademe, for that I haue nowe no further cause of care to cause me defer the same: & likewise, that I may giue iudgement against these most wicked conspirators. The Nobles with ioyfull hearts gaue consent, and immediately crowned him, with bended knees doing him reuerece: which done, Ornatus rising from his imperiall seate, came to Artesia , taking her by the hand; and leading her vppe the throne, seated her in the chaire, placing the Crowne vppon her head, saying: My Lords, I pray likewise be contented wt that I do, & as you haue elected mee king, make this your Queene: the puld hee off the vale from Artesias face, and her cleare beautie appeared to the admiration of all, who beholding, in humble sort did her reuerece, making exceeding shouts for ioy, their harts being all exceedingly glad of her safetie. When this was done, she came downe and imbraced them, yeelding them many thankes, who all shewed such exceeding kindnesse, as exprest their hartie goodwill, and reioyced both her & Ornatus to behold: especially Aura and Turnus duchesse, with many imbracings which they thought they could not sufficiently expresse, reioyced to see her in that safety. By that time Ornatus was againe seated & Artesia by him, Phylastes hearing of Ornatus returne being though greeuously wounded, yet in no great danger of death, as well as he could came into the presence, where beholding Ornatus and Artesia crowned, kneeled down before them, his heart conceiuing exceeding ioy, to behold that heauenly sight. Whom Ornatus kindly imbraced, reioycing to see him in that good estate: after Artesias salutation, willing him to sit down amongst
