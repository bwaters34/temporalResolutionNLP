 Transgressions, to the end that People, as many have done, may not think him worse than he was, what ever self-interest would have made him. Nor does he expect that any man will henceforth upbraid him for what is past, as being under the Protection of his Sovereigns Pardon, to which all true Subjects ought to give an awful respect and obedience. Had it not been for the high misdemeanours of Clavel we had miss'd a neat and excellent Poem, and the Discovery of a great Mystery of Iniquity. The Cheats and cunning Contrivances of Gusman and Lazarillo de Tormes have been made English out of the Spanish Language, as well to instruct, as to delight. And the greatest Historians have taken as much pains to recount the Lives of Bad Men, as of the most deserving Subjects of their Pens. Mirrors that do not shew the Deformities, as well as Beauties of a Face, are of little use. In short, all sorts of Men may gather hence, how vain a thing it is, to contend with the Law, and that they must inevitably incur the Misfortune of the Pitcher, by going often to the Well. But the way to amendment is never out of date. St. Austin himself had occasion enough to repent the Follies of his Youth. Not that he goes about to excuse his Offences; but this he hopes he may presume to say, That it was not his custom to put any man in danger of his life, but himself. He only impos'd upon the belief and understandings of others, which being deluded, misguided their Wills. And it is no small Argument, that his being so proper for the designs for which he was call'd out, was half a proof, that his discoveries were true; which perhaps had they not been ill-manag'd, might in some measure have made satisfaction for his past Transgressions; nor does he despair, but that some of them may yet take effect. In the mean time, while he lives to shew that Horace's Quo semel \---is not always true; Let the Vertuous hence observe, how laborious a thing it is to be wicked, and the Vicious learn by his Example to amend. ------ His motives to Travel.  5.

OR THE JUVENILE RAMBLES OF Thomas Dangerfield . sprightly, are the whispers and temptations of Pleasure, and that which Boys call Freedom , Men Extravagant Looseness : Which inclination in forward Striplings being once inflam'd by the inconsiderate severity of Parents, labours with more violence to cast off the yoke of Bondage; so that unwilling to be under the continual awe and terror of the Lash, they rather choose to stand to the favour of Fortune, and the compassion of the wide world, then the cruel mercy of them that begat 'em. A Cynical way of Education, which perhaps many may have learn't from the morose Documents of Solomon's whipping Proverbs, and still as eagerly prosecute, not observing the ill success it met with in his own Son. Upon which instigations, no sooner has incens'd Extravagancy resolv'd to take it's flight, bnt immediately Vice appears in all her Harlotry attire, and exposing all the splendour of her gaudy allurements, so hampers unwary Innocence in the Nooses of Necessity, that not knowing which way to disingage it self the Scene quite alters. So that of a sudden Innocence becomes criminal, before it knows what a crime is, and young offenders incurr the displeasure of the Law, ere they hardly understand what the Law forbids. Till at length perceiving what they have done, and not believing themselves safe from the punishment of lesser facts but by committing greater, they abandon themselves to those unhappy stratagems, which because they relieve at present, are by them lookt upon as the effect of Fortune's favour and their own prudence; so that encourag'd by success, they cannot forsake the delightful practice of those Enormities, which maintain the sweet and tickling pleasures of riot and debaushery. So easie a thing it is for Parents to beget, so difficult a task to hit the true method of Education; for want of which, so many lofty Genius's, so many active courages, so many soaring and refined wits, all tender pieces, ready for all the fair impressions of vertue, have quite alterd their Bias; so many blooming Expectations have perish'd in the deep Abysses of mistaken Conduct, and irregular severity. How near the Subject of this Story was to falling from this fatal Precipice, the ensuing Relation will declare, which, it may be, well believ'd, will prove neither unpleasing nor unprofitable to the Reader, or rather an incitement to acts of Vertue, when he shall observe the pains and labours which extravagance undergoes to support it self in profuse and guilty Luxury. Don Tomazo (for so he must be call'd, as having put his name into the Spanish Garb, to which he was most accustom'd in his Travels) was by birth of English Parents, born in Essex , no less famous for pleasure then plenty. His tender years were under the eye and government of his Father, a person of a severe and disobliging austerity. In him perhaps it might be thought paternal care , who observing which way the current of his Son's inclinations ran, deem'd it the safest course by violence to stop the stream of his unruly passions. And indeed there was sufficient cause of suspicion,  & the Father had a fair prospect of what the future would produce, by the early exercises of his Son's childish Talents. For which reason poor Don Tomazo was not onely daily rated and rebuk'd, but frequently and vigorously chastiz'd, and expos'd to the rigid lash for every trivial misdemeanour. This surly usage so disingag'd the frank and generous humour of Don Tomazo , which was to have been corrected rather by Lenitives then Corrosives, that he look'd upon his Father as a Master rather then a Parent, and himself to be a Slave rather then a Son. So then for redress of these grievances, there must be a speedy remedy provided, for finding out of which his tender wits were soon employ'd. They argu'd in his brain, that there was no living at home, therefore he must venture abroad, and that if a servitude must be endur'd, it was more easie to be born under the frowns and spurns of Strangers, then of near Relations, where Extravagance had no body to thank but it self for the hardship it suffer'd. In the midst of these serious Consultations, the Devil and Ill-Luck soon found him out a Meet-help for his purpose; a pure Satanical Privy-Counsellour, even a Servant of his own Fathers. He was call'd by the name of Jemmy , a Scot by Nation, Nature and Conditions; Indigent, Cunning and Perfidious: true only to the Son to cheat the Father; perhaps out of a desire to revisit his Houshold Gods, at the expences of a defrauded Master. To this Instrument of Belzebub , the young disgusted Squire discloses all the Secrets of his Heart, tells him the occasion of his discontents, and his design to throw off the Yoak of Paternal Severity, which since there was no way to do but by Travelling, he was resolv'd to take that course, and therefore requested both his advice and assistance. Jemmy listned to this Discourse like a Sow i'th Beans; he applauded his design, magnify'd his Youthful Courage, and by a large Encomium upon the worst of Countries, perswaded the Credulous Stripling to Steer toward the North-Pole , to the Land of his Nativity, whither he might be sure of a faithful Guide, and when there, of an Assistant in the midst of Wealthy and generous Relations. This being concluded, they were both sensible that it would be very uneasie Travelling without Horses; but that care was soon over, when Don Tomazo call'd to mind that his Father was well stor'd with that sort of Cattle, and being their own Casuists, they easily overcame all scruples of Conscience, upon a supposition that an Heir in a case of necessity, might anticipate a small pittance of his Inheritance, and that the so doing was positively no Theft. But then again well knowing that neither Horse nor Man could Travel upon the Road, without Corporal Food, and that it was in vain to swear at an Hostler, or to kick a Chamberlain without Money in Breeches; it was farther agreed that the young Squire should fly to London , there to take up what Money he could among his Father's Correspondents, and that trusty Jemmy upon notice given of his success, should precisely meet him at the Rendezvouz, which was before appointed at St. Alban's . These blessed beginnings were so fortunately favour'd by the assistance of their friend Monsieur Satan , who was loth to lose two such fair Gamesters, that all things being accomplish'd according to their hearts desire, away hastens Don Tomazo to St. Alban's , and there meets his punctual Companion with his Fathers two Horses; and so well mounted, the young Master and the young man, Knight-Errant-like, set forward upon their Northern Progress. By the way to make the Journey the more pleasant, Jemmy , who was endued with a nimble utterance, and the true faculty of Scotch lying, entertain'd his Master with several discourses, and among the rest, told him such extravagant stories of the sweet pleasures, the contentment and plenty which he should meet with at his Fathers stately Mansion, that he had rais'd Don Tomazo's expectations Steeple high. But after some days travel, there befel them a small occasion of delay, which somewhat abated the Squires jollity: For it so happen'd, that Jemmy , already possess'd with one Devil, was seiz'd with another Devil of an Ague, which enter'd him with that violence, that to exorcise the robustious Spirit, they were forced to lye still for four or five whole days and nights; in which time Don Tomazo's Father had been-amply inform'd which way the two Edomites were march'd with the Spoyls of his Purse and Stable. How fatal this discovery might have prov'd to these young Practitioners in iniquity may be easily conjectur'd, had the Father been eager to follow them. But he being more tender of his credit, as disdaining the world should know how his grave Experience had been over- reach'd by two raw Whipsters, then to make a noise of his losses, neglected the pursuit; so that upon Jemmy's recovery, the two Knight-Errants set forward again, without any disturbance. But Jemmy , as unsound in body as in mind, having ventur'd too soon into the sharp winter air, (for such was the season of the year which they chose for their Journey of pleasure) before they could accomplish four days travel more, fell into a new distemper, to the great grief and sorrow of Don Tomazo , who had then no small reason to doubt the loss of his Guide, and pillar of his hopes, as finding himself, for the love and friendship which he bore to Jemmy , now more likely to be expos'd then ever to the misfortunes of unhappy Undertakers, easily foreseen, but so not easie to be prevented, especially considering the great expence he then and still was like to be at. These reflections, and the thoughts of being a stranger, without having any Bills of Exchange for future supply, among a rude sort of people that would no longer respect him then his money lasted, which was not likely to be long, at the rate of Nurses and Pothecaries Bills, were sufficient to have confounded all the cogitations that an unexperienc'd Stripling could muster together. But Fortune and good Husbandry so well agreed to encourage Don Tomazo in his first Essays of Gusmanry , that in three weeks time, Jemmy not yet mellow enough for the Devil's palate was well recover'd, and able to undertake the remaining part of the Journey. And indeed he had then more reason then ever to promise a retaliation of that care and kindness which his Master had shewn him in his Sickness: nor, to say truth, could Don Tomazo accuse him in the least while he was yet in England , where he was as lavish of his acknowledgements as could be expected, and protested such works of supererogation at home, as if his Fathers Opulent Seat had been the Mansion of Gratitude it self. But the Reader shall soon find the vast difference between Scotch Promises and Scotch Performances. Well---after a cold and tedious Journey, all weather-beaten as we were, at length we arrived at Jemmy's Father's Palace, lying in the County of Anderdale , near a Town call!d Moffut . When Don Tomazo beheld it, he was so far from being over-ravish'd with joy at the fight, that he took it for some inchanted Castle, in regard he could not see so much as one stone of all that magnificent Pile, which Jemmy all the way upon the road had been building in his fancy. Rather he was more than usually surpriz'd at the humility of the Structure, and the lowliness of the Owner. Had he not been a Scot, you would have sworn him a Turk, regardless of his habitation in this world, in expectation of Fools Paradise in the next. It was a Hovel, or rather Stie, in length about six and thirty foot, not covered Cathedral-like with Lead, nor yet with glittering Copper after the Swedish manner, but according to the Scotch custome, very meanly thatcht with oaten Reeds; not such as the Arcadian Shepherds pip'd withal, but plain down-right illiterate Straw. The fire was made near the Bed-side, at one end, which for want of a Chimney, wrapt the whole Family, Guests and all, like so many Ixions , in a continual cloud of Eye-tormenting smoak. Near to the Bed-side lay the Corn and Hay, which you may be sure was not worth its weight in Gold: and at the other end, without the distinction of Partitions, stood two Sheep, a Cow, and the Squires Horses: So that it may be verily believ'd, that Vertue her self in all her exiles and persecutions never liv'd in such a Homely Hermitage: and Marius , when he lay hid among the Bulrushes in the Fens of Minturnus , might be thought to have lodg'd in a Palace to this ill-favour'd resemblance of Noah's Ark. So soon as we came to this unfortunate Apartment, the Old man, overtaken with joy not only to see his Son, who had been absent from him several years, but to behold him in an equipage so Gentile, after the English mode, could not forbear bedewing his Cheeks; but when Jemmy fell on his Knee to crave his Fathers blessing the old man, who well knew he had none to give, stood amaz'd; What a muckle Dee'l , quoth he, is the Carle wood? Whereupon Tomazo observing his astonishment, acquainted the old Bacon-fac'd Lown , that it was the onely customary way for Children in England to acknowledg their respect and duty to their Parents, and that Jemmy had done it purely out of natural affection, and to shew his improvement in English Behaviour and Education. Thereupon the old man seeming to be better satisfi'd, condescended to the breeding of his Son, and Embrac'd him. Which Ceremonie being soon over, he requested the Squire to enter his Polyphemes Den. But Don Tomazo being very hungry, and not finding the place proper for many Complements, came close to the point, and demanded what Provision they had in the House? To which they made answer, that they had good store of Oatemeal and water, but neither Flesh nor Fowl, Milk nor Butter, Bread nor Drink; and which was worse, that none of these Creature-comforts were to be had for money within six miles of the place; so that poor Don Tomazo who had always far'd well at a plentiful Table, began to curse his man Jemmy , who after such mountainous promises of a splendid Entertainment, and Princely Viands, had betray'd his longing Appetite to such miserable Commons, hardly worth the acceptance of a Country mouse. But Jemmeys Mother, discovering discontent in Don Tomazo's face, and taking pitty of his Youth, or rather for joy of her dear Darlings return, began to comfort up our desponding Stomachs with the hopes of a notable Banquet. This, after the expence of all her Huswifery, prov'd to be that sumptuous Scotch Dish, called a Steane-Bannock , which was a certain Composition of Bean, Peas'n, Barly and Oat'n-meal mix'd together with water, and made into the form of a large Cake, and being set to the fire against a stone, and so bak'd, was to be eaten with water; and this without first or second Course was the cream of their entertainment: a strange sort of Philosophical Diet that no way answer'd Don Tomazo's pamper'd Expectations. Supper, if so it might be call'd, being thus soberly dispatch'd at the meer instance of craving hunger, the weary Guests were no less desirous of repose, then they were before of food; to which the old man repli'd, that 'twas the Fashion in that Country for the Family to go to bed all together, and not one before another, and therefore in regard that Don Tomazo and his Son had prevail'd with him to be conformable to an English Ceremony, he would constrain them to be conformable to one of his Country Customes. Don Tomazo not a little disgusted at his Diet, and like to be worse pleas'd with his Lodging, began to enter into a serious consideration of his forlorn Condition. He found on the one side how miserably he had been frustrated by his man Jemmy , whose faus tongue he now began too late to curse; he saw himself in a wild Desert among a sort of Savages, more prone to make him a prey to their cruelty, then afford him relief: which on the other side fill'd his Head full of jealousies and fears, as now misdoubting that his trusty Man Jemmey had some further designs rather of mischief then of kindness, as being privy to the small Treasure he had about him. To repent was irksome, to fear, below him. There were no shady Woods for Nightingales to lull him into soft slumbers; no murmuring Rills, to which he might make his sorrowful complaints; no kind Hermites to invite him to their Cells. All his comfort was in Hope, and the Compassion of his Guardian Angel. In the midst of these Distractions Don Tomazo perceiv'd through the thick smoak, which forced those Tears from his Eyes that he ought more willingly to have shed, the two aged Parents, and five Children, of which Jemmey was one, preparing for bed; which made him desire leave that he might sit up by the Fire all night. But that request would by no means be granted him; so that poor Don Tomazo was constrain'd to uncloath, and go to bed with the rest. But in that comfortless place he was so far from finding any Sheets, that he scarce found Woollen enough to cover him from the nipping Cold. However, all things considered, the old Man was very friendly; for he laid the distressed Don Tomazo by one of his brawny sides, that smelt like Hung-Beef; a kindness more then ordinary; though it fell out to the unspeakable detriment of the sadly tormented Squire; for the warmth of his Body had soon summon'd together multitudes of that creeping Vermin, Lice, the common curse of the Country; which finding the easie penitrableness of the young Squires tender Skin, and the sweetness of his well-nourish'd Blood, fell to their fresh Viands, with such an eager appetite, that the unhappy Don Tomazo , incessantly tormented with the continual nippings of those hungry Animals, would be often starting up in his Litter to throw off his Shirt, to prevent those villanous Insects from taking possession of the folds of his under Linnen; for which the Old Man as often rebuk'd him. But alas! it was impossible for the suffering Don Tomazo to obey the checks of his surly moroseness, while the sharp-set Vermine were so busily employ'd upon his Carkass, which it was as natural for the rest to endure, as it was to sleep. This restlesness of Don Tomazo at length made the peevish Cinque and Quatre angry; so that at last he began to cry, Don Tomazo was a subtle Karle , and intended to be immodest with his Daughter. Whereupon in a grumbling tone he commanded him to surcease his cunning excuses and lie still: insomuch that the afflicted Squire was compell'd to comply with his austere Governour, and to spend the rest of the night in wishes for the slow-pac'd Morning. Which had no sooner display'd her comfortable Light, but up he rises, leaving the whole Family asleep, designing to be gone forthwith, and rather to expose himself to the mercy of the cold Winds the severe Weather, and the unknown Passages of the rugged Mountains, then to the barbarous kindness of such a savage entertainment for another night. Thereupon, in order to his farther progress, he puts on his Boots, and leads forth his Horse; but going behind the House with his Steed in his hand, (for to avoid the trouble of leading, he had left his other Courser at Jemmey's disposal, as the reward of his Fathers obligations) here Fortune shew'd him one of her cursed slippery tricks, which had like to have cost him his sweet Life, and put an end to all his disconsolations. For stepping by chance upon certain rotten Boards cover'd with Snow, that lay over a deep Well, the treacherous Boards giving way, in dropt Don Tomazo , who had like to have drawn his Horse also after him, had not the Bridle broke. Well it happen'd for the unfortunate Squire, that the Water in the Well was frozen to a considerable thickness, else you might have bid Don Tomazo good night by the Name of Nich'las . But the Ice putting a stop to his farther descent, he receiv'd no more hurt then a slight bruise by the Fall. So odly sometimes bad and good luck conjobble together. However, there he was forc'd to stand in a kind of cold Little-ease, or Lobs- pound, being fall'n much lower then was within his reach to get out again. Now by that he had remain'd there for some time meditating upon his misfortune in Chil-blood, Jemmey gets up, and perceiving his Master gone, runs into the Back-side where he finds the Horse in a cold Trance, wondering what was become of the Grass that us'd to grow in England , but could not imagine where Tomazo should be. In that amaze he flies about to seek him, but not succeediug in his Search, away he posts to Moffutt . In the mean while the Old Man rises, who finding both his Son and Don Tomazo absent; yet seeing their Horses, could not conjecture what the Dee'l should be become of 'em. He waited, for some hours, with patience, expecting their return, but neither appearing, away goes he also to draw Drie-foot after both. The Old-Man prov'd a cunninger Huntsman then the Son; for he tracing the Footsteps which he observ'd in the Snow, came directly to the Well, where he found the unfortunate Don Tomazo , who espying the Countenance of his supposed Deliverer, invokes his aid, and begs his assistance to help him out of his Winter Sweating-Tub. But Don Tomazo was extreamly deceiv'd in the humour of the Churlish Chuff; for he perceiving his Prey in the snare, told the shivering Squire that there were more words went to a Bargain: You, quo he , would have deflow'red my dear Moggee , and therefore you shall stay there a while to cool your courage. Nay farther, quo he , I am apt to believe, that because I spoil'd your sport, you have taken your revenge upon my Son, and made him away; so that until he be found, you are not like to stir. This was a sad Morning Lecture to poor Don Tomazo , who would have given all the Shooes in his Shop for a warm Chimney-corner; but there was no help for no remedy. For the old Villain, full of mischief, leaving him to his Soliloquies, returns to the House, and there consults the Hag his Wife, and his Daughters, as ready as himself to exercise their cruelty upon poor Tomazo , well understanding by Jemmey's information, that he had, what they had been but little acquainted with, both Silver and Gold about him: And therefore having fram'd their design, they came to the Well, let down a Rope, and bid Tomazo to fasten it about him. To these glad Tydings, as to a Voice from Heaven, Don Tomazo cheerfully condescended; so that obeying such welcome Orders, they presently drew him up. But he was no sooner come forth, but the Old Caitiffe was as yare for his Cash; who with a grim Aspect threatn'd to stab him with his Durk , a doleful sight God wott , if he did not fairly deliver all he had. Thereupon Don Tomazo finding himself under the Paws of an unavoidable violence, put his Hands into a Pocket that contain'd about three Pound in Silver, which the false old Miscreant took. But not so contented, he further told Tomazo of the concealment of his Gold, which he must either part with, or with his Life; and with that pull'd him down by main force i'th Snow, menacing nothing less then down-right murder if he did not speedily give it him. Don Tomazo did by no means like this bitter Breakfast; loth he was to part with the life of his Enterprize, and it was as sad a thing to think that he should take so much pains to travel into Scotland to be buried in a Well. While he was in this peck of troubles, the Wife and Children more merciful, prevail'd with the old Tyrant to spare his Life, but to examine his Cloaths for the Gold, which he soon found; and then fetching forth the despoyl'd Tomazo's Horse, bid him be gone, hoping, in regard the Ground was thick cover'd with Snow, and Don Tomazo an absolute Stranger in the Country, that either he might fall into some hole and be starv'd, or else never be able to give any account of the Place where he had been so courteously entertain'd. But Don Tomazo's better Fortune so guided the Horse, and the barbarism of the old Ragamuffin had so imprinted all imaginable Observations in Tomazo's Memory, that they were never to be forgotten. In this forlorn condition Don Tomazo , having wander'd till some time before the next night, and about ten Miles from the Den of his grisly Robber, happen'd to espy a small Village, to which he rode with great joy. There the Scene alter'd, and he found something of generosity in an ancient Gentleman, who was call'd the Laird of Corheid , and owner of the Village, to whom Don Tomazo , after he had made an Apology for himself, gave an account of the Old Mans entertainment. Which being deliver'd by the dismantled Squire in English , the Laird could scarce understand the meaning of his Story, till by frequent repetition he better apprehended the matter, and then gave credit to the Relation; promising Don Tomazo withal, that he would use him more kindly. Upon which he bid the empty young Gentleman welcome, and commanded him to be as free as if he were at his Fathers House: Moreover he assur'd the poor disconsolate Traveller, that the next day he would send his Warrant (for he was in Commission of the Peace) for the whole Family, which had been so barbarous to a Stranger, which he perform'd accordingly; so that both the Parents, and all the Children, together with Jemmey himself, were brought before him. There they met to their sorrow, their injur'd Guest, who charg'd the Old Man so home, that he could not deny the Fact, especially when being search'd, the joyful Don Tomazo's Gold was found about him. Thereupon the old Rogue, his Son Jemmey , and the Daughters, were all pack'd away to Goal. By this time the good Laird of Corheid , being truly sensible of the hainous abuses that had been put upon the succourless Don Tomazo by this same crew of Scotch Monsters, and also possessing a natural tenderness of Heart, took such an affection to Don Tomazo , that he requested him to remain in his House, till he could more opportunely dispose of himself. Which kind and seasonable offer Don Tomazo was unwilling to refuse, especially finding the temper of that whole Family so truly generous, so that he took the boldness to continue there near upon forty days. During which time he had so won the Lairds favour, that he call'd Don Tomazo his Son, and was often wont to take him, when he went a visiting, to the Houses of several Persons of Quality, by whom he was so nobly and familiarly treated, that it would be a foul ingratitude not to acknowledge their most obliging generosity. Now was Don Tomazo as it were in a serene Calme after a violent Storm, living at ease and in plenty; he had seen himself reveng'd upon those violators of the Laws of Hospitality; he found his Money all restor'd, and his company acceptable to the chiefest in the Province: Which had inspir'd so much greatness into Don Tomazo's Breast, that he, according to the Proverb, Taking that for his Country where he far'd best , did not much care to quit his Post. However, considering with himself in the midst of his Delights, that it would be a rudeness beneath the breeding he had shewn, to trespass upon the Laird's good Nature beyond reason, he bethought himself that it was high time to take his leave, yet with a promise to return, (for such was the Lairds obligation laid upon him, provided he could find no better Quarters.) Whereupon he set forwards, being furnish'd with a Letter of Recommendation to a Person of Quality that liv'd about fifteen Scotch Miles from the Lairds House, the most part of which way lay over the Mountains. But now behold another jades trick of that fickle Whore that Men call Fortune . She had for forty days together given the exalted Don Tomazo her sweet Milk, but now she resolves to kick down the Pail; as if by checquering the accidents of his Travels, she intended betimes to teach him what he was to trust to, if he rely'd upon the mutability of her humour. For by that time Don Tomazo had rode about six of the foremention'd Miles, from a little Cave between two Rocks out leap'd a Brace of St. Nicholas Clerks , who violently seizing the Person of the Squire, took away not only his Gold and Silver, that had already been in so much jeopardy, but also his Horse and Cloaths, stripping him to his very Shirt: In lieu of which they gave him a piece of an old Pladd , adding withal, that that sort of Cloathing would make him as perfect a Scotch Man as either of them; and thus penyless, dismounted and naked they left him to pilgrim it over the Snowy Mountains, without so much as directing him one step of his Way. You may now easily conjecture, that this unfortunate Youth had reason sufficient to condole the calamity of his condition. And indeed there was no Person of pity that did not highly blame these rigorous proceedings of that hare-brain'd Beldame Fortune ; but she made answer for her self, that they could be no true-taught Sons of hers, that were not bred up in the School of Affliction: Experience was not to be learn'd by living at a certain rate of content and plenty: It was the mixture of good and bad luck that was the Mistress of Knowledge. Quo she, this young Gusman will be the better for these two Robberies, and this damn'd Walk over the cursed Rocks, as long as he lives. This is the way to try whether he have courage, whether he have patience, whether he have ingenuity. And so indeed it happen'd; for though at first the strip'd and ransack'd Cavaleer could not forbear lamenting the rashness of a Journey that had brought him into so many almost intollerable misfortunes; yet resuming his natural courage, rather then return in that miserable condition to the good Laird, (who would most certainly have cloath'd and entertain'd him as before) he resolv'd to march forward, and to try, since he had no more to lose, how he might revenge himself by getting something from a People that had taken all from him; a task very difficult to be perform'd among the Sons of Poverty it self, in a Country as barren of Riches as the Mountains that disfigure it. Full of these thoughts Don Tomazo steers his course by accident to another Lairds House, whose Title was the Laird of Creyback Borne ; to whom the rifled Squire related his last misfortune only, omitting all the former Passages, nor owning that he knew any Person in the Country, but only that he was travelling to Edenburgh , where he was in expectation of meeting with some Friends. This Lairds compassion was not much inferior to that of his first acquaintance; for when Don Tomazo had told him his Story he clad him with a Suit of his Sons Cloaths, civilly entertain'd him all night, and the next morning, after he had directed him the best way to Edenburgh , gave him also three Pounds Scotch , which is five Shillings Sterling, to bear his Charges. From hence Don Tomazo walk'd on, till he came to the old Town of Peebles , about ten Miles from the last Lairds House, and still in the same County, where it fell out that he met with the very Persons that had so lately discharg'd him of the burthen of his Cloaths and Money; but though he kept 'em company, and drank with 'em, till he had spent half his small Stock, their disguises were such as preserv'd them altogether from his knowledge, till it was too late to prosecute his revenge. His Tut'ress Fortune had a mind to keep him fasting, on purpose to put him upon Tryals of skill. She knew Necessity, and the lowness of his Pocket, would soon constrain him to summon his Wits to a Consultation for Replenishment. Every Fool can put the Sweat of his Tenants in his Pocket; He's the darling of Fortune that carries his Estate in his Brains. She never forsakes the bold and daring, O brave Wits! for by their prompt assistance Don Tomazo , now at a desperate pinch, had call'd to his remembrance a way what to do; not to laze under hedges, not to go whining from door to door, to court penurious Charity; but to cheat the Crafty, out-knave the Knave in grain; to white-wash Boatles , one of which is the sixth part of a Peny, so as to make them pass currently for a certain Scotch piece of Silver, call'd a Forty-peny Piece, which amounts to twenty Boatles in Copper. Of these Pieces Don Tomazo , by the help of some Ingredients which he bought at Peebles , had got good store, which being by him vended for good, in a weeks time put about five Pounds in his Pocket. And thus you see the wide World is no dangerous Sea for one that can swim. With this jolly recruit Don Tomazo , now a Don indeed, returns to his friend the Laird of Corheids , to whom he related the manner of his being rob'd the second time, which the good Gentleman could hardly believe, till Don Tomazo had describ'd one of the Persons most exactly well, and the other so near as could be possible. The first happen'd to be one of the Lairds Tenants, who had often seen Tomazo , and knew of the Gold and Silver's being restor'd to him at the Lairds House. The temptation of which booty prompted him to act a crime, which he had never been guilty of before. But that lame confession serv'd neither his nor his Companions turn; for being both apprehended, they were both sent to Goal, Companions in their punishment, as they had been Associates in the Crime. Which put Don Tomazo into some apprehension of his own danger, fearing lest his condition might be the same, should he linger much longer near the Places where he had so lately been sowing his counterfeit Pieces. But Fortune that desir'd his improvement only, not his ruine, found out a way to deliver him. For about two nights after, as the Laird was sitting by the Fire with his Family, and Don Tomazo , there arose a discourse concerning the misfortunes of Don Tomazo ; at which the Laird fell into a rapture of admiration, how miraculously Heaven had deliver'd the Unfortunate Stranger; saying very devoutly withal, That surely Providence had reserv'd him to be an Instrument of some great Work or other. And therefore, lest the noise of Don Tomazo's Gold and Silver might prove a Bait for others to destroy this precious Instrument, he resolv'd the next morning to go for Edenburgh , to look after the prosecution of the Prisoners, and to take Don Tomazo along with him, as indeed the Proceedings of Justice requir'd. Now the Road to Edenburgh lay through a Village call'd Perkessen , where Don Tomazo had been very busie in vending his Forty-peny Pieces. So that as he pass'd through the Town, the Person who had exchang'd the greatest part, espying him, ran to stop his Horse; at which the Laird being surpriz'd, demanded of the Fellow, whether he intended to rob him? No, said he, but I want some Money which that Person, pointing to Tomazo , cheated me of about five days since. But the Laird had too good an opinion of his Son Don Tomazo , to give credit to his Story; but rather believ'd that the noise of his Gold being spread over the Country had set the People a gog to be hang'd for it. So that the Laird , putting Don Tomazo before him, without taking any farther notice of the Villagers complaint, rode on. By which means Don Tomazo scap'd a scouring, and got clear to Edenburgh with his true Friend the good Laird , who carri'd him to one of the Judges to give in his Testimony against the Prisoners; but Don Tomazo being under age, could not be admitted as Evidence against them, and so they were all acquitted. At Edenburgh Don Tomazo accidentally met with certain English Gentlemen, whose curiosity had lead them to travel into those Parts. These Gentlemen knew Don Tomazo , to whom he related the occasion of his coming thither, as also how he had been treated, as well by the Laird in particular, as others: He also gave them an account of his misfortunes and deliverances; which as they were Stories pleasing to the Ear, induc'd them to take Don Tomazo for a Companion, and to make the same provision for him as for themselves. After which they went with Don Tomazo to wait upon the Laird, to give him thanks for the great favours he had shewn their Country-man. Which piece of Complaisance was so grateful to the Laird , that after he had drank a Bottle or two in the Company, with Tears in his Eyes (for such was his affection to his new Son) he took his leave of Tomazo in particular, and then of the rest of the Gentlemen. Where note, that it is not for Clowns and Men of sullen tempers, but for Persons of accute complyance, and airy behaviour, to be Gusmans . With these Gentlemen Tomazo travel'd through divers parts of Scotland , which prov'd a very pleasant Journey; in regard those Gentlemen had Letters of Credit to most Persons of Quality in the Country; by whom they were for the most part very nobly entertain'd with good Musick, and other Rarities; nay in some Parts their splendid Equipage produc'd such credit of it self, without their Letters, that some Gentlemen of the Country would stand at the back of a Chair, waiting while they sate at Dinner, using no less then the Title of Lord to the meanest of them, though they endeavoured as much as in them lay to perswade them to the contrary. Thus having travel'd almost through the whole Country, and meeting nothing worthy observation, the Gentlemen fac'd about homewards; when coming to a Town call'd Dunfreize , upon the Borders of England , they concluded there to rest for a Week or so: in which time they became acquainted with several of the Inhabitants of the Place, with whom they us'd to drink smartly. One day among the rest, as they were merry at a Tavern, an old Woman came into the Room to beg a Glass of Wine; and in particular of Don Tomazo ; who for that very reason refus'd to give her any, unwilling to assume a preeminence in the company of Friends to whom he was so much beholding. At which the Woman went away, refusing to take Wine from any other Person, but threat'ning Don Tomazo with most dreadful misfortunes, and an immediate Curse that should attend him; which the Gentlemen little regarding, drank on to that excess, that very few, if one went home sober. That night Don Tomazo was not in a condition, but the next morning he went to look after his Horse, which he found in such a posture as amaz'd him; for his Body was drawn up in such a strange manner, that his Head and his four Feet were all in a huddle together; besides this, the colour of his hair was alter'd, and a thick white Foam bedaub'd his Chaps from one side to the other. This putting Don Tomazo in mind of the Womans threats the night before, made him suspect her for a Witch. Which he found upon enquiry had been the hard opinion of her Neighbours for many years. Upon which information Don Tomazo , possess'd with immediate revenge, or rather to draw blood of her, according as his Nurse had taught him, went to the old Womans House, where he found her cutting of Wood. So soon as she saw him, it seem'd to Tomazo , that the antickness of her behaviour was such as shew'd her jealous of Tomazo's design in coming to visit her, who while she discours'd him smoothly and calmly enough, waited for nothing but an opportunity to surprize her. At length, perceiving she had got a great Stick in her hand that she could not easily cleave, Don Tomazo very officiously desires her to give him the Bill, and to hold one end of the Stick, to which she readily consenting, Don Tomazo , having by some discourse or other oblig'd her to look another way, with a home stroak cut off one of her Thumbs, and so leaving her to curse and ban him to the Devil, went immediately to the Stable, where he found his Horse upon his Legs in decent order, and feeding as well as if nothing had ever ail'd him. This accident of the Witch, if such she were, exalted Don Tomazo to a very high pitch; as believing he was, or should be some great Hero. For, quo he, Ulysses was belov'd by a Witch, and Æ neas was belov'd by a Witch; St. George was charm'd by a Witch, and Don Tomazo was belov'd by a Witch. So that had he given her Wine, and not cut off her Thumb, who knows what happinesses had been prepar'd for him. But having cut off her Thumb, she withdrew her affections from him, and was so far from advancing his Fortunes, that she complain'd to the Magistrates of the Town of the loss of her Joynt; for which she accus'd the English Lad , as she call'd him. Whereupon the English Lad was sent for, and upon a full examination of the matter, committed to Prison. For indeed he own'd the Fact, and upon what occasion he did it, but could not make out by any sort of reason why he should assume the doing of justice to himself. The rest of the Gentlemen offer'd to be his Bail; but nothing would serve but one of Tomazo's Thumbs, which the Magistrate protested should be cut off, and given to the Old Woman to burn before his face. Which rigorous Sentence you may be sure did not a little trouble Don Tomazo . But Fortune, who knew he had more occasion for his Thumb then the Old Woman, was for none of those Mosaical Executions, so that what by her assistance, and the Gentlemans industry, a Rope was convey'd to Don Tomazo , by means whereof he made his escape out of the Goal, without paying his Fees; and so being privately convey'd out of Town to a Place where his Horse stood ready, he receiv'd directions to post with all speed to Carlisle , and there to stay at an Inne appointed, till the Company came to him. Which by the good conduct of Fortune, and with no small hazard he accomplish'd, being pursu'd almost to the Walls of the City. About a week after arriv'd his Companions, who being suspected to have been privy to Tomazo's Escape, were detain'd by the Magistrate till they had pay'd their ten Crowns apiece to the Poor of the Town, which amounted to a considerable Sum, there being five in number. These Gentlemen being come to Carlisle , found there their beloved Tomazo , for which they were not a little joyful; their kindness to him being nothing inferior to the Laird of Corheids . From Carlisle they set forward for London with all speed; where in a little time being safely arriv'd, the Company separated, and Don Tomazo was left to himself; who though so near his Parents, was almost in as bad a condition as at his first entrance into Scotland . But necessity prompting him to some serious resolution, the Story of the Prodigal Son took possession of his Pate, and he began to study how to be reconcil'd to his Father. A kind Office which was soon accomplish'd by the Intercession of a particular Favourite of his Fathers, who so far prevail'd, that Tomazo , after a hearty sorrow and deep contrition for his Crime, was again admitted into his Fathers favour: both expecting various effects of the past Ramble; the Father believing that the Son, now well read in the Lectures of necessity, would be more careful how he plung'd himself into the same Exigencies again; and the Son presuming, that the Father now knowing what it was to want a living Child, would be more tender of provoking him for the future. In both which Conjectures both were mistaken. As for Tomazo (for while he is under his Father's Roof we must un-Don him) for about half a year he continu'd very patiently within the bounds of modesty. But the continu'd austerity of his Father, together with certain Impressions that Love had made in his Heart, soon put his discontents into an uproar, and quite alter'd that composure of mind, which had given such life to their hopes of his becoming a new Creature. The Don began to close again with Tomazo , and all his passions being in a ferment, so alarum'd his Father, that he was forc'd to double his Guards. However, notwithstanding all the Fathers diligence and correction, the Son, having laid aside all thoughts of reformation, and forgotten all his vows and protestations of penitence, betook himself so far to his former more natural, and consequently more pleasing extravagancies; so that the Old Man, no longer able to endure the bad Examples which he gave in his Family, one day in the Garden took an occasion to acquaint Tomazo that he must depart those Walls. This Sentence sounded very harshly in Tomazo's Ears; and therefore duly weighing the misery of an eloignment from his beloved Mistress, a near Neighbour, the great dangers he had escap'd in Scotland ; his present ease, and the apparent extremities he should be expos'd to by the Casualty of new Travels, he began to intercede with his Father, whose good nature at that time was easily prevail'd with to have some farther patience, provided his Son would keep up to his promises of mortification. But Tomazo being engag'd in an Amour with a loving Female, that was the sole and first Mistress of his affections, had not the power to perform his engagements, and therefore found out a ready way to unravel all his Fathers hopes. This Mistress of his was Daughter to a neighbouring Gentleman, in her thirteenth year, of no great Fortune, more then what Nature and Art in point of Education had accomplish'd her withal; which for the most part are the chief allurements of Youth, especially such as are not capable of taking a prospect of their future well- being. Between these two Children, as I may safely say, for Tomazo was not then above fourteen years of age, there was an amorous intreague so cunningly manag'd, as could hardly be expected from such early Lovers. To which purpose the Damsel, who had a Father as severe in all particulars as Tomazo's , had order'd our meetings in the night; to the end she might steal her enjoyments, when the old Gentleman thought her most secure, that is in English , fast asleep. Tomazo's condition was the same. So that for several nights they entertain'd each other with all the amorous caresses that an innocent and harmless converse could afford. But it so fell out, that Tomazo was unfortunately suspected by his Father, whose Argus Eyes kept a continual Watch upon him, even to that degree of strictness, that nothing would serve but that Tomazo's Quarters must be remov'd to a Chamber, the passage to which lay through his Fathers. So that it was almost impossible for Tomazo to meet his Mistress that night, as by solemn Promise, sacred among Lovers, he had engag'd himself to do. But Love, that has more ways to the Wood then one, furnish'd him with an Expedient; for Tomazo , considering the vast damage it might be to him, to disappoint a Lady that ventur'd all for his sake, resolv'd to make the attempt, though it were through his Fathers Chamber. With this resolution of a deeply-smitten Gallant, up he rises, puts on his Cloaths, and laying in his place a Periwig and a Block with the face of the Block turn'd to the Wall, and carefully heal'd up for fear of catching cold, he takes a Sheet along with him, and adventures cross the old Gentlemans Chamber, who being more wakeful then Tomazo expected, over-hear'd him, but yet let him alone, well knowing the door to be fast, and the Keys of all the House to be safe by his Bed side. Tomazo understood all that before, and therefore not to put himself upon vain and fruitless delays, he takes his Napkin and his short Stick, Utensils that he had ready fix'd, goes to the Window, and having with much Art, but no noise, drawn the Barr, he fastens his Sheet, lets himself down into the Garden, and thence with no less speed then joy, repairs to his Mistress, whose patience was almost tyr'd with waiting for his company, which she had scarce enjoy'd above two hours, but break of day-light forc'd them to retire. But before that time, Tomazo's Father, having heard something trip through his Chamber, concluded that it was his gracious Son; but because he was almost assur'd that he could find no way out of the House, he therefore expected his immediate return, which not being made, the Old Gentleman, mistrusting some treachery in his own Sense of Hearing, consulted his Wife. She was of the same opinion, that it was impossible for Tomazo to get out of the House, and therefore undertook to perswade her Husband, that Tomazo was return'd to his Chamber. However, the Old Gentleman, not being satisfy'd, gets up, and taking a Candle examins the Bed; where finding a Head with hair that lay very snug and quiet in a true sleeping posture, he could not imagine but that Slipstring was fast in Morpheus Chains, who was then indeed in the Fetters of his Mistresses Arms. But Jealousie and Age, being generally such inseparable Companions, it would not out of the Old Gentlemans Pericranium, but that either some Hobgoblin, or some Thief had been visiting the Secrets of his House: and therefore resolving to be farther satisfy'd, once more up he takes the Candle, down Stairs he rumbles, and examines all the Doors; but finding all fast, in a pelting chafe to be put thus to dance about i'th' cold, in his Shirt, up he comes again; when, loe, as he ascended, he spy'd a pittance of the Sheet hanging within the Window, whither he march'd immediately, and observing the posture of the contrivance, concluded there was a Robbery in the case. Thereupon the Old Gentleman calls up his Servants, and bid 'em search the House: who finding all things in due decorum, brought in an absolute Ignoramus , to the great amazement of the Master and themselves: in which astonishment he returns to his warm Wife, and relates the Story to her. She presently call'd 'em all Fools, and bid 'em call up Tomazo , who there was no question to be made would soon unfold the Mystery. Thereupon one of the Maids was sent to wake him; who receiving no answer, began to jog the Block, believing it to have been the drowsy Body of her Masters Son; which she did so rudely, that the Block, turning, the black Physiognomy of the graven Image, star'd her full i'th' Count'nance. Which so terrify'd the Maid, that she ran to her Master, crying out, that Tomazo was murder'd, for he look'd black i'th' face. Upon which the Master and Mistress both rose, and went into Tomazo's Chamber; where, upon a true examination of the whole matter, they discover'd the Plot, and so leaving the wooden Idol in the same posture, as it lay when the Maid first found it, they went to bed in expectation of Tomazo's return; who soon after made his silent entry, and having rectify'd the disorders of the Window, stole bare-foot through his Fathers Chamber, who heard him well enough, into his own, and with much inward satisfaction for the purloyn'd pleasures he had had, went to supply his broken rest, not dreaming he was discover'd, in regard he found all things as he left them. But woe is me, before Tomazo was well settl'd in his repose, the Father, no longer able to conceal his passion, came to correct the amorous Night-walker. Tomazo , by the cloud upon his Fathers Brows, perceiving the Storm coming, pleaded hard for mercy, beseeching his Father to consider, that the innocency of his years could not draw him forth to any more then only a merry-making with honest and civil Persons, some of whom he well knew. But that would not qualifie the incens'd Old Gentleman, who at first laid on very smartly; but observing no returns of childish howling, but rather a manly suffering, and passive submission to Paternal Authority, he forbore any farther School-boys chastizement, which he saw was, but thrown away upon one that so little regarded it; and upon Tomazo's further entreaty came to a Capitulation, which produc'd these Articles of Agreement, That the next fault that Tomazo did commit, he should be thrust out of doors, never more to see his Fathers face again. This was a doleful Sentence, yet but a Flea-bite to the irresistable commands of Love. An Article with a Father was not to stand in competition with a Promise made to a Mistress. And the Devil would have it, that he had made one to meet her again the night following in the same place. So that, after the mode of Princes, Tomazo soon found a flaw i'th' Treaty, and was resolv'd to venture a breach, though he lost the reversion of all his Fathers Dominions. Thereupon, being inform'd, that his Father, who look'd upon him as a Carthaginian of no faith, was resolv'd to lock him into his Chamber the next night; by way of prevention, Love inspir'd Tomazo to go in the day-time and pluck up one of the Boards under his own Bed, which gave him free passage into a Cellar, and so through a Window as before. That done, the hopes of enjoying his Mistress made Don Tomazo very pleasant the rest of the day, having made so fair a progress already, which gave his Father no less cause to suspect that he had some notable Stratagem in his Pate, that made his Heart so light, and therefore that night he resolv'd to watch Tomazo's motion himself. Which being come, and the usual hour having summon'd the Family to bed, Tomazo was lock'd into his Room; where, after he had made a seeming preparation to go to bed, he fell to work, and first having remov'd the Board, he let down his Cloaths with a Line, the passage not being otherwise wide enough for his Body: then he descended himself, like an Angel from the Roof of a Play-house, and thinking himself as secure as a Thief in a Mill; but no sooner was he in the Cellar, but at the same moment his Father was in the Room, who immediately seizing the Line, drew back all Tomazo's Cloaths, and left him to meditate i'th' cold Cellar all night in his Shirt, having nothing to keep him warm, but the heat of his desire; a sort of practice of Piety which no way agreed with Tomazo's temper. These disappointments did but serve to height'n Tomazo's Resolutions, whose Fires meeting with reciprocal and equal Flames, burnt with that ardent heat, that the least separation from the Object of his Love, was a gash that wounded to the Heart, not to be endur'd. Love of it self, crafty and subtle enough, is a meer Devil in a young Gusman, lawless as an Irish Torie , as impatient as Ajax , and as cholerick as Hector . So that had not his modesty argu'd hard against it, he had ventur'd, as he was in his Shirt, to shew himself a punctual Lover to a most faithful Hero , who had spent all the night in waiting and moaning, and moaning and waiting for her dear Leander , till the Tell-tale Sun began to peep into her amorous Sanctuary. At what time, despairing, sighing, and accusing the Infidelity of her young Gallant, she retir'd to her broken rest; while on the other side the Old Gentleman came not only to release his languishing Pris'ner, but also to discharge him without Fees out of his House; according to the Conditions of the Treaty so lately concluded. Which as soon as he was apparel'd was absolutely perform'd, and poor Peel-Garlick turn'd adrift into the wide World in a worse condition then when he travel'd for Scotland ; for then he had the Blessings of Mony, now not a Boatle in his Pocket. It was now high time to consider what course to steer. The last disappointment of his Mistress had so confounded him in his Amours, that he had not the face to appear in his Mistress's sight. He thought it a crime so far beyond forgiveness, that he durst not crave it. And therefore giving her over for lost, (for he was yet but in his Love-primmar, and had not learn'd those Lessons of cajeoling tender Damsells, which afterwards he became a Doctor in) he abandon'd all his Amorous Thoughts, and rather chose the retirement of a Hay-cock the remaining part of that day, there to condole his Destiny. So soon as it was night with the Beasts of Prey, to avoid his discovery, he began his Rambles, steering directly for London , once more to try his Fathers credit, which prov'd not so hide-bound as the Old Gentleman intended. Who suspecting that Tomazo would make bold with it, as he had formerly done, had, by way of prevention, fairly warn'd all his Correspondents not to pay any Money upon his account, without a Warrant under his own hand. Now was Tomazo , with a slender stock of Nine-pence, arriv'd at Englands Metropolis, where he was hard put to it to find a Lodging. However, he ventur'd couragiously into a publick House, and having refresh'd himself with a moderate Supper, he calls for Pen, Ink and Paper, and then drawing a Letter of his Fathers out of his Pocket, he did most exactly counterfeit the Old Gentlemans Hand, to a Person of his acquaintance, for thirty Pound; who not at all suspecting the Note, but extreamly jealous of the Messenger, of whom he had had some former experience, was at a wicked Nonplus what to do about the delivery of the Money. At length, rather then run the risco of disobliging Tomazo's Father, the politick Citizen found out an expedient; which was, that he would send his Servant and the Money with Tomazo to his Father, to which Tomazo chearfully agreed. So the Money was immediately deliver'd to the Servant, with positive orders not to part with his Treasure to any Person living but Tomazo's Father. With these Cautions the Knight of the burning Pestle and Tomazo set forward toward his Fathers forbidden Gates. Upon the way, Tomazo , full of invention, often courted his Companion with the Temptation of drink, a Bait that would not take with a zealous Writer of Shorthand, so jealous-pated, that when he came to a House upon the Road, where he had a mind to rest himself, he deliver'd his Charge to the Master of the House to secure it, while he took a nap. Tomazo wholly intent upon his Prey, and watching all opportunities with the vigilance of a Tigre, was not a little troubl'd at this reserv'd wariness of the coy Purse-bearer . But such was Tomazo's patience, that he stifl'd all his discontents, and still beheld his Companion with the careless glances of a merry Countenance. After some hours of slumber and repose, Tomazo and his cautious fellow- traveller set forward again; but going over a Heath, they met with several Persons that inform'd them that if they went such a Road, they would be certainly rob'd, as they themselves had been but just before. Which so alarum'd the Cuckow-brain'd Prentice, who was order'd to deliver his Money to none but Tomazo's Father, that to prevent a compulsion to breach of Trust, he examin'd Tomazo what private ways there were that led to his Fathers House? Blessed Mercury soon inspir'd Tomazo , so that he presently call'd to mind a solitary by-way through long Grass and Corn, which prov'd so tiresome, that the careful Londoner , to ease himself in some measure of his Burthen, believing he could deal well enough with Tomazo , most inauspitiously desir'd Tomazo to relieve his weary Arms. Tomazo most affectionately embrac'd both the Opportunity and the Bag; so that from that time they carry'd it by turns, to the great but different comfort of each other. About eleven a Clock at night (for so eager was the faithful Trustee to be at his Journeys end) it came to young Iscariot's turn to bear the Sacred Load; who had no sooner lodg'd it next his Heart, but Judas's own Devil possess'd him, and presently taught him a trick, that Monsieur Blunderbus should be no more troubl'd with his Burthen. For Tomazo passing by a heap of Stones, privately, but with a dext'rous slight of hand, takes up a good big Brickbat, and lays the ador'd Mammon in its place. Soon after, Tomazo being to go over a Bridge, makes a false step, as if he had been near a fall, and drops the Stone into the River. Which the City-Dromedary hearing, demanded what it was? 'Tis the Money, reply'd Tomazo ; Pox take it, quo he, let it go and be hang'd,---better let the Money fall, then suffer my self to be sous'd at this time a night. The poor Seagul was in such a dismal consternation at the news, so that his Senses were just packing up their Awls to be gone from a place where they prophesy'd that they should be but very rudely entertain'd by the Passion of the Master, upon his Boobies return; in so much that Tomazo , who all the while laugh'd in his sleeve, would have given something to have had his Picture as he then look'd. In this amazement trusty Tom-Fool would have perswaded Tomazo to have put off his Cloaths, and to have gone into the Water to make search for the Money, which Tomazo , to avoid all suspition, willingly offer'd to do, but withal told Nickapoop, that it would be but a vain attempt without the help of a Candle. So that he easily perswaded the tame Dottrell, now as submissive as a pump'd Bailiff, to stay by the Bridge while he went back to certain Houses about half a mile off to get a Light. In his way, Tomazo had recover'd and secur'd his Money, and so making forward to the Houses, call'd up the People, told them the misfortune of young Nicodemus , desir'd their assistance, and sent them all, for a company of Fools, to the Bridge, where while they were poking, and groping, and treading a Mortar i'th' Water with their bare feet, Tomazo having travers'd his Ground, and taken another Road, had made a fair step in his way back to London , leaving Tom-Tottie to con the short Lesson of Experience which he had set him. So far Tomazo had reason to applaud his own Ingenuity. But Fortune would have her turns and her changes, to shew him he was yet but a young Gusman, and that there were others superior to him, whose Art was not to be learnt by Rules of Accidence or Grammar , but by a suffering Experience. For he had no sooner secur'd himself in the City, but he fell into the company of certain Town-Bullies, who carry'd Tomazo , to Speirings Ordinary, where having easily allur'd the young Squire into play, they soon reduc'd the thirty Pound, for which he had taken so much pains, and which he look'd upon as one of the Trophies of his Mercurial Stratagems, to twenty Shillings, to the great grief of Tomazo , who, to add to his afflictions, had receiv'd Information that his Father was also in pursuit of him. For the dejected Counter-scrubber , perceiving as well by the vain search that the People had made, as by the not returning of Tomazo , that the Serpent had been too crafty for him, with a heavy Heart jog'd on to the Old Gentlemans House, and there told the uncomfortable Story, not daring to venture his Masters displeasure, though there were not above two Inches difference in the depth of their understanding, only the Master trusted the Man, and the Man trusted Tomazo . Upon this Alarum Tomazo makes down for Gravesend with all speed, where he was inform'd, that several Ships lay bound for the Straights . Whither Tomazo resolv'd to venture, rather then fall again under the Jurisdiction of his Father. There it was that Tomazo , to whom Fortune was never more kind then when she had empty'd his Pocket, while he was treating with one of the Captains for his Passage to Cadiz , met with two of the Gentlemen, with whom he had travel'd in Scotland , bound in the same Ship, for the same place. To those Gentlemen, as to his Confidents, he made known his condition, and related all that had befal'n him since the time that they parted at London . True it is, that the Stories of his Extravagance were not so pleasing to their more serious humours; however, for old acquaintance sake, they promis'd to take such care of Tomazo , provided he would be govern'd, that while he continu'd with them, he should want nothing that was convenient for him, (a kindness easily within their Power, as being the Sons of Persons of Quality, and Heirs to fair Estates;) and thus far Tomazo had Greymolkin's luck, still to fall upon his Legs. While the Ship was under Sail, the two Gentlemen and Tomazo had several Consultations, how to shape their Travels after they came ashoar; in order whereunto it was agreed, that they should travel all Spain first; and after that set Sail for Æ gypt , from whence they would visit India, China, Tartarie , and so through Muscovie and Germanie home into England again. Full of these design'd Rambles, they arriv'd at Cadiz , from whence they made hast to Madrid , where they had not been above four days, but one of the Gentlemen happen'd to kill a Spanish Count, which occasion'd an immediate and diligent enquiry after all Persons that had been in his company. Thereupon the Gentlemen, upon notice of the search given them by a Blackamore -Maid that serv'd in the House where they lodg'd, stole away afoot through all the by-ways of the Country, shaping their Course for Ligorn , and leaving miserable Tomazo behind, without either Money or Credit, who in two days after was apprehended, and in that bless'd condition committed to Goal. There he found several other English People, whose Crimes were only their acquaintance with the Gentleman that had kill'd the Count ; which Gentlemans Name (the sequel of the Story so requiring) is to be henceforward Don Pedro Perguelio . But such was the kindness of the Spanish Justice, that when the Search was over, all the Pris'ners were brought before the Court, where nothing appearing against them, they were all discharg'd. Had not Tomazo had a wonderful Love for the Light of the Sun, it had been all one for him to have confess'd the Fact and been hang'd, as to starve for want of mouldy Crusts: Such were the violent persecutions of a hungry Stomack, under which Tomazo pin'd and wasted at that time. But, if it had not been for these blessed Butts , of which you shall meet with anow, before the Story concludes, poor Tomazo had been half worm-eaten by this; but then I say, it so fell out one day, as Tomazo was walking upon the Parade among the Soldiers, for his inclinations were always Martial, a certain Captain , whose Name was Don Pedro del Viejo Castello , perceiving Tomazo , by his Habit, to be a Forreigner, ask'd him his Country; to which Tomazo reply'd, of England ; for which the Captain liking him much the better, perswaded him to list himself in his Company, which lay then at Puerto Ferrara , promising him due payment of his Wages, which came to three half-pence a day; but withal by his deportment giving Tomazo to understand that there might be some hopes of advance, and better usage for an English-man , then for the riffraff of the Country. The Offer, considering the nick of time, was as welcome to Tomazo , as Rain to the parch'd Earth, he having been a Stranger to all sort of Sustenance for some time. So that now being advanc'd on a sudden from the Grave , to be a Gentleman Soldier, he again resumes his forsak'n Title of Don , and marches away in state to his new Quarters at Puerto Ferrara . There he liv'd about three quarters of a year, upon his foremention'd allowance, and the augmentation of a pound of Bread a day; at the end of which term, the Garrison was in a most violent manner besieg'd by the Portugueses , with whom the Besieg'd had many Encounters; in one of which the Collonel of Tomazo's Regiment being kill'd, Don Pedro del Viejo Castello succeeded him in the employment: who not forgetting Don Tomazo in his advancement, whose courage and behaviour had very much won his Heart, took such a special care of him, that he rais'd his Pay from three half-pence to four pence, and after that, for some works of super-arrogation that Don Tomazo perform'd, from four pence to eight pence a day. About which time the Besiegers drew off, leaving all their Trenches in good order, and retreated home for some time; which gave the Town both leisure and opportunity to recruit. During this Calm, the rest of the Soldiers, who had recover'd their Spirits, envying Don Tomazo's Prosperity, and the great esteem which his Collonel had for him, enter'd into Cabals and Consultations among themselves to contrive his ruine; but finding no success in their Spanish Plots, a Brace of the Conspirators undertook to attaque him by main force; and in pursuance of their design, one evening, at the turning of a Corner, set upon him with that violence, that Don Tomazo was very severely wounded; but having recover'd himself, he drew forth a Pistol, and shot one of his Assailors, who soon after dy'd of his hurts: and while he was in pursuit of the other, a Corporal came in to his assistance, who took the other, and secur'd him upon the Guard. Nevertheless, upon the death of the first Aggressor, Don Tomazo was try'd by a Counsel of War; where, upon a full examination of the Fact, Don Tomazo was acquitted with great applause, and the other Assailant that was taken, both degraded and cashier'd. This Exploit made Don Tomazo more famous then before, and more esteem'd and redoubted in the Garrison. So that when the Enemies return'd again, and renew'd their Attacques upon the Town with that fury, that the Inhabitants began to be apprehensive of the loss of the Place, several of the better sort deliver'd their Jewels to a very considerable value to the custody of Don Tomazo , the better to secure 'em upon the surrender of the Town. Which being no longer, after several rude Assaults, able to hold out, yielded upon honourable Conditions, and so the Spanish Garrison march'd forth, and as one of the Number, Don Tomazo . Who now possess'd of so fair a Booty, and knowing the danger of Delays, went to his Collonel for a Pass-port. The Collonel, unwilling to part with Tomazo , promis'd to advance him to a Commission, and to make his Fortune, provided he would stay in his Service. But Tomazo , who had an unknown Fortune within the compass of his Breeches, gave those pressing Arguments for his departure to his Collonel, and press'd him so home, that at length vanquish'd by Importunity the Collonel granted him his Pass; by vertue of which Don Tomazo posted away for Ligorn , as fast as his Legs would carry him, and there embarqu'd for Scanderoon , whither, he was inform'd, some English Gentlemen had taken Shipping about fourteen days before, with a resolution to visit Grand Cairo . When he came to Scanderoon , upon enquiry, by all descriptions he guest them to be the Persons that had left him to his shifts at Madrid ; which was the reason he was not very follicitous to follow them. At Scanderoon therefore he stay'd, till upon the sale of some of his Jewels to a Jew that was bound for Ligorn , he was inform'd by his Landlady, an English-woman , that that there was an express come with Orders to apprehend him. For the Jew coming to Ligorn , presently offers his new Purchase to sale, and, as the Devil and ill luck would have it, to a Merchant nearly related to the very Person from whom Don Tomazo had receiv'd them, who had also particular order from his Relation, to seize all such Persons as should expose any such sort of Jewels to sale, of which he had sent a particular description. So that the Jew being question'd about the Jewels, informs against his Chapman, and discovers where he was. Thereupon Don Tomazo thought it high time to shift his Quarters, and posts away with all imaginable speed for Grand Cairo ; where if a Man do but alter his Habit, 'tis impossible to find him out. To which purpose he puts on the disguise of a Turk , and in that dress one day met with his old Fellow-Traveller, Don Pedro Perguelio , who admir'd to find Don Tomazo in such a Mahometan Garb; but being acquainted in few words with the occasion, he receiv'd ample satisfaction; more especially when Don Tomazo farther told him, that at that distance from his Country, he could in that Heathenish City command a thousand Pound. Which was at that time no Rodomantado, in regard the Jewels were worth above four times the value. Certainly there can be no greater pleasure in this World, then for one distress'd Gusman to meet another of the same Order flush in the Trophies of succesful project; Gusmans being the only relict of the Golden Age that have all things in common; so that if one has it, the rest never want. So that it is but reason that the Purses of Fools should pay Tribute for the maintenance of such a noble Generosity. Don Pedro was upon his last Legs, when the happy accident to meet a Member of the Fraternity so richly laden, made his Heart dance in his Breast without a Violin. On the other side, Don Tomazo understood that it had not been so much the ill husbandry of Don Pedro which had brought him so low, but a generous Charity to two English Gentlemen his Comrades, who dy'd there of the Plague, the Expences of whose Sickness, together with their Funeral Charges, had exhausted him to a very small Remainder. So that as if the two deceased Gentlemen had left Don Pedro the Executor of their gratitude, from thence forward Don Pedro and Don Tomazo enter'd into an inviolable League as well offensive as defensive, in so much that though they were two Bodies, there were the same thoughts and the same mind in both, and an united force now manag'd all their intreagues. Grand Cairo is a City famous for its situation, and the variety of Pleasures it affords all Persons so well able to purchase 'em as then Don Tomazo was; who resolving to know the difference between three half-pence a day, and the splendor of unlimited plenty, concluded with his friend to debarr themselves of no freedom or recreation which Money could command in the greatest Mart of the World. But as the Sea it self would dry up, without the continual supply of swelling Rivers, so it was impossible for Tomazo's unreplenish'd Bag, had it been as deep as Virgils Passage to Hell, to answer the Expectations of a Brace of Scattergoods , that thought it would never be ev'ning: till at length their inconsiderate profuseness having reduc'd their lean Bank to the low ebb of not above a hundred and fifty Pounds, Repentance stept in, and put them in mind of the calamities of Poverty, a very unsuccessful remedy to cure the Surfeits of Excess, among the pitiless Adorers of Mahomet . Thereupon they began to think of a new Ramble; and understanding that there was a Caravan of 800 Passengers ready to depart for India , both the Dons agree'd to make a part of the Company. But the season of the year for passing the sandy Deserts proving more tempestuous then usually, gave them leisure enough to spend a hundred and twenty Pound out of their low Stock, (for the curses of the credulous Portugueses had by this time taken their desir'd effect) so that they perceiving no more then thirty Pound remaining, alter'd both their Resolutions and their Habits, and embarqu'd from Scanderoon for Genoa , where they continu'd fourteen Months, to the total consumption of all the Portugal Booty. Then it was that Necessity put Don Tomazo to employ the Talents of his Youth, to which purpose he made Love to a Genoese Widow , over whose Affections in a short time he had obtain'd a Conquest, that very fairly answer'd both his own and his Friends Expectations. But having made that Post too warm by debauching the Woman, getting her with Child, and wasting her Fortunes, they departed incognito in an English Man of War, that brought them safe to Cadiz . Where they behav'd themselves so well, that the Merchants gave them daily invitations, and were very free in all manner of accommodations. But one day among the rest, Don Tomazo , to retaliate the Kindnesses they had both receiv'd, (for true Gusmans never mind Morality) propos'd to his Friend Don Pedro a Design, which had it taken effect, would have made them Masters of a new Fortune to the value of above five hunder'd Pound. But it so happen'd, that as they were walking upon the Beach , in a deep Consultation about the most compendious and effectual way to proceed in their attempt, not minding their way, they were rambl'd about a League from the Town, where they were overtaken by three English Gentlemen, who were in pursuit of eight Land Pirates, for a Robbery and Murder they had committed the night before upon the Person of Thomas Lucie Esq;. These Gentlemen requested their assistance, which they readily promis'd and joyn'd in the Pursuit. After a chase of four hours they found one of the Criminals sitting upon a Sand-hill, who pretended himself half dead. This crafty Devil sate there as a Decoy, having planted his other seven Confederates under the Sand, whence they were all ready to rise with Pistols and Stilletto's if occasion requir'd; as indeed it most unfortunately fell out. For the Gentlemen eagerly falling to search and examine the single Pickaroon, he presently gave the watch-word to the rest, who presently rising from their Ambuscado, fell upon the Gentlemen, not a little surpriz'd at their number, and their Instruments of death, with that violent fury, that one of them was kill'd outright, having receiv'd near twenty stabs with a Stilletto, and the other two so wounded, that they were left for dead. Tomazo was shot in the Back and Shoulder, and Don Pedro prick'd in five or six places with a Spanish Tuck, and both convey'd by the Victors among the great Sand-hills. The other two, who were left for dead, made such hideous out-cries, through the extremity of their Pain, that a Spaniard sishing not far from the Shoar, came and took them into his Boat. Don Tomazo and Don Pedro had the good luck to tast of the Free-booters mercy, who very carefully dress'd their Wounds, as if natural instinct had prompted them to be kind to Persons that liv'd upon the spoil as they did; and when they were in a hopeful way of recovery, perswaded them to enter in their Society, and to run the risco of their Fortune: which there was a necessity for the two Dons seemingly to condescend to. Nor was it long after the compleating of their Cures, before those Sons of Rapine had cut them out an Employment. For those Miscreants hearing of a parcel of Merchants that were to pass by their Territories, set the two Dons to guard a Pass upon the Road to Madrid , which was convenient for an Escape if need requir'd, while the Master-Rogues, having met with the unfortunate Merchants, rob'd them of their Goods and Money to the value of six thousand Pounds Sterling, of which they gave a reasonable proportion, according to the justice of Thieves one among another; promising that the next time they should be both equally concern'd. From thence they made to their Sanctuary among the Sand-hills; a Place which did not afford those delights to the English Gallants that their Hearts panted after when their Pockets were full. Whereupon Don Tomazo and Don Pedro agreed to make their Escape in the night; which an odd accident much facilitated to their advantage. For one night among the rest, which prov'd darker then ordinary, one of the Pickaroons being upon the Watch, certain flashes of combustible Meteors appearing among the Sand-hills, so terrifi'd the guilty Sentinel, that he awak'd his Companions, who believing the Country was risen upon 'em, and hearing Don Tomazo and Don Pedro affirm withal, that they had heard the Voices of strange People, put the villanous crew into such a Consternation, that for their better security, they concluded to march off several ways by couples, having appointed a Rendezvous when the danger was over. The two Dons keeping together, steer'd directly for Cadiz , being follow'd by two more of the Gang aloof off. Upon the way they met with two of their old acquaintance in the Town, with whom they presently agreed to pillage the two Pickaroons that came behind, which they did, leaving them sorely maim'd and beaten upon the place, and so with light Hearts and heavy Purses continu'd their Journey to Cadiz : where being arriv'd, they were entertain'd with great joy by their former Correspondents. Being thus got together among their Friends, the main discourse of the Company was about two English Gentlemen that had been most barbarously us'd by eight Thieves, and of two other English Gentlemen that were gone away with the Robbers. Thereupon Don Tomazo having first made enquiry how the Gentlemen did, and understanding they were safe and well, began to relate the whole Story, confessing himself and Don Pedro to be the two lost Sheep; and after that gave them an account of the last Robbery. Which happen'd not a little to their disadvantage; for one of the Merchants that had been rob'd being then in company, spar'd not to bellow forth his Losses and his Usage; insomuch that the two Dons being conscious, that they had about them some of the Goods which the Merchant had describ'd, and unwilling to run the risco of a discovery, thought it very conducing to their future safety to refund what the Merchant laid claim to, and to put the rest into the Hands of the Magistrates, who promis'd them an ample recompence for their fidelity; but were never so good as their words. Which cost one of the Spanish Merchants, by way of revenge, a Cornuting; Don Tomazo having enter'd into a League of Familiarity with his Wife, to the production of a very comfortable subsistance for himself and his Friend while they continu'd in the Town. At length, perceiving no more good to be done there, and finding several Ships bound for England , they embarqu'd for the Land of their Nativity in one, which by the Masters ill conduct, had the ill fortune to be cast away; so that there had been an end of all the Ships company, and the two young Gusmans had been coffin'd in some Sea-Monsters Belly, had not a Dutch Vessel been so kind as to send out their Boat, and save all the Men, whom they carry'd along with them to Amsterdam . A Place to which Don Tomazo and Don Pedro were both absolute Strangers. But finding several English there, they told their Tale so smoothly, that they found very compassionate entertainment among their Countrymen. During which leisure time, Don Tomazo having made his interest with a Burger's Wife, had soon wheedl'd the Loving Soul out of three hunder'd Guilders, which amounted to near thirty Pound English . With this Money the two Dons having pick'd up and joyn'd themselves in confederacy with two more Spaniards of the same Order, Philippo de Mexico , and Gulielmo Porfeire , fell to the National Cheat of Coyning; wherein, after they had cut their own Stamps, they were so successful, that in two months time they had fill'd all Amsterdam so full of double Stivers, compos'd of three parts Copper, blanch'd with Arsenick, and one Third Silver, that there was hardly any other Money stirring among the Butter-boxes . By which piece of dangerous Industry, they advanc'd their Stock to twelve hunder'd pound Sterling. All which being rightly consider'd by the four Engineers, they forsook Amsterdam , and retir'd with their Bank into Zeland . Where they were no sooner arriv'd, but the twelve hunder'd Pound had so inspir'd them with high thoughts, that then little gains were look'd upon as ridiculous, and nothing would serve less then ten thousand Pound apiece. For the raising of which Princely Sum there was a general consultation of all four Heads; wherein it was concluded, that Doublon Stamps, Ducatoon Stamps, and all sorts of Stamps for Spanish Gold should be forthwith prepar'd; but the Metal could not be fix'd, till near four hundred Pound of the main Stock was embezel'd in Experiments, and necessary Expences. But then, Fortune, loth such Men of Art and Industry should lye any longer idle, found them out a Composition to their Hearts desire, consisting of one Third Copper, artificially tinctur'd with Yellow, one half Third Gold, and half Third Emery, and one Third super-fine Silver. Of which Metal they made about 2000 l. according to their modest computation, and the Conscience they us'd in putting them off. Which that they might do with the more facility and speed, they dealt with all Persons, bought the best Commodities, and gave the largest Rates. And for the better management of the Affair, every Confederate had his particular employment assign'd him. Philip de Mexico , and Gulielmo Porfeire , were to reside at Middleburgh and prepare the Coyn; Don Pedro was the Merchant that bought the Goods, and Don Tomazo the Factor, who resided at Gaunt , whither all Commodities were and immediately expos'd to sale, or transported to Places more secure. But this Trade lasted not long: For Philip de Mexico being a Person inclin'd to all sorts of debauchery, one day gave a certain Female, that had caress'd him with more then ordinary civilities, one of his counterfeit Pieces, who having a sudden occasion for Money, as Women of that Profession are seldom Hoarders, carry'd the Piece to exchange for Silver with a Goldsmith, who had forfeited his judgment by being bitten with about 30 Pieces of the same nature before. Whose revenge exasperating him to a strict examination of the Woman, she was constrain'd to discover where she had it; and then to go along with the Officers of the City, and shew them Philip's Lodging, who was immediately surpriz'd and apprehended with all his Materials and Instruments about him, and, without enquiry after farther proof, committed to Prison. This apparent discovery, and the great alarum it gave the whole City, was notice sufficient for Don Pedro and Gulielmo to shift for themselves, who made all imaginable hast to Don Tomazo , to whom they related the doleful disaster, and the sad tydings of their interrupted Commerce. Thereupon Don Tomazo sold off all his Merchandize, and having quarter'd his Companions in a Village near to Gaunt , he went himself to Middleburgh , with an intention to use all his endeavours to help Philip out of the Briars. But by that time he had been twice with Philip in the Prison, and had order'd all things ready for his Escape, there came in the middle of the night several of the Officers of the Town to seize Tomazo , upon information given to the Heers against him by Philip himself who not believing it was in Don Tomazo's power to bring him off, was in hopes, by an ingenious confession, and the conviction of Don Tomazo , to save his own Bacon. But his treachery did him no kindness. For he wanted Money, without which there is nothing to be done in that, nor in any other part of the World. On the other side Tomazo had plenty, and with his Golden Showers so mollifi'd the Goalers Daughter, that she not only brought him an Iron Instrument to dig his way through the Wall, a Rope to let himself down, and a Boat to receive him, but accompany'd him her none tender self, leaving Father and Mother for the sweet satisfaction of her fleshly appetite. Being both safe in the Boat, away sail'd Feliciano and his Feliciana to Flushing , and from thence without any Provision put to Sea, where they drave, almost starv'd to death, upon the Wide Ocean, till Fortune threw them at length upon the Coast of Flanders ; at what time they quitted the Boat, and travel'd the Country by Land, like a Tinker and his Doxey, till they came to Don Pedro and Gulielmo , to whom Don Tomazo gave an account of the kindness Philip would have done him in requital of his pains and friendly Intentions. Nor was it long after that we heard of poor Philips being transported to the other World in a Caldron of boyling Oyl, according to the Sentence of his Judges; which sort of terrible Execution did not little startle the rest of the Confederates, yet not so as altogether to daunt 'em in the progress of their profession. For Don Tomazo, Don Pedro, Gulielmo , and the Goalers kind Daughter, whose Name was Mariana , removing to Brussels , they fell again in that Place to their Zeland sport, resolving to hazard t'other Caldron; where, after they had made a considerable quantity of Coyn, they took their several Stations and Employments of Merchandizing, till all their Pieces were gone. Which good success encourag'd them to go on afresh. But so it fell out, that Mariana , who had alter'd her Habit, and went for a Dutch Minheir , and Gulielmo , going one day to Court to buy Horses of Count Monterey's Servants, were spy'd by a Person of Quality, of whom they had purchas'd other Horses before, and pay'd him two hunder'd Pistols of Coyn out of their own Mint. This same Person was a certain Count , who made such a noise, that the whole Court was alarum'd, the Parties accus'd were both apprehended, and sent to eat the Bread of affliction in Lobbs-pound; where they endur'd no small torment both of Body and Mind; especially Mariana , whose misfortune was the greater for want of her dear Don Tomazo . But neither were his Love nor his Jealousie so importunate nor so vehement at that time, but that he was content rather to trust the Spaniard with his Mistress, then venture his Carcass for them, as he had done for Philip . A piece of ingratitude which his Conscience and Self- preservation were forc'd to dispense with at that time, in regard he was too well known to be their Sollicitor. Which was the reason that both the wary Dons stole privately away for Dunkirk , there to attend the Issue of Gulielmo's and Mariana's Imprisonment; who in a short time after were both convicted by their own Confessions, and forc'd to evaporate their Souls in boyling Oyl, as Philip had done; by an Infernal Torment in this, the better to prepare them for the bituminous Tan-pits of the other World. The news of which hellish Execution reaching the Ears of the two Dons at Dunkirk , the very thoughts of Dutch and Flemish Crucibles so cool'd their courages, that for the future they resolv'd utterly to abandon the Melting Trade. And believing that Time would obliterate the memory of these extravagancies, they resolv'd to employ themselves in Travel, as they did through most Parts of France . But returning for Calice , with an intention to embarque for England , the boyling Oyl had so perfum'd those Parts, that not able to endure the scent, they retreated to Diepe , from whence they arriv'd safe and sound at Rye in Sussex , where when they came to cast up their Accounts, they found themselves reduc'd to 500 l. apiece; a sound Foundation, could they have had the patience to build upon it like either Suttons or old Audleys . But they had no skill in Grazing, or Maulting, or setting up of Brew-houses, by which they had known as many ruin'd as rais'd: They were for the quick dispatch: They were for drink and be rich: They look'd upon themselves like two Children of Israel , and all the World beside as Æ gyptians ; from whom they thought it no crime to borrow in their necessity. And Gusmans call that Necessity, when they want Fewel to feed the heat of their Prodigality. The inseparable Don Tomazo and Don Pedro being thus return'd into their Native Country, like two Sons of Priam, Per varios casus, per tot discrimina Rerum , made hast to London , the Grand Receptacle of all the most refin'd Virtuoso's in Gusmanry, where they made it their business to repair the loss they had sustain'd by the parboyling of their Spanish Companions. Nor was it long before they had found out a parcel of Projectors as fit for intreague as themselves, to whom they communicated a certain Conundrum, which they had just coddl'd in their continually working Brains; the sum and shape of which piece of Midwifery was this: That six Persons should lay down 300 l. apiece to fit out a Privateer to Sea; a Gudgeon quickly swallow'd among Persons that took all for Fish that came to Net. Thereupon there was a Person employ'd to go to Dunkirk to buy a Vessel, and to fit and Victual her out to Sea. They that made the Grand-Councel at London were to pick up Men, and to have them ready to go aboard, when the Vessel should arrive upon the Coast of England ; wherein the concording Gusmans were so punctual, (for the Sinews of their War began to wast) that the Men being convey'd away in Boats, the little Dreadnought set forward in pursuit of her design, which was no less then the intended Destruction of the whole Guiney Trade. See here the difference between a Spanish and an English Gusman ; the one pursuing a poor hungry Plot upon his penurious Masters Bread and Cheese; the other designing to grasp the Riches of the fourth part of the World by the Ruine of a National Commerce. Thus with a firm belief that they should have ballasted their Ship with Dust- Ore, they hois'd their Sails; but being driven by most violent Storms upon the Coasts of Ireland , they lost both their Vessel and all their Hopes; no other good luck attending that Voyage, but only that of saving the Men, which were in number above three hunder'd, who dividing into small Companies for convenience of Travel, took several ways to seek for new employment: by which means the Coast of Guiney scap'd a most desperate scowring, and the African Company had a very great deliverance. Don Tomazo and Don Pedro , so lately Men , though now but Mice , kept still together Companions in misery, and coming to Dublin , by the instigation of pure necessity, (a thing which the morose Law never considers) fell to their old Trade, which was to counterfeit Guineys , and broad Pieces of Gold. Which after they had done, and carry'd on about two Months, some as good and as expert at the sport as themselves, not enduring interlopers to their own prejudice, trac'd 'em out, and found their Quarters. Where they gave the Dons very courteously to understand, that that small City was already too well stock'd with Gravers of the Kings Image, and therefore desir'd the Right Worshipful Copper-smiths to depart, lest worse befel them. Upon which kind advice the two Dons took shipping for Bristol , a Place much more fit for their purpose. There, being loth to draw Bills, and break the bulk of their London Stock, with a poor inconsiderable Bank of thirty Shillings, of which fifteen were Mill'd, they began again. Those fifteen Mill'd Shillings did the Two Dons Knights Service; for being double guilt, and in-laid with Scepters, they march'd off currantly. Upon which Foundation they wrought so long with ease and little expence, till they had well lin'd their Pockets, were well mounted, and in a good condition to ramble. From thence, well knowing the danger of staying too long in a place, they rode to Glocester . Where after they had made up near three hunder'd and fifty of their own St. Martins Ware, they were disturb'd by an officious Rumor, and forc'd to ride the Country. During which Journey of pleasure, in exchange either for good Mony or Commodities, they put out all their illegitimate Pieces to Nurse. After which, like a little running Pestilence, they went to infect the City of Worcester . There the Two Dons met accidentally with four other Persons of the same profession; who being pursu'd by the Country, were apprehended in their Company. At what time one of the Strangers, to prevent the Fatality of a Search, convey'd under the Table into Tomazo's hands a certain Bag both large and weighty. Don Tomazo was with Child to know the Contents, and therefore being got to his Lodging, his dear Pylades and he made bold to open the Bag; in which they found six Letters to as many Gentlemen in the neighbouring Counties, a Note of considerable Sum of Money left with an Inn-keeper at Bridgenorth , and 220 false Guineys most artificially and elaborately order'd. The Letters they open'd, took Copies, and seal'd up again; having found by the Contents how Affairs stood with the Gentlemen to whom they were directed. Thus fortunately provided Don Tomazo and Don Pedro departed forthwith, and galloping tantivy to Bridgenorth , they receiv'd 337 l. from the Inn-keeper. From thence they took their Rounds to visit the six Gentlemen, who being all Persons of valuable Estates, and fearing to run the bloody hazard of having their spotless Reputations brought upon so dangerous a Stage, upon the delivery of the Letters, and a relation of the misfortune that attended the Persons from whom they came, willingly bled their fifty Pound apiece for an obligation of Secrecy. The Two Dons having thus made the best of their Market, left the Gentlemen for that time, and took a Ramble for Stourbridge , where being forc'd to continue, by reason of an Accident that befel Don Tomazo's Horse, they liv'd to the height of their Estates. During which demorage, Don Tomazo's behaviour (always taking among the tender Sex) had infus'd such a passion into the Heart of a Gentlewoman in the Town, who wanted neither Wit nor Caution to manage her amorous Diversions, that partly out of gratitude, partly for profit, (for he seldom lov'd but for his advantage) partly for pleasure, his friend and he were forc'd to encamp in that Place much longer then they intended, Don Tomazo passing for a German , and humouring that pretence with broken English . All that while Don Tomazo lost no time in improving the advantage of his Amours, nor spar'd for any sort of Caresses which he thought were proper to entertain so kind and bountiful a Lady. But that Post growing too hot, through the jealousies and suspitions conceiv'd of Don Tomazo and Don Pedro , in regard of the high rate they liv'd at, the two Sparks were forc'd to remove; though not without taking leave of the young Lady; who was so concern'd for the loss of her dear German's society, that the magnetick Vertue of his Embraces had almost engag'd her in a resolution to be the Companion of his Fortunes. But Don Tomazo not desiring to travel with the expensive Molestations and Inconveniences of Female Luggage, diverted her affectionate humour with such powerful Arguments, that at length they parted, though not without some Briny Deluges that overflow'd the sorrowful Ladies Rosie Cheeks. Don Tomazo having thus disingag'd himself from the Labyrinths of Love, after a prodigal wast of his Venerial Ammunition, set forward, with his other self Don Pedro , for London , where they ranted with a profuse pomp and vain-glory for about half a year, till finding their Exchequer grow low, they began to think it time to recruit. Neither was it for such extraordinary high-soaring Gusmans as they to play at ordinary Games; whose prodigality was not to be supply'd by the dipping of Country Squires, or the little Cheats of high and low Fullums . At that time the French and Dutch were at Daggers drawing; and they understanding that there was a Fleet of Holland Merchant-men in the River of Thames , very richly laden, to the value of eight hunder'd thousand Pound, all outward bound, under a Convoy of two Men of War, of 40 Guns apiece, and very well mann'd, concluded upon a design to surprize these Ships and their Convoy, and to make them Prize, by vertue of a French Commission, with which they were already furnish'd. First then in order to this attempt, by their acquaintance with some of those Sea-men, who had been fellow-sufferers with them in their intended Voyage to the Coast of Guiney , they rais'd a very considerable number of Men, which by the leave of the Captains of the Dutch Men of War were to be put aboard their Ships, under pretence of being rais'd as Recruits by certain Officers employ'd from Holland for that purpose. And it so happen'd that Tomazo's great diligence had found out a parcel of such Sons of Necessity, as had not only Dutch Commissions, but as good a Will to the Design as himself. These Persons treated with the aforesaid Captains for the carrying over so many Men for the Service of the States, which the Captains were very willing to undertake for the good of their Country. So that in two days time, the whole Fleet lying at Gravesend , the Major part of the Men were sent aboard, in the Habit of new rais'd Men, but all resolute Sea-Tories, and privately well arm'd with Poynyards and Pistols. These were to have been the fatal Instruments of the grand Surprize. For it being the custom at Sea to divide the Ships Company into three parts, that make three Watches, of which one is to be always upon the Deck, it was so laid, that the English , in the dead of the Night, after they had secur'd the Powder-Rooms, should run upon the Decks, shut down the Hatches to keep down those that were below, and cut the Throats of all that made resistance above. By which means having got the Command of the Men of War, they might with ease have commanded the Merchant-men, and so have made for the French Ports, where their Commissions would have born them out. About two days after the Men were thus dispos'd of, the pretended Dutch Officers sent down about forty large Trunks, of a prodigious weight, with particular care to put them aboard in the night, for fear of meeting with the Searchers. All which Trunks were fill'd only with Hey and Bricks, to possess the People with a belief of some considerable Treasure, or some great quantity of Arms that might be in them, to avoid the suspition of Men whom they saw entrusted with such a ponderous Charge. By this time the Wind stood fair, and the English Officers were order'd by the Dutch Captains to repair aboard with the rest of their Men; in order whereunto they went all down to Gravesend , where the Officers having sent their Men aboard, went themselves ashoar, and in their company Don Tomazo and Don Pedro , the Master-wheels of this confounded piece of Mischief, under the Notion of Servants to one that pass'd for a Lieutenant-Colonel. Thus far things went prosperously on, and the Gale of Fortune blew as fair, as the Wind then favourable to the Voyage. But the Devil's i' that thing call'd Fond Love . Which has made me think that the Poets did ill to couple Mars and Venus together, considering how many brave Martial Designs have prov'd abortive through the open-heartedness of Amorous Folly. For to the total destruction of this Babel -like structure of two unwearied Brains, it happen'd that one of the Men who went last aboard, and was to have been a private Sentinel, was marryed forsooth to a Dutch- woman , who had so ravish'd, or rather infatuated him, upon the Leave-taking Night, that, like the hair-brain'd Curius , he could not conceal from his charming Fulvia the great Design he was going upon. Whereupon the plaguy Dalilah , out of a pure affection for her Countrymen, went and discover'd the grand Plot to the Dutch Captains, who were at first struck with a strange kind of Terror to see themselves so near the brink of danger; but soon recollecting themselves, they kept their discovery close, not making it known to any but the Officers of the Ships. After that, having prepar'd all things for a close Fight, they order'd all the English which were above to go under Deck upon pain of death, which they did all but some resolute Fellows, who being over-power'd, were beaten, wounded, and forc'd down. Which petty Conquest being thus obtain'd, and the fatal Sinons secur'd in the Bodies of the two Trojan Sea-Horses , one of the Captains was sent ashoar to entreat the English Officers to come aboard, in regard the Fleet was ready to set Sail. But those Sons of Guilt and Jealousie reading something more then ordinary in the Dutch Captains face, one of them, with a loud Oath, swore, they were all undone, and was making an offer to shift for himself; but the Dutch having rais'd the Town, had so beset the Houses, that they were apprehended every Mothers Son, and deliver'd up to the Magistrates, with a general Information against them of the Crime, and of the Design they had in hand, but not a word in the least of the Men which they had secur'd in the two Vessels. The Dutch Captains having thus escap'd a Danger ten times worse than that of Scylla or Charybdis , weigh Anchor, and being safe arriv'd at their intended Port, acquaint the Great Minheirs what a Whirl-pool they had so narrowly miss'd, and deliver'd up all their Pris'ners to the mercy of the Hogen Mogens , who order'd them to be sent to the Indies for eight years, while they that were seiz'd at Gravesend were discharg'd for want of farther prosecution, and so return'd to London . In which wide Place, neither Don Tomazo nor Don Pedro durst shew their Heads, as having not only spent their own ill-got Bank, but run in debt to defray the Charges, which you may be sure the Expences of such a Design would require. Such is the Fate of Gusmanry, sometimes to abound, and sometimes to want Bread. In which condition the two reduc'd Projectors were forc'd for a while to sit and bite upon the Bridle: Till in some short time, having rais'd so much Money as would pay for their Passage to Harlem in the Low-Countries , they embarqu'd for that Place, where the two Dons prevail'd with a certain Merchant to furnish them with thirty Pound, for the re-payment whereof they drew a Bill upon another Merchant of their own invention and nomination at London . Thus set up again, they departed for Amsterdam , where they possess'd the English with so firm a belief of their being young Irish Merchants, who had suffer'd Shipwrack; that they, compassionating their condition, assisted them with Money and credit to the value of a hunder'd Pound. Which good success in those two Places made them resolve to try how high they could build upon this same odly begun Foundation of the Worlds opinion. Which is many times the beginning of a Trade that advances several to vast and real Fortunes. In order to this Design, away they go to Rotterdam , where they found an English Merchant; who being newly crept into the World, struck in with Don Tomazo and Don Pedro , who pretended to be of the same Profession; and that they would send for Goods out of Ireland with the next opportunity. Upon which score the Dutch Merchant furnish'd his two new Partners with Wines and other Commodities to the value of 400 l. which were presently ship'd off for Flanders by the general consent of all the three. Into that Country the inseperable Couple follow'd their Game, and at Bruges set up their Staff. There, for a short Apprentiship serv'd their turn, they fell to trade with the Merchants of the City, and barter'd their Commodities very fairly for Irish Goods, and with good advantage. And which was more, very honestly from time to time sent the effects to their Correspondent at Rotterdam ; who by that Hocus of just dealing was so satisfy'd with the reality and good intentions of his two Irish Chapmen, that they continu'd trading together for above a year, in which time he had furnish'd them with Goods to the value of 3457 l. for which the two Dons return'd him still most punctually Commodities of equal value, to the great content of the Rotterdamer , and the great Reputation of the two English Gusmans . Who in this time, by vertue of their Commerce with the Merchants of Bruges , and the great entertainment which they gave them, were grown to be as high in the credit of the City-Merchants, as with their Correspondent at Rotterdam , every one courting their Custom, and expressing how deeply they would trust 'em for their farther encouragement. One would have thought this genteel and gainful way of living, the kindness of Strangers, and their own gratitude, should have oblig'd these two Dons to have kept within the bounds of Reason and common Honesty. But there is that Letchery in some Men to triumph in their frauds, and to be profuse at the Expences of other Peoples Purses, that they cannot be contented with other Gains then those that will satisfie their Prodigality; and the toyl of keeping Accompts was a labour too tedious to their Mercurial Brains; and therefore they were now for reaping the Harvest which they saw ripe for their Sickle. The Sun shin'd, and they must make their Hey. The Merchants had fairly promis'd, and they resolv'd to try how far they would be as good as their words. Volenti non fit injuria was a Matchiavillian Maxim that very much prevail'd upon their Consciences, none of the tenderest at that time. Thereupon they took up several parcels of Goods to the value of 2000 l. or upwards; which being ship'd off for England , away march'd they after their Prey; and taking Ostend, Newport, Dunkirk, Calice , and indeed all the considerable Ports between that and St. Malo's , at the same Places, by vertue of several counterfeit Bills from several Parts, but more particularly from Rotterdam and Bruges , they rais'd, all expences born, an additional Stock of ready Money, amounting to one thousand five hunder'd and seven Pounds; with which recruit they bore away to the Port of Exeter , where the two Dons thought to have found the Ship which carry'd their Goods. But being arriv'd there, they understood by a Merchant concern'd in the same Ship, that the Master and some of the Company had carry'd the Vessel and Goods to Bayon , and had there expos'd them to sale. Nor was this all; for the same Merchant, keeping a Correspondence at Bruges , and by the intelligence he had receiv'd from thence, concluding Don Tomazo and Don Pedro to be the two Persons complain'd of for the exploit they had there so lately committed, caus'd them to be both arrested in the Names of his Flemsh friends, to whom he sent word of the Embargo which he had laid upon their Persons. The Bruges Merchants had no sooner receiv'd the Information, but they sent over a Person to treat with the two young Sparks, who being unwilling to lose time by lying in Prison, the worst place in nature for Men of their Profession, came to a seasonable composition, and having to their great grief refunded 1360 l. were presently discharg'd. Happily for them; for they were no sooner gone, but fresh Orders came to the same Merchant from several Persons out of France to detain them upon their accounts. However, the Birds being flown, there was an end of that prosecution. The guilt of the two Dons made them wickedly jealous of the diligence that would be us'd to entrap them, and therefore they made all the hast they could to London , where they lay still a while, till they thought the danger over. This Terror being past, the two Dons fell to new Consultations, and finding the ill success of Merchandizing, they resolv'd to set up the old trade of Coyning, wherein they were more expert, as being more suitable to their Genius's . In order to the better management of which Affair, like Men of gravity and prudence, they consulted the Statutes of the Kingdom, by which they found the counterfeiting of Spanish Gold to be the least dangerous in point of Penalty. And therefore having got their Materials and Confederates, such as broken Goldsmiths and Guilders all in a readiness, they fell so sedulously to their business, that in fourteen days time they had made as many Doublons , and double Doublons , as amounted to the value of 3245 l. according to the price of their Mint. Part of these Pieces Don Pedro and Tomazo undertook to put off, in the West and Northwest Parts of England . To which purpose they took their Progress well mounted, genteelly clad, well attended with Servants, besides the travelling Grandeur of led Horses. However, they did not always appear in this Splendor, but at certain times, and for colour of some great Designs; having for Projects of lesser moment other disguises and pretences. Among the rest they had an easie excuse for their stay at Sea-port Towns, in expectation of Ships from several Parts: During which demorage, it was no difficult thing to put off thirty or forty of their Pieces, and then remove to another Place: Neither was Lyme in Dorsetshire the Scene of one of their meanest Exploits. In that Place liv'd a Merchant nearly related to their Correspondent at Rotterdam , upon whom they had a Design of no less than three or four hunder'd Pound thick. This Man was a wary Person, and one that having been often scalded, dreaded the Fire; which made the Enterprize much more difficult; however, the Resolution of the two Dons was such, that they resolv'd to attempt it, as they did in this manner. Don Tomazo and Don Pedro , with their Servants and Horses, in great splendor, went to Lime , where they took up all the chiefest Inns of the Town, Don Tomazo (and Don Proteus himself could have done no more) having now Metamorphos'd himself into the Shape of a Spanish Count, to whom he pretended, the King of England , and several of the Nobility, had given several Horses, and Liberty to buy more, and to transport them at his pleasure, for the Service of his own Sovereign. In prosecution of which Affair, he had been in the adjacent Counties, and had made several Purchases, which he daily expected in that Town; and was therefore come to make Provision of Hay, Corn and Stabling for their Accommodation, till he could have the Conveniency of Shipping them off; insomuch that the Country People that came thither to Market, were forc'd to set their unregarded Beasts in the Streets, to make room for the Spanish Count's Horses. During the Spanish Count's Continuance at Lime , which was about four days, he sends for the Merchant upon whom he had fix'd his Design; and after he had amus'd him with a Noble Entertainment, entred into a Discourse with him about his Horses, and how he intended to have them transported; desiring him, either to assist him with his Advice, or else himself be pleas'd to hire him some Vessels for that purpose. An Employment which the Merchant readily undertook, and to that purpose, brought four or five Masters of Ships to the Count, with whom his Lordship soon agreed for the Passage of his numerous Cavalry. The next day, the Merchant being present, the Count received an Account from one of his Servants, who pretended he came from the Horses, that they were at such a place; but that his Agents had bought more Horses then they had Money to pay for, and therefore desir'd the Money might be sent them. Presently the Count, calling for his Steward, bid him go, and fetch as many pieces of Spanish Gold, as would make up the Sum. Which being brought as soon, the Count desir'd the Merchant to exchange them for Silver. Which the Merchant undertaking to do, went home, carries the Gold along with him: and sending for three more of his Friends, they all laid their Heads together, to make tryal of the pieces; which they did by all the usual ways of Touching, Cutting, Weighing, and the like. But the Mettal was so superexcellently temper'd, that they could make no other discovery, but that it was absolutely real; so that the Merchant return'd with the full Change in Silver, which the Count immediately deliver'd to one of his Grooms, who carri'd it away. The next day, the former Messenger returns again to Lime , and tells the Count, that all his Horses were seiz'd, in regard the Country People had consulted together, and were of Opinion, that the Horses were to be transported contrary to an Act of Parliament, and without the King's leave. At which unexpected news, the Count was seemingly strangely allarm'd and surpriz'd; and in a Passion, as well counterfeited as his Spanish Gold, commanded his Groom to make ready his Horses, pretending to go in person to dispute a business so prejudicial to his grand Affairs. On the other side, for the prevention of all disturbance and delay; and to shew, that he came not into England upon a First of April Day's Errant, being as it were come to himself, he desir'd the Favour of the Merchant, to ride Post to London , to give the King an account of the Abuse and Scandal he had suffer'd from the Countrey, and to pray His Majesties Warrant for the Release of his Horses; and in consideration of his trouble, allow'd him one of his Servants to wait upon him, and ten Pistols to bear his Charges, with assurance, that at his Return, he should find the Count at Lime . The Merchant, as well to oblige a Person of so much Honour as the Spanish Count, as to serve his Neighbours, who were not a little discompos'd at the loss they should sustain by the Count's being so rudely disappointed, set forward with more then good speed to solicit for the Count: For upon his Arrival at London , the Count's Gentleman, who had his Private Instructions, to prevent the Merchants going to Court, sent for a Confederate, that well understood his Lord's Affairs, who presently entred an Action of 4000 l. against the Spanish Count's Embassador, and arrested him as he was going to Whitehall , with a crew of pretended Officers of his own garbling. In this Condition they hurry'd the helpless Merchant to Prison, as they made him believe; but indeed to one of their own Private Haunts, a certain dark Diabolical Cellar, where they so roughly entertain'd the terrifi'd Stranger, that to free himself out of the Clutches of such a surly sort of Rake-shames , he was forc'd to draw Bills upon his Correspondents in several places; which being receiv'd, and due intelligence given to the Count of all Proceedings, the poor Merchant of Lime , who had by this means moulted a good part of his gayest Feathers, was discharg'd out of Captivity. As for the Count himself, and his Retinue, they soon quitted that Post, and having alter'd their Habits, and chang'd their Horses, ranged up farther up into the Country, not deeming the Sea-ports proper to be visited, while such Exploits as these were fresh in Memory. So like are these sort of Gusmans to the Tartars , who, when they have devoured the Products of one place, remove into fresh Accommodation. But though they had chang'd their Horses, they did not alter their Pretence of buying Horses. To which purpose, Don Tomazo , now acting the part of a Jocky, rather then a Spanish Count, made it his business to ride with a Servant, up and down to Farmers Houses, having first enquir'd the names of such Gentlemen as liv'd nearest thereabouts, and also taken a Prospect as far as he could of their Qualities, their Honours, and their Conditions. 'Tis well known to be the Custom in many parts of the West of England , for many Farmers to breed up Horses of Fifty, or Sixty Pound a Pair, and sometimes of greater Value. Such Horses as these, Don Tomazo would often cheapen, and sometimes bargain for; but when the Seller, and the Purchaser came to the Point, Don Tomazo had no Money which was passable, nor was it his intent it should be so; as knowing well the Humour of those sort of People, which was to raise the Country presently, to make a thousand Hubbubs, and put all the World into Noise and Uproar; whereas a Gentleman having been smitten under the Fifth Rib, will first consider his own Reputation, and hold a private Emparlance with his own Reason; of which, some are so highly conceited, that they would not have the World believe, they could be out-noddl'd, for the half of their Estates. They observe themselves to be the great Idols of Wit and Parts, to which the People offer in the High Places of the Countrey; but should it once appear, that their Divinity-ships had once been subject to the Frailty of having been cully'd and cunny-catch'd by Mortal Gusmans , their Oracles would be no more frequented among the Vulgar, and the smiles of the Gentry would expose them to the Satyrical Extension of the Fore-finger; which was a punishment of their unwary Folly, that so over-aw'd their considerative Prudences , that hardly one in twenty ever divulg'd the Tricks that Don Tomazo put upon them. And therefore, because they were best able to bear the Loss, most ready to put it up, and most easie to be plaid upon, (as depending upon their own Judgments) in point of Morality, in point of Policy, and to save trouble, Don Tomazo seldom dealt with any other then those of his own Rank, Gentlemen . Having made this Digression, for the better Instruction of the Reader, we shall clear the foregoing Axiom by the following Demonstration. For as has been already hinted, when Don Tomazo had bargain'd with any Farmers, for one or more Horses, he still told them he had not currant Money to pay for his Markets; and therefore desir'd them to send one of their Servants to such a Gentleman's House, where he was certain to be furnish'd with English Coyn; delivering himself in such a manner, as if he were most intimately acquainted there. Thereupon the Farmer would presently order a Servant to ride along with their Genteel Chapman, who, by the way, never fail'd to intoxicate the credulous Bumpkin with the promise of some Gratuity for his pains; and then to make him perfect in his lesson; which was, to give such a short account of Don Tomazo , as he himself directed him. The Fellow being thus prepar'd, and inspir'd with expectation, so soon as they came somewhat near the House, was sent before, to enquire whether the Gentleman were within? A Question which Don Tomazo could have resolv'd before; but done on purpose to give the Gentleman opportunity to enquire of the Servant, who the Person was that was coming behind? For then it was, that the Countrey Fellow generally gave his Worship this Answer, That either he was a Person of Quality, and of his Master's Acquaintance, who had bought Horses of one that liv'd in such a place; or else, that he was a near Relation to his Master, who had bought Horses of another of his Acquaintance: Either of which Pretences so formal, and so probable, were enough to prevail with a Gentleman always ready to oblige his Neighbours. So that by these Artifices, Don Tomazo seldom fail'd of having his Gold chang'd, or Silver lent upon it, with his promise of sending for it again in such a time. But the Fish being caught, Don Tomazo had no more business either with that Farmer or his Servant; and therefore at parting, he only gave the Fellow a small Reward, and bid him tell his Master, That he was gone to such a place, quite contrary to that Corner of the Wind, whither he was bound, and would be with him in three or four Hours, in which time he was got out of reach to his next Conveniency. For Don Tomazo , and his Brethren, always so manag'd their Business, that they rode first about the Countrey to inform themselves of every thing material, before they made any attempt; so that when they once began, two or three days put an end to all such Designs as they had in those Parts of the Countrey. During the time that these Pranks were play'd, the Lime Merchant being return'd home, full of Choler and Revenge, had made a strange hurly burly in the Country; but could hear no Tidings of his Count. So that all things being once more still and quiet, Don Tomazo and Don Pedro resolv'd to take the opportunity of the Calm, and to favour their beloved, the Sea-ports, with a fresh Visit. Among the rest, they arrived at length at a place call'd Kings- Bridge in Devonshire . There coming in upon a Market Day, Don Tomazo found divers Gentlemen, and several of their number, in whose Faces he could read a Chapter fit for his purpose, better then some Astrologers . And indeed the Circumstantial Accidents fell out so propitiously, that they seem'd, as it were, to assure him of Success. For upon a suddain, not only about the Town, but all the Country round, there fell so deep a Snow, that neither Horse nor Man could travail. By which Confederacy of the Season, Don Tomazo , and Don Pedro came familiarly acquainted with several of the said Gentlemen, under the notion of Persons that were newly arriv'd from Spain . This happy time of leisure afforded Don Tomazo a kind Opportunity to enter his new Acquaintance into Play, (which is one of the laudable Exercises that waste our time in these parts of Europe ) at which sport, he gave them leave at first to win much of his Spanish Gold, which some of the Gamesters, having been Travellers in that Kingdom, pretended to understand, as well as the losing Stranger, who, to give the better Colour to his Design, seem'd not a little troubled at the loss of his Summum Bonum , the only true Friend to a Traveller. But the fickle Dice, y'saith, soon alter'd their Carier, and ran so much on Don Tomazo's side, that in a short time he had taken Captive good store of the Gentlemens Coin, who were so fond of the Gold, that rather then part with it, they borrowed Money in the Town to pay their Losses. But this same sport was too hot to hold; so that the Gentlemen weary at length of ill Luck, and tir'd with the Inconveniencies of losing, as having taken their leaves (besides the satisfaction for Don Tomazo's Gold,) of near a hundred pounds of their own Money, thought it high time to knock off, and return to their several Habitations. At their several Departures, there was one of the Company, that prevail'd with Don Tomazo and Don Pedro to ride with him Home; where they were not only receiv'd with a most hospitable Accommodation by the Gentleman at his own, but by him also carry'd to a Person of Qualitie's House not far off, where they were likewise entertain'd with no less kindness then plenty. But such is the ill nature of Gusmanry , that it spares neither Friend nor Foe: For of this very Person of Quality, who had been so civil in his Entertainment, did Don Tomazo very gratefully buy two Horses, for which he paid 147 Pistolets, and sent them away by his Servant. This Scene being over, they were in haste to be gone; and therefore to avoid the sour Sawce that might happen to season the sweet Viands of their Entertainment, they took their leaves of the Civility of those Places, and set forward for Plimouth ; but giving out that they intended for London . When the two Dons came to Plimouth , e're they had time to alight, Don Tomazo was spy'd by a Person that knew him, who inform'd him, that his Master was in the Town. This News was to Don Tomazo like Aloes and Honey, a strange mixture of Sweet and Bitter. For the Gentleman was his acquaintance, but one of the Persons that had won some of his Gold at Kings-Bridge ; so that Don Tomazo , suspecting that the Gentleman was come thither to make tryal of his Gold, thought it not proper to stay there. Thereupon the two Dons turn'd their Horses Heads; but as they rode by a Goldsmith's Shop, Don Tomazo's counterfeit pieces began to ferment in his Pocket: So that at their Instigation, Don Tomazo deeming it a foul Shame, that he should come into such a Town as Plimouth , and leave no Monument of his Fame behind him, alights at the Goldsmith's Shop, and desires Silver for as much Gold as amounted to 14 l. 10 s. 9 d. The Goldsmith satisfi'd with the Tryal he made, delivers the Silver demanded; and so the two Dons , having given that great Town a small Taste of their Ingenuity, steer'd directly for the County of Cornwal , where they found great Opportunities of Business, play'd several Pranks, and among the rest, this in particular. Don Tomazo having taken up his Quarters at a Town call'd Pensanse , and Don Pedro at another call'd St. Ives , both Sea-ports; lay there, without taking the least Cognizance of each other. They had been such strangers one to another for some Weeks, that the one had not been in the others Company but once, and that, as it were by an Accidental Meeting. So that it was impossible for the Country to imagin or suspect any such thing as an Intimacy between them; which was the Foundation upon which many Designs were laid, and brought to perfection. One time among the rest, it hapn'd, that Don Tomazo being at Church upon a Sunday, paying his Devotions to something or other; Cupid finding him at a loss for an Object of his Zeal, fix'd his Eyes upon a very pretty Lady, whose Beauty made no slight Impression in Tomazo's Heart. The inflam'd Lover, whose business it was, always to use the swiftest Expedition in his Affairs, now more violently hastn'd by his amorous Impatience, returns to his Quarters, and makes all those diligent Enquiries after the Lady that Lovers are wont to do; which concluding with such a passionate Joy, that all their Answers satisfi'd his Expectations, the People easily from thence drew their wonted Conjectures, and presently reported, that Don Tomazo , who past for the Son of a Person of great Quality in the North , was deeply in Love with such a Lady. This Report flew like Lightning, and was presently bandy'd from one Tittle-tattle to another, till it came to the Father's Ear, with all the Embellishments of Multiplication, in reference to the Behaviour and Gallantry of the Enamour'd Esquire. The Father was tickl'd at the Tidings, and as it is the fashion of the Unwary, to look upon distant Prospects with a Magnifying fancy, thought it but an act of Paternal Affection to advance his Daughters Fortune; and the Daughter her self, proud of the Conquest of her Victorious Beauty, already imagin'd her self riding in her Coach and Six Horses, the ador'd Mistress of many Tenants, and the charming Wife of a brisk, bonny, and wealthy Heir. Thereupon the Justice comes thundring to Pensanse , to take view of his Son-in-Law, and having found him out, took an occasion to fall into a sifting Discourse with Don Tomazo , who had all his Story so Geometrically fram'd, and deliver'd it with such a careless Exactness, without the least Hesitation, that the Cornish Chough , was not only taken with his Person and Behaviour, but so intoxicated with his Narrative, that he invited him over to his House. Don Tomazo kindly accepted his Invitation, and accordingly gave him the Honour of his Company home; where he had leisure enough to unbosom his Affections to the Young Isabella , the Name by which hence forward she shall be known. Some time after, the Justice, his Wife, and his Daughter, went to visit a Gentleman of their Acquaintance, that liv'd not far from St. Ives , who after Dinner, inform'd the Justice of a Gentleman that quarter'd at St. Ives , that was certainly the best Company that ever he met with; withal, That he was a Spaniard , whose Curiosity had brought him thither to view the Country. Upon which rare Character of an intimate Friend, the Justice desir'd he might be sent for, as he was, with all speed. But when he came, the Country Gentleman, who only thought to compleat his Pastime with the mirth of some Comical Droll, was strangely out of Countenance, and in a Surprize, believing his Old Acquaintance had put some Trick upon him. For such was Don Pedro's Air and Deportment, that the Justice took him for no less then some Person of High Quality; which was no small trouble to the Justice, to be put out of the road of his Rural Addresses, and Country Complements; and forc'd on a suddain to recollect the Exercises of his Youth at the Dancing School, for new Congies, and Refin'd Expressions. For indeed, Don Pedro might well have past for such a one as the Justice took him to be, in any part of the World. He was a Person so comely, that few Spaniards were like him, very Fair, full Ey'd, with a lovely Head of Long Hair, as black as a Raven's Wing, and a Body most curiously proportion'd; to which his Graceful Carriage, his affable, sweet, and complaisant Humour, his fluencie of Speech, and his Noble Equipage, were such charming Additions, that it was no wonder Cupid took his Stand in such a Face, and bent his Bow to kill two Birds with one Stone. I say bent , because at that time, I believe the God of Love made use of a Cros-bow, in regard of the Crossness of the Shot. In short, the Mother and the Daughter were both shot Plumb-dead at the same time, insomuch, that there was no Peace or Quiet in either of their Bosoms, till they had prevail'd with the Justice, (who could hardly think his Mansion worthy such a Guest) to invite Don Pedro to his House. But at last, overcome by their Importunity, and his own Ambition, he took the Confidence to give him a Solemn, and Cardinal-like Invitation, which Don Pedro readily accepted. You may be sure, the Entertainment could not chuse but be splendid, where the Master consulted his Honour, the Mistress her deep Affection; and no question but the Daughter sate up late, and had a Finger in every Pye, and every Tart. Nor was the Female diligence of those two Love-shot Ladies, less, to dress, and trim, and trick and adorn themselves, with all the Ornaments their Trunks and Cabinets could afford. What Fairs and Christnings saw but seldom and in Parcels, that D. Pedro saw at once, and every day display'd; while the Mother strove to renew the Youth of her past Beauty, the Daughter to beautifie her present Youth. All this Don Pedro contentedly observ'd; and as he was extremely acute in his Observations, after Dinner, he gave Madam Isabella an occasion to convey a little Billet into his hand; at what time the Mother took an Opportunity to slip another into his Pocket, ignorant of what her Rival Daughter had done. Neither indeed, was Don Pedro aware of the Mothers contrivance. So ambitious they were, which of the two should make the first and deepest Impression in Don Pedro's Heart. The two Ladies having thus disburthen'd their Affections, the one into his Pocket, the other into his Hand; Don Pedro , after a powre of Complements and Kindness, took his Leave, and being return'd to his Quarters, drew forth the Billet which he had receiv'd from Mrs. Isabella , wherein he read these following Lines.  SIR, Passion in my Heart, which having ever since tormented me, pardon the Flame that enforces me to let you know the Wound you have giv'n me. I doubt not, but that a Person of your Quality will be careful to manage this Secret, with that Prudence, as shall be no way to the disadvantage of a person so young and tender, that languishes for your sake.  Don Pedro was so startl'd at the reading these short Ejaculations of a wounded Heart, that he wrote a Letter to Don Tomazo , and within inclos'd the Billet , desiring him to consider, what Design would be most likely to succeed among People that had laid themselves so fairly at the Feet of their mercy, and as it were, put their Lilly white hands into the Lion's Mouth. Withal, he caution'd Don Tomazo for the future, to avoid suspicion, to write his Mind, and send his Servant with it, to be left in a hole of a certain Rock half way between Pensanse and St. Ives , which was afterwards observ'd. But when Don Tomazo came to read the Billet which Don Pedro had inform'd him came from the Justices Daughter, he was in a strange Quandary: for belov'd her himself, even beyond the pleasures of his Profession. He could not imagin the reason of his Misfortune, not dreaming the Young Lady had been such an early May-cherry , so soon to allure the Gatherer's Hand; of whom, he then himself had no other hopes, but as the Paternal Heat of her Father's Care, mellow'd her for his Embraces. Of his Approbation Good Will, and Favour, he thought himself Cock-sure, as well for that they had been more intimate together, as in regard the Deportment, and Natural Parts of Don Tomazo , were not much inferiour to those acquir'd Endowments of Don Pedro . But while Don Tomazo's thoughts were thus Tennis-ball'd between Love and Gusmanry , the Lady her self sent him a Cordial, that soon compos'd this Disorder of his Senses. For within two days after, Mrs. Isabella finding a convenient Opportunity, and as young and innocent as Don Tomazo thought her, willing to have two Strings to her Bow, writ Don Tomazo the following Letter in Answer to one of his.  SIR, of this nature; and besides, you men (as I I have been inform'd by my Mother) are most kind things till your ends are accomplish'd, and then as full of slights; But if I could be satisfi'd of the reality of your affection, it would be more serviceable to your Interest. But, alas! how shall I credit any thing from a man who burns and dyes, Swears, Vows, and Protests, and all in one single Minute, quite contrary to the thoughts of his Heart. This from a person so great a stranger, as well to your Self, as to the thing call'd Love, as I am, You may, if you please, value as a piece of Liberty I allow you, to be what in Yours you express.  This Letter from so young and so unexpected a piece of Female Treason did not a little damp the Amorous Don Tomazo's flame. He saw how the subtle Traytress was only coaxing poor Tomazo with the shadow, while she was disposing the Substance to Don Pedro : cunningly providing, that if Don Pedro should slight her proffer'd fondness, then to accept of Don Tomazo's Courtship. This double dealing of Mrs. Isabella , though unlook't for, was upon better consideration, the more welcome to Don Tomazo , to support the Morality of that injustice which he intended the Family: which while he was meditating how to bring to pass, his Servant brought him a Letter from the Rock, with another Billet in the Belly of it. For, by this time, Don Pedro's Servant, after his Master had shifted his Cloaths, had found the Justice, 'seignior Cornudo Elects Wives Love-Letter in one of the Pockets; which Don Tomazo reading, found these violent Expressions of an Amorous Fury:  Most Fair and Dear to me of all your Sex, state of Marriage this twenty five years, a just and dutiful Wife, and, as I thought, to the best of your Sex, am now so alter'd in my respect to that Thing call'd an Husband, that I hate him for your sake; for which I would quit all my immediate plenty, to enjoy your dear Company but one hour. Pity the weakness of a Woman, and do not slight a Passion so great, that no Breast can conceal; and consider how I break the Impalement of a virtuous Life Forty three years long, to come to the Embraces of your self, whom I love above all the World. Let not my Age render me insignificant, but meet me to morrow at the Mount.  Don Tomazo having read this Letter, could not choose but laugh, to see the infidelity of the Daughter so prettily reveng'd by the wantonness of the Mother, who was all this while in a fiery torment, like St. Laurence upon the Gridiron; believing that if Don Pedro had not slighted her, he either would have met her, or else she should have heard from him. It seems Don Pedro knew nothing of this Letter, before his man had found it; and therefore not to lose his opportunities, having receiv'd some private Instructions from Don Tomazo , he thought it high time to answer both his Clients, beginning first with Madam Isabella , in this Language.  Fair Isabella , Constructions: But by the Contents thereof, being truly sensible of your great Affections for me, assure your self, nothing on Earth shall labour more to retaliate those your Favours, nor manage the whole matter with more safety to your self then I will. So if you'l but meet me at the Little Rock, I shall there express what is now too much to expose in written Lines. Adieu.  After he had wrote this, and was assured of Isabella's coming to the place appointed, Don Pedro , apprehensive that the absence of the Daughter might raise jealousies in the Mother, and put her upon the search, like Ceres after her Daughter Proserpine , to prevent her, sent her this Julep to qualifie the heat of her Fever.  Dear Madam, from me: For I never knew of it, till shifting my Apparrel; and then my Valet du Chambre found it by accident in the same pocket, which I suppose you put it. But the Contents thereof has giv'n me such demonstrable satisfaction of your great and good Inclination to me, that it puts me under no small surprize to qualifie my self for the reception of so much Honour, the least grain of which, as coming from you, I shall more esteem then my Life, and finally make it my study how to embrace you with such a tenderness as may be most proper for a Lady under the circumstances of so great a Passion. And from hence forward to prevent the jealousie of a Husband; let us only meet and not write. For nothing is of more dangerous consequence then Letters of such a nature as this, when once discovered; especially by a man so apt as the Justice. I will meet you to morrow at the same place you appointed, and the same hour. Adieu.  At the receit of this Letter, the Lady was so transported, that for that day all the Gayety and Pleasure she had ever show'n, or enjoy'd in her whole Life, seem'd to be recollected, and rendevouz'd in her Countenance. She thought of nothing but of reinforcing her amorous Heat, that she might be able to meet her Dear Don Pedro's Fires, with equal Flames. Her Heart danc'd the Canaries in her Bosom for joy that she should so soon be happy in the Embraces of her Beloved Spaniard ; and the continual meditations of her Brain upon these voluptuous felicities did so employ her thoughts, that her Daughter might have had the opportunity to have lost more Maidenheads then Hercules got in one night, for any enquiry her Mother made after her. Thus was the Mothers security the Daughters safety, who by this time had lost her troublesome Virginity in those Embraces, to which the other was the next day to resign the Matrimonial Loyalty of many years. So little does the continual sight of a Gold Thumb-Ring controul the temptations of a wanton Appetite. Isabella having by this means obtained a full satisfaction from Don Pedro , and now become as wise in the Natural Philosophy of Love as her Mother, left her Instructor a thousand sweet kisses in pawn for an assurance of her farther Society, and with the modesty of a Nun, return'd home to laugh in her sleeve at the Cheat she had put upon the vigilance of her Mother, and all her Female Guardians. But before Don Pedro and she parted, there was an agreement made, that whenever D. Pedro came to the Justices House, it should be under pretence of making Love to her, who had already given him the surest pledge of her affection. For, under that colour D. Pedro being now to manage the Intrigue between the Mother and him, where lay the stress both of his and D. Tomazo's design, and the prospect of their gain, it was necessary to uphold the amorous correspondence which he and Isabella had begun. And now the happy Hour was come, D. Pedro and the enamour'd Mother met; and he that had so deliciously fed the Young Kitlin, was now to purr it with Grey-maulkin the Elder; whom he entertain'd with such variety of Embraces, that she protested, all the Justices Cornish Huggs were but Bavinbands to 'em. Which gave her such an intrinsick Satisfaction, that she enjoyn'd D. Pedro to stay in those Parts a Month longer; and indeed, till those Quarters were grown almost too hot to hold either him or his Company. In order whereunto, she had contriv'd a way for his coming to the Justices House. But D. Pedro not deeming her way so commodious as his own, acquainted the Mother with his Affections to her Daughter; who thereupon approv'd of his Intentions, and having resolv'd to act conformably to the Design; they parted for that time. Don Pedro being return'd home, wrote a Letter to be left at the Rock for D. Tomazo , wherein he gave him an exact account of what had past between him and the two Ladies; and farther desir'd D. Tomazo with all speed to get himself introduc'd into Isabella's Company, and to make his Addresses to her, wherein he promis'd to be assisting, so soon as there appear'd any publick Acquaintance between them. This Letter, Don Tomazo read, with great regret, cursing Pedro's happiness, and his own ill Conduct, not so much for the Love he bore the dissembling Isabella , as for that he had not made the same Improvement of his Opportunity that Don Pedro had done; but finding it was now Don Pedro's Intention to carry on the Common Advantage, and that the Design began to ripen, he easily rid his Head of those impertinent Imaginations, and two days after gave a Visit to the Justice, who being at home, entertain'd him with great Respect; and among the rest of the Discourse, knowing Don Tomazo was well skill'd in the Spanish Tongue, inform'd him of a Famous Spanish Gentleman that was in those Parts, well worth his Acquaintance. Of which Don Tomazo seemingly made slight, telling the Justice, that he was a Young Man, and did not know what Inconveniencies the Knowledge of that Gentleman might produce. But the more Don Tomazo slighted it, the more earnest the Justice was to send for Don Pedro . So that Don Tomazo , unwilling to disoblige the Justice by his Obstinacy, suffer'd himself to be over-rul'd. As soon as Don Pedro came, Don Tomazo entertain'd him with all the Ceremonies according to the Gravity of Spain , and afterwards discours'd him in the Spanish Language, which fell out luckily for their Business, in regard that none of the Justices Family understood what they said. This Interview between the two pretended Strangers, Don Tomazo and Don Pedro , first begat a Familiarity, then frequent Meetings; and at length, by the Justices Consent, his House became the General Rendevouz. During which time, Don Pedro having had the frequent sight and handling of his enamour'd Mistress's Jewels, had got such a perfect Idea of the shape, form, and bigness of the Pearls and Stones, and afterwards drawn them so exactly in Paper, that there was no question of the Success of the Design. Thereupon Don Tomazo dispatch'd away his Man to Exeter , who there bought up several Pendants of counterfeit Pearl, and Bristow -stones, so well match'd, that they were hardly to be distinguish'd from the Originals. Which being brought to Don Tomazo , he deliver'd them to Don Pedro ; who watching his opportunity, which the fond Dotage of Issabella's Mother often gave him, by opening her Cabinet, and displaying her Wealth, to dazle his Eyes, and oblige him to the satisfaction of her desires, took an honest occasion to pay himself for his Drudgery, by taking out the real Substances, and conveying the Counterfeit Shadows in their places. Which being done, for about three days after, Don Tomazo and Don Pedro drank the Justice very hard; and indeed, made it their business to keep him elevated for the most part of their Stay, after the moral Exchange which Don Pedro had made with his Wife. During which time, one Evening, the Justice being bowsie, they took an occasion to make a Repetition of the great Favours he had shewn them, promising those Returns, which they neither durst, nor ever intended to perform. In the Conclusion of which most lofty Complements, some Discourse arising about Mrs. Isabella , D. Pedro catch'd at it, and spar'd not to say, that he lov'd her beyond measure, and little less then his Life; but he came short of D. Tomazo , who swore by way of Reply, that she was more dear to him then Life it self; and in pursuit of his Zeal for the Lady, requested the Justice to declare, if it were his Intention to dispose of his Daughter in Marriage, and if it were possible for her to love Tomazo and Pedro both alike, on which of the two he would soonest bestow her? The Justice being ravish'd to hear such a brisk Contest about his Daughter, between two such great Persons of Quality, was at first in a Dilemma ; but at length, heightn'd by the t'other Round, and the more generous Protestation of D. Tomazo , frankly declar'd in favour of him. At which D. Pedro seem'd to take Snuff, but carry'd it off for the present; and so they drank on all three, till the Ladies were gone to Bed; but then D. Pedro and D. Tomazo took an occasion to slip out of the Room, leaving the Justice alone, who perceiving they did not immediately return, presently began to reflect upon the discourse that had past between 'em. With that he ran to the Garden door, at which they went out; where he had not stood long, before he heard the clashing of Swords. Which so amaz'd his Worship, that in a trice, the whole Family was allarm'd, and the Justice with some of his Servants, came in great haste to part them. In this counterfeit Fray, D. Pedro had prickt D. Tomazo in the Arm, more like a Surgeon then an Enemy, which, with another green Hurt that Tomazo had receiv'd but a little before, past for two great Wounds. The Justice caus'd his Servants to take D. Tomazo into the House, while he labour'd to appease Don Pedro , who seemingly, would fain have had the t'other Touch with D. Tomazo . But his violent Passion, at length submitting to the Justices Mediation, he was prevail'd with to go to Bed. The Scuffle being thus over, and the great Mischief prevented, the Justice visited Tomazo , who all in a boyling Choler, lay swearing, he would make D. Pedro smoak for the injury he had done him, and what he would make him pay for Damages. The Old Gentleman gave him all the Sugar words he could think of, and sent for a Surgeon, whose Honesty D. Tomazo easily tempted to delay the Cure, to enhance the Bill of Costs. After that time, the two Rivals never met, D. Tomazo returning to his Quarters; and the Justice for his own Reputation, so ordered it, that there was no noise made of the dangerous Duel. Nevertheless, D. Pedro , who all this while, lay at Rack and Manger in the Justices House, and took that care of his wife, to find her other sport then visiting her Cabinets, seem'd to be not a little afraid of his Rival, and therefore perswaded the Justice to give D. Tomazo a Visit, and withal, to pump him in reference to his demands for Satisfaction. To whom D. Tomazo protested, that 500 l. should not reconcile 'em. But the Cure being over, D. Tomazo was perswaded by the Justice, (whom they found very much pleas'd with his Office of Mediation) to treat with D. Pedro , who was willing to refer himself to D. Tomazo , as not thinking it convenient to incumber himself with the Laws of the Nation, to which he was a Stranger. So that at length, D. Tomazo was over-rul'd by the Justice, to take 225 l. Accordingly Don Pedro laid down the Money in Spanish Gold, which D. Tomazo refus'd, as not being the Coin of England . Thereupon D. Pedro , mainly desirous to be rid of Trouble, requested the Justice to take the Gold, and furnish him with so much Money, which he not having in the house, courteously sent to Pensanse for, and deliver'd it to Pedro , who upon the Payment thereof to Don Tomazo , receiv'd a full and ample discharge, but refus'd to have any more to do with such a litigious Gentleman. By this time having stock't all that Countrey with their precious Metal, by a Letter from the rock, they agreed to be gone, as they did in a most slovenly manner. For without taking leave of the Justice, who was so courteous, or his Wife, who had been so kind, or the Daughter, who had been so tenderly loving, they took horse of a sudden, and vanish'd out of the Countrey, leaving nothing behind 'em but the Remarques of an old musty Proverb, Happy are they that beware by other mens harms . Neither were they very scrutinous to know what Curses or Lamentations follow'd 'em from the Justices House, who they knew had no great reason to be over-zealous in their pursuit. During this pleasant Ramble, the two Brethren in Evil had return'd several considerable Sums to London , and dispos'd of all their counterfeit Peruvians . And now, coming to a certain Market-Town beyond Exeter , the little God, with a muffler about his Eyes, found a way to shoot a new Passion into Don Tomazo's heart. He that had so long defi'd the yoke of Wedlock, was now altogether for the Bonds of Matrimony. He had met with an Object beautiful and rich, that had enslav'd him even to a sense of Honour, as if the sickness of his Love had caus'd a qualm of Honesty in his mind. So that having succeeded in his Courtship, he resolv'd to be faithful to one he entirely lov'd. And now all things being concluded, and nothing wanting toward consummation but the Ceremony of the Church, Don Tomazo rides back to Exeter to provide the Nuptial Ornaments. By the way, at another Market-Town, he met with some Gentlemen of the Country, who perswaded him to dine with 'em at an Inn; Where, after they had drank pretty hard, one of the Company (who was Master of the Inn where Don Tomazo quarter'd at Lime ) began to relate the whole Story of a certain Exploit that was done at his Town by a pretended Spanish Count; and at the conclusion of his Story pointed to Tomazo , saying, that the Count was as like him, as ever he saw any man in his Life, only that the Count wore a Perruke, and Don Tomazo his own Hair. This Narrative did not a little disorder Don Tomazo's Cogitations; but he who had the confidence to out-brazen the stern looks of so many Dangers, scorn'd to betray his fear of such a scare-crow as this: and so, putting a good face upon the matter, with a Story of the same nature with his own Concern, which led to others quite different, he lull'd the Lime -man's Relation asleep; and for fear it should wake again, he kept the Company so well soder'd together with pleasing Healths, that all manner of Stories were forgot, there being not one in the Company but what was carry'd to bed. Onely Don Tomazo , having been more careful of himself, rode to Exeter that night, to meet a more unlucky Misfortune. For early the next morning after he came thither, the Ostler of the Inn where his Horses stood, taking one of them to the Farriers, upon some occasion or other, a certain Person casting his Eye upon the Beast, demanded of the Ostler whose it was? who answered, He knew not. Thereupon the Person who ask'd the Question waited till the Horse was led back, and following him to the Stable, there found the very Horse on which Tomazo rode when he chang'd his Spanish pieces with him at Plimouth , for 14 l. odd money; for so it fell out, that this was the very Individual Goldsmith that had been nick't in that manner. Who thereupon went to Don Tomazo's Lodging, and caus'd him to be apprehended. A sad Catastrophe to a Person that dream't of nothing but Epithalamiums and Hymen aeal Flambeau's . Presently he was carry'd before a Magistrate, by whom, upon the Justices Information, he was committed, but left Bailable. Don Tomazo being thus in the Climm, and well knowing that the report of his being in Prison would muster a wicked Battalion of the same Crimes to his destruction; to prevent the threats of his hard Fate, writes away a Letter to a Gentleman who was a Justice of the Peace in the County of Devon , whose Sirname he then assum'd to himself; wherein he gave him to understand his Condition, and that he was a person nearly related to him; and therefore requested his Worship (for nothing less then a Justice of Peace of the same County would serve) to favour an innocent Stranger, so far as to stand for one of his Bail; pretending, as well he might do, that his Imprisonment would be his Ruine; as being a person that came not into the Country to utter false Money, but to court a young Lady, that liv'd not far from him; of which he would give his Worship a farther Account, if his Request were granted. Don Tomazo's Letter was well consider'd and scann'd by the Justice, before he sent an Answer; and enquiry was also made by his Order, after this new discover'd Kinsman; by which the Justice finding many of the Circumstances to be true, as Don Tomazo had exprest, believ'd the rest, and wrote him word, that though he knew him not personally, he was satisfi'd that he had such a Kinsman in the World, and believ'd him so to be; and therefore rather then suffer a Relation to lie under such a Scandal, he promis'd to bail him off, which was immediately done by himself and another Justice of the Peace, whom he had engag'd to stand with him. With this new Relation Don Tomazo went home, where he was civilly entertain'd till the time of his Appearance at the Sessions. During which Interval, being brought acquainted by his Cousin, with the Justices of the Peace of the County, he had so insinuated himself into their Favour, that several of them had oblig'd themselves by Promise to be his Friends, which made him resolv'd to stand his Tryal. When the time came, the Goldsmith exhibited his Indictment against Don Tomazo , wherein he charg'd him with having exchang'd at his Shop, a certain weight of Mettal for so much real-money; but that when he went to melt it down in his Forge, the whole matter by putting a smart Fire under it, evaporated with that Violence, that his Servant standing on the other side of the Forge, having receiv'd some of the Vapour into his Nostrils, swonded away to the great wonder of his Master. Upon this Indictment D. Tomazo was found guilty of a high Misdemeanour, and fin'd 45 l. which was afterwards brought down to 40 s. and presently pay'd with great Joy. For upon Payment of his fine, no other charge coming against him, he was acquitted by Proclamation. D. Tomazo having thus escap'd the Goldsmith's Tongues, almost as bad as St. Dunstan's , and made all the Expedition he could, to render his Acknowledgments to the Gentleman he was so much oblig'd to, made as much haste out of the Countrey, and with his other self D. Pedro set forward for London , no more regarding his intended Marriage; which indeed had been to little purpose. For his Mistress's Relations having heard of his Misfortunes, and that he had been no Sufferer for his Religion, took that Paternal care, as to send their Kinswoman far enough out of his reach. When the two Travellers arriv'd at London , and had cast up their Accounts, it appear'd by their Books, that they and their Confederates had utter'd in this Kingdom 4050 Pieces of their sorts of Spanish Gold, amounting to near 5000 l. Sterling. Of which, being divided 1700 l. came to Don Tomazo's and D. Pedro's Share; all which, together with the stock they had before, and the Jewels which they had borrow'd of the Justice's Lady (clear booty to them two) rose to a very considerable Value; and yet no such vast Sum neither, for those that had been sowing and reaping all over England . Now you will say, What became of all this Money? Oh! never fear it, you shall have a faithful Account of it by and by. You'l be impertinently questioning too, Why did not these two Dons put themselves in a Way? So they did, and that in as fair a way to be hang'd as ever they did in all their Progresses through all the ways of Great Britain . Now loosing, and ventring Life and Limbs to impose upon Princes and Generals, as they did before to cozen Goldsmiths and Countrey Gentlemen. But how you will approve of their ways, is not for them to determine. For to tell you the truth, the two Dons finding London the coolest place in England for men of their Profession, now grown by continual Persecutions, rather like the Stoves i'the new Bagno , then like a gentle Egyptian Oven to hatch more mischief in, resolv'd to pass over into Holland , with a Resolution to serve the Prince of Orange , and so they did more tricks then ever he thought they deserv'd thanks for. To which intent, they took their Leaves of their Native Soil, like two Philosophers, carrying all they had along with them: though it were a hard thing to judge whether their Country were not as glad to be rid of them, as they were to be rid of their Country. But let it be as it will, they were no sooner entred upon the Stage of Holland , but they were admitted to kiss the Princes Hands. Such an Ascendant has the dazle of Garb and Behaviour over all Mankind, and all, because the Body of Man is not as transparent, as it is brittle. Soon after they had perform'd this Ceremony, they had leave to enter themselves as Volunteers; for there were no Commissions to be had for Money, it being then at the beginning of the Campaign . During all which time of Military Duty, and the Winter following, the two English Sparks, not considering that their Bank was to be fadom'd, or rather, building upon the fair Promises made them of Employments, that would soon replenish the Vacuums of their empty Bags, what with Item for excessive Eexpences; Item for Gaming, that bane of Plethorie Pockets, were brought to sing Lachrym ae over the last penny. So that, for want of foresight, seldom regarded by the great Masters of Art in Gusmanry , having dispos'd of all their Equipage and Bravery, for it came to that at length, they were resolv'd however not to starve. And therefore to prevent that miserable pining Death, Don Tomazo , who had some knowledge in the Art of Fortification, as being one that had often built Sconces, took the boldness to wait upon the Prince, to whom he exprest the great desire he had to serve his Highness to the utmost of what he was capable. Then, for Don Tomazo was always one that kept close to his Text, he made known to the Prince the necessity he was in, not forgetting to mind him of the good Services he and Don Pedro had done at several places, and more particularly the Siege of Grave , which were not unknown to the Prince. Who thereupon bid Tomazo look about, and find out something within his Highness's disposal, and that then both he and his Friend should not fail to see the Effects of his Highness's Favour answerable to their Expectations. But Don Tomazo not to be baulk'd by those plausible Evasions of Courtship, came close to the Point, for it was money he wanted, and thereupon he acquainted the Prince, That if he would order him a hundred pound, he would undertake to serve him as a Spye in the French Army. This the Prince desir'd Time to consider of, and in a short time communicated the Secret to some of his Council; who being as truly sensible as himself of the great want of Intelligence among the Dutch , perswaded the Prince to employ Don Tomazo , since 'twas his own Voluntary offer. In pursuit of this Advice, the Prince sent for D. Tomazo , and told him, provided his Friend D. Pedro would condescend to be left as a Pledg, he should have a hundred pounds to put him into an Equipage fit for the Prosecution of his Proposals. For the Prince had had several tricks put upon him by the English before, which made him the more cautious. Upon this, Tomazo advises with his Friend D. Pedro ; and as they two were not wont to Spaniolize in their Consultations, the matter was so order'd to the Princes Satisfaction likewise, that Don Tomazo , as much to his Satisfaction likewise, received the hundred pound. Upon the receipt whereof, away went Don Tomazo for Brussels , alter'd all his Habits, and in the disguise of a Boor of that Countrey, trudg'd to the French Army, that then lay encamp'd near Sogny , under the Command of the Prince of Conde . There Don Tomazo got a full view of all their Standards, Cannon, and the manner of their Encamping; as also, a very near account of the number of their Men, both Horse and Foot. With this Discovery Don Tomazo return'd to Brussells , where he put all things into a formal draught, exactly representing the whole Camp; which being shew'd to the Prince of Orange , he compar'd it with one which he had receiv'd before from another person of the same Occupation. By which Comparison, the Prince found D. Tomazo to be a very fit Person for his Employment; and therefore encourag'd him, and promis'd him, that so long as he could furnish them with good Intelligence, he should want neither for Money nor Advance. Thereupon Don Tomazo returns to Brussells , where finding several of the Country People, whose Houses had been plunder'd, and themselves stript by the French , so miserably poor, that they wanted Bread: Don Tomazo pick't up one of these forlorn Creatures, which by Conversation he found most acute, with whom he prevail'd to undertake such Enterprizes as he should put him upon, and to follow his directions; for which he promis'd him half a Crown English a day. The Boor taking Don Tomazo for an Angel sent from Heaven to relieve his Misery, embrac'd his Offer with all the readiness imaginable. So that Don Tomazo having giv'n him full Instructions, sent him about his business. Upon his Return, the Boor gave a very good Account of things, which being put into Form, together with such other Discoveries which Don Tomazo had made (unknown to the Boor) he presented them to the Prince, who still receiv'd more and more Satisfaction from the Labours of his new spy. Sometime after, D. Tomazo had by the Diligence of his new acquir'd Confederate, prevail'd with ten or a dozen more of the same stamp, and in the same Condition to list themselves in his Service for the same Pay. By this Increase of Number, his Intelligence notably increast, insomuch that his double Diligence had highly advanc'd him in the Favour of the Prince, who believ'd that whatever Tomazo brought him, was clearly gotten by his own Hazard and Industry, as indeed the best part of it was; for you must always allow the Master to outdoe the Servants. These smaller Attempts so well succeeding, D. Tomazo was desir'd by the Prince of Orange , to use all his art to insinuate himself into an Acquaintance with some of the Prince of Conde's Family or Attendents, promising that if it could be accomplish'd and any Service accrue from thence, no Sum of Money should be wanting for Gratification, or Reward, or Remuneration, or whatever ye please to call it. D. Tomazo thirsting after Fame and Money, and believing that having so many Irons in the Fire it would not be long e're some of them prov'd hot enough to strike, readily undertakes the Affair; to which purpose he provides a Frock of Sack- cloath, a pair of wooden Shooes, (for such is the Habit of the Boors in those parts) a Rundlet of Brandy, and a parcel of Tobacco . This Rundlet had two Divisions, the one for the Souldiers Liquor of Life, and the other for black- lead Pencils, and Parchment, and such other necessary materials. In this Garb, who the Devil could know so great a Person as Don Tomazo ? So that under this disguise, he walk'd about the French Camp, grateful to the Souldiers for the sake of his Tobacco and Brandy; and watching his Opportunies, took several Memorandums very considerable. But loytring one day carelessly about the Quarters of the Prince of Conde , one of the Captains of the Guard call'd to Don Tomazo , who believing him not worse then Cerberus , and in hopes that a Sop would have stopp'd his Mouth, proffer'd him a Tast of his Cordial Liquor. But the Captain suspecting him to be what he was, order'd him to be search'd, and kept him upon the Guard four whole hours. This was an Accident that set all the Pulses of Don Tomazo's Brain at work; and all little enough to hammer out new Spirits to supply the want of those which he had lost in the Fright. But those little Vulcans soon recruited his Arteries, and the Devil too, the Father of Lyes, unwilling to loose a Servant, gave him a List with a cast of his Favour. For after something of a serious Study upon such a ticklish point of Life or Death, D. Tomazo call'd for the Captain, and desir'd he might be carry'd to the Prince of Conde ; at which the Captain laught and saluted Don Tomazo's Posteriors with a contemptible Kick or two; asking in great Derision, What Business such a Beast as he could have with the Prince? So strangely may a Captain be mistaken. But Don Tomazo urg'd his Importunity so home, that Mareschal D' Humieres passing by, and hearing the brandy man so boldly demand to speak with the Prince of Conde about Business of Importance, came up to him and ask'd him What it was? To whom Don Tomazo made a submissive Answer, That it was of that high Consequence, that for his Life he durst not impart it to any but the Prince himself. Away went the Mareschal, little thinking, that Satan had sent him of an Errand, and gave Notice to the Prince of D. Tomazo's Importunity; who thereupon sent for the Brandy-Merchant, not to buy any of his Ware, but to understand his Business. Then it was, that D. Tomazo , with a respective Bow, not like that of a Strong-water-man, desir'd Privacy with his Highness, as not daring to give any Account of his Business to any person living but himself. Thereupon, the Prince considering there were such things as Disguises in the World, and frequently made use of, and that it was in his Power, with one puff of a Mort-bleu , as well to hang a Varlet, as to reward an Instrument, order'd all People to withdraw: which being done, Don Tomazo opening his Mouth without Fear or Trembling, thus began. Sir, it is intended by the Prince of Orange , that his whole Army shall march to Oudenard about four days hence; in order to which, all things are in Preparation: thirty Battering Cannon are to be sent from Gaunt to meet them; the Prince being resolv'd to besiege the Town with all the Vigour imaginable; and to render the Enterprize more easie, four Engineers are to be sent into the Garrison to morrow, to dismount the Cannon, which is to be done with the consent of some of the Gunners already tamper'd with, and made for their Purpose. Farther, when the Dutch are ready to open their Trenches, the great Water Damm in the middle of the Town is to be sprung by another Engineer, by the consent of the Persons there concern'd, of whom they are already assur'd. Which being done, and the Water fallen, the Enemy intends to attacque the Town on that side. Now if your Highness think fit, I will return to the Dutch Army, and make farther enquiry into the particulars of this design, which when I have done, I shall be ready to go to Oudenard , and discover to the Persons your Highness shall appoint, the very Engineers, and their Accomplices themselves. The Prince hearing such a Formal Story from such an Annis-seed-water -Robin, as he took Tomazo to be, was not a little surpris'd, which caus'd him, as any General of reason would have done, to ask Tomazo what he was? how he had liv'd? what had induc'd him to make this Discovery? and how he came to be privy to such a considerable Secret? Adding withal, that he could not believe the Prince of Orange would ever communicate a Design of such Importance, to a Person of his Low Degree. To this Don Tomazo , not thinking it necessary to run through the whole Course of his Life, reply'd in short, That he was a Captain in the Prince of Orange's Army, that he was intimately acquainted with all the Chief Officers; that he had been divers times at their Councils of War; and often had had the Honour privately to discourse the Prince of Orange , the Princes of Curland, Nassau , and Friezeland ; by which he made it out, that there was probability enough, that he might be acquainted with part, though not with all their Designs. And lastly, that as to his Inducement, to make the Discovery, it proceeded meerly from the great Honour and Esteem he had for His Majesty of France , whom he was most ambitious to serve. The Prince, having thus duly weigh'd the Circumstances of the Story, and finding nothing but what was very likely to be true, surrender'd his Belief to D. Tomazo's smooth Tale; and the more to oblige him, order'd his Valet du Chambre to present him with forty Quadruples , to the value of 160 l. Sterling; which pleas'd D. Tomazo much better then the Kicks o'the Breech which the Surly Captain gave him. Which being done, the Prince gave him farther hopes of his Favour, even to high Advancement, if he made out the discovery as he had begun; and so, having enjoyn'd him to return with all possible speed, in order to his going to Oudenard for the Apprehension of Don Tomazo's Traytors in the Moon, he dismiss'd the well satisfi'd Mundungus -merchant from a most dreadful Agony, with the sweet Consolation of Fidler's Fare. Don Tomazo having thus by dint of Wit, deliver'd himself out of the Lion's Den, and finding that he was able to deal with two Princes at one time, resolv'd to play his Game out. To this Intent, away he goes directly to the Prince of Orange , and to him, without any Concealment, relates all that had past between the Prince of Conde and himself. A Story which very much pleas'd the Prince, and caus'd him to laugh heartily. At the Conclusion of his Narrative, Don Tomazo was commanded by the Prince, to return at the time appointed; which he did accordingly, and found immediate Admittance to the Prince of Conde , to whom he told the same Story as before, only with some Alterations and Additions. Which so convinc'd the Great General of the Truth of the Fable, not believing that though a man had counterfeited once, he would ever be such a Fool to venture again with the same Lye in his Mouth, that he order'd Don Tomazo to go directly by such a Token to the Marquis de Chamilly , then Governour of Oudenard , and give him an Account of the whole matter, as from the Prince. All which Don Tomazo exactly perform'd; but then pretending to the Marquis, that the Persons were not yet come, and that it behov'd him therefore to stay till they came; that Liberty was soon allow'd him. During which time, he made it his Business to walk and view all the Fortifications, as well Private as Publick; as also, to take several Memoirs of what he thought proper for his Purpose. And though it was not to be expected, that the Marquess should be so liberal as the Prince of Conde , yet did Don Tomazo so well order his Governourship, that he Chamilly'd him out of forty Pistols; and so having model'd all his draughts  & Observations, he watch'd his Opportunity, and stole out of the Town, though with no small hazzard; the French being the most careful in the World how they let any persons pass in or out at their Garrisons without a strict Examination. By this time the Prince of Conde had receiv'd an account from some Correspondent of his in the Dutch Army, that the Prince of Orange had sent an Engineer to Oudenard , and that he did intend to beleaguer it. Which piece of imperfect Intelligence from a known Friend, agreeing with Don Tomazo's Story, so startl'd the Prince, that he now believ'd every word Don Tomazo had said. And thereupon, raises his Camp from Charleroy , and marches quite cross the Country to cover Oudenard ; into which he put three thousand fresh men with Provisions, continuing his Camp upon the Downs, in expectation of the Prince of Orang's Coming. Of whom in four days after he heard another Story, for the Dutch taking the Opportunity of the discamping and long march of the French , presently surrounded Charleroy , the place they had all along had their Design upon; which forc'd the Prince after a tedious March to Oudenard for the Apprehension of Don Tomazo's invisible Ingineers, to hurry back again to the Relief of Charlery , where he had no small Trouble to raise the Besiegers, not daring to give them Battel, though he had much the Advantage: And it may be truly said, that this invented Chim aera of Don Tomazo's , the product of a meer Accident, had so disorder'd the Measures of the French Counsels, by sending their General from post to pillar, that they could not recover their Senses all that Summer. From such small Beginnings oft times arise the most fatal Revolutions in the World. For, to say Truth, the Siege of Oudenard was never dreamt of, till Don Tomazo's Return from thence with the Marquis's Pistols, and his presenting the Prince of Orange with the Draughts and Observations he had made. But then the Prince consulted all his Engineers, and divers Councils of War were held upon the occasion of Don Tomazo's discoveries; which were found to be of that Consequence, that the Dutch fell in good earnest to the Siege of Oudenard ; which put the Prince of Conde to another Dance of Attendance upon their Masterships, to rouze 'em from that haunt. Which hapn'd very much to the loss of the Besiegers, and more for the Prince of Conde's honour, though Don Tomazo had put him to trot hard for it. However, there were some Commanders of great Experience among the Dutch , who were of Opinion, that had the directions which Don Tomazo gave them, been rightly manag'd and kept private, the Success of the Enterprise could not have fail'd. But that which occasion'd the ill Successes of the Dutch , I mean not only in this particular, but at other times, was first their ill Conduct in not concealing the good Services, nor indeed the names of the persons of those they put upon such Employments as these; and then, so often communicating their Designs to such as gave immediate notice to the French ; by whose Advices, the Dutch Spies were so often discover'd and hang'd, that others being discourag'd their Intelligence was very insignificant, till Don Tomazo undertook the business, who so order'd it, that he had several Emissaries up and down in the French Army, and some that waited even upon some of the Principal Officers themselves, which he had in daily pay; beside others that continually trotted between them in the Army and himself, who with Don Pedro , still kept his Quarters in some Spanish Garrison nearest his Business, modelling collateral designs of another nature. The next Summer, the face of Affairs was somewhat alter'd, the Prince of Conde being remov'd into Alsatia , and the Duke of Luxemburgh made General of the Army in Flanders ; which clearly disorder'd Tomazo's former Settlement: So that he was forc'd to go himself to new model his Affairs, which he effectually perform'd. For he got Don Pedro to be a Valet du Chambre to the Duke himself; by which means, Don Pedro became very Serviceable to him. His Correspondence being thus setl'd, and carri'd on for near four Months, D. Tomazo found, that some of the Spanish Governours were not so kind to him as he expected, and therefore he made his Complaint to the Prince of Orange , who soon after, procur'd Letters of Recommendation from the Duke de Villa Hermosa , not only to those, but to all others, which Don Tomazo had occasion to visit. A certain sort of Utensils, which he knew how to make use of. Some time after, there hapn'd certain disorders among the Confederate Spies, which could not be well settl'd, unless Don Tomazo appear'd among them in Person, and as it fell out, no other place would serve but the Duke of Luxemburgh's Quarters themselves. In order to this difficult Journey, Don Tomazo puts on the Habit of a Merchant, gets as many Pass-ports as were requisite for a Man under such Circumstances to travel with, and so sets forward on Foot towards the French Camp. By the way, he narrowly escap'd the pursuit of several Boors in the Province of Artois , who would certainly have stript, if not murther'd him, had he not shew'd them a good pair of Heels; the use of which he well understood: For it was common with him to travel fifty miles a day in that Country. He had no sooner got clear of this cursed Crew, but he met with another party, about a half a Mile off, as bad as themselves. Through these he had no other means to escape, but by making his way by main force. Which so provok'd those Bloody Varlets, that some of them let fly several shot at him from their Fuzees, while others set a running after him, thinking to have overtaken him; and perhaps they might have won the Race to the loss of his Life, had he not met with some of the Horse Guards of Lisle , then scouting abroad, who, observing what had past between the Boors and him, presently seiz'd him, and sent him away to the Garrison. Where he was detain'd by the Captain of the Guard, notwithstanding that he shew'd him his Passports; who told Don Tomazo , that he was a Spie, and only forc'd in by a party of their Men, who were gone out but a little before, and that therefore he should stay till the Party return'd. Don Tomazo vex'd at this stop, acquainted the Captain with the real occasion of his travelling that way, which was to wait upon the Duke of Luxemburgh ; but nothing would serve, till at length the Souldiers coming back, and giving the Captain an Account, how he had been pursu'd by the Boors, and how they had seiz'd him, to secure him out of their Clutches; he was presently discharg'd; but order'd to attend the Governour, who was desirous to see him, having heard of his deliverance out of the hands of the Sons of Belial . The Governour lik'd Don Tomazo so well, that he would fain have entertain'd him in his House, as being unwilling to part with him, always acknowledging the great Obligations the English had laid upon him in his Extremity in remembrance whereof, he thought himself engag'd to be kind to Don Tomazo . But he, knowing the urgency of his own Affairs far better then the Governour, pretended that his Errand was to the Duke of Luxemburgh and then told him so much of his business as concern'd the French Interest. Whereupon the Governour, sorry that he had detain'd D. Tomazo so long, to make him amends, by expediting his Journey, caus'd his Groom to saddle two very good Horses, and to attend D. Tomazo , till he saw him with the Duke. This kindness of the Governour Don Tomazo could very well have born with, had not the Groom been order'd to see him with the Duke. For Don Tomazo being resolv'd to make the Governour, who had given him nothing but a parcel of good words, pay for his loss of time, had already design'd to take the Horses in Execution for his Debt. All the matter was how to get rid of this impertinent Groom: Which put Don Tomazo upon his Invention that seldom fail'd; and at this time prov'd most faithful to him, for as he was riding before by a piece of enclos'd Ground, upon a Pretence that he had seen a Hare, he had flung his Cane over the Hedge; and therefore pray'd the Groom to alight and fetch it him again, while he held his Horse. Don Tomazo finding this the only time to prevent his being brought before the Duke of Luxemburgh , left his Conductor to return home a foot, and rode clear away with the Horses to Mons , a Garrison of the Spaniards . Upon his Arrival there, he was presently carry'd by two files of Musketeers to the Governour, then the Duke of Arescot , who had had Letters of Recommendation in the Behalf of Don Tomazo from the Duke of Villa Hermosa before. To the Duke Don Tomazo told the whole Story of his Travels, and how he had serv'd the Governour of Lisle for detaining him from his Business. Thereupon the Duke caus'd the horses to be sold by beat of Drum, upon the sale of which Don Tomazo receiv'd six and forty pound, which he put up in his Pocket to drink the Governour of Lisle and his Grooms Health. Two days after, the Duke sent a Convoy of 800 Dragoons to Brussels , for Provisions. Thither with them went Don Tomazo , and there considering the pressing want of his Appearance among his Confederates in the French Army, he resolv'd to adventure once more. To which purpose he drest himself up in a poor Habit like a Woman; and so setting forward, the next day made his private Entry into the French Camp. Where after he had setled all his Affairs, scowr'd and oyl'd all his Wheels, and set 'em at work again; as he was coming away, it being in the Evening, a certain lascivious Horse Officer mad to be riding a fresh Country Wench, would needs have been forcing up D. Tomazo's Coats; so that the young Amazon , not willing to be discover'd, was forc'd to use her utmost Strength to keep the boystrous Officer honest. Thereupon, as all Repulses in Love beget Revenge, the disappointed Cavalier not believing so much Strength in that Sex, and disdaining to be so slighted by a bumpkinly Trull, commanded some of his Souldiers to search Tomazo , which when those rugged men-mid-wives had done, and made the true Discovery, th' enraged Hotspur caus'd D. Tomazo to be ty'd neck and heels, and secur'd as a Spy. Now was Don Tomazo in a bushel of Troubles, and one would think past all Redemption; but give a man Luck and coyt him into the Sea. In this Condition therefore, D. Tomazo arming himself with his wonted Confidence, sends to speak in private with his amorous Officer, which being condescended to, Don Tomazo gave him such a parcel of Demonstrations so satisfactory to a Fellow that had more Leachery then Wit, that he not only order'd no more noise to be made of the Business, but at the Request of D. Tomazo , went himself to tell the Duke of Luxemburgh , that there was a person stolen out of the Prince of Orange his Army in Womans Apparel, to make some Discovery to his Excellency : whereupon the Duke sent for Don Tomazo . But having heard how the Prince of Conde had been trout-tickl'd, and resolving that no Body should make a Gudgeon of him, so soon as Don Tomazo was brought before him, sent for several Officers who had serv'd in the Army when the Prince of Conde commanded, to come and view Don Tomazo , but it so happen'd, that now there was not one that could remember him, upon which Assurance the Duke was willing to hear what Don Tomazo had to say; which was to this Effect, as close as all the Wit he had could prompt him to lay it; That an English Colonel in the Dutch Army had a great Inclination to serve the King of France , and to that purpose, would so order his Business, that all his Men and Officers should privately convey themselves into the French Camp, provided the Duke would assure them of the same Employments in his Service, as they had under the Prince of Orange: And farther, that the said Colonel had employ'd him, who was one of his Corporals, to treat with his Excellency about it. This Tale of a rosted Horse seem'd very probable to the Duke, by reason of the frequent Revolts of the English to the French , in regard of their better Pay and Usage. Thereupon the Duke oblig'd Don Tomazo to assure the Officers, that they should not only have the same Employments, but also Considerations of greater Value; and to give Don Tomazo an occasion to applaud his Bounty, with his own hand, put into D. Tomazo's Paum, ten Pistols for a Taste; for which, Don Tomazo having made a Scrape or a Court'sie, he cannot well remember, with a most chearful Heart withdrew: and being now from a Mouse in a Trap, advanc'd to be a Man at full Liberty, repairs to the Prince of Orange , to whom he related the and bad Fortune that had befall'n good him, since the last time that he had waited upon his Highness: which so well pleas'd the Prince, that he remembring the Proverb of the Pitcher, kindly perswaded Don Tomazo not to venture any more, as indeed he did not intend; but seemingly refus'd to give over, keeping his private Correspondence still with his Agents in Pay, though that knack of his were unknown to the Prince. But by this time the Winter approach'd; and the Rivulets of Money not flowing so freely from the Prince's Springs, as if there were no need of Intelligence in the Winter; Don Tomazo , who thought he deserv'd as much in the Winter as in the Summer, and therefore apprehended himself to be slighted, sent for Don Pedro out of the French Army, and resolves to set some Engine at work. To this purpose, Don Tomazo , taking Don Pedro along with him, went to the Governour of Gaunt , with whom he was sure there lay perdue a Letter of Recommendation from the Duke of Villa Hermosa in his behalf, as there did with all the rest of the Spanish Governours. To this same great Man of Trust, Don Tomazo pretended, that D. Pedro was going upon particular and immediate Service into the French Camp; but wanted Money to defray the necessary Expences of the Design. Upon which Assertion of such a known Minister among them as Don Tomazo, Don Pedro was presently furnish'd with 30 l. With which Pretence, they visited all the most considerable Governours of the Spanish Garrisons, which produc'd a notable Heap; for they never got less than Twenty pound at a place. At length, having no more but one to visit, who was a great Grandee, they resolv'd to strike him home. To which intent, they took up their Quarters in Antwerp ; and as they never wanted Tools (for Don Tomazo had provided himself of a Signet with the Prince of Orange's Arms) they counterfeited a Letter from the Prince to Count Salazar , then Governour of Antwerp Castle, in these very Words.  SIR, four Horses, at the Request of P. Orange .  This Letter was carri'd by Don Tomazo , alone; and being shew'd to the Count, who had not the least suspicion that it was written at Don Tomazo's Quarters in Antwerp , order'd the Money forthwith to be paid, and the Horses to be deliver'd; which you may be sure were none of the worst. For the Count was so civil to the Prince, as to give Don Tomazo the Liberty to go into his Stable, and make Choice of such as he should think most proper for his purpose. And for prevention of the bad Effects of Second thoughts, as well as for their own ease, Don Tomazo requested the Count, that he would permit one of his Grooms to ride along with him. A request soon granted to the Spy-master General of Holland . Having thus done all their business with success, Don Tomazo and Don Pedro rode directly like Castor and Pollux to Dunkirk ; where being stopt by the Out-guards, Don Tomazo , with a kind of impatient Countenance of Business, desir'd to be carri'd forthwith before the Governour; to whom, so soon as he had the Liberty of a private Audience, he related in part what he had done to the Advantage of the French ; that his coming to that Garrison, was to serve the King his Master, and as such a one desir'd to to be entertain'd. Upon this the Governour receiv'd both Don Tomazo and Don Pedro with great Civility, giving them Permission to dispose of their Booty. But Don Tomazo being willing to lay some kind of Obligation upon the Governour, for the Proverb tells ye, there is daubing in all Trades, as an Acknowledgment of his Favour, presented him with two of the best; the other two they put i' their Pockets, and having giv'n the Groom a small Gratuity for his Attendance, and money to bear his Expences, they dismiss'd him with as ponderous a Complement to his Master, as they thought his Memory was able to bear, which by that time was as welcome to the Count as the sound of his Passing-bell. For before the Return of the Groom with his vostre tres humble's , the Prince of Orange passing through Antwerp in his way to the Hague (the Campaigne being then broke up) the Spanish Count believing he had laid a great Obligation upon the Prince never to be forgotten, gave him to understand, how ready he had been to observe his Highness's Commands, in furnishing Don Tomazo according to his Request, expecting some mountainous Complement for his great Care. But the Prince not knowing what the Count meant, instead of applauding his Sedulity, fell a laughing, adding withal, that it was a Trick, and that he must pay for his Learning. No not so, reply'd the Count, for I have your Highness's hand to shew for what I have done: and presently drew the Note out of his Pocket. The Prince read it, and shew'd it to all the Chief Personages about him, who could not gainsay, but that it was the Prince's Subscription, and his Secretaries Writing. However, in regard the Prince could not remember either the Time or the Occasion of such a bountiful piece of Writing, it was by all condemn'd for a Cheat, and so the Count lost his Cause. Nevertheless, the Prince more sensible then the rest, of the Motives that had induc'd D. Tomazo to make such an ill use of his Ingenuity, protested, that if Don Tomazo were with him again, he should not be so slighted as he had been, for that he had done him very great Services; and therefore could not well be blam'd for carving for himself, what ought to have been with more Freedom allow'd him. Weary now of the Land Service, for a while, they resolv'd to commit themselves to the Mercy of the Ocean; and to venture the Hazards of three unruly Elements, Fire, Air, and Water all at once. In order to which Resolution, the two bold Sparks, flush with the Spoils of the Flandrian Governours, make a League with a Privateer at Dunkirk , and so hoisting sail, they steer away for the North-East Sea; Where after they had taken several Prizes, D. Tomazo was order'd by the Captain to officiate in one of the best, as his Lieutenant. Now would it not vex a man of Sense to be in Possession of a Peruvian Mine, and in a moment to loose it again through the Folly or rather Madness of a company of unruly beasts? For this some prize wherein Tomazo was, being well stor'd with Wine, as well as other rich Commodities, had given the Seaman such a fatal Opportunity to steep themselves in the Juice of the Grape, that while their heads swam, the Ship run a ground upon the Isle of Amelandt ; in which condition D. Tomazo and the rest of the Seamen having pillag'd her of the best of her lading, left her to the mercy of the next Tide, and got a shore, which being discover'd by two Dutch -men that belong'd to the Vessel before she was made Prize, the Country rose upon the miserable sons of Misfortune, took them every Mothers- son Prisoners, and carry'd them to Harling in Friezland , where after they had stript them, and eas'd them of their rich plunder which in Gold, Jewels, Neck-laces of Pearl and other Commodities of the highest Value found upon no more then 13 men, amounted to no less then 15000. l. Sterling ; they were so charitable as to deliver them some of their Seamens old Cloaths, to cover their Nakedness, and so with five Shillings apiece to bear their Expences, turn'd 'em like a sort of Christian Dogs out of the Town, to enquire their way home to Dunkirk , which is near a hundred Leagues; So little Compassion do Malefactors find among the wicked themselves. In their way, the chiefest place of Note was Amsterdam , where D. Tomazo having entred into a Confederacy with two of the stoutest and acutest of the distressed Gang, resolv'd to make a full stop; leaving the rest to take their own Course. Here Don Tomazo , hourly instigated by his late Sufferings and Losses fresh in Memory, thinking no Injury he could do so merciless an Enemy, could equalize the Miseries which they had caus'd him to endure, sought all Opportunities to satisfie his importunate Revenge. Nor needed he long to wait, for those Occasions are always at the Elbow of those that dare adventure to attempt. And so it now hapn'd, for at that time, several East-India Ships, being newly return'd home, lay below a certain place call'd the Pampus , not being able to get over the Sands, till they had lighten'd themselves by unloading some part of their Freight. To which purpose, several small Vessels of thirty and forty Tun apiece, were employ'd to carry the Goods so unladen up the River to Amsterdam ; all which D. Tomazo and his Comrades with Teeth watring, and Fingers itching well observ'd. And therefore knowing their Condition to be desperate, and that if their Courage did not put an end to their Misery, their Necessity would soon send them for another World, for which they were not yet ready; they resolv'd to play at Hazard and venter Neck or nothing. With which Resolution, they made bold to borrow a small Boat from Amsterdam , and to set sail toward the Pampus upon the Tryal of their Fortune. By the way they met with a Vessel of forty Tuns laden with Indian Goods, which in the height of their indigent Fury, they presently took, though guarded by nine men, whom they made Prisoners. With this Prize, the three daring Adventurers sail'd close by the Ship from whence the Goods were taken, whose Company well knowing that was not the way to Amsterdam , let fly several Shot at Don Tomazo's Prize, however all to no purpose, they had as good ha' thrown their Caps at it, for the Vessel running right before the Wind, got presently out of their Reach. But coming up with the Texel at the Mouth of the River, the Gunner of that Fort having observ'd the Shot which the East-India Gyant had made at Tomazo's Pigmee, sent his Iron round Robins after him too, which made several Loopholes in the Sails, and some few in the Hull of the Vessel, but all to little or no effect, so that now being quite out of their Reach, and as they thought, out of Danger, they put boldly to Sea, and steer'd their Course directly for Dunkirk . But when Fortune has a mind to play her Christmas Gambols , the Devil's in her, she's as wanton as a Kitten; no body knows where to have her, sometimes she's as kind as an Inn- keeper's Daughter, sometimes as froppish as a Quakers wife; sometimes as sweet as a Whore in Drink, sometimes as testy as a loosing Gamester. As for Example, you shall see how she dealt hith poor Don Tomazo , before she harbour'd him in his desired Port. For no sooner were he and his two Comrades with their Prize upon the wide Ocean making for Dunkirk , but they were kenn'd by a Rotterdam Man of War, whose Business it was, to cruise about and clear the Coast; who judging by their course that they were no Friends of his, gave them Chase, and about an hour after, coming up with them, took the Vessel. Upon his first Examination, he found the Indian Commodities; and upon a farther Search, the Skipper whom Don Tomazo had stow'd in a little hole in the Hold, who gave the Captain a full Accompt of the whole Transaction. Whereupon the Captain sent away the Vessel for Rotterdam , but kept Don Tomazo and his Associates in Affliction on board his own Ship, which was to continue at Sea a Month longer, by Order from the States General . Thus much for Don Tomazo , whom Fortune had depriv'd of the Profit of all his fair Hazard and confin'd to an abstemious poor- John Diet; Now you shall see how she bob'd the Captain of the Man of War. For about a Week after, certain Privateers hap'ning to pass the Channel, being three in number, the Captain made all his Sail, and coming up with one of their Prizes, retook her, and after that another, which the three Pickaroons observing, and well knowing their strength, for they had eight or ten Guns, and a hundred Men a piece, two of them resolv'd to attacque the Man of War, while the other was sent to retake their Prizes, which being resolv'd, the Dutch Man of War was boarded, and after a smart Fight, compel'd to yield. The Dutch Captain thus bejaded, and his Ship secur'd, Don Tomazo appear'd in his Likeness, and gave the French an account of his Exploits, which so well pleas'd the Privateers, that they highly applauded him. But Don Tomazo , full of Revenge for the good Booty he had lost, requested the Captains to spare him a little Money, and six men besides his two Comrades; for that he was resolv'd once more to try his Fortune upon the same Coast; which Request of his was not only granted, but one of the French Captains, mainly pleas'd, both with Don Tomazo and his Proposals, resolv'd to make one of the Company, and for his security, took his Commission with him, which was for both Land and Sea. By this time, the other Privateer, had retaken the two lost Prizes, and so they all steer'd directly for Dunkirk , taking the Valiant Defender of his Country along with them, to feed upon the same Bread of Affliction which he had intended for Don Tomazo . So various are the Chances of whimsical War. At the same time, D. Tomazo , the Captain and his Crew, took a small Boat, and made for the Land; and being got ashore, parted Company, and went by couples directly to Rotterdam . Where, after they had continued four days, they found probability enough of good store of Purchase, though not so rich as what Tomazo had already lost. But the main Booty they had fix'd their Eyes upon, was a great Fly-boat, which lay in the Road before Rotterdam , but that day return'd from Cadiz , very richly Laden, having in her a Months Provision, twenty four Guns mounted, all her Sails furl'd to the Yard, and above half her Men gone ashore. This Vessel Don Tomazo and his Crew resolv'd to attacque in the Night. And for the better carrying on of their Enterprise, D. Tomazo with the Company, went to a Village call'd Lyren Damm , and set it a fire; to the end, that while the People were busi'd for their own Security, they might with more freedom do their own Work. Which fell out very luckily; for the Fire had consum'd six Houses and four Ships. During which time, D. Tomazo and his Company had taken the Fly-boat from seventeen Men that guarded it. Who being secur'd without any Noise, they cut the Cables, and let the Vessel drive with the Tide, before they loos'd so much as one Sail: till being almost out of sight, they spread their Canvass Wings, and made all the way they could. So kindly does one Mischief assist another. Being now got below the Brill , they spi'd a very gay Pleasure-Boat under Sail, and bound for Rotterdam . At the sight of which they brought their Ship to an Anchor, man'd out their Long-boat, and Boarded the little Yacht with the usual Fury that the hope of Purchase inspires, that they soon made themselves Masters of her, four great Minheirs , and their Wives, together with nine men more, and four Seamen. These fine Folks had been taking their Pleasure all the day before at Sea; but Don Tomazo and his Company got the Profit of their Voyage at Night, which consisted of several good Watches, Jewels, Necklaces of Pearl, and Chains of Gold, to a considerable Value. The Pleasure-Boat they sunk, and then carri'd all their Pris'ners aboard their great Vessel, who being dispos'd of, they weigh'd Anchor, and set Sail, till they were clear out at Sea. At what time, they put the Minheirs and their Company into the two Shallops, which they had made use of for the Conquest of their Prize, and sent them home to bewail their Losses, having above a League to the Shore. While the Minheirs and their Wives were lamenting the sowre Sawce to their sweet Jollity, Don Tomazo and his Crew divided the Spoil, and being assisted with a thumping Gale at Nore Nore-East , in a short time arriv'd in Ostend Road; where, being spi'd by a Privateer belonging to the Town, who guess'd her to be a Prize taken by the French , he gave her Chase, and in two Hours reach'd her. Don Tomazo , and the Captain his Comrade, would not fire so much as one Gun, till the Ostender was come within half Shot; but then bringing four Guns double laden, to bear upon him all at a time, they so rak'd his Sides, that not liking his Entertainment, he sprung his Luff, and lay by to repair his damages, while Don Tomazo kept on his Course, and in twelve or fourteen hours after, arrived safe in the Splinter . The Arrival of Don Tomazo with this Prize, was more welcome to his owners, then Summer to the Swallow. Who, after they had highly caress'd and entertain'd him, expos'd the Ship and Goods to Sale; and upon Receipt of their Money, gave Don Tomazo and his Fellow Captain 4600 l. for their Shares, the Ship and Cargo being worth eight times as much, considering that there was found at the Bottom of the Vessel, a great Chest, crouded with Pieces of Eight , not less worth then two thirds of the Purchase. Don Tomazo and the Captain thus contented and satisfi'd, generously rewarded the Seamen with 300 l. a man, and gave the Prisoners which they had brought along with them twenty Crowns a piece to bear their Expences home. Wherein they shew'd nineteen times more full Ounces of Charity, then the Dutch had shewn them before at Harling . Don Tomazo being now at some leisure, began to enquire after his beloved Friend Don Pedro ; concerning whom he had this Account, That Don Pedro had been also put into another Prize, and that they fear'd he had undergone the same Misfortune which Don Tomazo had suffer'd upon the Coast of Amelandt . Soon after, Don Tomazo receiv'd a Letter from Don Pedro , that the Ship with which he had been intrusted, was cast away: which Letter was writ, not for any Truth that it contain'd, but only for the cold Comfort and Satisfaction of the Owners. For indeed the Company had agreed with Don Pedro , to run the Ship to Leith , and there expose her to Sale. But the Scots being too cunning for them, laid up the Vessel, and only gave Don Pedro and his Mates enough to bear their Charges to Dunkirk ; so that upon their Return, they were forc'd to make good the Truth of Don Pedro's Letter, by affirming the Loss of the Prize; which was too true to their Cost. The two Dons being thus reunited, and having drown'd in the Pleasures of the land the Memory of their Salt-water Afflictions, and purg'd themselves from the scorbutic Humours of hung Beef, and Groynland Fish, resolv'd to try their Talents once more upon the Terra Firma . In Pursuit of which Resolution, away they went to the Duke of Luxemburgh's Army then encamped not far from Mons . So soon as they came thither, upon their Addresses to the Duke, they were both admitted Voluntiers in his own Regiment of Foot, and soon after advanced, D. Pedro to be youngest Lieutenant, and Don Tomazo to be youngest Ensign in the same Regiment; the Duke not suspecting in the least, that one of these two was the Person that had put so many Furberies upon himself, and the Prince of Conde his Predecessor. About half a year had these two Dons enjoy'd their Commissions, at what time the French and Dutch Armies met at Cenneff , which occasion'd a most terrible Fight, wherein to the unspeakable Grief of Don Tomazo, Don Pedro was slain, and Don Tomazo himself taken Prisoner, and which was worst of all, by a Party of Horse, that belong'd to Salazar Governour of Antwerp Castle, of whom Don Tomazo had borrow'd the Money and Horses in the Prince of Orange's Name. These needy Spaniards having uncas'd Don Tomazo , found in his Pockets several rough Draughts of Antwerp, Mechlen, Ipre, Lovain, Gant , and several other Spanish Garrisons; upon which they conjectur'd him to be a Spy, and so publickly declar'd him to be. The Noise of a Spy's being taken in time of Fight, and by his own men, made the old Count eagerly desirous to see this same Thief of Intelligence; But no sooner did Don Tomazo appear in his Sight, but the Cunning Governour at first View without Spectacles, knew him to be the Person that he had furnish'd with the Money and Horses, as already has been related. So that without any farther Examination, Don Tomazo was commited close Prisoner to Antwerp Castle, and by the Counts Order, guarded day and night by four Sentinels, to prevent any Discourse, or Conveyance of Letters. This severe Confinement lasted about four Months. In which time the Misfortunes of an English Gentleman had entred the Colledge of Jesuits at Antwerp , and was more particularly taken notice of by one Father Worseley , who was the only man among them that made it his business to gain Proselytes. He therefore, at the Instigation of his Zeal prevail'd with the Count, to discourse Don Tomazo: A request easily obtain'd by one of his Order and Function. When Father Worseley came to discourse Don Tomazo in English , Heavens, what a Refreshing it was to him! For he had not spoken to any Person whatever in ten Weeks before. Presently Don Tomazo besought the Old Father to take his Confession, (for Don Tomazo shrewdly guessing at the Occasion of his Charitable Visit, was resolv'd to prevent him of the Trouble of a Conversion) which he did accordingly, and therein as Don Tomazo had order'd it, had some sort of Information of Don Tomazo's Case. From thence forward, the Old Father lookt upon him as his Pupil, procur'd him a better Provision of Diet and Lodging, and came often to visit him, as well to confirm him in his Faith, as to fathom the Bottom of his Crime. And at length, the Father's good Opinion of his Penitent, mov'd him to so much Compassion, that having throughly sifted his Case, and understanding, that the Draughts which the Spaniards found in his Pockets, were the Effects of his Employment under the Prince of Orange , and that the Prince had been presented with all the Copies of them, he resolv'd to take a Journey to the Prince to know the Truth of the Matter, which he soon found to be real; and that the Prince was sorry for Tomazo's Misfortune. During these Negotiations of the Old Father, Don Tomazo was brought before a Court Marshal, convicted for a Spie, and sentenc'd to be shot to Death by two Files of Musqueteers; but upon Don Tomazo's Application, he was allow'd five Days Time for him to prepare himself for another World, neither he knowing of the Father's Journey, nor the Father of his Condition. But it luckily fell out, that the Old Father return'd before two of the five Days were expir'd, and brought along with him a Letter from the Prince of Orange , to the Duke de Villa Hermosa , purporting the great desire he had that Don Tomazo should be discharg'd. But the Old Father, having all the Count's Revenge, and Interest at Court to deal with, found it hard to get the Prince's Letter allow'd: so that all he could obtain for the present, was a Reprieve for fourteen days longer. In that time the Father made another Journey to the Prince, and then return'd with two Letters, one to the Duke, and another to the Count, which gave them both such Satisfaction, that Don Tomazo was order'd to be discharg'd. But the Old Father desirous to try whether Don Tomazo were a true Son of the Church or no, kept him still in ignorance of his Proceedings; and still admonish'd him to prepare for Death, as Don Tomazo did according to all the ceremonies of the Romish Church, as being indifferent to him since he must die of what Religion he died. So that now the time prefixt being quite expir'd, Tomazo was brought to the Tree, bound fast, the Souldiers in his sight ready presented, the Old Man on his Right Hand, the few Ejaculations he had were spent, and he ready to give the Sign, when the Old Father seeing the Constancy of his devout Son, unbound him, and with Tears embrac'd him (an odd kind of Ambition in those People to heighten the Merits of their Obligations) crying out, My Son, thou shalt not die, for God has intended thee for some good and Pious Work . Don Tomazo thus discharg'd was taken by the old Father to the Jesuits Colledge, where the Members of the Order, rais'd him a Collection of thirty seven pound, which put him into an Equipage to return to the French Army; where he was no sooner arrived, but he was inform'd by an English Souldier, that Don Pedro was slain, that all their Equipage and Money was seiz'd, for that the Duke of Luxemburgh had understood, as indeed their Papers demonstrated no less, that his Lieutenant and Ensign, had been both Spies for the Prince of Orange . It was a hard case for a man to lose all the Treasure and sweet Booty, for which he had so often ventur'd his Life; but Don Tomazo rather chose to abandon all, then stand to the Mercy of the Duke of Luxemburgh ; and so with a heavy and disconsolate Heart, he took his way for Calice , from thence he cross'd over to Dover , and so came directly to London . Being come to London , his first Endeavour was to find out an Associate fit for his Turn, of which he could not well miss among so much Variety. So that having leagu'd himself with one (as he thought) according to his heart's desire, and rais'd a small Sum of Money, they two fell to the Old Trade of Counterfeiting Gold. So that in a short time, they had made and utter'd a considerable quantity, presuming to visit several Parts wherein Don Tomazo had been before. Which bold Attempt prov'd very unsuccessful. For having dispers'd several of their Illegitimate Guineys in Wiltshire, Dorset and Hampshire , they were pursu'd and taken in Dorsetshire , and both upon Information, committed to Dorchester Prison. Some time after, Don Tomazo was remov'd to Sarum , there to be try'd according to the Law for his Offences committed in those Parts. A thing that could not be avoided; so that he was convicted, and suffer'd the penalty of his Sentence: and which added to his Affliction, he had no fair Prospect of his Release, as not having wherewithal to satisfie the irresistable Demands of the Jaylor. But Fortune, sometimes his Friend, as well as sometimes his Foe, soon found out a way to bring him out of this Labyrinth. For in a short time after, one of the tender Sex, among whom he had always a Friend in a Corner, came and made him a visit so full handed, that Don Tomazo soon purchas'd the Liberty of his Heels. Which being obtain'd, away he comes for London ; where he first sought out, and soon found a Companion. For Iniquity seldom prospers without Confederacy. This Companion of his lent him his helping hand to the Old Profession; for they knew that the readiest way to have Money, was to make it themselves. And therefore, after they had stor'd themselves with a sufficient parcel of their own Manufacture, and were able to set up for themselves, away they gallop to Newmarket , where it was their course to bett high, but never both of the same side. So that if the one lost, the other was sure to win: and the Gains of the one, easily made good the others Losses: for the loss of near a hundred Guineys of Don Tomazo's quaint sort of Metal, did not amount to above Seven pound. This Trade continu'd for some time with good Success; there being hardly a Horse-race, or a Cock-match that escap'd the two Guiney-merchants. But that trade failing at length, D. Tom. and his Companion turn'd Graziers, and frequenting the Fairs and Markets up and down the Country, bought several Droves of Cattel with their unlawful Coin; for which, when they had driven them off to another place, they soon found Chapmen, as being Persons that could easily afford good Peniworths. But the Cries of the Country Farmers began to be so loud, when they found what a bad Exchange they had made, that Don Tomazo and his Companion not able to endure the Noise, were forc'd, after a Trade of four Months continuance, to quit a Calling so prejudicial to all the Landlords and Tenants in the Country. So true is the Proverb, That nothing violent is of long Continuance . Thus, no where safe, and continually lying under the Curse of wasting perpetually what was ill got, the two Knights of the Order of Industry, resolv'd to take their Pleasure at Sea. To which purpose they bought them a Vessel of about Forty Tuns, and having man'd her with persons fit for their purpose, they lay perdue, sometimes in the River's Mouth, sometimes in the Chanel, to meet with Merchants Vessels that were homeward bound. Out of which, Don Tomazo and his Friend bought several good Peniworths of the Seamen with their counterfeit Gold, till they had almost loaded their Vessel. Which done, away they made for some convenient Port, and expos'd their Goods to Sale for good Money. This was a way less hazardous, but very expensive, and therefore not answering expectation, was soon laid aside. The Sea Trade failing for this reason, and the two Merchants near broke, D. Tomazo and his Comrade parted, after which D. Tomazo taking a Journey into Berkshire , to sow his Yellow Grain in that Soyle, was apprehended, and committed to Prison for endeavouring to enrich that County with his pretious Wealth. There he was kept half a year in Durance, and sorely threatn'd to be sent to Heaven in a String; but not liking that way of travelling to Bliss, he so order'd his Affairs, that he was discharg'd without any Tryal, though cruelly grip'd with the pangs of Poverty. For when the Prison Doors were open'd to him, all his Revenue was but three shillings. But Industry soon increast it. For out of that small Sum, one being a Mill'd shilling, he presently made a Counterfeit Guiney, and past it off with a Certiorari for good. Which fruitful Return, soon produc'd a new Recruit; so that in a short time, he saw himself the Father of two goodly Twins, or Bags of a hundred pound a piece, begot by his own labour. This round Sum warm'd his Invention, and put him in an Equipage to go on with a New Project. In order to which, away he returns for London , hires several Servants fit for his purpose, according to the method of Trim-tram , and takes at least fourteen or fifteen Lodgings of good Note in the City. Which Lodgings were generally near the Shop-keeper, or the Merchant that was to suffer under his Contrivance. These Boroughs of his, he would visit several times in a day, lying sometimes at one and sometimes at another, till he had lain a night a piece in each; which being, as he thought, long enough, he began his Frolick as follows. Don Tomazo staid in his Lodging, and sent a Servant, as it might be, cross the way to a Goldsmith, to bring him such and such Parcels of Rings and Jewels of such a sort to shew them his Master. Presently either the Goldsmith or his Man came along with the Servant in hopes of some great Customer. But when Don Tomazo had fix'd upon such Jewels and Rings which he seem'd to like best, and agree'd upon the Price, the Goldsmith having left the main Purchase with Don Tomazo , was desir'd to walk up another pair of Stairs with his Servant, if the House admitted of such a Conveniency, there to receive his Money. But no sooner was the Goldsmith in the Trap, but the Servant, who you may be sure was a special Trout, lock'd the Door upon the poor Mouse, and presently both Master and Man slipt away together. At another place, having bought another parcel of the same Commodities at the same Rate, he would send his Servant with the owner of the Goods to some Cashier or Banker of Note, to be there paid for his costly Ware, and while his Trusty Servant and the Goldsmith were trotting to the Receipt of of Custom, away tript D. Tomazo to another Lodging, leaving his Servant to make his Escape and shift for himself as well as he could. And of such an Exploit as this, a certain Goldsmith in Lumbard Street had the Misfortune to have the woful Experience to the loss of 275 l. 17 s. 6 d. Now you are to understand, that when D. Tomazo had once begun his Diabolical Progress, he us'd all the Expedition imaginable in his dispatches, and removals from place to place, in regard it behov'd him never to leave off till he had made an effectual Visit at all his particular Abodes: which was done to all Intents and Purposes in the space of nine hours, by which he got more then the best Day-labourer that works at Pauls : the reward of those few Hours pains, amounting to no less then 1625 l. For he look'd upon it as a Calling too mean for one of his Quality to make Childrens Shoes. But this Trick made too great a noise to be plaid over again. So that Don Tomazo was resolv'd to knock off, and live for some time upon the Spoil. In order whereunto, like an honest Master, he first discharg'd all his Servants, to whom he gave 35 l. a piece, which amounted to 525 l. there being fifteen in all; and then retir'd into the Countrey. But neither could he there rest long; for though he went under the most absolute disguise imaginable, yet it would so happen, that some or other still knew him. So that in short, by removing from place to place, and living at the rate of a Lord, his massie Sum in two years, was reduc'd to an hundred and fifty pound, with which D. Tomazo set forward again for London , the only Stage proper for a Gusman , to act his parts upon, in order to the projecting some new Enterprize. But no sooner was he come to Town, but a Gentleman of Worcestershire , with whom D. Tomazo had been traffiquing by way of Exchange, to the value of 170 l. met him in the Street, and began to make a Noise, which D. Tomazo finding no way convenient for his Interest, whisper'd the Gentleman in the Ear. Which gentle motion of Don Tomazo's Lips, having conveigh'd to his irritated Senses, a short promise of Satisfaction, stopt the violent motion of the Gentleman's Tongue. Thereupon away they went to the Tavern, where Don Tomazo would fain have been rid of his troublesome Companion; but he stuck so close to him, and kept him so charily within the reach of his Eye, that Don Tomazo , to his unspeakable Grief, was forc'd to come to Composition, and to pay the Gentleman 120 l. This forc'd Putt of Moral Satisfaction brought Don Tomazo very low. Hating therefore that Want should be his Master, he resolv'd to have one stroak more with his Hammer, and so fell to the old Trade of Coining. Which work, by the help of two more Assistants, being compleated, and a good stock of Pieces being made, they had laid their Design to take a Ramble into Essex to dispose of their Gold, that made others poor and themselves rich. Being upon their Journey, they took Hackney in their way, where one of the Sparks, having his Pockets full of Gold, would needs have the World to take notice of it; and to that end, at a place where he and his Companions had call'd to drink a Bottle of Wine, pull'd out his Gold by handfuls, and exchang'd one of his counterfeit Guineys to pay the Reckoning. The King's Picture dazl'd the Vintner's Eyes at first; but they were no sooner gone, but, happily for Essex , the Cheat was discover'd, which put the whole Town upon a swift pursuit, and such a one as prov'd indeed so very swift, that the whole knot of Money-changers was quite unti'd, all of them taken and carri'd over the Fields to a Justice of the Peace. By which means D. Tomazo took the advantage to dispose of his Guineys in the long grass. Nevertheless, that poor shift would not do, Don Tomazo was sent to Newgate for Company, try'd at the Old Baily for Company, and fin'd 50 l. for Company, and so was remanded to Newgate for Company, where he lay a whole year, not able to pay his Fine; and at length obtain'd His Majesties Most Gracious Pardon, by which he was discharg'd. Having this ill luck in Company, he fell to the old Trade alone, with the assistance only of one Servant. But whether Fortune had taken a peek agaid Coiners, or whether Mercury were turn'd honest, and had dispos'd of his Influencies another way, so it hapn'd, that D. Tomazo having sent his Boy to the Silver Market one Evening in the shape of a Vintner's Servant, to exchange some few counterfeit Guineys, the raw Messenger was taken, carri'd before a Magistrate, examin'd, and upon his Examination discover'd his Master. Whereupon D. Tomazo , was as soon apprehended, and sent to wait upon his Man to Newgate . 'Twas an ill jobb for one Misfortune so soon to fall upon the neck of one another; But there was no avoiding these home-thrusts of Fate. And therefore D. Tomazo , to make the best of a bad Market, made all his Applications to his Servant, and so far prevail'd upon his good Nature, to recant his Charge against his Master, and take the whole business upon himself; which he did, with that exactness and fidelity, that D. Tomazo being try'd first, was acquitted. But being forc'd to lie a good while before he could purchase his Liberty, as being charg'd with Actions to a great value; then it was that Mrs. Cellier , having heard of D. Tomazo's Fame, and believing him brisk for her turn, gave him her first Visits, which produc'd those Transactions between them, that have lately made so great a Noise in the World. For an account whereof, the Reader is refer'd to the Narratives themselves.
