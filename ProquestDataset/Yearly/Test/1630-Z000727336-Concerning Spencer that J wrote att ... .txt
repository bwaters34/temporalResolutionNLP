 was euer settled to long continuance, but in the first beginninges of it there was an uninterrupted succession of heroyke and braue men to extend and confirme it; A like necessity is in languages; and in ours we may promise our selues a long and florishing age, when diuine Spencers sunne was no sooner sett, but in Johnson a new one rose wth. as much glory and brightnesse as euer any shone withall; who being himselfe most excellent and admirable in the iudicious compositions that in several kindes he hath made, thinketh no man more excellent and more admirable then this his late pr aedecessor in the laurell crowne. To his wise and knowing judgement faith may be giuen; whereas my weake one may be called in question upon any other occasion then this, where the conspicuity of truth beareth it out. bringeth downe the highest and deepest mysteries that are contained in humane learning, to an easie and gentle forme of deliuery; wch. sheweth he is Master of what he treateth of; he can wield it as he pleaseth: And he hath done this so cunningly, that if one heede him not wth. great attention, rare and wonderful conceptions will unperceiued slide by him that readeth his workes, and he will thinke he hath mett wth. nothing but familiar and easie discourses: But lett one dwell a while upon them, and he shall feele a strange fulness and roundness in all he sayth.
