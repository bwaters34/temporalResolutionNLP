It is plea[s]ure; plea[s]ure, my dear Lucy, on leaving my paternal roof! Could you have believed that the darling child of an indulgent and dearly beloved mother would feel a gleam of joy at leaving her? but [s]o it is. The melancholy, the gloom, the condolence, which surrounded me for a month after the death of Mr. Haly, had depre[s][s]ed my [s]pirits, and palled every enjoyment of life. Mr. Haly was a man of worth; a man of real and [s]ub[s]tantial merit. He is therefore deeply, and ju[s]tly regreted by his friends; he was cho[s]en to be a future [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-009.jpg) \- external link  - Page 006. ] guardian, and companion for me, and was, therefore, beloved by mine . As their choice; as a good man, and a faithful friend, I e[s]teemed him. But no one acquainted with the di[s]parity of our tempers and di[s]po[s]itions, our views and designs, can [s]uppo[s]e my heart much engaged in the alliance. Both nature and education had in[s]tilled into my mind an implicit obedience to the will and de[s]ires of my parents. To them, of cour[s]e, I [s]acrificed my fancy in this affair; determined that my rea[s]on [s]hould coucur with theirs; and on that to ri[s]k my future happine[s]s. I was the more encouraged, as I [s]aw, from our fir[s]t acquaintance, his declining health; and expected, that the event would prove as it has. Think not, however, that I rejoice in his death. No; far be it from me; for though I believe that I never felt the pa[s][s]ion of love for Mr. Haly; yet a habit of conver[s]ing with him, of hearing daily the mo[s]t virtuous, tender, and affectionate [s]entiments from his lips, inspired emotions of the [s]incere[s]t friend[s]hip, and e[s]teem. He is gone. His fate is unalterably, and I tru[s]t, happily fixed. He lived the life, and died the death of the righteous. O that my la[s]t end may be like his! This event will, I hope, make a [s]uitable and abiding impre[s][s]ion upon my mind; teach me the fading nature of all [s]ublunary enjoyments, and the little dependence which is to be placed on earthly felicity. Who[s]e [s]ituation was more agreeable; who[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-010.jpg) \- external link  - Page 007. ] pro[s]pects more flattering, than Mr. Haly's? Social, dome[s]tic, and connubial joys were fondly anticipated, and friends, and fortune [s]eemed ready to crown every wi[s]h! Yet animated by [s]till brighter hopes, he cheerfully bid them all adieu. In conver[s]ation with me, but a few days before his exit; "There is" [s]aid he, "but one link in the chain of life, undissevered; that, my dear Eliza, is my attachment to you. But God is wife and good in all his ways; and in this, as in all other re[s]pects, I would cheerfully [s]ay, His will be done." You, my friend, were witne[s]s to the concluding [s]cene; and therefore, I need not describe it. I [s]hall only add, on the [s]ubject, that if I have wi[s]dom and prudence to follow his advice and example; if his prayers for my temporal and eternal welfare be heard and an[s]wered, I [s]hall be happy indeed. The di[s]po[s]ition of mind, which I now feel, I wi[s]h to cultivate. Calm, placid, and [s]erene; thoughtful of my duty, and benevolent to all around me, I wi[s]h for no other connection than that of friend[s]hip. This Letter is all egoti[s]m, I have even neglected to mention the re[s]pectable, and happy friends, with whom I re[s]ide; but will do it in my next.

Naturally cheerful, volatile, and unreflecting, the oppo[s]ite di[s]po[s]ition, I have found to contain [s]ources of enjoyment, which I was before uncon[s]cious of po[s][s]e[s][s]ing. My friends, here, are the picture of conjugal felicity. The [s]ituation is delightful. The visiting parties perfectly agreeable. Every thing tends to facilitate the return of my accu[s]tomed vivacity. I have written to my mother, and received an an[s]wer. She prai[s]es my fortitude, and admires the philo[s]ophy which I have exerted, under, what [s]he calls, my heavy bereavement. Poor woman! She little thinks that my heart was untouched; and when that is unaffected, other [s]entiments and pa[s][s]ions make but a tran[s]ient impre[s][s]ion. I have been, for a month or two, excluded from the gay world; and, indeed, fancied my[s]elf [s]oaring above it. It is now that I begin to de[s]cend, and find my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-012.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] natural propen[s]ity for mixing in the bu[s]y [s]cenes and active plea[s]ures of life returning. I have received your letter; your moral lecture rather; and be a[s][s]ured, my dear, your monitorial le[s][s]ons and advice [s]hall be attended to. I believe I [s]hall never again re[s]ume tho[s]e airs, which you term coquetti[s]h , but which I think de[s]erve a [s]ofter appellation; as they proceed from an innocent heart, and are the effu[s]ions of a youthful, and cheerful mind. We are all envited to [s]pend the day, to morrow, at Col. Farington's, who has an elegant [s]eat in this neighbourhood. Both he and his Lady are [s]trangers to me; but the friends, by whom I am introduced, will procure me a welcome reception. Adieu. Eliza Wharton . - -  New-Haven Is it time for me to talk again of con que[s]ts? or mu[s]t I only enjoy them in [s]ilence? I mu[s]t write to you the impul[s]es of my mind; or I mu[s]t not write at all. You are not [s]o moro[s]e, as to wi[s]h me to become a nun, would [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-013.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] our country, and religion allow it. I ventured ye[s]terday to throw a[s]ide the habiliments of mourning, and to array my[s]elf in tho[s]e more adapted to my ta[s]te. We arrived at Col. Farington's about one o'clock. The Col. handed me out of the carriage, and introduced me to a large company a[s][s]embled in the Hall. My name was pronounced with an empha[s]is; and I was received with the mo[s]t flattering tokens of re[s]pect. When we were [s]ummoned to dinner, a young gentleman in a clerical dre[s]s offered me his hand, and led me to a table furni[s]hed with an elegant, and [s]umptuous repa[s]t, with more gallantry, and addre[s]s than commonly fall to the [s]hare of [s]tudents. He [s]at oppo[s]ite me at table; and whenever I rai[s]ed my eye, it caught his. The ca[s]e, and politene[s]s of his manners, with his particular attention to me, rai[s]ed my curio[s]ity, and induced me to a[s]k Mrs. Laiton who he was? She told me that his name was Boyer; that he was de[s]cended from a worthy family; had pa[s][s]ed with honor and applau[s]e through the univer[s]ity where he was educated; had [s]ince [s]tudied divinity with [s]ucce[s]s; and now had a call to [s]ettle as a mini[s]ter in one of the fir[s]t pari[s]hes in a neighbouring [s]tate. The gates of a [s]pacious garden were thrown open, at this in[s]tant; and I accepted with avidity an invitation to walk in it. Mirth, and hilarity prevailed, and the moments fled on downy wings; while we traced the beauties of art [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-014.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] and nature, [s]o liberally di[s]played, and [s]o happily blended in this delightful retreat. An enthu[s]ia[s]tic admirer of [s]cenes like the[s]e, I had rambled [s]ome way from the company, when I was followed by Mrs. Laiton to offer her condolence on the [s]uppo[s]ed lo[s]s, which I had [s]u[s]tained, in the death of Mr. Haly. My heart ro[s]e again[s]t the woman, [s]o ignorant of human nature, as to think [s]uch conver[s]ation acceptable at [s]uch a time. I made her little reply, and waved the [s]ubject, though I could not immediately di[s]pel the gloom which it excited. The ab[s]urdity of a cu[s]tom, authori[s]ing people at a fir[s]t interview to revive the idea of griefs, which time has lulled; perhaps obliterated, is intolerable. To have our enjoyments arre[s]ted by the empty compliments of unthinking per[s]ons, for no other rea[s]on, than a compliance with fa[s]hion is to be treated in a manner which the laws of humanity forbid. We were [s]oon joined by the gentlemen, who each [s]elected his partner, and the walk wa[s] prolonged. Mr. Boyer offered me his arm, which I gladly accepted; happy to be relieved from the impertinence of my female companion. We returned to tea, after which the ladies [s]ung, and played by turns on the Piano Forte ; while [s]ome of the gentlemen accompanied with the flute, the clarinet, and the violin, forming in the whole a very decent concert. An elegant [s]upper, and half an hour'[s] conver[s]ation [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-015.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] after it, clo[s]ed the evening; when we returned home, delighted with our entertainment and plea[s]ed with our[s]elves and each other. My imagination is [s]o impre[s][s]ed with the fe[s]tive [s]cenes of the day, that Morpheus waves his ebon-wand in vain. The evening is fine beyond the power of de[s]cription! all nature is [s]erene and harmonious; in perfect uni[s]on with my pre[s]ent di[s]po[s]ition of mind. I have been taking a retrospect of my pa[s]t life; and a few juvenile follies excepted, which I tru[s]t the recording angel has blotted out with the tear of charity, find an approving con[s]cience, and a heart at ea[s]e. Fortune, indeed, has not been very liberal of her gifts to me; but I pre[s]ume on a large [s]tock in the bank of friend[s]hip, which, united with health and innocence, give me [s]ome plea[s]ing anticiapation[s] of future felicity. Whatgever my fate may be, I [s]hall always continue your Eliza Wharton . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-016.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] - -  New-Haven You a[s]k me, my friend, whether I am in pur[s]uit of truth, or a lady? I an[s]wer, both. I hope and tru[s]t they are united; and really expect to find truth and the virtues and graces be[s]ides in a fair form. If you mean by the fir[s]t part of your que[s]tion, whether I am [s]earching into the [s]ublimer doctrines of religion? To the[s]e I would by no means be inattentive; but to be hone[s]t, my [s]tudies of that kind have been very much interrupted of late. The re[s]pectable circle of acquaintances with which I am honored here, has rendered my vi[s]its very frequent and numerous. In one of the[s]e I was introduced to Mi[s]s Eliza Wharton; a young lady who[s]e elegant per[s]on, accompli[s]hed mind, and poli[s]hed manners have been much celebrated. Her fame has often reached me; but, as the queen of Sheba [s]aid to Solomon, the half was not told me. You will think, that I talk in the [s]tyle of a lover. I confe[s]s it, nor am I a[s]hamed to rank myself among the profe[s][s]ed admirers of this lovely fair one. I am in no danger, however, of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-017.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] becoming an enthu[s]ia[s]tic devotee. No, I mean to act upon ju[s]t and rational principles. Expecting [s]oon to [s]ettle in an eligible [s]ituation, if [s]uch a companion as I am per[s]uaded [s]he will make me, may fall to my lot, I [s]hall deem my[s]elf as happy as this [s]tate of imperfection will admit. She is now re[s]ident at Gen. Richman's. The general and his lady are her particular friends. They are warm in her prai[s]es. They tell me, however, that [s]he is naturally of a gay disposition. No matter for that; it is an agreeable quality, where there is di[s]cretion [s]ufficient for its regulation. A cheerful friend, much more a cheerful wife is peculiarly nece[s][s]ary to a person of a [s]tudious and [s]edentary life. They dispel the gloom of retirement, and exhilerate the [s]pirits depre[s][s]ed by inten[s]e application. She was formerly addre[s][s]ed by the late Mr. Haly of Bo[s]ton. He was not, it [s]eems, the man of her choice; but her parents were extremely partial to him, and wi[s]hed the connection to take place. She, like a dutiful child, [s]acrificed her own inclination to their plea[s]ure, [s]o far as to acquie[s]ce in his vi[s]its. This [s]he more ea[s]ily accompli[s]hed, as his health, which declined from their fir[s]t acquaintance, led her to [s]uppo[s]e, as the event has proved, that he would not live to enter into any la[s]ting engagements. Her father, who died [s]ome months before him, invited him to re[s]ide at his hou[s]e, for the benefit of a change of air, agreeably to the advice of his phy[s]icians. She attended him during his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-018.jpg) \- external link  - Page 015. ] la[s]t illne[s]s, with all the care and a[s][s]iduity of a nur[s]e; and with all the [s]ympathi[s]ing tenderness of a [s]i[s]ter. I have had [s]everal opportunities of conversing with her. She di[s]covers an elevated mind, a ready apprehen[s]ion, and an accurate knowledge of the various [s]ubjects which have been brought into view. I have not yet introduced the favorite [s]ubject of my heart. Indeed [s]he [s]eems [s]tudiou[s]ly to avoid noticing any expre[s][s]ion which leads towards it. But [s]he mu[s]t hear it [s]oon. I am [s]ure of the favor and intere[s]t of the friends with whom [s]he re[s]ides. They have promi[s]ed to [s]peak previou[s]ly in my behalf. I am to call as if accidentally this afternoon, ju[s]t as they are to ride abroad. They are to refer me to Mi[s]s Wharton for entertainment, till their return. What a delightful opportunity for my purpo[s]e! I am counting the hours, nay, the very moments. Adieu. You [s]hall [s]oon hear again from your mo[s]t obedient, J. Boyer . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-019.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] - -  New-Haven These bewitching charms of mine have a tendency to keep my mind in a [s]tate of perturbation. I am [s]o pe[s]tered with the[s]e admirers; not that I am [s]o very hand[s]ome neither; but I dont know how it is, I am certainly very much the ta[s]te of the other [s]ex. Followed, flattered, and care[s][s]ed; I have cards and compliments in profu[s]ion. But I mu[s]t try to be [s]erious; for I have, alas! one [s]erious lover. As I promi[s]ed you to be particular in my writing, I [s]uppo[s]e I mu[s]t proceed methodically. Ye[s]terday we had a party to dine. Mr. Boyer was of the number. His attention was immediately engro[s][s]ed; and I [s]oon perceived that every word, every action, and every look was [s]tudied to gain my approbation. As he [s]at next me at dinner, his a[s][s]iduity and politene[s]s were plea[s]ing; and as we walked together afterwards, his conver[s]ation was improving. Mine was [s]entimental and [s]edate; perfectly adapted to the ta[s]te of my gallant. Nothing, however, was [s]aid particularly expre[s][s]ive of his apparent wi[s]hes. I [s]tudiou[s]ly avoided every kind of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-020.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] discourse which might lead to this topic. I wi[s]h not for a declaration from any one, e[s]pecially from one whom I could not repul[s]e and do not intend to encourage at pre[s]ent. His conversation, [s]o [s]imilar to what I had often heard from a [s]imilar character, brought a decea[s]ed friend to mind, and rendered me [s]omewhat pensive. I retired directly after [s]upper. Mr. Boyer had ju[s]t taken leave. Mrs. Richman came into my chamber as [s]he was pa[s][s]ing to her own. Excu[s]e my intrusion, Eliza, [s]aid [s]he; I thought I would ju[s]t [s]tep in and a[s]k you if you have pa[s][s]ed a plea[s]ant day? Perfectly [s]o, madam; and I have now retired to protract the enjoyment by recollection. What, my dear, is your opinion of our favorite Mr. Boyer? Declaring him your favorite, madam, is [s]ufficient to render me partial to him. But to be frank, independent of that, I think him an agreeable man. Your heart, I presume, is now free? Yes, and I hope it will long remain [s]o. Your friends, my dear, [s]olicitous for your welfare, wi[s]h to [s]ee you suitably and agreeably connected. I hope my friends will never again interpo[s]e in my concnerns of that nature. You, madam, have have ever known my heart, are [s]en[s]ible, that had the Almighty [s]pared life, in a certain in[s]tance I mu[s]t have [s]acrificed my own happine[s]s, or incurred their cen[s]ure. I am young, gay, volatile. A melancholy event has lately extricated me from tho[s]e [s]hackles, which parental [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-021.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] authority had impo[s]ed on my mind. Let me then enjoy that freedom which I [s]o highly prize. Let me have opportunity, unbia[s][s]ed by opinion, to gratify my natural di[s]po[s]ition in a participation of tho[s]e plea[s]ures which youth and innocence afford. Of [s]uch plea[s]ures, no one, my dear, would wi[s]h to deprive you. But beware, Eliza!--- Though [s]trowed with flowers, when contemplated by your lively imagination, it is, after all, a [s]lippery, thorny path. The round of fashionable di[s][s]ipation is dangerous. A phantom is often pur[s]ued, which leaves its deluded votary the real form of wretchedne[s]s. She [s]poke with an empha[s]is, and taking up her candle, wi[s]hed me a good night. I had not power to return the compliment. Something [s]eemingly prophetic in her looks and expressions, ca[s]t a momentary gloom upon my mind! But I de[s]pi[s]e tho[s]e contracted ideas which consine virtue to a cell. I have no notion of becoming a reclu[s]e. Mrs. Richman has ever been a beloved friend of mine; yet I always thought her rather prudi[s]h. Adieu, Eliza Wharton .

I [s]hewed the billet to Mrs. Richman, [s]aying, I have not much acquaintance with this gentleman, madam; but I [s]uppo[s]e his character [s]ufficiently re[s]pectable to warrant an affirmative an[s]wer. He is a gay man, my dear, to [s]ay no more, and [s]uch are the companions we wi[s]h, when we join a party avowedly formed for plea[s]ure. I then [s]tepped into my apartment, wrote an an[s]wer, and dispatched the [s]ervant. When I returned to the parlour, [s]omething di[s]approbating appeared in the countenances of both my friends. I endeavored without [s]eeming to ob[s]erve, to di[s][s]ipate it by chit chat; but they were better plea[s]ed with each other than with me; and [s]oon ri[s]ing, walked into the garden, and left me to amu[s]e my[s]elf alone. My eyes followed them through the window. Happy pair, [s]aid I.

The pure[s]t and mo[s]t ardent affection, the greate[s]t con[s]onance of ta[s]te and di[s]po[s]ition, and the mo[s]t congenial virtue and wi[s]hes di[s]tingui[s]h this lovely couple. Health and wealth, with every attendant ble[s][s]ing preside over their favored dwelling, and [s]hed their benign influence without alloy. The consciousness of exciting their di[s]plea[s]ure gave me pain; but I con[s]oled my[s]elf with the idea that it was ill founded. They [s]hould con[s]ider, [s]aid I, that they have no [s]atisfaction to look for beyond each other. There every enjoyment is centered; but I am a poor [s]olitary being, who need [s]ome amusement beyond what I can [s]upply my[s]elf. The mind, after being confined at home for a while, [s]ends the imagination abroad in que[s]t of new trea[s]ures, and the body may as well accompany it, for ought I can [s]ee. General Richman and lady have ever appeared [s]olicitous to promote my happine[s]s [s]ince I have re[s]ided with them. They have urged my acceptance of invitations to join parties, though they have not been much them[s]elves, of late; as Mrs. Richman's pre[s]ent circumstances render her fond of retirement. What rea[s]on can be a[s][s]igned for their apparent reluctance to this evening's entertainment is to me incomprehen[s]ible; but I [s]hall apply the chymical powers of friend[s]hip, and extract the [s]ecret from Mrs. Richman to morrow if not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-024.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] before.

When I clo[s]ed my la[s]t letter to you, my heart exulted in the plea[s]ing anticipation of promi[s]ed bli[s]s; my wi[s]hes danced on the light breezes of hope, and my imagination dared to arre[s]t the attention, and even claim a return of affection from the lovely Eliza Wharton! But imagination only, it has proved; and that da[s]hed with the bitter ranklings of jealou[s]y and [s]u[s]picion. But to re[s]ume my narrative. I reached the man[s]ion of my friend about four. I was disagreeably [s]truck with the appearance of a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-025.jpg) \- external link  - Page 022. ] carriage at the door, as it rai[s]ed an idea of company which might fru[s]trate my plan; but [s]till more di[s]agreeable were my [s]en[s]ations, when, on entering the parlour, I found Major Sanford evidently in a waiting po[s]ture. I was very politely received; and when Eliza entered the room with a brilliance of appearance and gaiety of manner, which I had never before connected with her character, I ro[s]e, as did Major Sanford who offered his hand, and led her to a chair. I forgot to [s]it down again, but [s]tood transfixed by the pangs of di[s]appointment. Mi[s]s Wharton appeared [s]omewhat confu[s]ed; but [s]oon resuming her vivacity, de[s]ired me to be [s]eated; inquired after my health, and made [s]ome common place remarks on the weather. Then apologizing for leaving me, gave her hand again to Major Sanford, who had previou[s]ly ri[s]en, and reminded her that the time and their engagements made it nece[s][s]ary to leave the good company; which, indeed, they both appeared very willing to do. General Richman and lady took every method in their power to remove my chagrin, and atone for the ab[s]ence of my fair one, but ill did they [s]ucceed. They told me that Mi[s]s Wharton had not the mo[s]t di[s]tant idea of my vi[s]iting there, this afternoon; much le[s]s of the de[s]ign of my vi[s]it; that for [s]ome months together, [s]he had been lately confined by the [s]ickne[s]s of Mr. Haly, whom [s]he attended during the whole of his la[s]t illne[s]s; which confinement had eventually increa[s]ed her de[s]ire of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-026.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] indulging her natural di[s]po[s]ition for gaiety. She had, however, they [s]aid, an excellent heart and reflecting mind, a great [s]hare of [s]en[s]ibility, and a temper peculiarly formed for the enjoyments of [s]ocial life. But this gentleman, madam, who is her gallant this evening---is his character unexceptionable? Will a lady of delicacy associate with an immoral, not to [s]ay profligate man? The rank and fortune of Major Sanford, [s]aid Mrs. Richman, procure him re[s]pect. His [s]pecious manners render him acceptable in public company; but I mu[s]t own that he is not the per[s]on with whom I wi[s]h my cousin to be connected, even for a moment. She never con[s]ulted me [s]o little on any [s]ubject as on that of his card this morning. Before I had time to object, [s]he di[s]mi[s][s]ed the [s]ervant; and I forbore to de[s]troy her expected happine[s]s, by acquainting her with my di[s]approbation of her partner. Her omi[s][s]ion was not de[s]ign; it was juvenile indi[s]cretion. We mu[s]t, my dear [s]ir, continued [s]he, look with a candid eye on [s]uch excentricities. Faults, not foibles, require the [s]everity of cen[s]ure. Far, madam, be it from me to cen[s]ure any conduct, which as yet I have observed in Mi[s]s Wharton; [s]he has too great an intere[s]t in my heart to admit of that. We now went into more general conversation. Tea was [s]erved; and I [s]oon after took leave. General Richman, however, in[s]i[s]ted on my dining with him on Thur[s]day, which I promi[s]ed. And here I am again over head [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-027.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] and ears in the hypo. A di[s]ea[s]e, you will [s]ay, peculiar to [s]tudents. I believe it peculiar to lovers; and with that cla[s]s I mu[s]t now rank my[s]elf, though I did not know, until this evening, that I was [s]o much engaged as I find I really am. I knew, indeed, that I was extremely plea[s]ed with this amiable girl; that I was intere[s]ted in her favor; that I was happier in her company than any where el[s]e, with innumerable other circum[s]tances, which would have told me the truth, had I examined them. But be that as it may; I hope, and tru[s]t that I am, and ever [s]hall be a rea[s]onable creature; and not [s]uffer my judgment to be mi[s]led by the operations of a blind pa[s][s]ion. I [s]hall now lay a[s]ide this [s]ubject, endeavor to dive[s]t even my imagination of the charmer, and return until Thur[s]day, to the contemplation of tho[s]e truths and duties, which have a happy tendency to calm the jarring elements which compo[s]e our mortal frame. Adieu. J. Boyer . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-028.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] - -  New-Haven We had an elegant ball, la[s]t night, Charles; and what is [s]till more to the ta[s]te of your old friend, I had an elegant partner; one exactly calculated to plea[s]e my fancy; gay, volatile, apparently thoughtle[s]s of every thing but pre[s]ent enjoyment. It was Mi[s]s Eliza Wharton, a young lady, who[s]e agreeable person, poli[s]hed manners, and refined talents, have rendered her the toa[s]t of the country around for the[s]e two years; though for half that time [s]he has had a clerical lover impo[s]ed on her by her friends; for I am told it was not agreeable to her inclination. By this [s]ame clerical lover of hers, [s]he was for [s]everal months confined as a nur[s]e. But his death has happily relieved her, and [s]he now returns to the world with redoubled lu[s]tre. At pre[s]ent [s]he is a vi[s]itor to Mrs. Richman, who is a relation. I fir[s]t [s]aw her on a party of plea[s]ure at Mr. Frazier's where we walked, talked, [s]ung, and danced together. I thought her cou[s]in watched her with a jealous eye; for [s]he is, you mu[s]t know, a prude: and immaculate, more [s]o than you or I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-029.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] mu[s]t be the man who claims admi[s][s]ion to her society. But I fancy this young lady is a coquette; and if [s]o, I [s]hall avenge my [s]ex, by retaliating the mi[s]chiefs, [s]he meditates again[s]t us. Not that I have any ill de[s]igns; but only to play off her own artillery, by u[s]ing a little unmeaning gallantry. And let her beware of the confequences. A young clergyman came in at Gen. Richman's ye[s]terday, while I was waiting for Eliza, who was much more cordially received by the general and his lady, than was your humble [s]ervant: but I lay that up. When [s]he entered the room, an air of mutual embarra[s]ment was evident. The lady recovered her a[s][s]urance much more ea[s]ily than the gentleman. I am ju[s]t going to ride, and [s]hall make it in my way to call and inquire after the health of my dulcinea. Therefore, adieu for the pre[s]ent. Peter Sanford . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-030.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] - -  New-Haven I am not [s]o happy to day in the recollection of la[s]t evening's entertainment, as I was in the enjoyment. The explanation which I promi[s]ed you from Mrs. Richman ye[s]terday, I could not obtain. When I went down to dinner, [s]ome friends of General Richman's had accidentally dropped in, which precluded all particular conver[s]ation. I retired [s]oon to dre[s]s, and [s]aw Mrs. Richman no more, till I was informed that Major Sanford waited for me. But I was [s]urpri[s]ed on going into the parlour to find Mr. Boyer there. I blu[s]hed and [s]tammered; but I know not why; for certain I am, that I neither love nor fear the good man yet, whatever I may do [s]ome future day. I would not be under[s]tood that I do not re[s]pect and e[s]teem him; for I do both. But the[s]e are calm pa[s][s]ions, which [s]ooth rather than agitate the mind. It was not the con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of any impropriety of conduct; for I was far from feeling any. The entertainment for which I was prepared was [s]uch as virtue would not di[s]approve, and my gallant was a man of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-031.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] fortune, fa[s]hion, and for ought I knew, of unblemished character. But Mr. Boyer was much more di[s]concerted than my[s]elf. Indeed he did not recover his philo[s]ophy while I [s]taid. I believe, by [s]ome hints I have received [s]ince, that he had [s]ome particular views, in which he was di[s]appointed. Our ball had every charm which could render a ball delightful. My partner was all ea[s]e, politene[s]s, and attention; and your friend was as much flattered and care[s][s]ed as variety it[s]elf could wi[s]h. We returned to General Richman's about two. Major Sanford a[s]ked leave to call and inquire after my health, this morning, and I am now expecting him. I ro[s]e to breakfa[s]t. The late hour of retiring to re[s]t had not depre[s][s]ed, but rather exhilerated my [s]pirits. My friends were waiting for me in the parlor. They received me [s]ociably, inquired after my health, my la[s]t evening's entertainment, the company, &c. When, after a little pau[s]e, Mrs. Richman [s]aid, and how do you like Major Sanford, Eliza? Very well indeed, madam: I think him a fini[s]hed gentleman. Will you, who are a connoi[s]ieur, allow him that title? No, my dear: in my opinion, he falls far below it; [s]ince he is deficient in one of the great e[s][s]entials of the character, and that is, virtue . I am [s]urpri[s]ed, [s]aid I: but how has he incurred [s]o [s]evere a cen[s]ure? By being a pro[s]e[s][s]ed libertine; by having but too [s]ucce[s]sfully practi[s]ed the arts of [s]eduction; by triumphing in the destruction of innocence and the peace of families! [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-032.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] O, why was I not informed of this before? But, perhaps the[s]e are old affairs; the effects of juvenile folly; crimes of which he may have repented, and which charity ought to obliterate. No, my dear, they are recent facts; facts which he dares not deny; facts for which he ought to be bani[s]hed from all virtuous [s]ociety. I [s]hould have intimated this to you before, but your precipitate acceptance of his invitation deprived me of an opportunity, until it was too late to prevent your going with him; and we thought it be[s]t to protract your enjoyment as long as po[s][s]ible, not doubting but your virtue and delicacy would, in future, guard you again[s]t the like deception. Mu[s]t I then become an avowed prude at once; and refu[s]e him admi[s][s]ion, if he call, in compliance with the cu[s]tomary forms? By no means. I am [s]en[s]ible, that even the fal[s]e maxims of the world mu[s]t be complied with in a degree. But a man of Major Sanford's art can ea[s]ily di[s]tingui[s]h between a forbidding, and an encouraging reception. The former may, in this ca[s]e, be given without any breach of the rules of politene[s]s. A[s]toni[s]hed, and mortified, I knew not what further to [s]ay. I had been [s]o plea[s]ed with the man, that I wi[s]hed to plead in his favor; but virtue and prudence forbade. I therefore ro[s]e and retired. He is this moment, I am told, below [s]tairs. So that I mu[s]t bid you adieu, until the next po[s]t. Eliza Wharton . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-033.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] - -  New-Haven Upon clo[s]ing my la[s]t, I walked down, and found Major Sanford alone. He met me at the door of the parlor; and taking my hand with an air of affectionate tenderne[s]s, led me to a [s]eat, and took one be[s]ide me. I believe the gloom of [s]u[s]picion had not entirely for[s]aken my brow. He appeared, however, not to notice it; but after the compliments of the day had pa[s][s]ed, entered into an ea[s]y and agreeable conver[s]ation on the plea[s]ures of [s]ociety: a conver[s]ation perfectly adapted to my ta[s]te, and calculated to di[s][s]ipate my chagrin, and pa[s]s the time imperceptibly. He inquired the place of my native abode; and having informed him, he [s]aid he had thoughts of purchasing the [s]eat of Capt. Pribble, in that neighborhood, for his re[s]idence; and could he be assured of my [s]ociety and friend[s]hip, his resolution would be fixed. I an[s]wered his compliment only by a [s]light bow. He took leave, and I retired to dre[s]s for the day, being engaged to accompany my cou[s]in to dine at Mr. Laurence's, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-034.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] a gentleman of fortune and fa[s]hion, in this vicinity. Mr. Laurence has but one daughter, heire[s]s to a large e[s]tate, with an agreeable form, but a countenance, which to me, indicates not much [s]oul. I was [s]urpri[s]ed in the afternoon to [s]ee Major Sanford alight at the gate. He entered with the familiarity of an old acquaintance; and, after acco[s]ting each of the company, told me, with a low bow, that he did not expect the happine[s]s of [s]eeing me again [s]o [s]oon. I received his compliment with a con[s]cious awkwardness. Mrs. Richman's morning lecture [s]till rung in my head; and her watchful eye now traced every turn of mine, and every action of the major's. Indeed, his a[s][s]iduity was painful to me; yet I found it impo[s][s]ible to disengage my[s]elf a moment from him, till the clo[s]e of the day brought our carriage to the door; when he handed me in, and pre[s][s]ing my hand to his lips, retired. What [s]hall I [s]ay about this extraordinary man? Shall I own to you, my friend, that he is pleasing to me? His per[s]on, his manners, his situation, all combine to charm my fancy; and to my lively imagination, [s]trew the path of life with flowers. What a pity, my dear Lucy, that the graces and virtues are not oftner united! They mu[s]t, however, meet in the man of my choice; and till I find [s]uch a one, I [s]hall continue to subscribe my name Eliza Wharton . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-035.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] - -  New-Haven Well , Charles, I have been man oeuvring to day, a little revengefully. That, you will [s]ay, is out of character. So baleful a pa[s][s]ion does not ea[s]ily find admi[s][s]ion among tho[s]e [s]ofter ones, which you well know I cherish. However, I am a mere Proteus, and can a[s][s]ume any [s]hape that will be[s]t an[s]wer my purpose. I called this forenooon, as I told you I intended, at Gen. Richman's. I waited [s]ome time in the parlor alone, before Eliza appeared; and when [s]he did appear, the di[s]tant re[s]erve of her manners, and the pen[s]ivene[s]s of her countenance convinced me that [s]he had been vexed, and I doubted not but Peter Sanford was the occasion. Her wife cou[s]in, I could have [s]worn, had been giving her a detail of the vices of her gallant; and warning her again[s]t the danger of a[s][s]ociating with him in future. Notwithstanding, I took no notice of any alteration in her behavior; but entered with the utmo[s]t facetiousness into a conver[s]ation which I thought [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-036.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] mo[s]t to her ta[s]te. By degrees, [s]he a[s][s]umed her u[s]ual vivacity; cheerfulne[s]s and good humor again animated her countenance. I tarried as long as decency would admit. She having intimated that they were to dine at my friend Lawrence's, I caught at this information; and determined to follow them, and teaze the jealous Mrs. Richman, by playing off all the gallantry I was ma[s]ter of in her pre[s]ence. I went, and [s]ucceeded to the utmo[s]t of my wi[s]hes, as I read in the vexation, vi[s]ible in the one; and the ea[s]e and attention di[s]played by the other. I believe too, that I have charmed the eye at lea[s]t, of the amiable Eliza. Indeed, Charles, [s]he is a fine girl. I think it would hurt, my con[s]cience to wound her mind or reputation. Were I di[s]po[s]ed to marry, I am persuaded [s]he would make an excellent wife; but that you know is no part of my plan, [s]o long as I can keep out of the noo[s]e. Whenever I do submit to be [s]hackled, it mu[s]t be from a nece[s][s]ity of mending my fortune. This girl would be far from doing that. However, I am plea[s]ed with her acquaintance, and mean not to abu[s]e her credulity and good nature, if I can help it. Peter Sanford . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-037.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] - -  New-Haven The heart of your friend is again be[s]ieged. Whether it will [s]urrender to the assailants or not, I am unable at pre[s]ent to determine. Sometimes I think of becoming a prede[s]tinarian, and [s]ubmitting implicitly to fate, without any exerci[s]e of free will; but, as mine [s]eems to be a wayward one, I would counteract the operations of it, if po[s][s]ible. Mrs. Richman told me this morning, that [s]he hoped I [s]hould be as agreeably entertained this afternoon, as I had been the preceding; that [s]he expected Mr. Boyer to dine, and take tea; and doubted not but he would be as attentive and [s]incere to me, if not as gay and polite as the gentleman who obtruded his civilities ye[s]terday. I replied that I had no rea[s]on to doubt the [s]incerity of the one, or the other, having never put them to the te[s]t, nor did I imagine I ever [s]hould. Your friends, Eliza, [s]aid [s]he, would be very happy to [s]ee you united to a man of Mr. Boyer's worth; and [s]o agreeably [s]ettled, as he has a pro[s]pect of being. I hope, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-038.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] [s]aid I, that my friends are not [s]o weary of my company, as to wi[s]h to di[s]po[s]e of me. I am too happy in my pre[s]ent connections to quit them for new ones. Marriage is the tomb of friendship. It appears to me a very [s]elfi[s]h [s]tate. Why do people, in general, as [s]oon as they are married, centre all their cares, their concerns, and plea[s]ures in their own families? former acquaintances are neglected or forgotten. The tenderest ties between friends are weakened, or dissolved; and benevolence it[s]elf moves in a very limited [s]phere. It is the glory of the marriage [s]tate, [s]he rejoined, to refine, by circum[s]cribing our enjoyments. Here we can repo[s]e in [s]afety. "The friend[s]hips of the world are oft Confed'racies in vice, or leagues in plea[s]ure: Our's has the pure[s]t virtue for its ba[s]is; And [s]uch a friend[s]hip ends not but with life." True, we cannot always pay that attention to former a[s][s]ociates, which we may wi[s]h; but the little community which we [s]uperintend is quite as important an object; and certainly renders us more beneficial to the public. True benevolence, though it may change its objects, is not limited by time or place. Its effects are the [s]ame, and aided by a [s]econd [s]elf, are rendered more diffu[s]ive and [s]alutary. Some plea[s]antry pa[s][s]ed, and we retired to dre[s]s. When [s]ummoned to dinner, I found Mr. Boyer below. If what is [s]ometimes [s]aid be true, that love is diffident, re[s]erved, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-039.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] unassuming, this man mu[s]t be tinctured with it. The[s]e [s]ymptoms were vi[s]ible in his deportment when I entered the room. However, he [s]oon recovered him[s]elf, and the conver[s]ation took a general turn. The [s]e[s]tive board was crowned with [s]ociability, and we found in reality, "The fea[s]t of rea[s]on, and the flow of [s]oul." After we ro[s]e from table, a walk in the garden was propo[s]ed, an amu[s]ement we are all peculiarly fond of. Mr. Boyer offered me his arm. When at a [s]ufficient di[s]tance from our company, he begged leave to congratulate him[s]elf on having an opportunity which he had ardently de[s]ired for [s]ome time, of declaring to me his attachment; and of [s]oliciting an intere[s]t in my favor; or, if he might be allowed the term, affection. I replied, that, Sir, is indeed laying claim to an important intere[s]t. I believe you mu[s]t [s]ub[s]titute [s]ome more indifferent epithet for the pre[s]ent. Well then, [s]aid he, if it mu[s]t be [s]o, let it be e[s]teem, or friend[s]hip. Indeed, Sir, [s]aid I, you are intitled to them both. Merit has always a [s]hare in that bank; and I know of none, who has a larger claim on that [s]core, than Mr. Boyer. I [s]uppo[s]e my manner was hardly [s]erious enough for what he con[s]idered a weighty cau[s]e. He was a little di[s]concerted; but [s]oon regaining his pre[s]ence of mind, entreated me, with an air of earne[s]tne[s]s, to encourage his [s]uit, to admit his addre[s][s]es, and, if po[s][s]ible, to reward his love. I told him, that this was rather a [s]udden affair to me; and that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-040.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] I could not an[s]wer him without con[s]ideration. Well then, [s]aid he, take what time you think proper, only relieve my [s]u[s]pen[s]e, as [s]oon as may be. Shall I vi[s]it you again to morrow? O, not [s]o [s]oon, [s]aid I. Next Monday, I believe will be early enough. I will endeavor to be at home. He thanked me even for that favor, recommended him[s]elf once more to my kindness; and we walked towards the company, returned with them to the hou[s]e, and he [s]oon took leave. I immediately retired to write this letter, which I [s]hall clo[s]e, without a [s]ingle observation on the [s]ubject, until I know your opinion. Eliza Wharton . - -  Hartford And [s]o you wi[s]h to have my opinion before you know the re[s]ult of your own. This is playing a little too much with my patience. But, however, I will gratify you this once, in hopes that my epi[s]tle may have a good effect. You will a[s]k, perhaps, whether I would influence your judgment? I an[s]wer, no; provided [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-041.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] you will exerci[s]e it your[s]elf: but I am a little apprehen[s]ive that your fancy will mi[s]lead you. Methinks I can gather from your letters, a predilection for this Major Sanford. But he is a rake, my dear friend; and can a lady of your delicacy and refinement, think of forming a connection with a man of that character? I hope not. Nay, I am confident you do not. You mean only to exhibit a few more girli[s]h airs, before you turn matron. But I am per[s]uaded, if you wi[s]h to lead down the dance of life with regularity, you will not find a more excellent partner than Mr. Boyer. Whatever you can rea[s]onably expect in a lover, hu[s]band, or friend, you may perceive to be united in this worthy man. His ta[s]te is undebauched, his manners not vitiated, his morals uncorrupted. His [s]ituation in life is, perhaps, as elevated as you have a right to claim. Forgive my plainne[s]s, Eliza. It is the ta[s]k of friend[s]hip, [s]ometimes to tell di[s]agreeable truths. I know your ambition is to make a di[s]tingui[s]hed figure in the fir[s]t cla[s]s of poli[s]hed [s]ociety; to [s]hine in the gay circle of fa[s]hionable amu[s]ements, and to bear off the palm amid[s]t the votaries of plea[s]ure. But the[s]e are fading honors, unsatisfactory enjoyments; incapable of gratifying tho[s]e immortal principles of rea[s]on and religion, which have been implanted in your mind by nature; a[s][s]iduou[s]ly cultivated by the be[s]t of parents, and exerted, I tru[s]t, by your[s]elf. Let me advi[s]e you then, in conducting this affair; an affair big, perhaps, with your future fate, to lay a[s]ide those [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-042.jpg) \- external link  - Page 039. ] coquetti[s]h airs which you [s]ometimes put on; and remember that you are not dealing with a fop, who will take advantage of every conce[s][s]ion; but with a man of [s]en[s]e and honor, who will properly e[s]timate your conde[s]cen[s]ion, and frankness. Act then with that mode[s]t freedom, that dignified unre[s]erve which be[s]peaks con[s]cious rectitude and [s]incerity of heart. I [s]hall be extremely anxious to hear the process and progre[s]s of this bu[s]ine[s]s. Relieve my impatience, as [s]oon as po[s][s]ible, and believe me yours, with undi[s][s]embled affection. Lucy Freeman . - -  New-Haven I HAVE received, and read again and again, your friendly epi[s]tle. My rea[s]on and judgment entirely coincide with your opinion; but my fancy claims [s]ome [s]hare in the deci[s]ion: and I cannot yet tell which will preponderate. This was the day fixed for deciding Mr. Boyer's cau[s]e. My friends here gave me a long differtation on his merits. Your letter, likewi[s]e, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-043.jpg) \- external link  - Page 040. ] had its weight, and I was candidly [s]umming up the pros and cons in the garden, whither I had walked (Gen. Richman and lady having rode out) when I was informed that he was waiting in the parlor. I went immediately in (a good [s]ymptom, you will [s]ay) and received him very graciou[s]ly. After the fir[s]t compliments were over, he [s]eemed eager to improve the opportunity to enter directly on the [s]ubject of his pre[s]ent vi[s]it. It is needle[s]s for me to recite to you, who have long been acquainted with the whole proce[s]s of court[s]hip, the declarations, propositions, prote[s]tations, intreaties, looks, words and actions of a lover. They are, I believe, much the [s]ame, in the whole [s]ex, allowing for their different di[s]po[s]itions, educations, and characters. But you are impatient I know for the conclusion. You have ha[s]tily peru[s]ed the preceding lines, and are [s]training your eye forward to my part of the farce; for [s]uch it may prove after all. Well then, not to play too long with the curio[s]ity, which I know to be excited, and actuated by real friend[s]hip, I will relieve it. I think you would have been plea[s]ed to have [s]een my gravity, on this important occa[s]ion. With all the candor and frankne[s]s which I was capable of a[s][s]uming, I thus an[s]wered his long harangue, to which I had li[s]tened, without interrupting him. Self knowledge, [s]ir, that mo[s]t important of all [s]ciences, I have yet to learn. Such have been my [s]ituations in life, and the natural volatility of my temper, that I have [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-044.jpg) \- external link  - Page 041. ] looked but little into my own heart, in regard to its future wi[s]hes and views. From a [s]cene of con[s]traint and confinement, ill [s]uited to my years and inclination, I have ju[s]t launched into [s]ociety. My heart beats high in expectation of its fancied joys. My [s]anguine imagination paints, in alluring colors, the charms of youth and freedom, regulated by virtue and innocence. Of the[s]e, I wi[s]h to partake. While I own myself under obligations for the e[s]teem which you are plea[s]ed to profe[s]s for me, and in return, acknowledge, that neither your per[s]on nor manners are di[s]agreeable to me, I recoil at the thought of immediately forming a connection, which mu[s]t confine me to the duties of demostic life, and make me dependent for happine[s]s, perhaps too, for [s]ub[s]i[s]tence, upon a cla[s]s of people, who will claim the right of [s]crutini[s]ing every part of my conduct; and by cen[s]uring tho[s]e [s]oibles, which I am con[s]cious of not having prudence to avoid, may render me completely mi[s]erable. While, therefore, I receive your vi[s]its, and cultivate towards you [s]entiments of friend[s]hip and e[s]teem, I would not have you con[s]ider me as confined to your [s]ociety, or obligated to a future connection. Our [s]hort acquaintance renders it impo[s][s]ible for me to decide what the operations of my mind may hereafter be. You mu[s]t either quit the [s]ubject, or leave me to the exerci[s]e of my free will, which perhaps may coincide with your pre[s]ent wi[s]hes. Madam, [s]aid he, far is the wi[s]h from me to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-045.jpg) \- external link  - Page 042. ] restrain your per[s]on or mind. In your brea[s]t I will repo[s]e my cau[s]e. It [s]hall be my [s]tudy to merit a return of affection; and I doubt not, but genero[s]ity and honor will influence your conduct towards me. I expect [s]oon to [s]ettle among a generous and enlightened people, where I flatter my[s]elf I [s]hall be exempt from tho[s]e difficulties, and embarra[s][s]ments, to which too many of my brethren are [s]ubject. The local [s]ituation is agreeable, the [s]ociety refined and poli[s]hed; and if, in addition, I may obtain that felicity which you are formed to be[s]tow, in a family connection, I [s]hall be happy indeed. He [s]poke with empha[s]is. The tear of sensibility [s]parkled in his eye. I involuntarily gave him my hand, which he pre[s][s]ed with ardor to his lips. Then ri[s]ing, he walked to the window to conceal his emotion. I rang the bell and ordered tea; during, and after which, we [s]hared that [s]ocial conver[s]e, which is the true ze[s]t of life, and which, I am per[s]uaded, none but virtuous minds can participate. General Richman and lady returned with the [s]hades of the evening. The penetrating eye of my cou[s]in traced in our countenances the progre[s]s of the cau[s]e, and the [s]mile of approbation animated hers . Mr. Boyer a[s]ked the favor of my company to ride to morrow morning, which was granted. He tarried to [s]upper, and took his leave. I retired immediately to my chamber, to which I was followed by Mrs. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-046.jpg) \- external link  - Page 043. ] Richman. I related to her the conver[s]ation, and the encouragement which I had given to Mr. Boyer. She was plea[s]ed; but in[s]i[s]ted that I [s]hould own my[s]elf [s]omewhat engaged to him. This, I told her I [s]hould never do to any man, before the indi[s][s]oluble knot was tied. That, [s]aid I, will be time enough to re[s]ign my freedom. She replied that I had wrong ideas of freedom, and matrimony; but [s]he hoped that Mr. Boyer would happily rectify them. I have now, my dear friend, given you an account of my pre[s]ent [s]ituation, and leave you to judge for your[s]elf concerning it. Write me your opinion, and believe me ever yours. Eliza Wharton . - -  Hartford I congratulate you, my dear Eliza, on the [s]tability of your conduct towards Mr. Boyer. Pur[s]ue the [s]y[s]tem which you have adopted, and I dare [s]ay, that happine[s]s will crown your future days. You are indeed very [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-047.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] tenacious of your freedom, as you call it; but that is a play about words. A man of Mr. Boyer's honor and good [s]en[s]e will never abridge any privileges which virtue can claim. When do you return to embelli[s]h our [s]ociety, here? I am impatient to [s]ee you, and likewi[s]e this amiable man. I am much intere[s]ted in his favor. By the way, I am told that Major Sanford has been to look at the [s]eat of Captain Pribble, which is upon [s]ale. It is reported that he will probably purcha[s]e it. Many of our gentry are pleased with the pro[s]pect of [s]uch a neighbor. As an accompli[s]hed gentleman, [s]ay they, he will be an agreeable addition to our [s]ocial parties; and as a man of property, and public [s]pirit, he will be an advantage to the town; but, from what I have heard of him, I am far from [s]uppo[s]ing him a de[s]irable acqui[s]ition in either of the[s]e respects. A man of a vicious character cannot be a good member of [s]ociety. In order to that, his principles and practice mu[s]t be uncorrupted: in his morals, at lea[s]t, he mu[s]t be a man of probity, and honor. Of the[s]e qualifications, if I mistake not, this gallant of yours cannot boa[s]t. But I [s]hall not [s]et up for a cen[s]or. I hope neither you nor I [s]hall have much connection with him. My [s]wain intere[s]ts him[s]elf very much in your affairs. You will po[s][s]ibly think him impertinent; but I give his curio[s]ity a [s]ofter name. Should I own to you that I place great confidence in his integrity and honor, you would, perhaps, laugh at my weakne[s]s; but, my dear, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-048.jpg) \- external link  - Page 045. ] I have pride enough to keep me above conquettry, or prudery; and di[s]cretion enough, I hope, to [s]ecure me from the errors of both. With him I have determined to walk the future round of life. What folly then would it be to affect re[s]erve and di[s]tance, relative to an affair in which I have [s]o much intere[s]t? Not that I am going to betray your [s]ecrets. The[s]e I have no right to divulge; but I mu[s]t be the judge what may, and what may not be communicated. I am very much pre[s][s]ed for an early day of consummation; but I [s]hall not li[s]ten to a reque[s]t of that kind, till your return. Such is my regard for you, that a union of love would be imperfect, if friend[s]hip attended not the rites. Adieu. Lucy Freeman . - -  New-Haven We go on charmingly here; almo[s]t as [s]oft and [s]mooth as your lady[s]hip. It [s]eems to me that love mu[s]t [s]tagnate, if it have not a light breeze of di[s]cord once in a while to keep it in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-049.jpg) \- external link  - Page 046. ] motion. We have not tried any yet, however. We had a lovely tour this forenoon; were out three long hours, and returned to dinner in perfect harmony. Mr. Boyer informed me that he [s]hould [s]et out to morrow morning, for his future re[s]idence, and [s]oon put on the [s]acred bands. He [s]olicited an epi[s]tolary corre[s]pondence, at the [s]ame time, as an alleviation of the care which that weighty charge would bring on his mind. I con[s]ented; telling him, that he mu[s]t not expect any thing more than general [s]ubjects from me. We were [s]omewhat interrupted in our confidential intercour[s]e, in the afternoon, by the arrival of Major Sanford. I cannot [s]ay that I was not agreeably relieved. So [s]weet a repa[s]t, for [s]everal hours together, was rather [s]ickening to my ta[s]te. My enamorato looked a little mortified at the cheerful reception which I gave the intruder, and joined not [s]o placidly in the [s]ocial conver[s]ation, as I could have wi[s]hed. When Mr. Boyer, after the Major took leave, pre[s][s]ed me to give him [s]ome a[s][s]urance of my con[s]tancy, I only reminded him of the terms of our engagement. Seeing me decided, he was [s]ilent on the [s]ubject, and [s]oon bid me an affectionate adieu; not expecting, as he told me, the plea[s]ure of a per[s]onal interview again, for two or three months. Thus far we have proceeded in this [s]ober business. A good beginning, you will [s]ay. Perhaps it is. I do not, however, feel my[s]elf [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-050.jpg) \- external link  - Page 047. ] greatly intere[s]ted in the progre[s]s of the negociation. Time may con[s]olidate my affections, and enable me to fix them on [s]ome particular object. At pre[s]ent the mo[s]t lively emotions of my heart are tho[s]e of friend[s]hip; that friendship which I hope you will [s]oon participate with your faithful Eliza Wharton . - -  New-Haven I have [s]ucceeded in my addre[s][s]es to the lovely Eliza Wharton; as far at lea[s]t as I had any rea[s]on to expect from our [s]hort acquaintance. I find the graces of her per[s]on and mind ri[s]e in my e[s]teem; and have already enjoyed, in her [s]ociety, [s]ome of the happie[s]t hours of my life. She is kind, affable, and conde[s]cending; yet I mu[s]t own that I have not been able to infuse into her bo[s]om, the ardor which I feel in my own. I know that the native mode[s]ty of the [s]ex would re[s]train the di[s]covery; but there is an animation of countenance, which betrays the [s]en[s]ations of the heart, that I find wanting in her on this occa[s]ion. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-051.jpg) \- external link  - Page 048. ] I have ju[s]t taken leave of my fair, and propose returning to morrow morning; to take upon me the [s]olemn charge, which lies with [s]uch weight upon my mind, that I need every support, both human and divine. Eliza has promised to corre[s]pond with me. From this I anticipate a [s]ource of plea[s]ure, which alone can atone for her ab[s]ence. I am, &c. J. Boyer . - -  New-Haven Do you know, Charles, that I have commenced lover? I was always a general one; but now I am [s]omewhat particular. I [s]hall be the more intere[s]ted, as I am likely to meet with difficulties; and it is the glory of a rake, as well as a chri[s]tian to combat ob[s]tacles. This [s]ame Eliza, of whom I have told you, has really made more impre[s][s]ion on my heart, than I was aware of; or than the [s]ex, take them as they ri[s]e, are wont to do. But [s]he is be[s]ieged by a priest (a likely lad though.) I know not how it is, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-052.jpg) \- external link  - Page 049. ] but they are commonly [s]ucce[s]sful with the girls, even the gaye[s]t of them. This one, too, has the intere[s]t of all her friends, as I am told. I called ye[s]terday, at General Richman's, and found this pair together, apparently too happy in each other's [s]ociety for my wi[s]hes. I mu[s]t own, that I felt a glow of jealou[s]y, which I never experienced before; and vowed revenge for the pain it gave me, though but momentary. Yet Eliza's reception of me was vi[s]ibly cordial; nay, I fancied my company as plea[s]ing to her as that which [s]he had before. I tarried not long, but left him to the enjoyment of that plea[s]ure which I flatter my[s]elf will be [s]hort-lived. O, I have another plan in my head; a plan of nece[s][s]ity, which, you know, is the mother of invention. It is this: I am very much courted and care[s][s]ed by the family of Mr. Lawrence, a man of large property in this neighborhood. He has only one child; a daughter, with whom I imagine the old folks intend to [s]hackle me in the bonds of matrimony. The girl looks very well. She has no [s]oul though, that I can di[s]cover. She is heire[s]s, neverthele[s]s, to a great fortune; and that is all the [s]oul I with for in a wife. In truth, Charles, I know of no other way to mend my circum[s]tances. But li[s]p not a word of my embarrassments for your life. Show and equipage are my hobby-hor[s]e; and if any female wi[s]h to [s]hare them with me, and will furni[s]h me with the means of [s]upporting them, I have no objection. Could I conform to the [s]ober rules of wedded [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-053.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] life, and renounce tho[s]e dear enjoyments of dissipation, in which I have [s]o long indulged, I know not the lady in the world with whom I would [s]ooner form a connection of this [s]ort than with Eliza Wharton. But it will never do. If my fortune, or hers were better, I would ri[s]k a union; but as they are, no idea of the kind can be admitted. I [s]hall endeavor, notwithstanding, to enjoy her company as long as possible. Though I cannot po[s][s]e[s]s her wholly myself, I will not tamely [s]ee her the property of another. I am now going to call at General Richman's, in hopes of an opportunity to profe[s]s my devotion to her. I know I am not a welcome vi[s]itor to the family; but I am independent of their cen[s]ure or e[s]teem, and mean to act accordingly. Peter Sanford . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-054.jpg) \- external link  - Page 051. ] - -  New-Haven I FIND the ideas of [s]obriety, and domestic [s]olitude, I have been cultivating for three days pa[s]t, [s]omewhat deranged by the interruption of a vi[s]itor, with whom, I know, you will not be plea[s]ed. It is no other than Major Sanford. I was walking alone in the garden yesterday, when he [s]uddenly appeared to my view. How happy am I, [s]aid he, [s]eizing my hand, in this opportunity of finding you alone; an opportunity, Mi[s]s Wharton, which I mu[s]t improve in expatiating on a theme, that fills my heart, and [s]olely animates my frame. I was [s]tartled at his impetuo[s]ity, and displeased with his freedom. Withdrawing my hand, I told him, that my retirement was [s]acred. He bowed [s]ubmi[s][s]ively; begged pardon for his intrusion, alledged, that he found no body but the [s]ervants in the hou[s]e; that they informed him, I was alone in the garden, which intelligence was too plea[s]ing for him to con[s]ult any forms of ceremony for the regulation of his conduct. He then went on rhap[s]odically to declare his pa[s][s]ion, his [s]u[s]picions, that I was forming a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-055.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] connection with Mr. Boyer, which would effectually de[s]troy all his hopes of future happine[s]s. He painted the re[s]traint, the con[s]inement, the embarra[s][s]ments to which a woman, connected with a man of Mr. Boyer's profe[s][s]ion, mu[s]t be [s]ubjected; however agreeable his per[s]on might be. He a[s]ked if my generous mind could submit to cares and perplexities like the[s]e; whether I could not find greater [s]ources of enjoyment in a more elevated [s]phere of life, or [s]hare pleasures better [s]uited to my genius and di[s]po[s]ition, even in a [s]ingle [s]tate? I li[s]tened to him involuntarily. My heart did not approve his sentiments, but my ear was charmed with his rhetoric, and my fancy captivated by his addre[s]s. He invited my confidence, by the mo[s]t ardent profe[s][s]ions of friend[s]hip, and labored to remove my [s]u[s]picions by vows of [s]incerity. I was induced by his importunity, gradually to di[s]clo[s]e the [s]tate of affairs between Mr. Boyer and my[s]elf. He li[s]tened eagerly; wi[s]hed not, he [s]aid, to influence me unduly; but if I were not otherwise engaged, might he pre[s]ume to [s]olicit a place in my friend[s]hip and e[s]teem; be admitted to enjoy my [s]ociety, to vi[s]it me as an acquaintance, and to attend my excur[s]ions and amusements, as a brother, if no more? I replied, that I was a pen[s]ioner of friend[s]hip, at pre[s]ent; that my friends were extremely refined in their notions of propriety, and that I had no right to receive vi[s]itants independent of them. I understand you, madam, [s]aid he. You intimate that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-056.jpg) \- external link  - Page 053. ] my company is not agreeable to them: but I know not why. Surely my rank in life is as elevated; and my knowledge of, and acceptance in the world, are as exten[s]ive as General Richman's. I hope, [s]aid I, [s]ince we are engaged in the conver[s]ation, that you will excu[s]e my frankness, if I tell you, that the under[s]tanding and virtue of this worthy couple, induce them, without any regard to rank, to be[s]tow their e[s]teem wherever it is merited. I cannot [s]ay that you are not a [s]harer. Your own heart can be[s]t determine, whether upon their principles, you are, or not! He appeared mortified, and chagrined; and we had walked [s]ome di[s]tance without exchanging a word, or a look. At la[s]t, he rejoined, I plead guilty to the charge, madam, which they have undoubtedly brought again[s]t me, of imprudence and folly in many particulars; yet of malignancy and vice I am innocent. Brought up in affluence; innured from my infancy to the gratification of every pa[s][s]ion; the indulgence of every wi[s]h, it is not [s]trange, that a life of dissipation and gaiety [s]hould prove alluring to a youthful mind, which had no care but to procure what it deemed enjoyment. In this pursuit I have perhaps deviated from the rigid rules of di[s]cretion, and the har[s]her laws of morality. But let the veil of charity be drawn over my faults; let the eye of candor impartially examine my pre[s]ent behavior; let the kind and lenient hand of friend[s]hip a[s][s]i[s]t in directing my future [s]teps; and, perhaps, I may not prove [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-057.jpg) \- external link  - Page 054. ] unworthy of a[s][s]ociating with the re[s]pectable inhabitants of this happy man[s]ion; for [s]uch I am [s]ure it mu[s]t be, while honored with Mi[s]s Wharton's pre[s]ence. But, circum[s]tanced as you and I are, at pre[s]ent, I will not [s]ue for your attention, as a lover; but re[s]t contented, if po[s][s]ible, with that [s]hare of kindne[s]s, and regard, which your be nevolence may afford me as a friend. I bowed in approbation of his re[s]olution. He pressed my hand with ardor to his lips; and at that in[s]tant General Richman entered the garden. He approached us cheerfully, offered Major Sanford his hand with apparent cordiality, and told us plea[s]antly, that he hoped he [s]hould not be con[s]idered as an intruder. By no means, [s]ir, [s]aid Major Sanford. It is I who have incurred that imputation. I called this afternoon to pay you my re[s]pects; when being informed that you and your lady were abroad, and that Mi[s]s Wharton was in the garden, I took the liberty to invade her retirement. She has graciou[s]ly forgiven my crime, and I was ju[s]t affixing the [s]eal to my pardon as you entered. We then returned into the hou[s]e. Mrs. Richman received us politely. During tea, the conver[s]ation turned on literary [s]ubjects, in which I cannot [s]ay that the Major bore a very distinguished part. After he was gone, Mrs. Richman [s]aid, I hope you have been agreeably entertained, Mi[s]s Wharton? I did not chu[s]e my company, madam, [s]aid I. Nor, [s]aid the, did you refu[s]e it, I pre[s]ume. Would you not have [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-058.jpg) \- external link  - Page 055. ] me re[s]pect the rights of ho[s]pitality towards your gue[s]ts, when you are ab[s]ent, madam? If you had acted from that motive, I own my obligations to you, my dear; but even that consideration can hardly reconcile me to the [s]acrifice of time, which you have made to the amusement of a [s]educer. I hope, madam, you do not think me an object of [s]eduction! I do not think you [s]educible; nor was Richard[s]on's Clari[s][s]a, till [s]he made her[s]elf the victim, by her own indi[s]cretion. Pardon me, Eliza, this is a [s]econd Lovelace. I am alarmed by his artful intru[s]ions. His in[s]inuating attention to you are characteri[s]tic of the man. Come, I pre[s]ume you are not intere[s]ted to keep his [s]ecrets, if you know them. Will you give me a little [s]ketch of his conver[s]ation? Mo[s]t willingly, [s]aid I; and, accordingly, related the whole. When I had concluded, [s]he [s]hook her head, and replied, beware, my friend, of his arts. Your own heart is too [s]incere to [s]u[s]pect treachery and di[s][s]imulation in another; but [s]uffer not your ear to be charmed by the [s]yren voice of flattery; nor your eye to be caught by the phantom of gaiety and plea[s]ure. Remember your engagements to Mr. Boyer. Let [s]incerity and virtue be your guides, and they will lead you to happine[s]s and peace. She waited not for an an[s]wer, but immediately ri[s]ing, begged leave to retire, alledging that [s]he was fatigued. Gen. Richman accompanied her, and I ha[s]tened to my apartment, where I have written thus far, and [s]hall [s]end it on for your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-059.jpg) \- external link  - Page 056. ] comments. I begin to think of returning [s]oon to your circle. One inducement is, that I may be free from the intru[s]ions of this man. Adieu. Eliza Wharton . - -  New-Haven From the conver[s]ation of the polite, the [s]edate, the engaging and the gay; from corre[s]ponding with the learned, the sentimental and the refined, my heart and my pen turn with ardor and alacrity to a tender and affectionate parent, the faithful guardian and guide of my youth; the unchanging friend of my riper years. The different di[s]po[s]itions of various a[s][s]ociates, [s]ometimes perplex the mind, which [s]eeks direction; but in the di[s]intere[s]ted affection of the maternal brea[s]t, we fear no dissonance of pa[s][s]ion, no jarring intere[s]ts, no disunion of love. In this [s]eat of felicity is every enjoyment which fancy can form, or friend[s]hip, with affluence, be[s]tow; but [s]till my mind frequently returns to the happy [s]hades of my nativity. I wi[s]h there to impart my plea[s]ures, and [s]hare the coun[s]els of my be[s]t, my long tried [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-060.jpg) \- external link  - Page 057. ] and experienced friend. At this time, my dear mamma, I am peculiarly [s]olicitous for your advice. I am again inportuned to li[s]ten to the voice of love; again called upon to accept the addresses of a gentleman of merit and respectability. You will know the character of the man, when I tell you, it is Mr. Boyer. But his situation in life! I dare not enter it. My di[s]po[s]ition is not calculated for that [s]phere. There are duties ari[s]ing from the [s]tation, which I fear I [s]hould not be able to fulfil; cares and re[s]traints to which I could not [s]ubmit. This man is not disagreeable to me; but if I mu[s]t enter the connubial [s]tate, are there not others , who may be equally plea[s]ing in their per[s]ons, and who[s]e profe[s][s]ion may be more conformable to my ta[s]te? You, madam, have pa[s][s]ed through this [s]cene of trial, with honor and applau[s]e. But alas! can your volatile daughter ever acquire your wi[s]dom; ever po[s][s]e[s]s your re[s]olution, dignity and prudence? I hope [s]oon to conver[s]e with you per[s]onally upon the [s]ubject, and to profit by your precepts and example. I anticipate the hour of my return to your bo[s]om, with impatience. My daily thoughts and nightly dreams re[s]tore me to the [s]ociety of my beloved mamma; and, till I enjoy it in reality, I [s]ub[s]cribe my[s]elf your dutiful daughter, Eliza Wharton . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-061.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] - Hartford . How welcome to me, my dear Eliza, are the tidings of your return? My widowed heart has mourned your ab[s]ence, and langui[s]hed for the company of its now, deare[s]t connection. When [s]tript of one dependence, the mind naturally collects, and re[s]ts it[s]elf in another. Your father's death deprived me, for a while, of every enjoyment. But a reviving [s]en[s]e of the duties which I owed to a ri[s]ing family, rou[s]ed me from the lethargy of grief. In my cares I found an alleviation of my [s]orrows. The expanding virtues of my children [s]oothed and exhilerated my drooping [s]pirits; and my attention to their education, and intere[s]t, was amply rewarded by their proficiency and duty. In them, every hope, every plea[s]ure now centres. They are the axis on which revolves the temporal felicity of their mother. Judge then, my dear, how anxiou[s]ly I mu[s]t watch, how [s]olicitou[s]ly I mu[s]t regard every circum[s]tance which relates to their welfare and pro[s]perity! Exqui[s]itely alive to the[s]e [s]en[s]ations, your letter awakens my hopes [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-062.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] and my fears. As you are young and charming, a thou[s]and dangers, lurk un[s]een around you. I wi[s]h you to find a friend and protector, worthy of being rewarded by your love and your [s]ociety. Such a one, I think, Mr. Boyer will prove. I am, therefore, [s]orry, [s]ince there can be no other, that his profe[s][s]ion [s]hould be an objection in your mind. You [s]ay, that I have experienced the [s]cenes of trial, connected with that [s]tation. I have, indeed; and I will tell you the re[s]ult of this experience. It is, that I have found it replete with happine[s]s. No cla[s]s of [s]ociety has dome[s]tic enjoyment more at command, than clergymen. Their circum[s]tances are generally a decent competency. They are removed alike from the perplexing cares of want, and from the di[s]tracting parade of wealth. They are re[s]pected by all ranks, and partakers of the be[s]t company. With regard to its being a dependent [s]ituation, what one is not [s]o? Are we not all links in the great chain of [s]ociety, [s]ome more, [s]ome le[s]s important; but each upheld by others, throughout the confederated whole? In whatever situation we are placed, our greater or le[s]s degree of happine[s]s mu[s]t be derived from our[s]elves. Happine[s]s is in a great mea[s]ure the re[s]ult of our own di[s]po[s]itions and actions. Let us conduct uprightly and ju[s]tly; with propriety and steadiness; not [s]ervilely cringing for favor, nor arrogantly claiming more attention and re[s]pect than our due; let us bear with fortitude the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-063.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] providential, and unavoidable evils of life, and we [s]hall [s]pend our days with re[s]pectability and contentment, at lea[s]t. I will not expatiate on the topic of your letter, till we have a per[s]onal interview, for which I am, indeed, impatient. Return, my daughter, as [s]oon as politene[s]s will allow, to your expecting friends; more e[s]pecially, to the fond embraces of your affectionate mother, M. Wharton . - -  Hampshire Can time, can di[s]tance, can ab[s]ence allay, or extingui[s]h the [s]entiments of refined affection, the ardor of true love? No, my dear Eliza. If I may judge by my own heart, I [s]hall [s]ay they cannot. Amid[s]t the parade which has attended me, the intere[s]ting [s]cenes in which I have been engaged, and the weighty cares, which have occupied my attention, your idea has been the [s]olace of my retired moments; the [s]oother of every anxious thought. I recal, with plea[s]ure, the conver[s]ation which we have [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-064.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] [s]hared. I dwell with rapture on the marks of favor which I have received from you. My fir[s]t wi[s]h is the continuance and increa[s]e of the[s]e favors; my highe[s]t ambition, to de[s]erve them. I look forward and anticipate with impatience, the future enjoyment of your [s]ociety; and hope we [s]hall one day experience the reality of tho[s]e beautiful lines of Thomp[s]on: \---"An elegant [s]ufficiency, Content, retirement, rural quiet, friend[s]hip; Books, ea[s]e and alternate labor, u[s]eful life; Progreflive virtue, and approving heaven; The[s]e are the matchle[s]s joys of virtuous love." Mr. Selby, my particular friend, will have the honor of delivering this letter. He will be able to give you any information, relative to our public tran[s]actions, which you may wi[s]h. May I [s]olicit the favor of a line, through him, in return? It will relieve, in [s]ome mea[s]ure, the tediousness of this [s]eparation. I intend to pay my re[s]pects to you per[s]onally, in about a fortnight; till when, I [s]ub[s]cribe my[s]elf your [s]incere and affectionate friend, J. Boyer . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-065.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] - -  New-Haven I have executed your commi[s][s]ion, and been amply rewarded for my trouble, by the plea[s]ure I enjoyed in the [s]ociety of the agreeable family to which I was introduced; especially of the amiable and accompli[s]hed lady, who is the object of your particular regard. I think [s]he fully ju[s]tifies your partiality to her. She appears to po[s][s]e[s]s both the virtues and the graces. Her form is fine, and her countenance intere[s]ts us at once in her favor. There is a mixture of dignity and ca[s]e, which commands re[s]pect, and conciliates affection. After the[s]e encomiums, will you permit me to [s]ay, there is an air of gaiety in her appearance and deportment, which favors a little of coquetry. I am persuaded, however, that [s]he has too much good [s]en[s]e to practi[s]e its arts. She received your letter very graciou[s]ly, a[s]ked leave to retire a few moments; and returned with a [s]mile of complacency on her brow, which I con[s]true favoraably to you. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-066.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] There was a Mr. Laurence, with his lady and daughter, and a certain Major Sanford, at the hou[s]e. The latter, I believe, in the modern [s]en[s]e of the phra[s]e, is much of a gentleman , that is, a man of [s]how and fa[s]hion. Mi[s]s Wharton a[s]ked me, when I [s]hould leave town, and when I [s]hould return, or have an opportunity of conveyance to Hamp[s]hire? I told her I [s]hould write by the next po[s]t, and if [s]he had any commands, would be happy to execute them. She would [s]end a line to her friend, [s]he [s]aid, if I would take the trouble to inclo[s]e it in my letter. I readily con[s]ented; and told her, that I would call and receive her favor to morrow morning. This chit-chat was a little a[s]ide; but I could not but ob[s]erve, that the fore[s]aid Major Sanford had dropped his part in the conversation of the re[s]t of the company, and was attending to us, though he endeavored to conceal his attention, by looking carele[s]sly over a play, which lay on the window by him. Yet he evidently watched every word and action of Mi[s]s Wharton, as if he were really intere[s]ted in her movements. It is [s]aid [s]he has many admirers, and I conceive it very po[s][s]ible that this may be one of them; though, truly, I do not think that [s]he would e[s]teem [s]uch a conque[s]t any great honor. I now joined in the general topic of conversation, which was politics. Mrs. Richman and Mi[s]s Wharton judiciou[s]ly, yet mode[s]tly bore a part; while the other ladies amu[s]ed them[s]elves [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-067.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] with Major Sanford, who was making his [s]age remarks on the play, which he [s]till kept in his hand. General Richman at length ob[s]erved, that we had formed into parties. Major Sanford, upon this, laid a[s]ide his book. Mi[s]s Laurence [s]impered; and looked as if [s]he was well plea[s]ed with being in a party with [s]o fine a man; while her mother replied, that [s]he never meddled with politics; [s]he thought they did not belong to ladies. Mi[s]s Wharton and I, [s]aid Mrs. Richman, mu[s]t beg leave to differ from you, madam. We think our[s]elves intere[s]ted in the welfare and pro[s]perity of our country; and, consequently, claim the right of inquiring into tho[s]e affairs, which may conduce to, or interfere with the common weal. We [s]hall not be called to the [s]enate or the field to affert its privileges, and defend its rights, but we [s]hall feel for the honor and [s]afety of our friends and connections, who are thus employed. If the community flouri[s]h and enjoy health and freedom, [s]hall we not [s]hare in the happy effects? if it be oppreff-ed and di[s]turbed, [s]hall we not endure our proportion of the evil? Why then [s]hould the love of our country be a ma[s]culine pa[s][s]ion only? Why [s]hould government, which involves the peace and order of the [s]ociety, of which we are a part, be wholly excluded from our observation? Mrs. Laurence made [s]ome [s]light reply and waved the [s]ubject. The gentlemen applauded Mrs. Richman's [s]entiments as truly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-068.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] Roman; and what was more, they [s]aid, truly republican. I ro[s]e to take leave, ob[s]erving to Mi[s]s Wharton, that I [s]hould call to morrow, as agreed. Upon this, Gen. Richman politely reque[s]ted the favor of my company at dinner. I accepted his invitation, and bid them good night. I [s]hall do the [s]ame to you for the pre[s]ent; as I intend, to morrow to [s]cribble the cover, which is to inclose your Eliza's letter. T. Selby . - -  New-Haven I resume my pen, having ju[s]t returned from Gen. Richman's; not with an expectation, however, of your reading this, till you have peru[s]ed, and reperu[s]ed the inclo[s]ed. I can bear [s]uch neglect, in this ca[s]e, as I have been alike intere[s]ted my[s]elf. I went to Gen. Richman's at twelve o'clock. About a mile from thence, upon turning a corner, I ob[s]erved a gentleman and lady on horse-back, [s]ome way before me, riding a very moderate pace, and [s]eemingly in clo[s]e conver[s]ation. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-069.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] I kept at the [s]ame di[s]tance from them, till I [s]aw them [s]top at the General's gate. I then put on, and coming up with them, ju[s]t as they alighted, and was [s]urpri[s]ed to find them no other than Major Sanford and Mi[s]s Wharton. They were both a little di[s]concerted at my [s]alutation; I know not why. Mi[s]s Wharton invited him in; but he declined, being engaged to dine. Gen. Richman received us at the door. As I handed Mi[s]s Wharton in, he ob[s]erved joco[s]ely, that [s]he had changed company. Yes [s]ir, [s]he replied, more than once, [s]ince I went out, as you doubtle[s]s ob[s]erved. I was not aware, [s]aid Mrs. Richman, that Major Sanford was to be of your party to day. It was quite accidental, madam, [s]aid Mi[s]s Wharton. Mi[s]s Laurence and I had agreed la[s]t evening, to take a little airing, this forenoon. A young gentleman, a relation of her's, who is making them a vi[s]it, was to attend us. We had not rode more than two miles, when we were overtaken by Major Sanford, who very politely a[s]ked leave to join our party. Mi[s]s Laurence very readily con[s]ented; and we had a very [s]ociable ride. The finene[s]s of the day induced me to protract the enjoyment of it abroad; but Mi[s]s Laurence declined riding [s]o far as I propo[s]ed, as [s]he had engaged company to dine. We therefore parted till evening, when we are to meet again. What, another engagement! [s]aid Mrs. Richman. Only to the a[s][s]embly, madam. May I inquire after your gallant, my dear? But I have no [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-070.jpg) \- external link  - Page 067. ] right, perhaps, to be inqui[s]itive, [s]aid Mrs. Richman. Mi[s]s Wharton made no reply; and the conver[s]ation took a general turn. Mi[s]s Wharton [s]u[s]tained her part with great propriety. Indeed, [s]he di[s]covers a fund of u[s]eful knowledge, and exten[s]ive reading, which render her peculiarly entertaining; while the brilliancy of her wit, the fluency of her language, the vivacity and ca[s]e of her manners, are inexpre[s][s]ibly engaging. I am going my[s]elf to the a[s][s]embly this evening, though I did not mention it to General Richman; I therefore took my leave [s]oon after dinner. I have heard [s]o much in prai[s]e of Mi[s]s Wharton's penman[s]hip, in addition to her other endowments, that I am almo[s]t tempted to break the [s]eal of her letter to you; but I forbear. Wi[s]hing you much happine[s]s in the peru[s]al of it, and more in the po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of its writer, I subscribe my[s]elf, yours, &c. T. Selby . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-071.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] - -  New-Haven Sir , Your favor of the 4th in[s]t. came to hand ye[s]terday. I received it with plea[s]ure, and embrace this early opportunity of contributing my part to a corre[s]pondence, tending to promote a friendly and [s]ocial intercour[s]e. An epi[s]tolary communication between the [s]exes has been with [s]ome, a [s]ubject of [s]atire and cen[s]ure; but unju[s]tly, in my opinion. With per[s]ons of refinement and information, it may be a [s]ource of entertainment and utility. The knowledge and ma[s]culine virtues of your [s]ex may be softened, and rendered more diffu[s]ive by the inquisitiveness, vivacity, and docility of ours; drawn forth and exerci[s]ed by each other. In regard to the particular [s]ubject of your's I [s]hall be [s]ilent. Ideas of that kind are better conveyed, on my part, by words, than by the pen. I congratulate you on your agreeable settlement, and hope it will be productive of real and la[s]ting happine[s]s. I am convinced that felicity is not confined to any particular [s]tation, or [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-072.jpg) \- external link  - Page 069. ] condition in life; yet methinks [s]ome are better calculated to afford it to me, than others. Your extract from a favorite poet is charmingly de[s]criptive; but is it not difficult to a[s]certain what we can pronounce "an elegant sufficiency?" Perhaps you will an[s]wer as [s]ome others have done, We can attain it by circum[s]cribing our wi[s]hes within the compa[s]s of our abilities. I am not very avaricious; yet I mu[s]t own that I [s]hould like to enjoy it without [s]o much trouble as that would co[s]t me. Excu[s]e my [s]eeming levity. You have flattered my cheerfulne[s]s by commending it; and mu[s]t, therefore, indulge me in the exerci[s]e of it. I cannot conveniently be at the pains of restraining its [s]allies, when I write in confidence. Is a [s]prightly di[s]po[s]ition, in your view, indicative of a giddy mind, or an innocent heart? Of the latter, I pre[s]ume; for I know you are not a mi[s]anthrope. We expect the plea[s]ure of Mr. Selby's company to dinner. You are, certainly, under obligations to his friend[s]hip for the liberal encomiums he be[s]towed on you, and your pro[s]pects ye[s]terday. Mrs. Richman rallied me after he was gone, on my li[s]tening ear. The General and [s]he unite in reque[s]ting me to pre[s]ent their re[s]pects. Wi[s]hing you health and happine[s]s, I [s]ub[s]cribe my[s]elf your friend, Eliza Wharton . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-073.jpg) \- external link  - Page 070. ] - -  New-Haven I am perplexed and embarra[s][s]ed, my friend, by the a[s][s]iduous attentions of this Major Sanford. I [s]hall write circum[s]tantially, and frankly to you, that I may have the benefit of your advice. He came here, la[s]t Monday, in company with Mr. Laurence, his wife, and daughter, to make us a vi[s]it. While they were pre[s]ent, a Mr. Selby, a particular friend of Mr. Boyer, came in, and delivered me a letter from him. I was really happy in the reception of this proof of his affection. His friend gave a very flattering account of his [s]ituation and pro[s]pects. The watchful eye of Major Sanford traced every word and action, re[s]pecting Mr. Boyer, with an attention, which [s]eemed to border on anxiety. That, however, did not re[s]train, but rather accellerate my vivacity and inquisitiveness on the [s]ubject; for I wi[s]hed to know whether it would produce any real effect upon him, or not. After Mr. Selby's departure, he appeared pensive, and thoughtful, the remainder of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-074.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] evening; and evidently [s]ought an opportunity of [s]peaking to me a[s]ide; which I studiously avoided. Mi[s]s Laurence and I formed an engagement to take an airing in the morning on hor[s]eback; attended by a relation of hers, who is now with them. They called for me about ten, when we immediately [s]et out upon our preconcerted excur[s]ion. We had not proceeded far, before we were met by Major Sanford. He was extremely polite, and finding our de[s]tination was not particular, begged leave to join our party. This was granted, and we had an agreeable tour for [s]everal miles; the time being pa[s][s]ed in ea[s]y, and un[s]tudied remarks upon obvious occurrences. Maj. Sanford could not, however, conceal his particular attention to me, which rather nettled Mi[s]s Laurence. She grew [s]omewhat [s]erious, and declined riding [s]o far as we had intended; alledging that [s]he expected company to dine. Major Sanford under[s]tanding that [s]he was going to the a[s][s]embly in the evening with Mr. Gordon, [s]olicited me to accept a ticket and form a party with them. The entertainment was alluring, and I con[s]ented. When we had parted with Mi[s]s Laurence, Major Sanford in[s]i[s]ted on my riding a little farther; [s]aying, he mu[s]t conver[s]e with me on a particular [s]ubject; and if I refu[s]ed him this opportunity, that he mu[s]t vi[s]it me, at my re[s]idence, let it offend whom it would. I yielded to his importunity; and we rode on. He then told me that his mind was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-075.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] in a [s]tate of [s]u[s]pen[s]e and agitation, which was very painful to bear; and which I only could relieve; that my cheerful reception of Mr. Boyer's letter, ye[s]terday, and deportment respecting him, had awakened in his brea[s]t all the pangs of jealou[s]y, which the mo[s]t ardent love could feel; that my treatment of Mr. Boyer's friend convinced him that I was more intere[s]ted in his affairs than I was willing to own; that he foresaw him[s]elf to be condemned to an eternal separation; and the total lo[s]s of my favor and society, as [s]oon as time and circum[s]tances would allow. His zeal, his pathos, alarmed me. I begged him to be calm. To you, [s]aid I, as a friend, I have intru[s]ted my [s]ituation in relation to Mr. Boyer. You know that I am under no [s]pecial obligation to him; and I do not intend to form any immediate connection. Mr. Boyer mu[s]t have different ideas, madam; and he has rea[s]on for them, if I may judge by appearances. When do you expect another vi[s]it from him? In about a fortnight. And is my fate to be then decided; and [s]o decided, as I fear it will be, through the influence of your friends, if not by your own inclination? My friends, [s]ir, will not control; they will only advi[s]e to what they think mo[s]t for my intere[s]t; and I hope, that my conduct will not be unworthy of their approbation. Pardon me, my dear Eliza, [s]aid he, if I am impertinent; it is my regard for you which impels me to the pre[s]umption. Do you intend to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-076.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] give your hand to Mr. Boyer? I do not intend to give my hand to any man at pre[s]ent. I have but lately entered [s]ociety; and wi[s]h, for a while, to enjoy my freedom, in the participation of plea[s]ures, [s]uited to my age and [s]ex. The[s]e, [s]aid he, you are aware, I [s]uppo[s]e, when you form a connection with that man, you mu[s]t renounce; and content your[s]elf with a confinement to the tedious round of dome[s]tic duties, the pedantic conver[s]ation of [s]cholars, and the invidious critici[s]ms of a whole town. I have been accu[s]tomed, [s]aid I, and am therefore attached to men of letters; and as to the prai[s]e or cen[s]ure of the populace, I hope always to enjoy that approbation of con[s]cience, which will render me [s]uperior to both. But you forget your promi[s]e, not to talk in this [s]tyle; and have deviated far from the character of a friend and brother, with which you con[s]ented to re[s]t [s]atisfied. Yes, but I find my[s]elf unequal to the ta[s]k. I am not [s]toic enough, tamely to make [s]o great a [s]acrifice. I mu[s]t plead for an intere[s]t in your favor, till you bani[s]h me from your pre[s]ence, and tell me plainly that you hate me. We had by this time reached the gate; and as we di[s]mounted, were unexpectedly acco[s]ted by Mr. Selby, who had come agreeably to his promi[s]e, to dine with us, and receive my letter to Mr. Boyer. Major Sanford took his leave as General Richman appeared at the door. The General and his lady rallied me on my change of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-077.jpg) \- external link  - Page 074. ] company; but very prudently concealed their sentiments of Major Sanford, while Mr. Selby was pre[s]ent. Nothing material occurred before, and during dinner; [s]oon after which, Mr. Selby went away. I retired to dre[s]s for the a[s][s]embly; and had nearly completed the labor of the toilet, when Mrs. Richman entered. My friend[s]hip for you, my dear Eliza, [s]aid [s]he, intere[s]ts me [s]o much in your affairs, that I cannot repre[s]s my curio[s]ity to know who has the honor of your hand, this evening. If it be any honor, [s]aid I, it will be confered on Major Sanford. I think it far too great to be thus be[s]towed, returned [s]he. It is perfectly a[s]toni[s]hing to me, that the virtuous part of my [s]ex will countenance, care[s]s, and encourage tho[s]e men, who[s]e profe[s][s]ion it is to bla[s]t their reputation, de[s]troy their peace, and triumph in their infamy! Is this, madam, the avowed de[s]ign of Major Sanford? I know not what he avows; but his practice too plainly be[s]peaks his principles and views. Does he now practice the arts you mention; or do you refer to pa[s]t follies? I cannot an[s]wer for his pre[s]ent conduct; his pa[s]t has e[s]tabli[s]hed his character. You, madam, are an advocate for charity; that, perhaps, if exerci[s]ed in this instance might lead you to think it po[s][s]ible for him to reform; to become a valuable member of [s]ociety; and, when connected with a lady of virtue and refinement, to be capable of making a good hu[s]band. I cannot conceive that [s]uch a lady would be willing to ri[s]k her all upon the [s]lender pro[s]pect of his reformation. I hope the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-078.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] one with whom I am conver[s]ing, has no inclination to [s]o hazardous, an experiment. Why, not much. Not much! If you have any, why do you continue to encourage Mr. Boyer's addresses? I am not [s]ufficiently acquainted with either yet, to determine which to take. At present, I [s]hall not confine my[s]elf in any way. In regard to the[s]e men, my fancy and my judgment are in [s]cales. Sometimes one preponderates, [s]ometimes the other. Which will finally outweigh, time alone can reveal. O my cou[s]in, beware of the delu[s]ions of fancy! Rea[s]on mu[s]t be our guide, if we would expect durable happiness. At this in[s]tant a [s]ervant opened the door, and told me that Major Sanford waited in the parlor. Being ready, I wi[s]hed Mrs. Richman a good evening, and went down. Neither General Richman nor his lady appeared. He therefore handed me immediately into his phaeton, and we were [s]oon in the a[s][s]embly room. I was [s]urpri[s]ed, on my entrance, to find Mr. Selby there, as he did not mention, at dinner, his intention of going. He attached him[s]elf to our party; and, in the intervals of dancing, took every opportunity of conver[s]ing with me. The[s]e, however, were not many; for Major Sanford a[s][s]iduou[s]ly precluded the po[s][s]ibility of my being much engaged by any one el[s]e. We pa[s][s]ed the evening very agreeably; but the Major's importunity was rather trouble[s]ome, as we returned home. He in[s]i[s]ted upon my declaring whether Mr. Boyer really po[s][s]e[s][s]ed my affections; and whether I intended to confer my[s]elf on him or [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-079.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] not. If, [s]aid he, you an[s]wer me in the affirmative, I mu[s]t de[s]pair; but if you have not absolutely decided again[s]t me, I will [s]till hope, that my per[s]evering a[s][s]iduity, my faithful love, may at la[s]t be rewarded. I told him that I was under no obligation to give him any account of my di[s]po[s]ition towards another; and that he mu[s]t remember the terms of our pre[s]ent association, to which he had [s]ub[s]cribed. I therefore begged him to wave the [s]ubject now, if not forever. He a[s]ked my pardon, if he had been impertinent; but de[s]ired leave to renew his request, that I would receive his vi[s]its, his friendly vi[s]its. I replied, that I could not grant this; and that he mu[s]t blame him[s]elf, not me, if he was an unwelcome gue[s]t at General Richman's. He lamented the prejudices which my friends had imbibed again[s]t him; but flattered him[s]elf that I was more liberal than to be influenced by them, without any po[s]itive proof of demerit; as it was impo[s][s]ible that his conduct towards me [s]hould ever deviate from the [s]tricte[s]t rules of honor and love. What [s]hall I [s]ay now, my friend? This man, to an agreeable per[s]on has [s]uperadded, graceful manners, an amiable temper, and a fortune [s]ufficient to en[s]ure the enjoyments of all the plea[s]ing varieties of [s]ocial life. Perhaps a gay di[s]po[s]ition, and a lax education may have betrayed him into [s]ome [s]cenes of di[s][s]ipation. But is it not an adage generally received, that " a reformed rake makes the be[s]t hu[s]band?  " My fancy leads me for happine[s]s to the fe[s]tive [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-080.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] haunts of fa[s]hionable life. I am at pre[s]ent, and know not but I ever [s]hall be, too volatile for a confinement to dome[s]tic avocations, and sedentary plea[s]ures. I dare not, therefore, place myself in a [s]ituation where the[s]e mu[s]t be indispensable. Mr. Boyer's per[s]on, and character are agreeable. I really e[s]teem the man. My reason and judgment, as I have ob[s]erved before, declare for a connection with him, as a [s]tate of tranquillity and rational happine[s]s. But the idea of relinqui[s]hing tho[s]e delightful amu[s]ements and flattering attentions, which wealth and equipage be[s]tow, is painful. Why were not the virtues of the one, and the graces and affluence of the other combined? I [s]hould then have been happy indeed! But, as the ca[s]e now [s]tands, I am loath to give up either; being doubtful which will conduce mo[s]t to my felicity. Pray write me impartially; let me know your real [s]entiments, for I rely greatly upon your opinion. I am, &c. Eliza Wharton . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-081.jpg) \- external link  - Page 078. ] - -  New-Haven I am quite a convert to Pope's assertion, that "Every woman is, at heart, a rake." How el[s]e can we account for the pleasure which they evidently receive from the society, the flattery; the care[s][s]es of men of that character? Even the mo[s]t virtuous of them [s]eem naturally prone to gaiety, to plea[s]ure, and, I had almo[s]t [s]aid, to di[s][s]ipation! How el[s]e [s]hall we account for the exi[s]tence of this di[s]po[s]ition, in your favorite fair? It cannot be the re[s]ult of her education. Such a one as [s]he has received, is calculated to give her a very different turn of mind. You mu[s]t forgive me, my friend, for I am a little vexed, and alarmed on your account. I went la[s]t evening to the a[s][s]embly, as I told you in my la[s]t that I intended. I was purpo[s]ely without a partner, that I might have the liberty to exerci[s]e my gallantry, as circumstances [s]hould invite. Indeed, I mu[s]t own, that my particular de[s]ign was, to ob[s]erve Mi[s]s Wharton's movements, being rather [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-082.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] inclined to jealou[s]y in your behalf. She was handed into the a[s][s]embly room by Major Sanford. The brilliance of their appearance, the levity of their manners, and the contrast of their characters I found to be a general [s]ubject of [s]peculation. I endeavored to associate with Mi[s]s Wharton, but found it impossible to detach her a moment from the coxcomb who attended her. If [s]he has any idea of a connection with you, why does [s]he continue to a[s][s]ociate with another, e[s]pecially with one of [s]o oppo[s]ite a de[s]cription? I am [s]eriou[s]ly afraid, that there is more intimacy between them, than there ought to be, con[s]idering the encouragement [s]he has given you. I hope you will not be offended by my freedom in this matter. It originates in a concern for your honor and future happine[s]s. I am anxious, left you [s]hould be made the dupe of a coquette, and your peace of mind fall a sacrifice to an artful debauchee. Yet I mu[s]t believe, that Mi[s]s Wharton has, in reality, all that virtue and good [s]en[s]e of which [s]he enjoys the reputation; but her pre[s]ent conduct is my[s]terious. I have [s]aid enough (more than I ought, perhaps) to awaken your attention to circum[s]tances, which may lead to important events. If they appear of little, or no con[s]equence to you, you will at lea[s]t a[s]cribe the mention of them to motives of [s]incere regard; in your friend and humble [s]ervant, T. Selby . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-083.jpg) \- external link  - Page 080. ] - -  New-Haven I go on finely with my amour. I have every encouragement that I could wi[s]h. Indeed my fair one does not verbally declare in my favor; but then, according to the vulgar proverb, that actions [s]peak louder than words , I have no rea[s]on to complain; [s]ince [s]he evidently approves my gallantry, is plea[s]ed with my company, and li[s]tens to my flattery. Her sagatious friends have undoubtedly given her a detail of my vices. If, therefore, my pa[s]t conduct has been repugnant to her notions of propriety, why does [s]he not act con[s]i[s]tently, and refuse at once to a[s][s]ociate with a man who[s]e character [s]he cannot e[s]teem? But no; that, Charles, is no part of the female plan: our entrapping a few of their [s]ex, only di[s]covers the gaiety of our dispositions, the in[s]inuating graces of our manners, and the irre[s]i[s]tible charms of our per[s]ons and addre[s]s. The[s]e qualifications are very alluring to the [s]prightly fancy of the fair. They think to enjoy the plea[s]ures which re[s]ult from this [s]ource; while their vanity and ignorance [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-084.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] prompt each one to imagine her[s]elf [s]uperior to delu[s]ion; and to anticipate the honor of reclaiming the libertine, and reforming the rake! I dont know, however, but this girl will really have that merit with me; for I am [s]o much attached to her, that I begin to suspect I [s]hould [s]ooner become a convert to sobriety than lo[s]e her. I cannot find that I have made much impre[s][s]ion on her heart as yet. Want of [s]ucce[s]s in this point mortifies me extremely, as it is the fir[s]t time I ever failed. Besides, I am apprehen[s]ive that [s]he is prepo[s][s]e[s][s]ed in favor of the other [s]wain, the clerical lover, whom I have mentioned to you before. The chord, therefore, upon which I play the mo[s]t, is the di[s][s]imilarity of their di[s]po[s]itions and plea[s]ures. I endeavor to detach her from him, and di[s]affect her towards him; knowing, that if I can [s]eparate them entirely, I [s]hall be more likely to [s]ucceed in my plan. Not that I have any thoughts of marrying her my[s]elf; that will not do at pre[s]ent. But I love her too well to [s]ee her connected with another for life. I mu[s]t own my[s]elf a little revengeful too in this affair. I wi[s]h to puni[s]h her friends, as [s]he calls them, for their malice towards me; for their cold and negligent treatment of me whenever I go to the hou[s]e. I know that to fru[s]trate their de[s]igns of a connection between Mr. Boyer and Eliza would be a grievous di[s]appointment. I have not yet determined to [s]educe her, though, with all her preten[s]ions to virtue, I do not think [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-085.jpg) \- external link  - Page 082. ] it impo[s][s]ible. And if I [s]hould, [s]he can blame none but her[s]elf, [s]ince [s]he knows my character, and has no rea[s]on to wonder if I act con[s]i[s]tently with it. If [s]he will play with a lion, let her beware of his paw, I [s]ay. At pre[s]ent, I wi[s]h innocently to enjoy her [s]ociety; it is a luxury which I never ta[s]ted before. She is the very [s]oul of plea[s]ure. The gaye[s]t circle is irradiated by her pre[s]ence, and the highe[s]t entertainment receives its greate[s]t charm from her [s]miles. Besides, I have purcha[s]ed the [s]eat of Capt. Pribble, about a mile from her mother's; and can I think of [s]uffering her to leave the neighborhood, ju[s]t as I enter it? I [s]hall exert every nerve to prevent that, and hope to meet with the u[s]ual [s]ucce[s]s of Peter Sanford . - -  Hartford You de[s]ire me to write to you, my friend; but if you had not, I [s]hould by no means have refrained. I tremble at the precipice on which you [s]tand; and mu[s]t echo, and re-echo the [s]ea[s]onable admonition of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-086.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] excellent Mrs. Richman, "Beware of the delu[s]ions of fancy!" You are [s]trangely infatuated by them! Let not the magic arts of that worthle[s]s Sanford lead you, like an ignis fatuus from the path of rectitude and virtue! I do not find, in all your conver[s]ations with him, that one word about marriage drops from his lips. This is my[s]terious? No, it is characteristic of the man. Suppo[s]e, however, that his views are honorable; yet what can you expect, what can you promi[s]e your[s]elf from [s]uch a connection? "A reformed rake," you [s]ay, "makes the be[s]t hu[s]band;" a trite, but a very erroneous maxim, as the fatal experience of thou[s]ands of our [s]ex can te[s]tify. In the fir[s]t place, I believe that rakes very [s]eldom do referm, while their fortunes and con[s]titutions enable them to pur[s]ue their licentious plea[s]ures. But even allowing this to happen, can a woman of refinement and delicacy enjoy the [s]ociety of a man, who[s]e mind has been corrupted, who[s]e ta[s]te has been vitiated, and who has contracted a depravity both of [s]entiment and manners, which no degree of repentance can wholly efface? Be[s]ides, of true love they are ab[s]olutely incapable. Their pa[s][s]ions have been too much hackneyed to admit [s]o pure a flame. You cannot anticipate [s]incere and la[s]ting re[s]pect from them. They have been [s]o long accu[s]tomed to the company of tho[s]e of our [s]ex, who ob[s]erve no e[s]teem; that the greate[s]t dignity and purity of character can never excite it in their brea[s]ts. They [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-087.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] are naturally prone to jealou[s]y. Habituated to an intercour[s]e with the ba[s]er part of the [s]ex, they level the whole, and [s]eldom believe any to be incorruptible. They are always hard hearted and cruel. How el[s]e could they triumph in the mi[s]eries which they frequently occa[s]ion? Their [s]pecious manners may render them agreeable companions abroad; but at home the evil propensities of their minds will invariably predominate. They are [s]teeled again[s]t the tender affections, which render dome[s]tic life delightful; [s]trangers to the kind, the endearing [s]ympathies of hu[s]band, father, and friend! The thou[s]and namele[s]s attentions which [s]often the rugged path of life, are neglected, and deemed unworthy of notice by per[s]ons who have been innured to [s]cenes of di[s][s]ipation and debauchery! and is a man of this de[s]cription to be the partner, the companion, the bo[s]om friend of my Eliza? Forbid it heaven! Let not the noble qualities, [s]o lavi[s]hly be[s]towed upon her, be thus unworthily [s]acrificed! You [s]eem to be particularly charmed with the fortune of Major Sanford; with the gaiety of his appearance; with the [s]plendor of his equipage; with the politene[s]s of his manners; with what you call the graces of his per[s]on! The[s]e, alas! are [s]uperficial, en[s]naring endowments. As to fortune, prudence, economy, and regularity are nece[s][s]ary to pre[s]erve it, when po[s][s]e[s][s]ed. Of the[s]e Major Sanford is certainly de[s]titute; unle[s]s common fame (which more frequently [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-088.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] tells truth than [s]ome are willing to allow) does him great inju[s]tice. As to external parade, it will not [s]atisfy the rational mind, when it aspires to tho[s]e [s]ub[s]tantial plea[s]ures for which yours is formed. And as to the graces of per[s]on and manners, they are but a wretched [s]ub[s]titute for tho[s]e virtues which adorn and dignify human life. Can you, who have always been u[s]ed to [s]erenity and order in a family, to rational, refined and improving conver[s]ation, relinqui[s]h them, and launch into the whirlpool of frivolity, where the correct ta[s]te and the delicate [s]en[s]ibility which you po[s][s]e[s]s mu[s]t constantly be wounded by the frothy and illiberal sallies of licentious wit? This, my dear, is but a faint picture of the [s]ituation to which you [s]eem inclined! Rever[s]e the [s]cene, and you will perceive the alternative, which is [s]ubmitted to your option, in a virtuous connection with Mr. Boyer. Remember that you are acting for life; and that your happine[s]s in this world; perhaps in the next, depends on your pre[s]ent choice! I called, la[s]t evening, to [s]ee your mamma. She is fondly anticipating your return; and rejoicing in the pro[s]pect of your agreeable and [s]peedy [s]ettlement. I could not find it in my heart to distress her by intimating that you had other views. I wi[s]h her benevolent bo[s]om never more to feel the pangs of di[s]appointed hope. I am bu[s]ily engaged in preparing for my nuptials. The [s]olemn words "as long as ye [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-089.jpg) \- external link  - Page 086. ] both [s]hall live," render me thoughtful and serious. I hope for your enlivening pre[s]ence [s]oon; which will prove a [s]ea[s]onable cordial to the spirits of your Lucy Freeman . - -  New-Haven I believe your [s]pirits need a cordial indeed, my dear Lucy; after drawing [s]o dreadful a portrait of my [s]wain. But I call him mine no longer. I renounce him entirely. My friends [s]hall be gratified. And if their predictions are verified, I [s]hall be happy in a union with the man of their choice. General Richman and lady have labored abundantly to prove that my ruin was inevitable if I did not immediately break all intercour[s]e with Major Sanford. I promi[s]ed a compliance with their wi[s]hes; and have accompli[s]hed the ta[s]k, though a hard one I found it. La[s]t Thur[s]day he was here, and desired leave to [s]pend an hour with me. I readily con[s]ented, a[s][s]uring my friends it [s]hould [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-090.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] be the la[s]t hour, which I would ever [s]pend in his company. He told me that he was obliged to leave town for a few days; and, as I [s]hould probably [s]ee Mr. Boyer, before his return, he could not depart in peace without once more endeavoring to intere[s]t me in his favor; to obtain [s]ome token of e[s]teem, [s]ome glimp[s]e of hope, that I would not utterly reject him, to [s]upport him in his ab[s]ence. I thanked him for the polite attention he had paid me, [s]ince our acquaintance; told him that I [s]hould ever retain a grateful [s]en[s]e of his partiality to me; that he would ever [s]hare my be[s]t wishes; but that all connection of the kind, to which he alluded, mu[s]t from that time, for ever cea[s]e. He exerted all his eloquence to obtain a retraction of that [s]entence, and ran, with the greatect volubility, through all the prote[s]tations, prayers, entreaties, profe[s][s]ions and a[s][s]urances which love could feel or art contrive. I had resolution, however, to re[s]i[s]t them, and to command my own emotions on the occa[s]ion, better than my natural [s]en[s]ibility gave me rea[s]on to expect. Finding every effort vain, he ro[s]e precipitately, and bade me adieu. I urged his tarrying to tea; but he declined, [s]aying, that he mu[s]t retire to his chamber, being, in his pre[s]ent [s]tate of mind, unfit for any [s]ociety, as he was bani[s]hed from mine. I offered him my hand, which he pre[s][s]ed with ardor to his lips, and bowing in silence, left the room. Thus terminated this affair; an affair, which, perhaps, was only the effect of mere gallantry [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-091.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] on his part, and of unmeaning plea[s]antry on mine; and which, I am [s]orry to [s]ay, has given my friends [s]o much anxiety and concern. I am under obligations to them for their kind solicitude, however cau[s]ele[s]s it may have been. As an agreeable companion, as a polite and fini[s]hed gallant, Major Sanford is all that the mo[s]t lively fancy could wi[s]h. And as you have always affirmed that I was a little inclined to coquetry, can you wonder at my exerci[s]ing it upon [s]o happy a [s]ubject? Be[s]ides, when I thought more [s]eriou[s]ly, his liberal fortune was extremely alluring to me, who, you know, have been hitherto confined to the rigid rules of prudence and economy, not to [s]ay, nece[s][s]ity in my finances. Mi[s]s Laurence called on me ye[s]terday, as [s]he was taking the air, and a[s]ked me whether Major Sanford took leave of me when he left town? He was here la[s]t week, [s]aid I, but I did not know that he was gone away. O yes, [s]he replied, he is gone to take po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of his [s]eat, which he has lately purcha[s]ed of Captain Pribble. I am told it is [s]uperb; and it ought to be, if it have the honor of his re[s]idence. Then you have a great opinion of Major Sanford, [s]aid I. Certainly; and has not every body el[s]e? [s]aid [s]he. I am [s]ure he is a very fine gentleman. Mrs. Richman [s]miled rather contemptuou[s]ly, and I changed the [s]ubject. I believe that the innocent heart of this simple girl is a little taken in. I have ju[s]t received a letter from Mr. Boyer, in the u[s]ual [s]tyle. He expects the [s]uperlative [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-092.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] happine[s]s of ki[s][s]ing my hand next week. O dear! I believe I mu[s]t begin to fix my phiz. Let me run to the gla[s]s and try if I can make up one that will look madami[s]h . Yes, I [s]ucceed very well. I congratulate you on your new neighbor; but I advi[s]e friend George to have the guardian knot tied immediately, le[s]t you [s]hould be ensnared by this bewitching '[s]quire. I have been trying to [s]educe General Richman to accompany me to the a[s][s]embly, this evening, but cannot prevail. Were Mrs. Richman able to go with us, he would be very happy to wait on us together; but to tell the truth, he had rather enjoy her company at home, than any which is to be found abroad. I rallied him on his old fa[s]hioned ta[s]te; but my heart approved and applauded his attachment. I despise the married man or woman, who harbors an inclination to partake of [s]eparate plea[s]ures. I am told, that a [s]ervant man inquires for me below; the me[s][s]enger of [s]ome enamoured [s]wain, I [s]uppo[s]e. I will [s]tep down and learn what message he brings--- Nothing extraordinary; it is only a card of compliments from a Mr. Emmons, a re[s]pectable merchant of this city, reque[s]ting the honor to wait on me to the a[s][s]embly this evening. A welcome reque[s]t, which I made no he[s]itation to grant. If I mu[s]t re[s]ign the[s]e favorite amusements, let me enjoy as large a [s]hare as po[s][s]ible, till the time arrive. Adieu. I mu[s]t repair to the toilet and adorn for a new conque[s]t, the per[s]on of Eliza Wharton .

I AM very happy to find you are in [s]o good [s]pirits, Eliza, after parting with your favorite [s]wain. For I perceive that he is really the favorite of your fancy, though your heart cannot e[s]teem him; and, independent of that, no [s]en[s]ations can be durable. I can tell you [s]ome news of this [s]trange man. He has arrived, and taken po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of his [s]eat. Having given general invitations, he has been called upon and welcomed by mo[s]t of the neighboring gentry. Ye[s]terday he made an elegant entertainment. Friend George (as you call him) and I were of the number, who had cards. Twenty one couple went, I am told. We did not go. I con[s]ider my time too valuable to be [s]pent in cultivating acquaintance with a per[s]on from whom neither plea[s]ure nor improvement are to be expected. His profu[s]ene[s]s may bribe the unthinking multitude to [s]how him re[s]pect; but he mu[s]t know, that though "Places and honors have been bought for gold, E[s]teem and love were never to be [s]old."

The[s]e, when detected, are rigidly puni[s]hed by the laws of the land. If their lives be [s]pared, they are [s]hunned by [s]ociety, and treated with every mark of di[s]approbation and contempt. But to the di[s]grace of humanity and virtue, the a[s][s]a[s][s]in of honor; the wretch, who breaks the peace of families, who robs virgin innocence of its charms, who triumphs over the ill placed confidence of the inexperienced, un[s]u[s]pecting, and too credulous fair, is received, and care[s][s]ed, not only by his own [s]ex, to which he is a reproach, but even by ours, who have every conceivable rea[s]on to de[s]pi[s]e and avoid him. Influenced by the[s]e principles, I am neither a[s]hamed nor afraid, openly to avow my [s]entiments of this man, and my rea[s]ons for treating him with the mo[s]t pointed neglect. I write warmly on the [s]ubject; for it is a [s]ubject in which I think the honor and happiness of my [s]ex concerned. I wi[s]h they would more generally e[s]pou[s]e their own cau[s]e. It would conduce to the public weal, and to their per[s]onal re[s]pectability. I rejoice, heartily, that you have had re[s]olution to re[s]i[s]t his allurements, to detect and repel his artifices. Re[s]olution, in [s]uch a ca[s]e, is ab[s]olutely nece[s][s]ary; for, "In [s]pite of all the virtue we can boa[s]t, The woman that deliberates is lo[s]t."

She wondered that I was not one of the party at our new neighbor's. The rea[s]on, madam, [s]aid I, is that I do not like the character of the man. I know nothing of him, [s]aid [s]he; he is quite a [s]tranger to me, only as he called at my hou[s]e, la[s]t week, to pay me his re[s]pects, as he [s]aid, for the [s]ake of my late hu[s]band, who[s]e memory he revered; and becau[s]e I was the mother of Mi[s]s Eliza Wharton, with whom he had the honor of [s]ome little acquaintance. His manners are engaging, and I am [s]orry to hear that his morals are corrupt. This, my dear, is a very extraordinary vi[s]it. I fear that he has not yet laid a[s]ide his arts. Be [s]till on your guard, is the advice of your [s]incere and faithful friend, Lucy Freeman . - -  Hartford I AM really bani[s]hed and rejected; de[s]ired never more to think of the girl I love, with a view of indulging that love, or of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-096.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] rendering it acceptable to its object! You will perhaps, di[s]pute the propriety of the term, and tell me it is not love, it is only gallantry, and a desire to exerci[s]e it with her, as a favorite nymph. I neither know, nor care by what appellation you di[s]tingui[s]h it, but it truly gives me pain. I have not felt one [s]en[s]ation of genuine plea[s]ure [s]ince I heard my [s]entence; yet I acquie[s]ced in it, and [s]ubmi[s][s]ively took my leave; though I doubt not but I [s]hall retaliate the indignity one time or other. I have taken po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of my new purcha[s]e, an elegant and delightful re[s]idence. It is rendered more [s]o by being in the vicinity of my charmer's native abode. This circum[s]tance will conduce much to my enjoyment, if I can succeed in my plan of [s]eparating her from Mr. Boyer. I know that my [s]ituation and mode of life are far more plea[s]ing to her than his, and [s]hall therefore tru[s]t to my appearance and address for a ree[s]tabli[s]hment in her favor. I intend, if po[s][s]ible, to ingratiate my[s]elf with her particular friends. For this purpo[s]e, I called la[s]t week at her mother's, to pay my re[s]pects to her ([s]o I told the good woman) as an object of my particular regard; and as the parent of a young lady, whom I had the honor to know and admire. She received me very civilly, thanked me for my attention, and invited me to call whenever I had opportunity; which was the very thing I wanted. I intend likewi[s]e, to court popularity. I don't know but I mu[s]t accept, by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-097.jpg) \- external link  - Page 094. ] and by, [s]ome lucrative office in the civil department. Yet I cannot bear the idea of confinement to bu[s]ine[s]s. It appears to me quite inconsistent with the character of a gentleman; I am [s]ure it is, with that of a man of plea[s]ure. But [s]omething I mu[s]t do; for I tell you, in confidence, that I was obliged to mortgage this place, becau[s]e I had not wherewithal to pay for it. But I [s]hall manage matters very well, I have no doubt, and keep up the appearance of affluence, till I find [s]ome lady in a [s]trait for a hu[s]band, who[s]e fortune will enable me to extricate myself from the[s]e embarra[s][s]ments. Do come and [s]ee me, Charles; for, notwith[s]tanding all my gaiety and parade, I have [s]ome turns of the hypo, [s]ome qualms of con[s]cience, you will call them; but I meddle not with [s]uch ob[s]olete words.

You [s]hall know the rea[s]on. I have been associated for three days, with [s]entiment and sobriety, in the per[s]on of Mr. Boyer. I don't know but this man will [s]educe me into matrimony. He is very eloquent upon the [s]ubject; and his manners are [s]o [s]olemn, that I am [s]trongly tempted, yet I dare not to laugh. Really, Lucy, there is [s]omething extremely engaging and [s]oothing too, in virtuous and refined conversation. It is a [s]ource of enjoyment which cannot be reali[s]ed by the di[s][s]olute and unreflecting. But then, this particular theme of his, is not a favorite one to me; I mean, as connected with its con[s]equences, care and confinement. However, I have compounded the matter with him, and conditioned that he [s]hall expatiate on the [s]ubject, and call it by what name he plea[s]es, platonic or conjugal , provided he will let me take my own time for the con[s]ummation. I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-099.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] have con[s]ented that he [s]hall e[s]cort me, next week, to [s]ee my mamma and my Lucy. O, how the idea of returning to that revered man[s]ion, to tho[s]e beloved friends, exhilerates my [s]pirits! General Richman's politene[s]s to me has induced him to invite a large party of tho[s]e gentlemen and ladies who have been particularly attentive to me, during my re[s]idence here, to dine and take tea, to morrow. After that, I expect to be engaged in making farewell vi[s]its, till I leave the place. I [s]hall, therefore, forego the plea[s]ure of telling you any occurrences, subsequent to this date, until you [s]ee and conver[s]e with your [s]incere friend, Eliza Wharton . - -  Hartford DEAR MADAM, The day after I left your ho[s]pitable dwelling, brought me [s]afe to that of my honored mamma; to the [s]eat of maternal and [s]ilial affection; of [s]ocial ea[s]e and dome[s]tic peace; of every [s]pecies of happine[s]s which can re[s]ult from [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-100.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] religion and virtue; from refinement in morals, and manners. I found my brother and his wife, with Lucy Freeman and Mr. Sumner, waiting to receive and bid me welcome. I flew with extacy to the bo[s]om of my mamma, who received me with her accu[s]tomed affection, te[s]tified by the expressive tears of tenderne[s]s which [s]tole [s]ilently down her widowed cheek. She was unable to [s]peak. I was equally [s]o. We therefore indulged, a moment, the plea[s]ing emotions of [s]ympathi[s]ing sensibility. When di[s]engaged from her fond embrace, I was [s]aluted by the others in turn; and having recovered my[s]elf, I pre[s]ented Mr. Boyer to each of the company, and each of the company to him. He was cordially received by all, but more e[s]pecially by my mamma. The next day I was called upon and welcomed by [s]everal of my neighboring acquaintance; among whom I was not a little [s]urpri[s]ed to [s]ee Major Sanford. He came in company with Mr. Stoddard and Lady, whom he overtook, as he told me, near by; and, as they informed him that the de[s]ign of their vi[s]it was to welcome me home, he readily accepted their invitation to partake of the plea[s]ure which every one mu[s]t receive on my return. I bowed [s]lightly at his compliment, taking no vi[s]ible notice of any peculiarity of expre[s][s]ion either in his words or looks. His politene[s]s to Mr. Boyer, appeared to be the re[s]ult of habit. Mr. Boyer's to him, to be [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-101.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] forced by re[s]pect to the company to which he had gained admi[s][s]ion. I dare [s]ay, that each felt a con[s]cious [s]uperiority; the one on the [s]core of merit; the other on that of fortune. Which ought to outweigh, the judicious mind will easily decide. The [s]cale, as I once ob[s]erved to you, will turn as fancy or rea[s]on preponderates. I believe the e[s]teem which I now have for Mr. Boyer, will keep me [s]teady; except, perhaps, [s]ome little excentricities, now and then, ju[s]t by way of variety. I am going to morrow morning to [s]pend a few days with Lucy Freeman; to a[s][s]i[s]t in the preparation for, and the solemnization of her nuptials, Mr. Boyer, in the mean time, will tarry among his friends in town. My mamma is exce[s][s]ively partial to him; though I am not yet jealous that [s]he means to rival me, I am not certain, however, but it might be happy for him if [s]he [s]hould. For I [s]u[s]pect, notwithstanding the di[s]parity of her age, that [s]he is better calculated to make him a good wife than I am or ever [s]hall be. But to be [s]ober. Plea[s]e, madam, to make my compliments acceptable to tho[s]e of your neighbors, who[s]e politene[s]s and attention to me, while at your hou[s]e, have laid me under particular obligations of gratitude and re[s]pect. My be[s]t regards attend General Richman. Pray tell him, that though I never expect to be [s]o good a wife as he is ble[s][s]ed with; yet I intend, after a while (when I have [s]owed all my wild cats) to make a tolerable one.

This event awakens new sensations in my mind; and calls into exerci[s]e a kind of affection which had before lain dormant. I feel already the tenderne[s]s of a parent; while imagination [s]ondly traces the mother's likene[s]s in the infant form. Mrs. Richman expects to receive your congratulations, in a letter by the next po[s]t.

Hail happy babe! Ushered into the world by the be[s]t of mothers; entitled by birth-right to virtue and honor; defended by parental love, from the weakne[s]s of infancy and childhood, by guardian wi[s]dom from the perils of youth, and by affluent independence from the griping hand of poverty, in more advanced life! May the[s]e animating prospects be reali[s]ed by your little daughter; and may you long enjoy the rich reward of [s]eeing her all that you wi[s]h! Ye[s]terday, my dear friend, Lucy Freeman gave her hand to the amiable and accomplished Mr. George Sumner. A large circle of congratulating friends were pre[s]ent. Her dre[s]s [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-104.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] was [s]uch as wealth and elegance required. Her deportment was every thing that mode[s]ty and propriety could [s]ugge[s]t. They are, indeed, a charming couple. The con[s]onance of their dispositions, the [s]imilarity of their ta[s]tes, and the equality of their ages are a [s]ure pledge of happiness. Every eye beamed with plea[s]ure on the occa[s]ion, and every tongue echoed the wi[s]hes of benevolence. Mine only was [s]ilent. Though not le[s]s intere[s]ted in the felicity of my friend than the re[s]t, yet the idea of a [s]eparation; perhaps, of an alienation of affection, by means of her entire devotion to another, ca[s]t an involuntary gloom over my mind. Mr. Boyer took my hand, after the ceremony was pa[s]t. Permit me, Mi[s]s Wharton, [s]aid he, to lead you to your lovely friend; her happine[s]s mu[s]t be heightened by your participation of it. Oh no; [s]aid I, I am too [s]elfi[s]h for that. She has conferred upon another that affection which I wi[s]hed to engross. My love was too [s]ervent to admit a rival. Retaliate then, [s]aid he, this fancied wrong, by doing likewi[s]e. I ob[s]erved that this was not a proper time to di[s]cu[s]s that [s]ubject; and, resuming my feat, endeavored to put on the appearance of my accu[s]tomed vivacity. I need nor relate the remaining particulars of the evening's entertainment. Mr. Boyer returned with my mamma, and I remained at Mrs. Freeman's. We are to have a ball here, this evening. Mr. Boyer has been with us, and tried to monopolize my company; but in vain. I am too much [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-105.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] engaged by the exhilerating [s]cenes around, for attending to a [s]ubject which affords no variety. I [s]hall not clo[s]e this till to morrow. \---I am rather fatigued with the amusements of la[s]t night, which were protracted to a late hour. Mr. Boyer was pre[s]ent; and I was plea[s]ed to [s]ee him not aver[s]e to the entertainment, though his profe[s][s]ion prevented his taking an active part. As all the neighboring gentry were invited, Mr. Freeman would, by no means, omit Major Sanford, which his daughter earnestly [s]olicited. It happened (unfortunately, [s]hall I [s]ay?) that I drew him for a partner. Yet I mu[s]t own, that I felt very little reluctance to my lot. He is an excellent dancer, and well calculated for a companion in the hours of mirth and gaiety. I regretted Mr. Boyer's being pre[s]ent, however; becau[s]e my enjoyment [s]eemed to give him pain. I hope he is not inclined to the pa[s][s]ion of jealou[s]y. If he is, I fear it will be [s]omewhat exerci[s]ed. Lucy Freeman, now Mrs. Sumner, removes, next week, to Bo[s]ton. I have agreed to accompany her, and [s]pend a month or two in her family. This will give variety to the journey of life. Be [s]o kind as to direct your next letter to me there.

I am again permitted to a[s][s]ociate with my Eliza; invited to the [s]ame entertainment! She does not re[s]u[s]e to join with me in the mazy dance, and partake the [s]cenes of fe[s]tive mirth. Nay, more; [s]he allows me to pre[s]s her hand to my lips; and li[s]tens to the [s]ighing accents of love. Love her, I certainly do. Would to heaven I could marry her! Would to heaven I had pre[s]erved my fortune; or [s]he had one to [s]upply its place! I am di[s]tracted at the idea of lo[s]ing her forever. I am [s]ometimes tempted to [s]olicit her hand in [s]erious earne[s]t; but if I [s]hould, poverty and want mu[s]t be the con[s]equence. Her disappointment in the expectation of affluence and splendor, which I believe her ruling pa[s][s]ion, would afford a perpetual [s]ource of di[s]content and mutual wretchedne[s]s. She is going to Bo[s]ton with her friend, Mrs. Sumner. I mu[s]t follow her. I mu[s]t break the connection, which is rapidly forming, between [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-107.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] her and Mr. Boyer; and enjoy her [s]ociety a while longer, if no more. I have had a little intimation from New-Haven, that Mi[s]s Laurence is partial to me, and might ea[s]ily be obtained, with a hand[s]ome property into the bargain. I am neither plea[s]ed with, nor aver[s]e to the girl. But [s]he has money, and that may [s]upply the place of love, by enabling me to pur[s]ue independent plea[s]ures. This [s]he mu[s]t expect, if [s]he marries a man of my ca[s]t. She doubtle[s]s knows my character; and if [s]he is [s]o vain of her charms or influence, as to think of reforming or confining me, [s]he mu[s]t bear the con[s]equences. However, I can keep my head up, at pre[s]ent, without recour[s]e to the noo[s]e of matrimony; and [s]hall, therefore, defer any particular attention to her, till nece[s][s]ity requires it. I am, &c.

That command, I cheerfully obey, in te[s]timony of my ready [s]ubmi[s][s]ion and re[s]pect. No other avocation could arre[s]t my time, which is now completely occupied in [s]cenes of amu[s]ement. Mrs. Sumner is agreeably [s]ettled and [s]ituated. She appears to be po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of every ble[s][s]ing which can render life de[s]irable. Almo[s]t every day, [s]ince our arrival, has been engro[s][s]ed by visitants.

The mu[s]eum, the theatres, the circus and the a[s][s]emblies have been frequented. Mrs. Sumner has made me [s]everal pre[s]ents, notwith[s]tanding which, the articles requi[s]ite to a fa[s]hionable appearance, have involved me in con[s]iderable expen[s]e. I fear that you will think me extravagant when you are told how much. Mr. Boyer tarried in town about a week, having bu[s]ine[s]s.

He even took the liberty to conver[s]e [s]eriou[s]ly on the [s]ubject. I was di[s]plea[s]ed with his freedom; and reminded him that I had the di[s]po[s]al of my own time, as yet; and that while I e[s]caped the censure of my own heart, I hoped that no one el[s]e would pre[s]ume to arraign it. He apologi[s]ed, and gave up his argument. I was much [s]urpri[s]ed, the fir[s]t time I went to the play, to [s]ee Major Sanford in the very next box. He immediately joined our party; and wherever I have been [s]ince, I have been almo[s]t [s]ure to meet him. Mr. Boyer has taken his departure; and I do not expect to [s]ee him again, till I return home. O mamma! I am embarra[s][s]ed about this man. His worth I acknowledge; nay, I e[s]teem him very highly.

I believe that I owe you an apology for my long [s]ilence. But my time has been much engro[s][s]ed of late; and my mind much more [s]o. When it will be otherwi[s]e, I cannot fore[s]ee. I fear, my friend, that there is [s]ome foundation for your [s]u[s]picions re[s]pecting my beloved Eliza. What pity it is, that [s]o fair a form, [s]o accompli[s]hed a mind, [s]hould be tarnished, in the [s]malle[s]t degree, by the follies of coquetry! If this be the fact, which I am loth to believe, all my regard for her [s]hall never make me the dupe of it. When I arrived at her re[s]idence, at New-Haven, where, I told you in my la[s]t, I was [s]oon to go, [s]he gave me a mo[s]t cordial reception. Her whole behavior to me was corre[s]pondent with tho[s]e [s]entiments of e[s]teem and affection which [s]he mode[s]tly avowed. She permitted me to accompany her to Hartford, to re[s]tore her to her mother, and to declare my wi[s]h to receive her again from her hand. Thus far, all was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-111.jpg) \- external link  - Page 108. ] harmony and happine[s]s. As all my wi[s]hes were con[s]i[s]tent with virtue and honor, [s]he readily indulged them. She took apparent plea[s]ure in my company, encouraged my hopes of a future union, and li[s]tened to the tender accents of love. But the [s]cenes of gaiety, which invited her attention, rever[s]ed her conduct. The delightful hours of mutual confidence, of [s]entimental conver[s]e, and of the interchange of re[s]ined affection, were no more! In[s]tead of the[s]e, parties were formed, unplea[s]ing to my ta[s]te; and every opportunity was embraced to join in diver[s]ions, in which [s]he knew I could not con[s]i[s]tently take a [s]hare. I, however, acquie[s]ced in her plea[s]ure, though I [s]ometimes thought my[s]elf neglected, and even hinted it to her mother. The old lady apologi[s]ed for her daughter, by alledging that [s]he had been ab[s]ent for a long time; that her acquaintances were rejoiced at her return, and welcomed her by [s]triving to promote her amnsement. One of her mo[s]t intimate friends was married during my [s]tay; and [s]he appeared deeply intere[s]ted in the event. She [s]pent [s]everal days in a[s][s]i[s]ting her, previous to the celebration. I re[s]ided, in the mean time, at her mamma's, visiting her at her friend's, where Major Sanford, among others, was received as a gue[s]t. Mrs. Summer acquainted me that [s]he had prevailed on Mi[s]s Wharton to go and [s]pend a few weeks with her at Bo[s]ton, whither [s]he was removing; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-112.jpg) \- external link  - Page 109. ] and urged my accompanying them. I endeavored to excu[s]e my[s]elf, as I had been ab[s]ent from my people a con[s]iderable time, and my return was now expected. But their importunity was [s]o great, and Eliza's declaration that it would be very agreeable to her, [s]o tempting, that I con[s]ented. Here I took lodgings and [s]pent about a week, taking every opportunity to conver[s]e with Eliza, [s]triving to di[s]cover her real di[s]po[s]ition towards me. I mentioned the inconvenience of vi[s]iting her [s]o often as I wi[s]hed, and [s]ugge[s]ted my de[s]ire to enter, as [s]oon as might be, into a family relation. I painted in the mo[s]t alluring colours the plea[s]ures re[s]ulting from dome[s]tic tranquillity, mutual confidence, and conjugal affection; and in[s]i[s]ted on her declaring frankly whether [s]he de[s]igned to [s]hare this happine[s]s with me, and when it [s]hould commence. She owned that [s]he intended to give me her hand; but when [s]he [s]hould be ready, [s]he could not yet determine. She pretended a promi[s]e from me to wait her time; to con[s]ent that [s]he [s]hould [s]hare the plea[s]ures of the sashionable world, as long as, [s]he cho[s]e, &c. I then attempted to convince her of her mistaken ideas of plea[s]ure; that the [s]cenes of di[s][s]ipation, of which [s]he was [s]o pa[s][s]ionately [s]ond, afforded no true enjoyment; that the adulation of the coxcomb could not give durability to her charms, or [s]ecure the approbation of the wife and good; nor could the fa[s]hionable amu[s]ements [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-113.jpg) \- external link  - Page 110. ] of brilliant a[s][s]emblies, and crouded theatres furni[s]h the mind with "That which nothing earthly gives, or can de[s]troy, The [s]oul's calm [s]un[s]hine, and the heart felt joy." The[s]e friendly [s]ugge[s]tions, I found were considered as the theme of a prie[s]t; and my de[s]ire to detach her from [s]uch empty pur[s]uits, as the [s]elfi[s]hne[s]s of a lover. She was even offended at my freedom; and warmly affirmed, that no one had a right to arraign her conduct. I mentioned Major Sanford who was then in town, and who (though [s]he went to places of public re[s]ort with Mr. and Mrs. Sumner) always met and gallanted her home. She rallied me upon my jealou[s]y, as [s]he termed it; wi[s]hed that I would attend her my[s]elf, and then [s]he [s]hould need no other gallant. I an[s]wered that I had rather re[s]ign that honor to another; but wi[s]hed, for her [s]ake, that he might be a gentleman who[s]e character would not di[s]grace the company with which he a[s][s]ociated. She appeared morti[s]ied and chagrined in the extreme. However, [s]he studiously [s]uppre[s][s]ed her emotions; and even [s]oothed me with the blandi[s]hments of female [s]oftne[s]s. We parted amicably. She promi[s]ed to return [s]oon, and prepare for a compliance with my wi[s]hes. I cannot re[s]u[s]e to believe her! I cannot cea[s]e to love her! My heart is in her possession. She has a perfect command of my passions. Per[s]ua[s]ion dwells on her tongue. With all the boa[s]ted fortitude and re[s]olution of our [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-114.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] [s]ex, we are but mere machines. Let love once pervade our brea[s]ts; and its object may mould us into any form that plea[s]es her fancy, or even caprice! I have ju[s]t received a letter from Eliza, informing me of her return to Hartford. To morrow I [s]hall [s]et out on a vi[s]it to the dear girl; for, my friend, notwith[s]tanding all her [s]oibles, [s]he is very dear to me. Before you hear from me again, I expect that the happy day will be fixed; the day which [s]hall unite, in the mo[s]t [s]acred bands, this lovely maid, and your faithful friend, J. Boyer . - -  Hampshire I HAVE returned; and the day, indeed, is fixed; but Oh! how different from my fond expectations! It is not the day of union, but the day of final [s]eparation; the day which divides me from my charmer; the day which breaks a[s]under the bands of love; the day on which my rea[s]on a[s][s]umes its empire, and triumphs over [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-115.jpg) \- external link  - Page 112. ] the arts of a fini[s]hed coquette! Congratulate me, my friend, that I have thus overcome my feelings, and repelled the infatuating wiles of a deceitful girl. I would not be under[s]tood to impeach Mi[s]s Wharton's virtue; I mean her cha[s]tity. Virtue in the common acceptation of the term, as applied to the [s]ex, is confined to that particular, you know. But in my view, this is of little importance, where all other virtues are wanting! When I arrived at Mrs. Wharton's, and inquired for Eliza, I was told that [s]he had rode out; but was [s]oon expected home. An hour after, a phaeton [s]topped at the door, from which my fair one alighted, and was handed into the hou[s]e by Major Sanford, who immediately took leave. I met her and offered my hand, which [s]he received with apparent tenderne[s]s. When the family had retired after [s]upper, and left us to talk on our particular affairs, I found the [s]ame indeci[s]ion, the [s]ame loathne[s]s to bring our court[s]hip to a period, as formerly. Her previous excu[s]es were renewed, and her wi[s]hes to have a union [s]till longer delayed, were zealou[s]ly urged. She could not bear the idea of con[s]inement to the cares of a married life at per[s]ent; and begged me to defer all [s]olicitation on that [s]ubject to [s]ome future day. I found my temper ri[s]e, and told her plainly, that I was not thus to be tri[s]ted with; that if her regard for me was [s]incere; if [s]he really intended to form a connection with me, [s]he could not thus [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-116.jpg) \- external link  - Page 113. ] protract the time, try my patience, and prefer every other plea[s]ure to the rational interchange of affection, to the calm delights of dome[s]tic life. But in vain did I argue again[s]t her fal[s]e notions of happine[s]s; in vain did I repre[s]ent the dangerous [s]y[s]tem of conduct, which [s]he now pursued, and urge her to accept, before it was too late, the hand and heart which were devoted to her [s]ervice. That, [s]he [s]aid, [s]he purpo[s]ed, ere long to do; and hoped amply to reward my faithful love; but [s]he could not fix the time this evening. She mu[s]t con[s]ider a little further; and likewi[s]e con[s]ult her mother. Is it not Major Sanford whom you wi[s]h to con[s]ult, madam? [s]aid I. She blu[s]hed, and gave me no an[s]wer. Tell me, Eliza, I continued, tell me frankly, if he has not [s]upplanted me in your affections; if he be not the cau[s]e of my being thus eva[s]ively, thus cruelly treated? Major Sanford, [s]ir, replied [s]he, has done you no harm. He is a particular friend of mine; a polite gentleman, and an agreeable neighbor; and therefore I treat him with civility; but he is not [s]o much intere[s]ted in my concerns, as to alter my disposition towards any other per[s]on. Why, [s]aid I, do you talk of friend[s]hip with a man of his character? Between his [s]ociety and mine, there is a great contra[s]t. Such oppo[s]ite put[s]uits and inclinations cannot be equally plea[s]ing to the [s]ame ta[s]te. It is therefore nece[s][s]ary, that you renounce the one, to enjoy the other. I will give you time to decide which. I am going to a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-117.jpg) \- external link  - Page 114. ] friend's hou[s]e to [s]pend the night; and will call on you to morrow, if agreeable, and conver[s]e with you further upon the matter. She bowed a[s][s]ent, and I retired. The next afternoon I went as agreed; and found her mamma and her alone in the parlor. She was very pen[s]ive and appeared to have been in tears. The [s]ight affected me. The idea of having treated her har[s]hly, the evening before, di[s]armed me of my re[s]olution to in[s]i[s]t on her deci[s]ion that day. I invited her to ride with me and vi[s]it a friend, to which [s]he readily consented. We [s]pent our time agreeably. I forebore to pre[s]s her on the [s]ubject of our future union; but [s]trove rather to [s]oothe her mind, and in[s]pire her with [s]entiments of tenderne[s]s towards me. I conducted her home, and returned early in the evening to my friend's, who met me at the door; and joco[s]ely told me, that he expected I [s]hould now rob them of their agreeable neighbor. But, added he, we have been apprehen[s]ive that you would be rivalled, if you delayed your vi[s]it much longer. I did not [s]u[s]pect a rival, [s]aid I. Who can the happy man be? I can [s]ay nothing from personal ob[s]ervation, [s]aid he; but [s]ame, of late, has talked loudly of Major Sanford and Mi[s]s Wharton. Be not alarmed, continued he, feeing me look grave. I pre[s]ume no harm is intended. The Major is a man of gallantry, and Mi[s]s Wharton is a gay lady; but I dare [s]ay that your connection will be happy, if it he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-118.jpg) \- external link  - Page 115. ] formed  . I noticed a particular empha[s]is on the word if; and as we were alone, I followed him with que[s]tions, till the whole affair was developed. I informed him of my embarra[s][s]ment; and he gave me to under[s]tand that Eliza's conduct had, for [s]ome time pa[s]t, been a [s]ubject of speculation in the town; that formerly, her character was highly e[s]teemed; but that her intimacy with a man of Sanford's known libertini[s]m; more e[s]pecially as [s]he was [s]uppo[s]ed to be engaged to another, had rendered her very cen[s]urable; that they were often together; that wherever [s]he went, he was [s]ure to follow, as if by appointment; that they walked, talked, [s]ung and danced together in all companies; that [s]ome [s]uppo[s]ed he would marry her; others, that he only meditated adding her name to the black catalogue of deluded wretches, whom he had already ruined! I ro[s]e, and walked the room in great agitation. He apologized for his freedom; was forry if he had wounded my feelings; but friendship alone had induced him frankly to declare the truth, that I might guard again[s]t duplicity and deceit. I thanked him for his kind inten[s]ions; and a[s][s]ured him that I [s]hould not quit the town till I had terminated this affair, in one way or another. I retired to bed, but [s]leep was a [s]iranger to my eyes. With the dawn I ro[s]e; and after breakfast walked to Mrs. Wharton's, who informed me, that Eliza was in her chamber, writing to a friend, but would be down in a few minutes. I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-119.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] entered into conver[s]ation with the old lady on the [s]ubject of her daughter's conduct; hinted my [s]u[s]picions of the cau[s]e, and declared my resolution of knowing my de[s]tiny immediately. She endeavored to extenuate, and excu[s]e her as much as po[s][s]ible; but frankly owned that her behavior was my[s]terious; that no pains had been wanting, on her part, to alter and rectify it; that [s]he had remon[s]trated, expo[s]tulated, advised and entreated, as often as occa[s]ion required. She hoped that my re[s]olution would have a good effect, as [s]he knew that her daughter esteemed me very highly. In this manner we conver[s]ed till the clock [s]truck twelve; and Eliza, not appearing, I desired her mamma to [s]end up word that I waited to [s]ee her. The maid returned with an an[s]wer that [s]he was indi[s]po[s]ed, and had lain down. Mrs. Wharton ob[s]erved, that [s]he had not [s]lept for [s]everal nights, and complained of the head ache in the morning. The girl added, that [s]he would wait on Mr. Boyer in the evening. Upon this information I ro[s]e and abruptly took my leave. I went to dine with a friend, to whom I had engaged my[s]elf the day before; but my mind was too much agitated to enjoy either the company or the dinner. I excu[s]ed my[s]elf from tarrying to tea, and returned to Mrs. Wharton's. On inquiry, I was told that Eliza had gone to walk in the garden; but de[s]ired that no per[s]on might intrude on her retirement. The singularity of the reque[s]t awakened my curio[s]ity, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-120.jpg) \- external link  - Page 117. ] determined me to follow her. I [s]ought her in vain, in different parts of the garden, till, going towards an arbor, almo[s]t concealed from [s]ight, by [s]urrounding [s]hrubbery, I di[s]covered her, sitting in clo[s]e conver[s]ation with Major Sanford! My blood chilled in my veins, and I [s]tood perrisied with a[s]toni[s]hment, at the di[s]clo[s]ure of [s]uch ba[s]ene[s]s and deceit. They both ro[s]e in vi[s]ible confu[s]ion. I dared not tru[s]t my[s]elf to acco[s]t them. My pa[s][s]ions were rai[s]ed, and I feared that I might [s]ay or do [s]omething unbecoming my character. I therefore gave them a look of indignation and contempt, and retreated to the hou[s]e. I traver[s]ed the parlor ha[s]tily, overwhelmed with chagrin and re[s]entment! Mrs. Wharton inquired the cau[s]e. I attempted to tell her, but my tongue refu[s]ed utterance! While in this [s]ituation, Eliza entered the room. She was not le[s]s di[s]compo[s]ed than my[s]elf. She [s]at down at the window and wept. Her mamma wept likewi[s]e. At length [s]he recovered herself, in a degree, and de[s]ired me to [s]it down. I an[s]wered no; and continued walking. Will you, [s]aid [s]he, permit me to vindicate my conduct and explain my motives? Your conduct, [s]aid I, cannot be vindicated; your motives need no explanation; they are too apparent! How, Mi[s]s Wharton, have I merited this treatment from you? But I can bear it no longer. Your indifference to me proceeds from an attachment to another; and forgive me, if I add, to one, who is the di[s]grace of his own [s]ex, and the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-121.jpg) \- external link  - Page 118. ] destroyer of yours. I have been too long the dupe of your di[s][s]imulation and coquetry. Too long has my peace of mind been [s]acrificed to the arts of a woman, who[s]e conduct has proved her unworthy of my regard; in[s]en[s]ible to love, gratitude and honor! To you, madam, [s]aid I, turning to her mother, I acknowledge my obligations for your friendship, politene[s]s and attention. I once hoped for the privilege of rocking for you the cradle of declining age. I am deprived of that privilege; but I pray that you may never want a child, who[s]e love and duty [s]hall prove a [s]ource of consolation and comfort! Farewell! If we never meet again in this life, I hope and tru[s]t we [s]hall in a better; where the parent's eye [s]hall cea[s]e to weep for the disobedience of a child; and the lover's heart to bleed for the infidelity of his mi[s]tre[s]s! I turned to Eliza, and attempted to [s]peak; but her extreme emotion [s]oftened me, and I could not command my voice. I took her hand, and bowing, in token of an adieu, went precipitately out of the hou[s]e. The re[s]idence of my friend, with whom I lodged, was at no great di[s]tance, and thither I repaired. As I met him in the entry, I ru[s]hed by him, and betook my[s]elf to my chamber. The fever of re[s]entment, and the tumult of pa[s][s]ion began now to give place to the [s]often emotions of the [s]oul. I found my[s]elf perfectly unmanned. I gave free [s]cope to the [s]en[s]ibility [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-122.jpg) \- external link  - Page 119. ] of my heart; and the effeminate relief of tears materially lightened the load which oppre[s][s]ed me. After this arduous [s]truggle I went to bed; and [s]lept more calmly than for [s]everal nights before. The next morning I wrote a farewell letter to Eliza (a copy of which I [s]hall inclo[s]e to you) and ordering my hor[s]e to be brought, left town immediately. My re[s]entment of her behavior has much assisted me in era[s]ing her image from my brea[s]t. In this exertion I have [s]ucceeded beyond my mo[s]t [s]anguine expectations. The more I reflect on her temper and di[s]po[s]ition, the more my gratitude is enlivened towards the wi[s]e Di[s]po[s]er of all events for enabling me to break a[s]under the [s]nares of the deluder. I am convinced, that the gaiety and extravagance of her ta[s]te, the frivolous levity of her manners di[s]qualify her for the [s]tation in which I wi[s]hed to have placed her. The[s]e con[s]iderations, together with that re[s]ignation to an overruling Providence which the religion I profe[s]s, and teach, requires me to cultivate, induce me cheerfully to adopt the following lines of an ingenious poet: "Since all the downward tracts of time, God's watchful eye [s]urveys, Oh, who [s]o wi[s]e to choo[s]e our lot, Or regulate our ways? Since none can doubt his equal love, Unmea[s]urably kind. To his nuerring gracious will, Be every wi[s]h re[s]ign'd. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-123.jpg) \- external link  - Page 120. ] Good, when he gives, [s]upremely good, Not le[s]s when he denies; E'en cro[s][s]es from his [s]overeign hand, Are ble[s][s]ings in di[s]gui[s]e." I am, &c. J. Boyer . - Enclo[s]ed in the foregoing -  Hartford MADAM, Fearing , that my re[s]olution may not be proof again[s]t the eloquence of tho[s]e charms, which have [s]o long commanded me, I take this method of bidding you a final adieu. I write not as a lover. That connection between us is for ever di[s][s]olved; but I addre[s]s you as a friend; a friend to your happine[s]s, to your reputation, to your temporal and eternal welfare. I will not rehear[s]e the innumerable in[s]tances of your imprudence and mi[s]conduct, which have fallen under my ob[s]ervation. Your own heart mu[s]t be your monitor! [s]uffice it for me to warn you again[s]t the dangerous tendency of [s]o diffipated a life; and to tell you that I have traced (I believe aright) the cau[s]e of your dissimulation and indifference to me. They are an aversion to the [s]ober, rational, frugal mode of living, to which my profe[s][s]ion leads; a fondness for the parade, the gaiety, not to [s]ay, the licentiou[s]ne[s]s of a [s]tation calculated to gratify [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-124.jpg) \- external link  - Page 121. ] [s]uch a di[s]po[s]ition; and a prepo[s][s]e[s][s]ion for Major Sanford, infu[s]ed into your giddy mind by the frippery, flattery and artifice of that worthless and abandoned man. Hence you preferred a connection with him, if it could be accomplished; but a doubt, whether it could, together with the advice of your friends, who have kindly e[s]pou[s]ed my cau[s]e, have re[s]trained you from the avowal of your real [s]entiments, and led you to continue your civilities to me. What the re[s]ult of your coquetry would have been, had I waired for it, I cannot [s]ay, nor have I now any de[s]ire or intere[s]t to know. I tear from my brea[s]t the idea which I have long cheri[s]hed of future union and happine[s]s with you in the conjugal [s]tate. I bid a la[s]t farewell to the[s]e fond hopes, and leave you for ever! For your own [s]ake, however, let me conjure you to review your conduct, and before you have advanced beyond the po[s][s]ibility of returning to rectitude and honor, to re[s]train your [s]teps from the dangerous path in which you now tread! Fly Major Sanford. That man is a deceiver. Tru[s]t not his profe[s][s]ions. They are certainly in[s]incere; or he would not affect concealment; he would not induce you to a clande[s]tine intercourse! Many have been the victims of his treachery! O Eliza! add not to the number! Bani[s]h him from your [s]ociety, if you wi[s]h to pre[s]erve your virtue un[s]ullied, your character [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-125.jpg) \- external link  - Page 122. ] un[s]u[s]picious! It already begins to depreciate. Snatch it from the envenomed tongue of slander, before it receive an incurable wound! Many faults have been vi[s]ible to me; over which my affection once drew a veil. That veil is now removed. And, acting the part of a di[s]intere[s]ted friend, I [s]hall mention [s]ome few of them with freedom. There is a levity in your manners, which is incon[s]i[s]tent with the [s]olidity and decorum becoming a lady who has arrived to years of di[s]cretion. There is al[s]o an unwarrantable extravagance betrayed in your dre[s]s. Prudence and economy are [s]uch necessary, at lea[s]t, [s]uch decent virtues, that they claim the attention of every female, whatever be her [s]tation or her property. To the[s]e virtues you are apparently inattentive. Too large a portion of your time is devoted to the adorning of your per[s]on. Think not that I write thus plainly from re[s]entment. No; It is from benevolence. I mention your foibles, not to reproach you with them, but that you may con[s]ider their nature and effects, and renounce them. I wi[s]h you to regard this letter as the legacy of a friend; and to improve it accordingly. I [s]hall leave town before you receive it. O, how different are my [s]en[s]ations at going, from what they were when I came! but I forbear de[s]cription. Think not, Eliza, that I leave you with indifference! The conflict is great; the trial is [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-126.jpg) \- external link  - Page 123. ] more than I can calmly [s]upport! Yet the consciousness of duty, affords con[s]olation. A duty I conceive it to be, which I owe to my[s]elf; and to the people of my charge, who are interested in my future connection. I wi[s]h not for an an[s]wer; my re[s]olution is unalterably fixed. But [s]hould you hereafter be convinced of the ju[s]tice of my conduct; and become a convert to my advice, I [s]hall be happy to hear it. That you may have wi[s]dom to keep you from falling, and conduct you [s]afely through this [s]tate of trial to the regions of immortal bli[s]s, is the [s]ervent prayer of your [s]incere friend, and humble [s]ervant, J. Boyer . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-127.jpg) \- external link  - Page 124. ] - -  Hartford The retirement of my native home is not [s]o gloomy, [s]ince my return from Boston, as I expected, from the contra[s]t between them. Indeed, the cu[s]toms and amu[s]ements of this place are materially altered, [s]ince the residence of Major Sanford among us. The dull, old fa[s]hioned [s]obriety which formerly prevailed, is nearly bani[s]hed; and cheerfulne[s]s, vivacity, and enjoyment are [s]ub[s]tituted in its [s]tead. Plea[s]ure is now diffu[s]ed through all ranks of the people, e[s]pecially the rich; and [s]urely it ought to be cultivated, [s]ince the wi[s]e[s]t of men informs us, that "a merry heart doth good like a medicine." As human life has many di[s]ea[s]es, which require medicines, are we not right in [s]electing the mo[s]t agreeable and palatable? Major Sanford's example has had great influence upon our [s]ociety in general; and though [s]ome of our old dons think him rather licentious; yet, for ought I can [s]ee, he is as [s]trict an ob[s]erver ofdecorum, as the be[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-128.jpg) \- external link  - Page 125. ] of them. True, he [s]eldom goes to church; but what of that? The Deity is not con[s]ined to temples made with hands. He may wor[s]hip him as devoutly el[s]ewhere, if he chu[s]es; and who has a right to [s]ay he does not? His return from Bo[s]ton was but a day or two after mine. He paid me an early vi[s]it; and, indeed, has been very attentive ever [s]ince. My mamma is [s]omewhat preci[s]e in her notions of propriety; and of cour[s]e, blames me for a[s][s]ociating [s]o freely with him. She [s]ays, that my engagements to Mr. Boyer ought to render me more [s]edate; and more indifferent to the gallantry of mere plea[s]ure-bunters , to u[s]e her phra[s]e. But I think otherwi[s]e. If I am to become a reclu[s]e, let me, at lea[s]t, enjoy tho[s]e amu[s]ements, which are [s]uited to my ta[s]te, a [s]hort time fir[s]t. Why [s]hould I refu[s]e the polite attentions of this gentleman? They [s]moothe the rugged path of life, and wonderfully accelerate the lagging wheels of time. Indeed, Lucy, he has an admirable talent for contributing to vary, and increa[s]e amusement. We have few hours unimproved. Some new plan of plea[s]ure, and [s]ociability is constantly courting our adoption. He lives in all the magnificence of a prince; and why [s]hould I, who can doubtle[s]s [s]hare that magnificence if I plea[s]e, forego the advantages and indulgences it offers, merely to gratify tho[s]e friends who pretend to be better judges of my happiness than I am my[s]elf. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-129.jpg) \- external link  - Page 126. ] I have not yet told my mamma that he entertains me with the lover's theme; or, at lea[s]t, that I li[s]ten to it. Yet I mu[s]t own to you, from whom I have never concealed an action or idea, that his [s]ituation in life charms my imagination; that the apparent [s]ervor and sincerity of his pa[s][s]ion affect my heart. Yet there is [s]omething extremely problematical in his conduct. He is very urgent with me to di[s][s]olve my connection with Mr. Boyer, and engage not to marry him without his con[s]ent; or knowledge, to [s]ay no more. He warmly applauds my wi[s]h, [s]till longer to enjoy the freedom and independence of a [s]ingle [s]tate; and profe[s][s]edly adopts it for his own. While he would disconnect me from another, he my[s]teriou[s]ly conceals his own intentions and views. In conversation with him ye[s]terday, I plainly told him that his conduct was unaccountable; that if his profe[s][s]ions and de[s]igns were honorable he could not neglect to mention them to my mamma; that I [s]hould no longer con[s]ent to carry on a clande[s]tine intercour[s]e with him; that I hourly expected Mr. Boyer, whom I esteemed, and who was the favorite of my frinds; and that unle[s]s he acted openly in this affair before his arrival, I [s]hould give my hand to him. He appeared thunder[s]truck at this declaration. All his words and actions were indicative of the mo[s]t violent emotions of mind. He entreated me to recall the [s]entence; for I knew not, he [s]aid, his motives for [s]ecrecy; yet he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-130.jpg) \- external link  - Page 127. ] [s]olemnly [s]wore that they were honorable. I replied in the words of the poet, "Tru[s]t not a man, they are by nature cruel, Fal[s]e, deceitful, treacherous, and incon[s]tant. When a man talks of love, with caution hear him; But if he [s]wear, he'll certainly deceive you." He begged that he might know by what means he had provoked my [s]u[s]picions; by what means he had for[s]eited my confidence? His importunity vanqui[s]hed my fortitude; and before we parted, I again promi[s]ed to make him acquainted, from time to time, with the progre[s]s of my connection with Mr. Boyer. Now, my dear friend, I want your advice more than ever. I am inadvertently embarra[s][s]ed by this man; and how to extricate my[s]elf, I know not. I am [s]en[s]ible that the power is in my hands; but the di[s]po[s]ition ([s]hall I confe[s]s it) is wanting! "I know the right, and I approve it too; I know the wrong and yet the wrong pur[s]ue!" I have ju[s]t received a card from Major Sanford, inviting me to ride this afternoon. At fir[s]t I thought of returning a negative an[s]wer; but recollecting that Mr. Boyer mu[s]t [s]oon be here, I concluded it be[s]t to embrace this opportunity, of talking further with him. I mu[s]t now prepare to go; but [s]hall not clo[s]e this letter, for I intend writing in continuation, as events occur, till this important bu[s]ine[s]s is decided. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-131.jpg) \- external link  - Page 128. ] Tue[s]day evening . The little tour which I mentioned to you this afternoon, was not productive of a final determination. The [s]ame plea was repeated over, and over again, without clo[s]ing the cau[s]e. On my return I found Mr. Boyer waiting to receive me. My heart beat an involuntary welcome. I received him very cordially, though with a kind of plea[s]ure mixed with apprehen[s]ion. I mu[s]t own that his conver[s]ation and manners are much better calculated to bear the [s]crutini[s]ing eye of a refined under[s]tanding and ta[s]te, than Major Sanford's. But whether the fancy ought not to be consulted about our [s]ettlement for life, is with me a que[s]tion. When we parted la[s]t, I had promi[s]ed Mr. Boyer, to inform him po[s]itively, at this vi[s]it, when my hand [s]hould be given. He therefore came, as he told me in the cour[s]e of our conversation, with the re[s]olution of claiming the ful[s]ilment of this promi[s]e. I begged ab[s]olution; told him, that I could not po[s][s]ibly [s]atisfy his claim; and [s]ought [s]till to evade, and put off the important deci[s]ion. He grew warm; and affirmed that I treated him ungenerou[s]ly, and made needle[s]s delays. He even accu[s]ed me of indifference towards him; and of partiality to another. Major Sanford he believed, was the man who robbed him of the affection which he had supposed his due. He warned me again[s]t any intercourse with him, and in[s]i[s]ted that I mu[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-132.jpg) \- external link  - Page 129. ] renounce the [s]ociety of the one or the other immediately. He would leave me, he [s]aid, this evening and call to morrow to know the re[s]ult of my determination. It was late before he bade me good night; [s]ince which I have written the[s]e particulars. It is now time to lay a[s]ide my pen, and deliberate what cour[s]e to take. Wedne[s]day Evening . La[s]t night I clo[s]ed not my eyes. I ro[s]e this morning with the [s]un, and went into the garden till breakfa[s]t. My mamma doubtle[s]s [s]aw the di[s]order of my mind, but kindly avoided any inquiry about it. She was affectionately attentive to me, but [s]aid nothing of my particular concerns. I mentioned not my embarra[s][s]ment to her. She had declared her[s]elf in favor of Mr. Boyer; therefore I had no expectation, that [s]he would advise impartially. I retired to my chamber, and remained in a kind of reverie, for more than an hour; when I was rou[s]ed by the rattling of a carriage at the door. I ha[s]tened to the window, and [s]aw Major Sanford ju[s]t driving away. The idea of his having been to conver[s]e with my mamma, gave me new sensations. A thou[s]and perplexities occurred to my mind relative to the part mo[s]t proper for me to act in this critical [s]ituation. All the[s]e might have been avoided, had I gone down and inquired into the matter; but this I delayed till dinner. My mamma then informed me, that Major Sanford had been with her, and inquired for me; but that [s]he thought it [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-133.jpg) \- external link  - Page 130. ] unnecessary to call me, as [s]he prefumed I had no particular bu[s]ine[s]s with him. I knew the motives by which [s]he was actuated, and was vexed at her eva[s]ions. I told her plainly, that [s]he would never carry her point in this way; that I thought my[s]elf capable of conducting my own affairs; and wi[s]hed her not to inter[s]ere, except by her advice, which I [s]hould always li[s]ten to, and comply with when I could po[s][s]ibly make it con[s]i[s]tent with my inclination and intere[s]t. She wept at my undutiful anger (of which I have [s]everely repented [s]ince) and affectionately replied, that my happine[s]s was the object of her wi[s]hes and prayers; conformably to which [s]he felt con[s]trained, [s]reely to [s]peak her mind, though it incurred my displeasure. She then went through again with all the comparative circum[s]tances and merits of the two candidates for my favor, which have perpetually rung in my ears for months. I [s]hed tears at the idea of my embarra[s][s]ment; and in this condition Mr. Boyer found us. He appeared to be affected by my vi[s]ible di[s]order; and without inquiring the cau[s]e, endeavored to dissipate it. This was kindly done. He conversed upon indifferent [s]ubjects; and invited me to ride, and take tea with your mamma, to which I readily con[s]ented. We found her at home; and pa[s][s]ed the time agreeably, excepting the alloy of your ab[s]ence. Mr. Boyer touched lightly on the [s]ubject of our laft evening's debate; but expatiated largely on the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-134.jpg) \- external link  - Page 131. ] plea[s]ing power of love; and hoped that we [s]hould one day both realize and exemplify it in perfection. When we returned, he observed that it was late, and took his leave; telling me that he [s]hould call to morrow; and begged that I would then relieve his [s]u[s]pen[s]e. As I was retiring to bed, the maid gave me a hint that Major Sandford's [s]ervant had been here and left a letter. I turned in[s]tantly back to my mamma, and telling her my information, demanded the letter. She he[s]itated, but I insisted on having it; and [s]eeing me re[s]olute, [s]he reluctantly gave it into my hand. It contained the following words: "Am I for[s]aken? Am I abandoned? Oh my adorable Eliza, have you [s]acrificed me to my rival? Have you condemned me to perpetual bani[s]hment, without a hearing? I came this day, to plead my cau[s]e at your feet; but was cruelly denied the privilege of feeing you! My mind is all anarchy and confu[s]ion! My [s]oul is harrowed up with jealou[s]y! I will be revenged on tho[s]e who [s]eparate us, if that di[s]tracting event take place! But it is from your lips only that I can hear my [s]entence! You mu[s]t witne[s]s its effects! To what lengths my de[s]pair may carry me, I know not! You are the arbitre[s]s of my fate! Let me conjure you to meet me in your garden to morrow at any hour you [s]hall appoint. My [s]ervant will call for an an[s]wer in the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-135.jpg) \- external link  - Page 132. ] morning. Deny me not an interview; but have pity on your faithful Sanford ." I wrote for an[s]wer, that I would meet him to morrow, at five o'clock in the afternoon. I have now before me another night for confideration; and [s]hall pa[s]s it in that employment. I purpo[s]e not to [s]ee Mr. Boyer, till I have conver[s]ed with Major Sanford. Thur[s]day Morning . The morning dawns, and u[s]hers in the day; a day, perhaps big with the fate of your friend! What that fate may be is wrapped in the womb of futurity; that futurity which a kind Providence has wifely concealed from the penetration of mortals! After mature confideration; after revolving and re-revolving every circum[s]tance on both [s]ides of the que[s]tion, I have nearly determined, in compliance with the advice of my friends, and the dictates of my own judgment, to give Mr. Boyer the preference, and with him to tread the future round of life. As to the de[s]pair of Major Sanford, it does not much alarm me. Such violent pa[s][s]ions are [s]eldom [s]o deeply rooted, as to produce la[s]ting effects. I mu[s]t, however, keep my word, and meet him according to promi[s]e. Mr. Boyer is below. My mamma has ju[s]t [s]ent me word that he wi[s]hed to [s]ee me. My reply was that I had lain down, which was a fact. One o'Clock . My mamma, alarmed by my indisposition, has vi[s]ited my apartment. I [s]oon [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-136.jpg) \- external link  - Page 133. ] convinced her that it was but tri[s]ling, owing principally to the want of [s]leep; and that an airing in the garden, which I intended towards night, would re[s]tore me. Ten o'clock, at night .---The day is pa[s]t! and [s]uch a day it has been, as I hope never more to [s]ee! At the hour appointed, I went tolerably compo[s]ed and re[s]olute into the garden. I had taken [s]everal turns, and retired into the little arbor, where you and I have [s]pent [s]o many happy hours, before Major Sanford entered. When he appeared, a con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of the impropriety of this clande[s]tine intercour[s]e suffused my cheek, and gave a coldne[s]s to my manners. He immediately penetrated the cau[s]e, and ob[s]erved that my very countenance told him he was no longer a welcome gue[s]t to me. I a[s]ked him if he ought [s]o to be; [s]ince his ma-tives for [s]eeking admi[s][s]ion, were unworthy of being communicated to my friends? That he [s]aid was not the ca[s]e, but that prudence in the present in[s]tance required a temporary concealment. He then undertook to exculpate him[s]elf from blame, a[s][s]uring me that as [s]oon as I [s]hould di[s]countenance the expectations of Mr. Boyer, and di[s]continue the reception of his addre[s]s, his intentions [s]hould be made known. He was enlarging upon this topic, when we heard a foot[s]tep approaching us? and looking up [s]aw Mr. Boyer within a few paces of the arbor.--- Confu[s]ion [s]eized us both! We ro[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-137.jpg) \- external link  - Page 134. ] involuntarily from our [s]eats, but were mute as [s]tatues! He [s]poke not a word, but ca[s]ting a look of indignant accu[s]ation at me, a glance which penetrated my very [s]oul, turned on his heel, and walked ha[s]tily back to the hou[s]e. I [s]tood a few moments, con[s]idering what cour[s]e to take, though [s]hame and regret had almo[s]t taken from me the power of thought. Major Sanford took my hand. I withdrew it from him. I mu[s]t leave you, [s]aid I. Where will you go? [s]aid he. I will go and try to retrieve my character. It has [s]uffered greatly by this [s]atal interview. He threw him[s]elf at my [s]eet and exclaimed, leave me not, Eliza, I conjure you not to leave me. Let me go now, I rejoined, or I bid you farewell for ever. I flew precipitately by him, and went into the parlor, where I found Mr. Boyer and my mamma, the one traver[s]ing the room in the greate[s]t agitation; the other in a flood of tears! Their appearance affected me; and I wept like an infant! when I had a little recovered my[s]elf, I begged him to fit down; He an[s]wered no. I then told him, that however unju[s]ti[s]iable my conduct might appear, perhaps I might explain it to his [s]atisfaction, if he would hear me; that my motives were innocent, though they doubtle[s]s wore the a[s]pect of criminality, in his view. He [s]ternly replied, that no palliation could avail; that my motives were [s]ufficiently notorious! He, accu[s]ed me of treating him ill, of rendering him the dupe of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-138.jpg) \- external link  - Page 135. ] coquetting artifice, of having an intrigue with Major Sanford, and declared his determination to leave me for ever, as unworthy of his regard, and incapable of love, gratitude, or honor!--- There was too much rea[s]on in [s]upport of his accu[s]ations for me to gain[s]ay them, had his impetuo[s]ity [s]uffered me to attempt it. But in truth I had no inclination to [s]elf defence. My natural vivacity had for[s]aken me; and I li[s]tened without interrupting him to the fluency of reproachful language, which his resentment in[s]pired. He took a very [s]olemn and affectionate leave of my mamma; thanking her for her politene[s]s, and wi[s]hing her much future felicity. He attempted to addre[s]s me, I suppose [s]omewhat in the [s]ame way; but his sensibility overcome him; and he only took my hand, and bowing in [s]ilence, departed. The want of re[s]t for two long nights together, the exerci[s]e of mind, and con[s]lict of passions, which now tortured my brea[s]t, were too much for me to [s]upport! When I [s]aw that he was gone; that he had actually for[s]aken me, I fainted. My mamma, with the a[s][s]i[s]tance of the maid, [s]oon re[s]tored me. When I opened my eyes, and beheld this amiable and tender parent, watching and attending me with the mo[s]t anxious concern; without one reproachful word, without one accu[s]ing look, my reflections upon the part I had acted, in defeating her benevolent wi[s]hes, were [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-139.jpg) \- external link  - Page 136. ] exqui[s]itely afflictive! But we mutually forbore to mention the occa[s]ion of my illne[s]s; and I complied with her advice to take [s]ome refreshment, and retire to my chamber. I am [s]o much fatigued by the exertions of the day, that reft is ab[s]olutely nece[s][s]ary; and I lay a[s]ide my pen to [s]eek it. Friday Morning . When I [s]hall again receive the balmy influence of [s]leep, I know not. It has ab[s]olutely for[s]aken me at prefent. I have had a mo[s]t re[s]tle[s]s night. Every awakening idea pre[s]ented it[s]elf to my imagination; whether I had [s]u[s]tained a real lo[s]s in Mr. Boyer's departure; reflections on my own mi[s]conduct, with the cen[s]ure of my friends, and the ill-natured remarks of my enemies, excited the mo[s]t painful anxiety in my mind! I am going down, but how [s]hall I [s]ee my mamma? To her will I con[s]e[s]s my faults, in her maternal brea[s]t repo[s]e my cares, and by her friendly advice regulate my conduct. Had I done this before, I might have e[s]caped this trouble, and [s]aved both her and my[s]elf many di[s]tre[s][s]ing emotions! Friday Evening . I have had a long conversation with my mamma, which has greatly relieved my mind. She has [s]oothed me with the mo[s]t endearing tenderne[s]s. Mr. Atkins, with whom Mr. Boyer lodged, while in town, called here this afternoon. I did not [s]ee him, but he told my mamma that Mr. Boyer had returned home, and left a letter [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-140.jpg) \- external link  - Page 137. ] for me, which he had promi[s]ed to convey with his own hand. By this letter I am convinced that the dye is ab[s]olutely ca[s]t, with re[s]pect to him, and that no attempts on my part to bring about a reconciliation would be either prudent or [s]ucce[s]sful. He has penetrated the cau[s]e of my proceedings; and [s]uch is his resentment, that I am inclined not much to regret his avoiding another interview. My excu[s]es would be deemed utterly insufficient, and truth would not befriend and ju[s]tify me. As I know you are impatient to hear from me, I will now di[s]patch this long letter without any other addition, than that I am your [s]incere friend, Eliza Wharton . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-141.jpg) \- external link  - Page 138. ] - -  Hartford Well , Charles, the [s]how is over, as we yankees [s]ay; and the girl is my own. That is, if I will have her. I [s]hall take my own time for that, however. I have carried my point, and am amply revenged on the whole po[s][s]e of tho[s]e dear friends of her's. She was entangled by a promi[s]e (not to marry this prie[s]t without my knowledge,) which her con[s]cience would not let her break. Thank God, I have no con[s]cience. If I had, I believe it would make wretched work with me! I [s]uppo[s]e [s]he intended to have one, or the other of us; but preferred me. I have e[s]caped the noo[s]e, this time, and I'll be fairly hanged, if I ever get [s]o near it again. For indeed Charles, I was seriously alarmed. I watched all their motions; and the appearances of harmony between them awakened all my activity and zeal. So great was my in[s]atuation, that I verily believe I [s]hould have a[s]ked her in marriage, and ri[s]ked the consequences, rather than to have lo[s]t her! [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-142.jpg) \- external link  - Page 139. ] I went to the hou[s]e, while Mr. Boyer was in town, but her mamma re[s]u[s]ed to call her, or to acquaint her that I was there. I then wrote a de[s]pairing letter, and obtained a conference with her in the garden. This was a fortunate event for me. True, Eliza was very haughty, and re[s]olutely in[s]i[s]ted on immediate declaration or rejection. And I cannot [s]ay what would have been the re[s]ult, if Mr. Boyer had not surprized us together. He gave us a pretty har[s]h look and retired without [s]peaking a word. I endeavored to detain Eliza, but in vain. She left me on my knees, which are always ready to bend on [s]uch occa[s]ions. This [s]ini[s]hed the matter, it [s]eems. I ro[s]e, and went into a near neighbor's to ob[s]erve what happened; and in about half an hour [s]aw Mr. Boyer come out, and go to his lodgings. This, [s]aid I to my[s]elf, is a good omen. I went home, and was informed next day, that he had mounted his hor[s]e and departed. I heard nothing more of her till ye[s]terday, when I determined to know how [s]he [s]tood affected towards me. I therefore paid her a visit, her mamma being luckily abroad. She received me very placidly, and told me, on inquiry, that Mr. Boyer's re[s]entment at her meeting me in the garden was [s]o great, that he had bid her a final adieu. I congratulated myself on having no rival; hoped that her favor would now be unbia[s][s]ed, and that in due time I [s]hould reap the reward of my fidelity. She [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-143.jpg) \- external link  - Page 140. ] begged me not to mention the [s]ubject; [s]aid [s]he had been perplexed by our competition, and wi[s]hed not to hear any thing further about it at pre[s]ent. I bowed in obedience to her commands and changed the di[s]cour[s]e. I informed her, that I was about taking a tour to the [s]outhward; that I [s]hould be absent [s]everal months, and tru[s]ted that on my return her embarra[s][s]ments would be over. I left her with regret. After all, Charles, [s]he is the [s]ummum bonum of my life. I mu[s]t have her in [s]ome way or other. No body el[s]e [s]hall, I am re[s]olved. I am making preparations for my journey; which between you and me, is occa[s]ioned by the pro[s]pect of making a [s]peculation, by which I hope to mend my affairs. The voyage will at lea[s]t le[s][s]en my expen[s]es, and [s]creen me from the importunity of creditors till I can look about me. Peter Sanford .

The detail which my [s]i[s]ter gave me of your [s]eparation from Mr. Boyer was painful; as I had long contemplated a happy union between you. But [s]till more di[s]agreeable sensations po[s][s]e[s][s]ed my brea[s]t, when told that you had [s]uffered your lively [s]pirits to be depre[s][s]ed, and re[s]igned your[s]elf to [s]olitude and dejection! Why, my dear friend, [s]hould you allow this event thus to affect you? Heaven, I doubt not, has happine[s]s [s]till in [s]tore for you; perhaps greater than you could have enjoyed in that connection. If the convi[s]ction of any misconduct on your part, give you pain, di[s][s]ipate it by the reflection, that unerring rectitude is not the lot of mortals, that few are to be found who have not deviated in a greater or le[s]s degree from the maxims of prudence.

But I will not moralize. Come and [s]ee us; and we will talk over the matter once, and then di[s]mi[s]s it for ever. Do prevail on your mamma to part with you a month or two, at lea[s]t. I wi[s]h you to witne[s]s how well I manage my nur[s]ery bu[s]ine[s]s. You will be charmed with little Harriot. I am already enough of the mother to think her a miniature of beauty and perfection. How natural, and how ea[s]y the tran[s]ition from one [s]tage of life to another! Not long [s]ince I was a gay, volatile girl; [s]eeking satisfaction in fa[s]hionable circles and amu[s]ements; but now I am thoroughly dome[s]ticated. All my happine[s]s is centered within the limits of my own walls; and I grudge every moment that calls me from the plea[s]ing [s]cenes of domestic life. Not that I am [s]o [s]elfi[s]h as to exclude my friends from my affection or [s]ociety. I feel intere[s]ted in their concerns, and enjoy their company. I mu[s]t own, however, that conjugal and parental love are the main [s]prings of my life. The conduct of [s]ome mothers in depriving their helple[s]s offspring of the care and kindne[s]s which none but a mother can feel, is to me unaccountable. There are many namele[s]s attentions which nothing [s]hort of maternal tenderne[s]s, and [s]olicitude can pay; and for which the endearing [s]miles, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-146.jpg) \- external link  - Page 143. ] progressive improvements of the lovely babe are an ample reward. How delightful to trace from day to day the expan[s]ion of rea[s]on and the dawnings of intelligence! Oh, how I anticipate the time, when the[s]e faculties [s]hall be di[s]played by the organs of [s]peech; when the li[s]ping accent [s]hall heighten our pre[s]ent plea[s]ure, and the young idea be capable of direction "how to [s]hoot"! General Richman is not le[s]s intere[s]ted by the[s]e enjoyments than my[s]elf. All the father beams in his eye! All the hu[s]band reigns in his heart, and pervades his every action! Mi[s]s Lawrence is [s]oon to be married to Mr. Laiton. I believe he is a mere fortune-hunter. Indeed [s]he has little to recommend her to any other. Nature has not been very bountiful, either to her body, or mind. Her parents have been [s]hamefully deficient in her education; but have [s]ecured to her what they think the chief good; not con[s]idering that happine[s]s is by no means the invariable attendant of wealth. I hope this incoherent [s]croll will amu[s]e, while it induces you [s]peedily to favor us with another vi[s]it. My be[s]t wi[s]hes attend your honored mamma, while I [s]ub[s]cribe my[s]elf, &c. A.

The agitating [s]cenes, through which I have lately pa[s][s]ed, have broken my [s]pirits, and rendered me unfit for [s]ociety. Major Sanford has vi[s]ited me, and taken his leave. He is gone to the [s]outhward on a tour of two or three months. I declined any further conver[s]ation with him, on the [s]ubjct of love. At pre[s]ent, I wi[s]h not to hear it mentioned by any one. I have received a very friendly and consolatory letter from Mrs. Richman. She invites me to [s]pend a few months with her; which with my mamma's con[s]ent I [s]hall do. I hope the change of [s]ituation and company will di[s][s]ipate the gloom which hangs over my mind. It is a common ob[s]ervation, that we know not the value of a ble[s][s]ing but by deprivation. This is [s]trictly verified in my ca[s]e. I was in[s]en[s]ible of my regard for Mr. Boyer, till this fatal [s]eparation took place. His merit and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-148.jpg) \- external link  - Page 145. ] worth now appear in the brighte[s]t colors. I am convinced of that excellence which I once [s]lighted; and the [s]hade of departed happine[s]s haunts me perpetually! I am [s]ometimes tempted to write him, and confe[s]s my faults; to tell him the [s]ituation of my mind, and to offer him my hand. But he has precluded all hopes of [s]ucce[s]s, by the [s]everity of his letter to me. At any rate, I [s]hall do nothing of the kind, till my return from New-Haven. I am the more willing to leave home, as my affairs are made a town talk. My mamma per[s]uades me to di[s]regard it. But how can I ri[s]e [s]uperior to "The world's dread laugh, which [s]carce the firm philo[s]opher can [s]corn?" Pray remember me to Mr. Sumner. You are happy, my friend, in the love and e[s]teem of a worthy man; but more happy [s]till, in deferving them. Adieu. Eliza Wharton .

In the [s]ociety of my amiable friends at New-Haven, I enjoyed every thing that friend[s]hip could be[s]tow; but re[s]t to a di[s]turbed mind was not in their power. I was on various parties of plea[s]ure, and pa[s][s]ed through different [s]cenes of amu[s]ement; but with me they have lo[s]t their charms. I relished them not as formerly. Mrs. Richman advi[s]es me to write to Mr. Boyer, and I have concluded to act accordingly. If it an[s]wer no other purpo[s]e, it will be a relie[s] to my mind. If he ever felt for me the tenderne[s]s and regard which he pro[s]e[s][s]ed, methinks they cannot be entirely obliterated. If they [s]till remain, perhaps I may rekindle the gentle [s]lame, and we may both be happy. I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-150.jpg) \- external link  - Page 147. ] may at lea[s]t recal his e[s]teem, and that will be a [s]atisfaction to my con[s]cious mind. I wonder what has become of Major Sanford! Has he too for[s]aken me? Is it po[s][s]ible for him wilfully to neglect me? I will not entertain [s]o injurious a [s]u[s]picion. Yet, if it were the ca[s]e, it would not affect me like Mr. Boyer's di[s]affection; for I frankly own, that my fancy, and a ta[s]te for gaity of life, induced me to cheri[s]h the idea of a connection with Major Sanford; while Mr. Boyer's real merit has imprinted tho[s]e [s]entiments of e[s]teem and love in my heart, which time can never efface. In[s]tead of two, or three, more than twelve months have elap[s]ed, and I have not received a line from Major Sanford in all that time, which I fully expected, though he made no mention of writing; nor have I heard a [s]yllable about him, except a report circulated by his servants, that he is on the point of marrying, which I do not believe. No, it is impo[s][s]ible! I am per[s]uaded that his pa[s][s]ion for me, was [s]incere, however deceitful he may have been with others. But I will not be[s]tow an anxious thought upon him. My de[s]ign relative to Mr. Boyer, demands my whole attention. My hopes and fears alternately prevail, and my re[s]olution is extremely fluctuating. How It finally terminates you [s]hall hear in my next. Pray write to me [s]oon. I [s]tand in need of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-151.jpg) \- external link  - Page 148. ] the con[s]oling power of friend[s]hip. Nothing can beguile my pen[s]ive hours, and exhilerate my drooping [s]pirits, like your letters. Let me know how you are to be entertained this winter at the theatre. That, you know, is a favorite amu[s]ement of mine. You [s]ee I can [s]tep out of my[s]elf a little. Afford an a[s][s]i[s]ting hand, and perhaps I may again be fit for society. Eliza Wharton . - -  Hartford SIR, It is partly in compliance with your de[s]ire, in your la[s]t letter to me, in which you tell me, "that when I am convinced of the justice of your conduct, and become a convert to your advice, you [s]hall be happy to hear it;" and partly from a wi[s]h to inform you, that [s]uch is in truth my pre[s]ent [s]tate of mind, that I now write to you. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-152.jpg) \- external link  - Page 149. ] I cannot but hope that this letter coming from the hand which you once [s]ought, will not be unacceptable. Pope very ju[s]tly ob[s]erves, "that every year is a critic on the la[s]t." The truth of this observation is fully exeplified in my years! How [s]everely this condemns the follies of the preceding, my own heart alone can te[s]tify! I [s]hall not offer any palliation, or apology for my mi[s]conduct. You told me it admitted none. I frankly confe[s]s it; and if the mo[s]t humble acknowledgement of my offences, with an a[s][s]urance that they have co[s]t me the deepe[s]t repentance, can in any degree atone for them, I now make that atonement. Casting off the veil of di[s][s]imulation, I [s]hall write with frankne[s]s; believing you po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of more honor than to make any ungenerous u[s]e of the confidence repo[s]ed in you. To [s]ay that I ever e[s]teemed you, may, perhaps, appear paradoxical, when compared with certain circum[s]tances which occurred during our acquaintance; but to affert that I loved you, may be deemed [s]till more [s]o. Yet the[s]e are real facts, facts of which I was then sensible, and by which I am now more than ever affected. I think you formerly remarked, that ab[s]ence [s]erved but to heighten real love. This I find by experience. Need I blu[s]h to declare the[s]e [s]entiments, when occa[s]ion like this, calls for the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-153.jpg) \- external link  - Page 150. ] avowal? I will go even further, and offer you that heart which once you prized; that hand which you once [s]olicited. The [s]entiments of affection, which you then cultivated, though [s]uppre[s][s]ed, I flatter my[s]elf are not wholly obliterated. Suffer me then to rekindle the latent flame; to revive that friend[s]hip and tenderness, which I have [s]o fooli[s]hly neglected. The endeavor of my future life [s]hall be to reward your benevolence, and perhaps we may yet be happy together. But let not this offer of my[s]elf con[s]train you. Let not pity influence your conduct. I would have your return, if that plea[s]ing event take place, a voluntary act. Receive, or con[s]ent not to confer happine[s]s. I thought it a duty which I owed to you, and to my[s]elf, to make this expiation; this [s]acrifice of female re[s]erve, for the wrongs I have done you. As [s]uch I wi[s]h you to accept it; and if your affections are intirely alienated, or otherwi[s]e engaged; if you cannot again command the respect and love which I would recal, do not despise me for the conce[s][s]ions I have made. Think as favorably of my pa[s]t faults, and of my present di[s]po[s]ition, as charity will allow. Continue, if po[s][s]ible, to be my friend, though you cea[s]e to be my lover. Should this letter find you in the full possession of happine[s]s, let not the idea of your once loved Eliza, thus intruding it[s]elf again upon [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-154.jpg) \- external link  - Page 151. ] your thoughts, interrupt your enjoyments. May [s]ome di[s]tingui[s]hed female, as de[s]erving, as fair, partake with you of that bli[s]s which I have forfeited. Whatever may be my de[s]tiny, my be[s]t wishes [s]hall ever attend you, and a plea[s]ing remembrance of your honorable attentions pre[s]ide, till death, in the brea[s]t of Eliza Wharton . - -  Hampshire MADAM, As I was [s]itting la[s]t evening in my [s]tudy, a letter was handed me by a [s]ervant; upon which I no [s]ooner ca[s]t my eye, than I recognized, with [s]urpri[s]e, the hand and [s]eal of my once loved, but to me long lo[s]t Eliza! I opened it ha[s]tily, and with [s]till greater [s]urpri[s]e, read the contents! [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-155.jpg) \- external link  - Page 152. ] You write with frankne[s]s. I [s]hall an[s]wer in the [s]ame manner. On reviewing our former intercour[s]e, be assured, that I have not an accu[s]ing thought in my heart. The regard which I felt for you was tender and animated, but it was not of that pa[s][s]ionate kind which ends in death or de[s]pair. It was governed by rea[s]on, and had a nobler object in view, than mere [s]en[s]ual gratification. It was excited by the appearance of excellent qualities. Your conduct, at length, convinced me it was mi[s]placed, that you po[s][s]e[s][s]ed not, in reality, tho[s]e charms which I had fondly ascribed to you. They were incon[s]i[s]tent, I conceived, with that artifice and di[s][s]imulation, of which you [s]trove to render me the dupe. But thank heaven, the [s]nare was broken. My eyes were opened to di[s]cover your folly; and my heart, engaged, as it was, exerted re[s]olution and [s]trength to bur[s]t a[s]under the chain by which you held me en[s]laved, and to affert the rights of an injured man. The parting [s]cene, you remember. I reluctantly bade you adieu. I tore my[s]elf from you, determined to eradicate your idea from my brea[s]t! long and [s]evere was the [s]truggle. I at la[s]t vanqui[s]hed, as I thought, every tender pa[s][s]ion of my [s]oul, (for they all centered in you) and re[s]igned my[s]elf to my God, and my duty; devoting tho[s]e affections to friend[s]hip, which had been di[s]appointed in love. But they are [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-156.jpg) \- external link  - Page 153. ] again called into exerci[s]e. The virtuous, the amiable, the accompli[s]hed Maria Selby possesses my entire confidence and e[s]teem; and I tru[s]t I am not deceived, when I think her highly deserving of both. With her I expect [s]oon to be united in the mo[s]t [s]acred and endearing of human relations; with her to pa[s]s my future days in [s]erenity and peace. Your letter, therefore, came too late; were there no other ob[s]tacle to the renewal of our connection. I hope at the clo[s]e of life, when we take a retro[s]pect of the pa[s]t, that neither of us [s]hall have rea[s]on to regret our [s]eparation. Permit me to add, that for your own [s]ake, and for the [s]ake of your ever valued friends, I [s]incerely rejoice that your mind has regained its native [s]trength and beauty; that you have emerged from the [s]hade of fanciful vanity. For although to adopt your own phra[s]e, I cea[s]e to [s]tyle my[s]elf your lover, among the number of your friends, I am happy to be reckoned. As [s]uch, let me conjure you, by all that is dear and de[s]irable, both in this life, and another, to adhere, with undeviating exactne[s]s, to the path of rectitude and innocence; and to improve the noble talents, which heaven has liberally be[s]towed upon you, in rendering your[s]elf amiable, and u[s]eful to your friends. Thus will you [s]ecure your own, while you promote the happine[s]s of all around you.

I hope [s]oon to hear that your heart and hand are be[s]towed on [s]ome worthy man, who de[s]erves the happine[s]s you are formed to communicate. Whatever we may have called errors, will, on my part, be for ever buried in oblivion; and for your own peace of mind, I entreat you to forget that any idea of a connection between us ever exi[s]ted.

But what are now my pro[s]pects? what are to be the future enjoyments of my life? Oh that I had not written to Mr. Boyer! by confe[s][s]ing my faults, and by avowing my partiality to him, I have given him the power of triumphing in my di[s]tre[s]s; of returning to my tortured heart all the pangs of [s]lighted love! and what have I now to con[s]ole me? my bloom is decrea[s]ing; my health is [s]en[s]ibly impaired. Tho[s]e talents, with the po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of which I have been flattered, will be of little avail when unsupported by re[s]pectability of character! My mamma, who knows too well the distraction of my mind, endeavors to [s]ooth and compo[s]e me, on chri[s]tian principles; but they have not their de[s]ired effect. I dare not converse freely with her on the [s]ubject of my present unea[s]ine[s]s, le[s]t I [s]hould di[s]tre[s]s her.

A bleeding heart, [s]lighted love, and all the et ceteras of romance, enter into the compo[s]ition! Excu[s]e this raillery; and I will now write more [s]eriou[s]ly.

But I mu[s]t act the part of a [s]kilful [s]urgeon, and probe the wound, which I undertake to heal. Where, O Eliza Wharton! Where is that fund of [s]en[s]e, and [s]entiment which once animated your engaging form? Where that [s]trength of mind, that independence of [s]oul, that alacrity and [s]prightline[s]s of deportment, which formerly rai[s]ed you [s]uperior to every adver[s]e occurrence? Why have you re[s]igned the[s]e valuable endowments, and [s]uffered yourself to become the [s]port of contending pa[s][s]ions? You have now emerged from that mi[s]t of fanciful [s]olly, which, in a mea[s]ure ob[s]cured the brilliance of your youthful days. True, you figured among the fir[s]t rate coquettes; while your friends, who knew your accompli[s]hments, lamented the mi[s]application of them; but now they rejoice at the returning empire of rea[s]on. True, you have erred; mi[s]lead by the gaiety of your di[s]po[s]ition, and that volatility, and incon[s]ideration, which were incident to your years; but you have [s]een, and nobly confe[s][s]ed your errors. Why do you talk of [s]lighted love? True, Mr. Boyer, [s]uppo[s]ing you disregarded him, transferred his affections to another object; but have you not your admirers [s]till, among men of real merit? Are you not e[s]teemed, and care[s][s]ed by numbers, who know you capable of [s]hining in a di[s]tingui[s]hed [s]phere [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-162.jpg) \- external link  - Page 159. ] of life? Turn then, my friend, from the gloomy pro[s]pect, which your di[s]turbed imagination has brought into view. Let rea[s]on and religion erect their throne in your brea[s]t; obey their dictates and be happy. Pa[s]t experience will point out the quick[s]ands which you are to avoid in your future cour[s]e. Date then, from this, a new aera of life; and may every moment be attended with [s]elicity. Follow Mr. Boyer's advice, and forget all former connections. Julia accepts your invitation. Nothing [s]hort of your reque[s]t could induce me to part with her. She is a good girl; and her [s]ociety will amu[s]e and in[s]truct you. I am, &c. Lucy Sumner .

She is all that I once was; ea[s]y, [s]prightly, debonair. Already has [s]he done much towards relieving my mind. She endeavors to divert, and lead my thoughts into a different channel from that to which they are now prone. Yesterday, we had each an invitation to a ball. She labored hard to prevail on me to go; but I ob[s]tinately refu[s]ed. I cannot yet mix with gay and cheerful circles. I therefore alledged that I was indi[s]po[s]ed, and per[s]uaded her to go without me. The events of my life have always been unaccountably wayward. In many in[s]tances I have been ready to [s]uppo[s]e that [s]ome evil genius pre[s]ided over my actions, which has directed them contrary to the [s]ober dictates of my own judgment. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-164.jpg) \- external link  - Page 161. ] I am [s]ometimes tempted to adopt the sentiment expre[s][s]ed in the following lines of the poet, "To you, great gods, I make my la[s]t appeal; O, clear my con[s]cience, or my crimes reveal! If wand'ring through the paths of life I've run; And backward trod the [s]teps, I [s]ought to [s]hun, Impute my errors to your own decree; My feet were guilty, but my heart was free." I [s]uppo[s]e you will tell me, that the fate I accuse, through the poet, is only the re[s]ult of my own imprudence. Well, be it what it may; either the impul[s]e of my own pa[s][s]ions, or [s]ome higher efficiency; [s]ure I am, that I pay dear for its operation. I have heard it remarked, that experience is the preceptor of fools; but that the wi[s]e need not its in[s]truction. I believe I mu[s]t be content to rank accordingly, and endeavor to reap advantage from its tuition. Julia urges me to revi[s]it the [s]cenes of amusements and plea[s]ure; in which [s]he tells me, [s]he is actuated by [s]elfi[s]h motives. She wi[s]hes it for her own [s]ake. She likes neither to be [s]ecluded from them, nor to go alone. I am [s]ometimes half inclined to [s]eek, in fe[s]tive mirth, a refuge from thought and reflection. I would e[s]cape, if po[s][s]ible, from the idea of Mr. Boyer. This I have never been able to accompli[s]h, [s]ince he dropped a tear upon my hand, and left me. I marked the [s]pot with my eye; and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-165.jpg) \- external link  - Page 162. ] twenty times in a day, do I view it, and fondly imagine it [s]till there! How could I give him pain! I hope his happy Maria never will! I hope [s]he will reward that merit, which I have [s]lighted! but I forbear. This theme carries away my pen, if I but touch upon it. And no wonder; for it is the [s]ole exerci[s]e of my thoughts! Yet I will endeavor to divert them. Send me [s]ome new books; not [s]uch, however, as will require much attention. Let them be plays or novels, or any thing el[s]e, that will amu[s]e and extort a [s]mile. Julia and I have been rambling in the garden. She in[s]i[s]ted upon my going with her into the arbor, where I was [s]urpri[s]ed with Major Sanford. What a croud of painful ideas rushed upon my imagination! I believe [s]he repented her ra[s]hne[s]s. But no more of this. I mu[s]t lay a[s]ide my pen; for I can write nothing el[s]e! Eliza Wharton .

But I cannot de[s]cribe to you the [s]urpri[s]ing change, which [s]he has undergone. Her vivacity has entirely for[s]aken her; and [s]he has actually become, what [s]he once dreaded above all things, a reclu[s]e! She [s]lies from company, as eagerly as [s]he formerly [s]ought it! Her mamma is exceedingly di[s]tre[s][s]ed by the [s]ettled melancholy which appears in her darling child; but neither of us think it be[s]t to mention the [s]ubject to her. We endeavor to find means to amu[s]e her; and we flatter our[s]elves that the pro[s]pect of [s]ucce[s]s rather increa[s]es. It would add greatly to my happine[s]s, to contribute, in any degree, to re[s]tore her to her[s]elf, to her friends, and to [s]ociety. We are all invited to dine abroad to morrow; and to oblige me, [s]he has con[s]ented to go. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-167.jpg) \- external link  - Page 164. ] Pray madam, write to her often. Your letters may do much for her. She is [s]till feelingly alive to the power of friend[s]hip; and none can exerci[s]e it upon her to greater acceptance, or with more advantage than your[s]elf. Major Sanford's hou[s]e is undergoing a complete repair. The report is, that he is [s]oon to be married. Mi[s]s Wharton has heard, but does not believe it. I hope, for her [s]ake, it will prove true. For, at any rate, he is about returning; and from her mamma's account of his pa[s]t conduct towards Eliza, were he to return unconnected, he would probably renew his attentions; and though they might end in marriage, her happine[s]s would not be [s]ecured. She has too nice a [s]en[s]e of love and honor, to compound with his licentious principles. A man, who has been di[s][s]olute before marriage, will very [s]eldom be faithful afterwards. I went into Eliza's chamber the other day, and found her with a miniature picture in her hand. You pretend to be a phy[s]iognomi[s]t, Julia, [s]aid [s]he. What can you trace in that countenance? I gue[s][s]ed who[s]e it was; and looking wi[s]tfully at it, replied, I believe the original is an artful, de[s]igning man. He looks to me like a Che[s]terfieldian. Pray who is he? Major Sanford, [s]aid [s]he; and I am afraid you have hit his character exactly. Sure I am, that the appearance of tho[s]e traits in it has made my heart ache! She wept, as [s]he [s]poke it. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-168.jpg) \- external link  - Page 165. ] Poor girl! I wi[s]h he may never give you greater cau[s]e to weep! She is [s]trongly blind to the vices and imperfections of this man. Though naturally penetrating, he has [s]ome how or other, ca[s]t a deceptious mi[s]t over her imagination, with re[s]pect to him[s]elf. She prosesses neither to love, nor e[s]teem him; and owns that his ungenerous artifice mi[s]lead her in her treatment of Mr. Boyer. Yet [s]he has forgiven him, and thinks him a plea[s]ing companion! How prone to error is the human mind! How much lighter than the breath of zephyrs the operations of fancy! Strange then, it [s]hould ever preponderate over the weightier powers of the under[s]tanding! But I will not moralize. My bu[s]ine[s]s here is to di[s][s]ipate, not to collect ideas; and I mu[s]t regulate my[s]elf accordingly. I am endeavoring to prepare Eliza, by degrees, to accompany me to Bo[s]ton, the en[s]uing winter; but think it doubtful whether I [s]hall [s]ucceed. I [s]hall, however, return my[s]elf; till when, I am, &c. Julia Granby .

It in[s]pired me both with concern, and chagrin. With concern, le[s]t your dejection of mind [s]hould affect your health; and with chagrin at your apparent indulgence of melancholy. Indeed, my friend, your own happiness and honor, require you to di[s][s]ipate the cloud which hangs over your imagination. Ri[s]e then above it; and prove your[s]elf superior to the adver[s]e occurrences which have befallen you. It is by [s]urmounting difficulties, not by [s]inking under them, that we di[s]cover our fortitude. True courage con[s]i[s]ts not in flying from the [s]torms of life; but in braving and [s]teering through them with prudence.

It is the bane of a di[s]ordered mind; though of great utility to a healthy one. Your once favorite amu[s]ements court your attention. Refu[s]e not their [s]olicitations. I have contributed my mite, by [s]ending you a few books; [s]uch as you reque[s]ted. They are of the lighter kind of reading; yet perfectly cha[s]te; and if I mi[s]take not, well adapted to your ta[s]te. You wi[s]h to hear from our theatre. I believe it will be well [s]upplied with performers this winter. Come and [s]ee whether they can afford you any entertainment. La[s]t evening I attended a tragedy; but never will I attend another. I have not yet been able to era[s]e the gloom which it impre[s][s]ed upon my mind. It was Romeo and Juliet. Di[s]tre[s][s]ing enough to [s]en[s]ibility this! Are there not real woes (if not in our own families, at lea[s]t among our own friends, and neighbors) [s]ufficient to exerci[s]e our [s]ympathy and pity, without introducing fictitious ones into our very diver[s]ions? How can that be a diver[s]ion, which racks the [s]oul with grief, even though that grief be imaginary. The introduction of a funeral solemnity, upon the [s]tage, is [s]hocking indeed! Death is too [s]erious a matter to be [s]ported with! An opening grave cannot be a [s]ource of amu[s]ement to any con[s]iderate mind! The closing [s]cene of life can be no pa[s]time, when realized! it mu[s]t therefore awaken painful sensations, in the repre[s]entation! [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-171.jpg) \- external link  - Page 168. ] The circus is a place of fa[s]hionable re[s]ort of late, but not agreeable to me. I think it inconsistent with the delicacy of a lady, even to witne[s]s the indecorums, which are practi[s]ed there; e[s]pecially, when the performers of equestrian feats are of our own [s]ex. To [s]ee a woman depart [s]o far from the female character, as to a[s][s]ume the ma[s]culine habit and attitudes; and appear entirely indifferent, even to the externals of mode[s]ty, is truly di[s]gu[s]ting, and ought not to be countenanced by our attendance, much le[s]s by our approbation. But setting a[s]ide this circum[s]tance, I cannot conceive it to be a plea[s]ure to [s]it a whole evening, trembling with apprehen[s]ion, le[s]t the poor wight of a hor[s]eman, or juggler, or whatever he is to be called, [s]hould break his neck in contributing to our entertainment. With Mr. Bowen's mu[s]eum, I think you were much plea[s]ed. He has made a number of judicious additions to it, [s]ince you were here. It is a [s]ource of rational and refined amusement. Here the eye is gratified, the imagination charmed, and the under[s]tanding improved. It will bear frequent reviews without palling on the ta[s]te. It always affords something new; and for one, I am never a weary [s]pectator. Our other public, and private places of resort, are much as you left them.

Again, my Eliza, will we ramble together in tho[s]e retired [s]hades which friend[s]hip has rendered [s]o delightful to us. Adieu, my friend, till then. Be cheerful, and you will yet be happy. Lucy Sumner . - -  Hartford Gracious Heaven! What have I heard? Major Sanford is married! Yes, the ungrateful, the deceitful wretch, is married! He has for[s]worn, he has perjured, and given him[s]elf to another! That, you will [s]ay, is nothing [s]trange. It is characteri[s]tic of the man. It may be [s]o; but I could not be convinced of his per[s]idy till now! [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-173.jpg) \- external link  - Page 170. ] Perhaps it is all for the be[s]t. Perhaps, had he remained unconnected, he might [s]till have deceived me; but now I defy his arts! They tell me, he has married a woman of fortune. I [s]uppo[s]e he thinks, as I once did, that wealth can en[s]ure happine[s]s. I wi[s]h he may enjoy it. This event would not affect me at all, were it not for the depre[s][s]ion of [s]pirits which I feel, in con[s]equence of a previous di[s]appointment; [s]ince which, every thing of the kind agitates and overcomes me. I will not [s]ee him. If I do, I [s]hall betray my weakne[s]s, and flatter his vanity; as he will doubtle[s]s think he has the power of mortifying me by his connection with another. Before this news di[s]compo[s]ed me, I had attained to a good degree of cheerfulne[s]s. Your kind letter, [s]econded by Julia's exertions, had a[s][s]i[s]ted me in regulating my [s]en[s]ibility. I have been frequently into company, and find my relish for it gradually returning. I intend to accept the plea[s]ure to which you invite me, of [s]pending a little time with you, this winter. Julia and I will come together. Varying the [s]cene may contribute effectually to di[s][s]ipate the gloom of my imagination. I would fly to almo[s]t any re[s]ort, rather than my own mind. What a dreadful thing it is to be afraid of one's own reflections, which ought to be a con[s]tant [s]ource of enjoyment! But I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-174.jpg) \- external link  - Page 171. ] will not moralize. I am [s]ufficiently melancholy, without any additional cau[s]e to increase it! Eliza Wharton . - -  Hartford DEAR DEIGHTON, Who do you think is writing to you? Why, it is your old friend, metamorphosed into a married man! You [s]tare, and can hardly credit the a[s][s]ertion. I cannot realize it my[s]elf; yet, I a[s][s]ure you, Charles, it is ab[s]olutely true! Nece[s][s]ity, dire nece[s][s]ity, forced me into this dernier re[s]ort. I told you, [s]ome time ago, it would come to this. I [s]tood aloof, as long as po[s][s]ible; but in vain did I attempt to [s]hun the noo[s]e. I mu[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-175.jpg) \- external link  - Page 172. ] either fly to this re[s]ource; or give up all my [s]how, equipage, and plea[s]ure, and degenerate into a downright plodding money-catcher, for a [s]ub[s]i[s]tance. I cho[s]e the fir[s]t; and who would not? yet I feel [s]ome remor[s]e at taking the girl to wife, from no better motives. She is really too good for [s]uch an impo[s]ition. But [s]he mu[s]t blame her[s]elf, if [s]he [s]uffer hereafter; for [s]he was vi[s]ibly captivated by my external appearance; and wanted but very little solicitation to confer her[s]elf, and fortune on [s]o charming a fellow. Her parents oppo[s]ed her inclination, for a while, becau[s]e I was a stranger, and rather too gay for their ta[s]te. But [s]he had not been u[s]ed to contradiction, and could not bear it; and therefore they ventured not to cro[s]s her. So I bore off the prize; and a prize [s]he really is. Five thou[s]and pounds in po[s][s]e[s][s]ion, and more in rever[s]ion, if I do not forfeit it. This will compen[s]ate for [s]ome of my pa[s]t mi[s]takes, and [s]et matters right for the pre[s]ent. I think it doing much better than to have taken the little Laurence girl, I told you of, with half the [s]um. Be[s]ides, my Nancy is a hand[s]omer, and more agreeable per[s]on. But that is of little con[s]equence to me, you know. "Beauty [s]oon grows familiar to the lover." Were I a lover, it would be of no great avail. A lover I am; yet not of my wife. The dart which I received from Mi[s]s Wharton, [s]ticks fa[s]t in my heart; and I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-176.jpg) \- external link  - Page 173. ] a[s][s]ure you, I could hardly per[s]uade my[s]elf even to appear unfaithful to her. O, Eliza, accu[s]e me not of infidelity; for your image is my con[s]tant companion! A thou[s]and times have I cur[s]ed the unpropitious [s]tars, which withheld from her a fortune. That would have enabled me to marry her; and with her, even wedlock would have been [s]upportable. I am told, that [s]he is [s]till [s]ingle. Her sober lover never returned. Had he loved as I did, and do, he could not have been [s]o precipitate. But the[s]e [s]toic [s]ouls are good for nothing, that I know of, but "Fix'd like a plant, to one peculiar [s]pot, To draw nutrition, propagate, and rot." I want to [s]ee Eliza, and I mu[s]t [s]ee her; yet I dread an interview. I [s]hall frankly confe[s]s my motives for marrying; and the rea[s]ons of my conduct, before I went away. I [s]hall own that my circum[s]tances would not allow me to po[s][s]e[s]s her; and yet that I could not re[s]ign her to another. When I make up the matter with her, I [s]hall [s]olicit her friend[s]hip for my wife. By this mean I may enjoy her [s]ociety, at lea[s]t, which will alleviate the con[s]inement of a married [s]tate. To my [s]pou[s]e I mu[s]t be as civil as po[s][s]ible. I really wi[s]h [s]he had le[s]s merit, that I might have a plau[s]ible excu[s]e for neglecting her. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-177.jpg) \- external link  - Page 174. ] Tomorrow I [s]hall go to Mrs. Wharton's. I am very much taken up with complimental vi[s]its, at pre[s]ent. What deference is always paid to equipage! They may talk of this virtue, their learning, and what not; but without either of them, I [s]hall bear off the palm of re[s]pect from tho[s]e, who have them, unadorned with gold, and its [s]hining appendages. Every thing hereabouts recals Eliza to my mind. I impatiently anticipate the hour, which will convey me to her pre[s]ence. Peter Sanford .

My mamma, Mi[s]s Granby, and my[s]elf, were [s]itting together in the chamber. Mi[s]s Granby was entertaining us by reading aloud in Millot's elements of hi[s]tory, when a [s]ervant rapped at the door, and handed in the following billet. "Will Mi[s]s Wharton conde[s]cend to converse a few moments with her once favored Sanford? He is but too [s]en[s]ible that he has forfeited all claim to the privilege. He therefore pre[s]umes not to reque[s]t it on the [s]core of merit, or of former acquaintance; but solicits it from her benevolence, and pity." I read and [s]howed it to my mamma, and Julia. What, [s]aid I, [s]hall I do? I wi[s]h not to [s]ee him. His artifice has de[s]troyed my peace [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-179.jpg) \- external link  - Page 176. ] of mind; and his prefence may open the wounds which time is clo[s]ing. Act, [s]aid my mamma, agreeably to the dictates of your own judgment. I [s]ee no harm in conver[s]ing with him, [s]aid Julia. Perhaps it may remove [s]ome di[s]agreeable thoughts, which now oppre[s]s and give you pain. And as he is no longer a candidate for your affections, added [s]he, with a [s]mile, it will be le[s]s hazardous than formerly. He will not have the in[s]olence to [s]peak; nor you the folly to hear, the language of love. He was accordingly invited in. When I ro[s]e to go down, I he[s][s]itated, and even trembled. I fear, [s]aid I, to my[s]elf, it will be too much for me; yet why [s]hould it? Con[s]cious innocence will [s]upport me. This he has not. When I entered the room he [s]tepped forward to meet me. Confu[s]ion and [s]hame were visibly depicted in his countenance. He approached me ha[s]tily; and without uttering a word, took my hand. I withdrew it. O! Mi[s]s Wharton, [s]aid he, de[s]pi[s]e me not. I am convinced that I de[s]erve your di[s]plea[s]ure, and disdain; but my own heart has avenged your cau[s]e. To your own heart, then, [s]aid I, I will leave you! But why do you again [s]eek an interview with one whom you have endeavored to mi[s]lead; with one whom you have treated with unmerited neglect? Ju[s]tice to my[s]elf required my appearing before you; that by confessing my faults, and obtaining your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-180.jpg) \- external link  - Page 177. ] forgiveness, I might [s]often the reproaches of my own mind. Will you be [s]eated, [s]ir? [s]aid I. Will you, rejoined he, conde[s]cend to [s]it with me, Eliza? I will, [s]ir, an[s]wered I. The rights of hospitality I [s]hall not infringe. In my own hou[s]e, therefore, I [s]hall treat you with civility. Indeed, [s]aid he, you are very [s]evere; but I have provoked all the coldne[s]s and re[s]erve which you can inflict! I am a married man, Eliza. So I understand, [s]aid I; and I hope you will never treat your wife with that di[s][s]imulation and fal[s]hood, which you have exerci[s]ed towards me. Would to heaven, exclaimed he, that you were my wife! I [s]hould not then fail in my love or duty as a hu[s]band! Yet [s]he is an amiable girl; and, had I a heart to give her, I might [s]till be happy! but that, alas! I can never recal. Why, then, [s]aid I, did you marry her? You were doubtle[s]s ma[s]ter of your own actions. No, [s]aid he, I was not. The embarra[s][s]ed [s]tate of my affairs precluded the po[s][s]ibility of acting as I wi[s]hed. Loving you mo[s]t ardently, I was anxious to prevent your union with another, till I could [s]o far improve my circum[s]tances, as to [s]ecure you from poverty and want in a connection with me. My regard was too sincere to permit me to deceive you, by a marriage which might have proved unhappy for us both. My pride forbad my telling you the motives of my delay; and I left you to [s]ee if [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-181.jpg) \- external link  - Page 178. ] I could place my[s]elf in a [s]ituation worthy of your acceptance. This I could not effect; and therefore have run the ri[s]k of my future happiness, by marrying a lady of affluence. This [s]ecures to me the externals of enjoyment; but my heart, I fear, will never participate it. Yet it affords me [s]ome degree of [s]atisfaction that I have not involved you in di[s]tre[s]s. The only alleviation of which my bani[s]hment from you is capable, is your forgivene[s]s. In compa[s][s]ion, then, refu[s]e it not! It cannot injure you! To me it will be worth millions! He wept! Yes, Lucy, this libertine; this man of plea[s]ure and gallantry wept! I really pitied him from my heart. I forgive you, [s]aid I and wi[s]h you happy; yet, on this condition only, that you never again pollute my ears with the recital of your infamous pa[s][s]ion. Yes, infamous, I call it, for what [s]ofter appellation can be given to [s]uch profe[s][s]ions from a married man? Harbor not an idea of me, in future, incon[s]i[s]tent with the love and fidelity which you owe your wife; much le[s]s, pre[s]ume to mention it, if you wi[s]h not to be dete[s]ted by me; and for ever bani[s]hed from my pre[s]ence. He expre[s][s]ed gratitude for his ab[s]olution even upon the[s]e terms; and hoped his future conduct would entitle him to my friend[s]hip and e[s]teem. That, I replied, time only can determine. One favor more he begged leave to [s]olicit; which was, that I would be a neighbor to his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-182.jpg) \- external link  - Page 179. ] wife. She was a [s]tranger, he [s]aid, and would deem my [s]ociety a particular privilege. This, I told him, I could not grant, at pre[s]ent, whatever I might do hereafter. He did not urge it any further, but inquired after my mamma, and expre[s][s]ed a wi[s]h to [s]ee her. I rung the bell, and ordered her and Mi[s]s Granby to be called. When they came, he was very polite to them both; and, after u[s]ual compliments, told my mamma that he was happy in having obtained my forgivene[s]s, to which he was anxious to have her [s]eal affixed. My daughter, [s]aid [s]he, is the injured party; and if [s]he be [s]atisfied, I [s]hall not complain. He thanked her for her conde[s]cention; informed her that he was married, and reque[s]ted her to vi[s]it his wife. We then conver[s]ed upon different [s]ubjects for a [s]hort time, and he took his leave. A [s]igh e[s]caped him as he departed; and a gloom was vi[s]ible in his countenance, which I never observed before. I mu[s]t acknowledge that this interview has given me [s]atisfaction. I have often told you that if I married Major Sanford, it would be from a predilecton for his [s]ituation in life. How wretched mu[s]t have been my lot, had I di[s]covered, too late, that he was by no mean, po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of the independence, which I fondly anticipated. I knew nor my own heart, when I contemplated a connection with him. Little did I think that my regard for Mr. Boyer was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-183.jpg) \- external link  - Page 180. ] [s]o deeply rooted, as I now find it. I fooli[s]hly imagined that I could turn my affections into what channel I plea[s]ed. What then mu[s]t have been my feelings, when I found my[s]elf deprived both of inward peace, and outward enjoyment! I begin now to emerge from the darkne[s]s, in which I have been long benighted! I hope the tragic comedy, in which I have acted [s]o con[s]picuous a part, will come to a happy end. Julia and I talk, now and then, of a journey to Bo[s]ton. As yet I have not re[s]olution to act with much deci[s]ion upon the [s]ubject. But, wherever I am, and whatever may be my fate, I [s]hall always be your's in truth, Eliza Wharton .

Major Sanford has returned; has made us a vi[s]it; and a treaty of peace, and amity (but not of commerce,) is ratified. Eliza appears to be rapidly returning to her former cheerfulne[s]s, if not gaity. I hope [s]he will not diverge too far from her pre[s]ent sedateness and [s]olidity; yet I am not without apprehensions of danger, on that [s]core. One extreme commonly [s]ucceeds another. She tells me, that [s]he a[s][s]iduou[s]ly cultivates her natural vivacity; that [s]he finds her ta[s]te for company and amu[s]ements increa[s]ing; that [s]he dreads being alone, becau[s]e pa[s]t [s]cenes ari[s]e to view which vex and di[s]compo[s]e her. The[s]e are indications of a mind not perfectly right. I flatter my[s]elf, however, that the time is not far di[s]tant, when her pa[s][s]ions will vibrate with regularity. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-185.jpg) \- external link  - Page 182. ] I need not repeat to you any thing relative to Major Sanford's conciliatory vi[s]it. Eliza has given you a particular, and I believe, a faithful detail. I was called down to [s]ee this wonderful man; and di[s]liked him exceedingly. I am a[s]toni[s]hed that Eliza's penetrating eye, has not long [s]ince read his vices in his very countenance. I am told by a friend, who has vi[s]ited them, that he has an agreeable wife; and I wi[s]h [s]he may find him a hu[s]band of the [s]ame de[s]cription; but I very much doubt the accompli[s]hment of my wi[s]h. For I have no charity for the[s]e reformed rakes. We were walking abroad the other afternoon, and met Major Sanford and lady. Eliza did not [s]ee them till they were very near us. She [s]tarted, turned pale, and then colored like crim[s]on. I cannot but think, a little envy rankled in her heart. Major Sanford very politely acco[s]ted us; and congratulated Mrs. Sanford on this opportunity of introducing her to a particular friend; pre[s]enting Eliza. She received her with an ea[s]y dignity, and bid her welcome to this part of the country. Mrs. Sanford an[s]wered her mode[s]tly; hoped for the plea[s]ure of a further acquaintance; and urged us, as we were not far from their hou[s]e, to return with them to tea. We declined; and, wi[s]hing each other a good evening, parted. Major Sanford's eyes were rivetted on Eliza, the whole time we were together; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-186.jpg) \- external link  - Page 183. ] and he [s]eemed loath to remove them, when we [s]eparated. I [s]u[s]pect there is [s]ome truth in his tale of love. I [s]hall therefore di[s]courage Eliza from a[s][s]ociating with him under any pretext whatever. She appeared more pensive and thoughtful than common, as we returned home; and [s]aid little the re[s]t of the evening; but next morning was as chatty as ever. She is warm in the prai[s]es of Mrs. Sanford, thinks her an accompli[s]hed woman, and wonders that the major could [s]ugge[s]t an idea of marrying her for her money. She intends, [s]he [s]ays, to vi[s]it her [s]oon; and wi[s]hes me to accompany her. This, for her own [s]ake, I [s]hall defer, as long as po[s][s]ible. I am, &c. Julia Granby . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-187.jpg) \- external link  - Page 184. ] - -  Hartford By Julia's advice, we have neglected the repeated invitations of Major Sanford, to vi[s]it and commence neighborhood with them, till ye[s]terday; when we received a polite billet, reque[s]ting the honor of our company to dine. My mamma declined going; but [s]aid [s]he had no objection to our compliance with the me[s][s]age, if we thought proper. Julia and I accordingly went. We found a large company a[s][s]embled in a [s]pacious hall, splendidly furni[s]hed and decorated. They were all very polite and attentive to me; but none more [s]o than Major Sanford and his lady, who jointly [s]trove to di[s][s]ipate the pen[s]ivene[s]s of my mind, which I found it impo[s][s]ible to conceal. When we were [s]ummoned to dinner, the major being near me, offered his hand, and leading me into the dining room, [s]eated me at a table furni[s]hed with all the variety which could plea[s]e the eye, or regale the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-188.jpg) \- external link  - Page 185. ] ta[s]te of the mo[s]t luxurious epicure. The conver[s]ation turned on various [s]ubjects, literary, political, and mi[s]cellaneous. In the evening we had a ball. Major Sanford gave the hand of his wife to a Mr. Grey, alledging that he was a [s]tranger, and therefore, entitled to particular attention; and then [s]olicited mine for him[s]elf. I was on the point of refu[s]ing him, but recollecting that it might have the appearance of continued re[s]entment, contrary to my declaration of forgiving what was pa[s]t, I complied. He was all kindne[s]s, and a[s][s]iduity; the more [s]o, I imagine, with a view to make amends for his former ingratitude and neglect. Tenderne[s]s is now peculiarly [s]oothing to my wounded heart. He took an opportunity of conver[s]ing with his wife and me together; hoped [s]he would be honored with my friend[s]hip, and acquaintance; and begged, for her [s]ake, that I would not be a [s]tranger at his hou[s]e. His Nancy, he [s]aid, was far removed from her maternal friends; but I could [s]upply their place, if I would generously undertake the ta[s]k. She joined in expressing the [s]ame [s]entiments and wi[s]hes. Alas! Sir, [s]aid I, Eliza Wharton is not now what [s]he once was! I labor under a depre[s][s]ion of [s]pirits, which mu[s]t render my company rather painful than plea[s]ing to my friends. The idea of what I had been, contra[s]ted with what I then was, touched my [s]en[s]ibility; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-189.jpg) \- external link  - Page 186. ] and I could not re[s]train the too officious tear from [s]tealing down my cheek. He took me by the hand, and [s]aid, you di[s]tre[s]s me, Mi[s]s Wharton, indeed, you di[s]tre[s]s me! Happine[s]s mu[s]t, and [s]hall attend you! Cur[s]ed be the wretch, who could wound a heart like your's! Julia Granby now joined us. An inquisitive concern was vi[s]ible in her countenance. I related this conver[s]ation to her, after we returned home; but [s]he approved it not. She thought Major Sanford too particularly attentive to me, con[s]idering what had previously happened. She [s]aid it would be noticed by others, and the world would make unfavorable remarks upon any appearance of intimacy between us. I care not for that, [s]aid I. It is an ill-natured, misjudging world; and I am not obliged to [s]acrifice my friends to its opinion. Were Major Sanford a [s]ingle man I [s]hould avoid his [s]ociety; but [s]ince he is married; [s]ince his wife is young, beautiful and lovely, he can have no temptation to injure me. I therefore [s]ee no evil, which can ari[s]e from the cultivation of friend[s]hip with her , at lea[s]t. I reli[s]h company [s]o little, that I may [s]urely be indulged in [s]electing that which is mo[s]t agreeable to my ta[s]te, to prevent my becoming quite a mi[s]anthrope. I thank you, my dear Mrs. Sumner, for your kind letter. It was a [s]ea[s]onable cordial to my mind; and I will endeavor to profit by your advice. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-190.jpg) \- external link  - Page 187. ] Your remarks on the public entertainments are amu[s]ing, and as far as I am a judge, perfectly ju[s]t. I think it a pity they have not female managers for the theatre. I believe it would be under much better regulations, than at present. With cordial re[s]pects to Mr. Sumner, I subscribe my[s]elf, yours in [s]incerity, Eliza Wharton .

No devotee could have been more sincere in his penitence, than I was in mine. Indeed, Charles, I never knew I had [s]o much [s]en[s]ibility before! Why, I was as much a woman as the very weake[s]t of the [s]ex! But I dealt very plainly and [s]incerely with her, to be [s]ure; and this atones for all pa[s]t offences, and procures ab[s]olution for many others yet to be committed. The dear girl was not inexorable; [s]he was as placable and conde[s]cending as I could expect, con[s]idering the nature of the crime, which was apparently [s]lighting her per[s]on and charms, by marrying another. This you know is one of the nice[s]t points with the ladies. Attack their honor, that is their chastity, and they con[s]true it to be the effect [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-192.jpg) \- external link  - Page 189. ] of exce[s][s]ive love, which hurries you a little beyond the bounds of prudence. But touch their vanity, by preferring another, and they will [s]eldom pardon you. You will [s]ay I am very [s]evere upon the [s]ex. And have I not rea[s]on to be [s]o, [s]ince I have found [s]o many frail ones among them. This, however, is departing from my [s]ubject. Eliza is extremely altered! Her pale dejected countenance, with the [s]edatene[s]s of her manners, [s]o different from the lively glow of health, cheerfulne[s]s and activity, which formerly animated her appearance and deportment, [s]truck me very di[s]agreeably. With all my gallantry, and fluency in love matters, I was unable to acquit my[s]elf tolerably; or to addre[s]s her with any degree of ea[s]e and confidence. She was very calm; and [s]poke with great indifference about my marriage, &c. which mortified me exceedingly. Yet I cannot con[s]ent to believe that her pre[s]ent depre[s][s]ion of [s]pirits ari[s]es [s]olely from Mr. Boyer's infidelity. I [s]latter my[s]elf that I am of [s]ufficient con[s]equence to her, to have contributed in a degree. When I inquired after her health, [s]he told me [s]he had been indi[s]po[s]ed; but was now much better. This indi[s]po[s]ition, I am informed, was purely mental; and I am happy to ob[s]erve her recovering from it. I frequently vi[s]it her, [s]ometimes with, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-193.jpg) \- external link  - Page 190. ] sometimes without my wife; of whom, through my mediation, [s]he has become a favorite. I have married, and according to the general opinion, reformed. Yet I [s]u[s]pect my reformation, like mo[s]t others of the kind, will prove in[s]table as "the ba[s]ele[s]s fabric of a vision;" unle[s]s I bani[s]h my[s]elf entirely from her [s]ociety. But that I can never do; for [s]he is [s]till lovely in my eyes, and I cannot control my pa[s][s]ions. When ab[s]ent from her, I am lo[s]t to every thing but her idea. My wife begins to rally me on my fondne[s]s for Mi[s]s Wharton. She a[s]ked me the other day if [s]he had a fortune? No, [s]aid I, if [s]he had I [s]hould have married her. This wounded her sensibility. I repented of my [s]incerity, and made my peace for that time. Yet, I find my[s]elf growing extremely irritable, and [s]he mu[s]t take heed how [s]he provokes me; for I do not love her; and I think the name of wife becomes more and more di[s]ta[s]teful to me every day. In my mind Eliza has no competitor. But I mu[s]t keep up appearances, though I endeavor to regain her love. I imagine that the enjoyment of her [s]ociety, as a neighbor and friend may content me for the pre[s]ent, and render my condition [s]upportable. Farewell, Charles. I hope you will never be embarra[s][s]ed with a wife, nor lack [s]ome favorite nymph to [s]upply the place of one. Peter Sanford .

I find it painful even to think of mixing again with the gay multitude. I believe the melancholy reflections, by which I am oppre[s][s]ed, will be more effectually, if not more ea[s]ily [s]urraounted, by tarrying where they are rendered familiar, than by going from them awhile, and then returning. Julia will therefore go without me. I envy her no enjoyment there, except your company. The [s]ub[s]titution of friend[s]hip in the place of love for Major Sanford, I find productive of agreeable [s]en[s]ations. With him, he a[s][s]ures me, it is a far more calm, and rational pleasure. He treats me with the affection and tenderness of a brother; and his wife , who exceeds him in pro[s]e[s][s]ions of regard, with all the con[s]oling [s]oftne[s]s, and attention of a [s]i[s]ter. Indeed, their politene[s]s has greatly contributed [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-195.jpg) \- external link  - Page 192. ] to revive the cheerfulne[s]s of my natural disposition. I believe the major's former partiality to me, as a lover, is intirely obliterated; and for my part, I feel as little re[s]traint in his company, and his lady's, as in that of any other in the neighborhood. I very much regret the departure of Julia; and hope you will permit her to return to me again, as [s]oon as po[s][s]ible. She is a valuable friend. Her mind is well cultivated; and [s]he has trea[s]ured up a fund of knowledge and information, which renders her company both agreeable and u[s]eful in every [s]ituation of life. We lately [s]pent the afternoon and evening at Mr. Smith's. They had a considerable number of vi[s]itants; and among the re[s]t, Major Sanford. His wife was expected, but did not come, being indi[s]po[s]ed. I believe, my friend, you mu[s]t excu[s]e me if my letters are [s]horter than formerly. Writing is not [s]o agreeable to me as it u[s]ed to be. I love my friends as well as ever; but I think they mu[s]t be weary of the gloom and dulne[s]s which pervades my pre[s]ent correspondence. When my pen [s]hall have regained its original fluency and alertne[s]s, I will re[s]ume and prolong the plea[s]ing ta[s]k. I am, my dear Lucy, your's mo[s]t affectionately, Eliza Wharton . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-196.jpg) \- external link  - Page 193. ] - -  Hartford DEAR MADAM, Agreeably to your de[s]ire, every art has been tried, every allurement held out, every argument u[s]ed, and every plan adopted which Mrs. Wharton and I could devi[s]e to induce Eliza to accompany me to Bo[s]ton; but all in vain. Sometimes [s]he has been almo[s]t persuaded to a compliance with our united reque[s]t; but [s]oon has re[s]olutely determined again[s]t it. I have ob[s]erved her [s]entiments to be suddenly changed after being in company with Major Sanford. This alarms us exceedingly. Indeed the major [s]eems to have in[s]inuated him[s]elf into her good opinion more than ever. She is flattered into the belief that his attention to her is purely the re[s]ult of friend[s]hip and benevolence. I have not [s]o favorable an opinion of the man, as to [s]uppo[s]e him capable of either. He [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-197.jpg) \- external link  - Page 194. ] has become very familiar here. He calls in almost every day. Sometimes he but ju[s]t inquires after our health; and [s]ometimes makes long vi[s]its. The latter is his invariable practice, when he finds Eliza alone. Mrs. Wharton always avoids [s]eeing him if [s]he can. She dreads, [s]he [s]ays, his approaching the hou[s]e. I entered the parlor the other day, somewhat [s]uddenly, and found him [s]itting very near Eliza, in a low conver[s]ation. They both ro[s]e in apparent confu[s]ion, and he [s]oon retired. When he was gone; I [s]u[s]pect, [s]aid I, that the major was whi[s]pering a tale of love, Eliza? Do you imagine, [s]aid [s]he, that I would li[s]ten to [s]uch a theme from a married man? I hope not, [s]aid I; but his conduct towards you indicates a revival of his former sentiments, at lea[s]t. I was not aware of that, [s]aid [s]he. As yet I have ob[s]erved nothing in his behavior to me, incon[s]i[s]tent with the pure[s]t friend[s]hip. We drank tea not long [s]ince at Mr. Smith's. Late in the afternoon, Major Sanford made his appearance to apologize, as he [s]aid, for Mrs. Sanford, who was indi[s]po[s]ed, and could not enjoy the plea[s]ure of the vi[s]it [s]he had contemplated. He was very gay, the whole evening; and when the company [s]eparated, he was the fir[s]t to pre[s]ent his arm to Eliza, who [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-198.jpg) \- external link  - Page 195. ] accepted it without he[s]itation. A Mr. Newhall attended me, and we endeavored to keep them company; but they evidently cho[s]e to walk by them[s]elves. Mr. Newhall ob[s]erved, that if Major Sanford were not married, he [s]hould [s]u[s]pect he [s]till intended a union with Mi[s]s Wharton. I replied, that their former intercour[s]e having terminated in friend[s]hip, rendered them more familiar with each other, than with the generality of their acquaintance. When we reached the hou[s]e, Mr. Newhall cho[s]e not to go in, and took his leave. I waited at the door for Eliza and Major Sanford. At [s]ome little di[s]tance I [s]aw him pre[s]s her hand to his lips. It vexed me exceedingly; and no [s]ooner had they come up, than I [s]ullenly bade him good night, and walked directly in. Eliza [s]oon followed me. I [s]at down by the fire in a thoughtful po[s]ture. She did the [s]ame. In this [s]ituation we both remained for [s]ome time, without [s]peaking a word. At length [s]he [s]aid, you [s]eem not to have enjoyed your walk, Mi[s]s Granby; did you not like your gallant? Yes, [s]aid I, very well; but I am mortified that you were not better provided for. I make no complaint, rejoined [s]he; I was very well entertained. That is what di[s]plea[s]es me, [s]aid I; I mean your vi[s]ible fondne[s]s for the [s]ociety of [s]uch a man. Were you aver[s]e to it, as you ought to be, there would be no danger. But he has an alluring [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-199.jpg) \- external link  - Page 196. ] tongue, and a treacherous heart. How can you be plea[s]ed and entertained by his conversation? to me it appears totally repugnant to that re[s]inement and delicacy for which you have always been e[s]teemed. His a[s][s]iduity, and obtru[s]ion ought to alarm you. You well know what his character has been. Marriage has not changed his disposition. It is only a cloak which conceals it. Tru[s]t him not then, my dear Eliza! If you do, depend upon it, you will find his professions of friend[s]hip to be mere hypocricy, and deceit! I fear that he is acting over again the [s]ame unworthy arts, which formerly mi[s]lead you. Beware of his wiles! Your friends are anxious for you. They tremble at your prosessed regard, and apparent intimacy with that unprincipled man. My friends, [s]aid [s]he, are very jealous of me, lately. I know not how I have forfeited their confidence, or incurred their [s]u[s]picion. By encouraging that attention, I warmly replied, and receiving tho[s]e care[s][s]es from a married man, which are due from him to none but his wife! He is a villian, if he deceived her into marriage by in[s]incere profe[s][s]ions of love. If he had then an affection for her, and has already di[s]carded it, he is equally guilty! Can you expect [s]incerity from the man, who withholds it from an amiable, and de[s]erving wife? no, Eliza; it is not love, which induces him to entertain you with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-200.jpg) \- external link  - Page 197. ] the [s]ubject! It is a ba[s]er pa[s][s]ion; and if you di[s]dain not his artifice; if you li[s]ten to his flattery, you will, I fear, fall a victim to his evil machinations! If he conducted like a man of honor, he would merit your e[s]teem; but his behavior is quite the rever[s]e! Yet vile as he is, he would not dare to li[s]p his in[s]olent hopes of your regard, if you puni[s]hed his presumption with the indignation it de[s]erves; if you [s]purned from your pre[s]ence the ungrateful wretch, who would requite your condescension by triumphing in your ruin! She now bur[s]t into tears, and begged me to drop the [s]ubject. Her mind, [s]he [s]aid, was racked by her own reflections. She could bear but little. Kindne[s]s deceived, and censure di[s]tre[s][s]ed her! I a[s][s]ured her of my good intentions; that as I [s]aw her danger, I thought it a duty of the friend[s]hip and affection I bore her, [s]olemnly to warn her again[s]t it before we parted. We talked over the matter more calmly, till [s]he profe[s][s]ed her[s]elf re[s]olved in future to avoid his company, and reject his in[s]inuations. The next day, as I walked out, I met Major Sanford. He acco[s]ted me very civilly. I barely bid him good morning, and pa[s][s]ed on. I made it in my way to call at his hou[s]e, and bid Mrs. Sanford adieu; not expecting another opportunity equally favorable. When [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-201.jpg) \- external link  - Page 198. ] I entered the parlor, [s]he was playing a melancholy air on the harp[s]icord. She ro[s]e, and gave me a polite and graceful reception. I told her, as I was [s]oon to leave town, I called to take my leave of her; a compliment, which her attention to me required. Are you going to leave us then, Mi[s]s Granby? [s]aid [s]he. I [s]hall regret your departure exceedingly. I have [s]o few friends in this part of the country, that it will give me [s]en[s]ible pain to part with one I [s]o highly value. I told her in the cour[s]e of conver[s]ation, that I expected the plea[s]ure of [s]eeing her yesterday at Mr. Smith's; and was very [s]orry for the indi[s]po[s]ition, which prevented her favoring us with her company. Indeed, [s]aid [s]he, I did not know I was expected there! Were you there pray? Yes, [s]aid I; and Major Sanford excu[s]ed your not coming, on the account I have mentioned. Well, [s]aid [s]he, this is the fir[s]t word I ever heard about it; he told me that bu[s]ine[s]s led him abroad! Did he gallant any lady? O, [s]aid I, he was with us all together. We had no particular gallants. Seeing her curio[s]ity excited, I heartily repented [s]aying any thing of the matter, and waved the [s]ubject. Little did I [s]u[s]pect him to have been guilty of [s]o ba[s]e an artifice! It was evidently contrived to faciliate an interview with Eliza. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-202.jpg) \- external link  - Page 199. ] When I returned I related this affair to Mrs. Wharton and her daughter. The old lady and I expatiated largely on the vilene[s]s of this conduct; and endeavored to expo[s]e it to Eliza's view in its true colors. She pretended not to ju[s]tify it. Yet [s]he looked as if [s]he wi[s]hed it in her power. I am now preparing for my journey to Boston; which I mu[s]t however de[s]er another week, for the [s]ake of a more agreeable pa[s][s]age in the [s]tage. I regret leaving Eliza! I tremble at her danger! She has not the re[s]olution to re[s]i[s]t temptation, which [s]he once po[s][s]e[s][s]ed. Her mind is [s]urpri[s]ingly weakened! She appears [s]en[s]ible of this; yet adds to it by yielding to her own imbecility. You will receive a letter from her with this; though I had much difficulty to per[s]uade her to write. She has unfortunately become very aver[s]e to this, her once favorite amu[s]ement. As I [s]hall [s]oon have the plea[s]ure of conversing with you per[s]onally, I conclude without any other addition to this [s]croll, than the name of your obliged Julia Granby . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-203.jpg) \- external link  - Page 200. ] - -  Boston MY DEAR FRIEND, I have received your letters, and mu[s]t own to you that the peru[s]al of them gave me pain. Pardon my [s]u[s]picions, Eliza: they are excited by real friend[s]hip. Julia, you [s]ay, approves not Major Sandford's particular attention to you. Neither do I. If you recollect, and examine his conver[s]ation in his conciliatory vi[s]it, you will find it replete with sentiments, for the avowal of which, he ought to be bani[s]hed from all virtuous [s]ociety. Does he not in[s]idiou[s]ly declare that you are the only object of his affections; that his union with another was formed from interested views; and though that other is acknowledged to be amiable and excellent, [s]till he has not a heart to be[s]tow, and expects not happiness with her? Does this di[s]cover even the appearance of amendment? Has he not, by [s]al[s]e preten[s]ions, mi[s]lead a virtuous woman, and induced her to form a connection with him? She [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-204.jpg) \- external link  - Page 201. ] was a [s]tranger to his manner of life; and doubtless allured, as you have been, by flattery, deceit, and external appearance, to tru[s]t his honor; little thinking him wholly devoid of that [s]acred tie! What is the reward of her confidence? In[s]en[s]ibility to her charms, neglect of her per[s]on, and profe[s][s]ed attachment to another! Is he the man, my dear Eliza, who[s]e friendship you wi[s]h to cultivate? Can that heavenly pa[s][s]ion re[s]ide in a brea[s]t, which is the [s]eat of treachery, duplicity, and ingratitude? You are too [s]en[s]ible of its purity and worth, to [s]uppo[s]e it po[s][s]ible. The confe[s][s]ions of his own mouth condemn him. They convince me that he is [s]till the abandoned libertine; and that marriage is but the cloak of his intrigues. His officious attentions to you are alarming to your friends. You own your mind weakened, and peculiarly [s]u[s]ceptible of tender impre[s][s]ions. Beware how you receive them from him. Li[s]ten not a moment to his flattering profe[s][s]ions. It is an in[s]ult upon your under[s]tanding for him to offer them. It is derogatory to virtue for you to hear them. Slight not the opinion of the world. We are dependent beings; and while the [s]malle[s]t traces of virtuous [s]en[s]ibility remain, we mu[s]t feel the force of that dependence, in a greater or le[s]s degree. No female, who[s]e mind is [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-205.jpg) \- external link  - Page 202. ] uncorrupted, can be indifferent to reputation. It is an ine[s]timable jewel, the lo[s]s of which can never be repaired. While retained, it affords con[s]cious peace to our own minds, and en[s]ures the e[s]teem and re[s]pect of all around us. Ble[s][s]ed with the company of [s]o disinterested and faithful a friend, as Julia Granby, [s]ome deference is certainly due to her opinion and advice. To an enlarged under[s]tanding, a cultivated ta[s]te, and an exten[s]ive knowledge of the world, [s]he unites the mo[s]t liberal sentiments, with a benevolence, and candor of di[s]po[s]ition, which render her equally deserving of your confidence and affection. I cannot relinqui[s]n my claim to a vi[s]it from you this winter. Marriage has not alieniated, or weakened my regard formy friends. Come, then, to your faithful Lucy. Have you forrows? I will [s]ooth, and alleviate them. Have you cares? I will di[s]pel them. Have you plea[s]ures? I will heighten them. Come then, let me fold you to my expecting heart. My happine[s]s will be partly [s]u[s]pended till your [s]ociety render it complete. Adieu. Lucy Sumner .

Writing is an employment, which [s]uits me not at pre[s]ent. It was plea[s]ing to me formerly, and therefore, by recalling the idea of circumstances and events which frequently occupied my pen in happier days, it now gives me pain. Yet I have ju[s]t written a long consolatory letter to Mrs. Richman. She has buried her babe; her little Harriot, of whom [s]he was doatingly fond. It was a cu[s]tom with [s]ome of the ancients, we are told, to weep at the birth of their children. Often [s]hould we be impelled to a compliance with this cu[s]tom, could we fore[s]ee the future incidents of their lives. I think, at lea[s]t, that the uncertainty of their conduct and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-207.jpg) \- external link  - Page 204. ] condition in more advanced age, may reconcile us to their removal to a happier [s]tate, before they are capable of ta[s]ting the bitterne[s]s of woe. "Happy the babe, who, priviledg'd by fate, To [s]horter labors, and a lighter weight, Receiv'd but ye[s]terday the gift of breath; Order'd to morrow, to return to death." Our dome[s]tic affairs are much as when you left us. Nothing remarkable has occurred in the neighborhood, worth communicating. The company and amu[s]ements of the town are as u[s]ual, I [s]uppo[s]e. I frequent neither of them. Having incurred [s]o much cen[s]ure by the indulgence of a gay di[s]po[s]ition, I am now trying what a reclu[s]e and [s]olitary mode of life will produce. You will call me [s]plenetic. I own it. I am plea[s]ed with nobody; [s]till le[s]s with my[s]elf. I look around for happine[s]s, and find it not. The world is to me a de[s]art! If I indulge my[s]elf in temporary enjoyment, the con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s or apprehension of doing ami[s]s, de[s]troys my peace of mind. And, when I have recour[s]e to books, if I read tho[s]e of [s]erious de[s]cription, they remind me of an awful [s]uturity, for which I am unprepared; if hi[s]tory, it di[s]clo[s]es facts in which I have no intere[s]t; if novels, they exhibit [s]cenes of plea[s]ure which I have no prospect of realizing! [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-208.jpg) \- external link  - Page 205. ] My mamma is [s]olicitou[s]ly attentive to my happine[s]s; and though [s]he fails of promoting it; yet I endeavor to [s]ave her the pangs of di[s]appointment, by appearing what [s]he wi[s]hes. I anticipate, and yet I dread your return; a paradox this, which time alone can [s]olve. Continue writing to me, and intreat Mrs. Sumner, in my name, to do likewi[s]e. Your benevolence mu[s]t be your reward. Eliza Wharton . - -  Boston A paradox , indeed, is the greater part of your letter to us, my dear Eliza. We had fondly flattered our[s]elves that the melancholy of your mind was exterminated. I hope no new cau[s]e has revived it. Little did I intend, when I left you, to have been ab[s]ent [s]o long; but Mrs. Sumner's di[s]appointment, in her plan of [s]pending the [s]ummer at [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-209.jpg) \- external link  - Page 206. ] Hartford, induced me, in compliance with her reque[s]t, to prolong my re[s]idence here. But for your [s]ake, [s]he now con[s]ents to my leaving her, in hopes I may be [s]o happy as to contribute to your amu[s]ement. I am both plea[s]ed and in[s]tructed by the conduct of this amiable woman. As I always endeavored to imitate her di[s]creet and mode[s]t behavior in a [s]ingle [s]tate; [s]o likewi[s]e [s]hall I take her for a pattern, [s]hould I ever enter a married life. She is mo[s]t happily united. Mr. Sumner, to allthe graces and accomplishments of the gentleman, adds the [s]till more important and e[s][s]ential properties of virtue, integrity and honor. I was once pre[s]ent when a per[s]on was recommended to her for a hu[s]band. She objected that he was a rake. True, [s]aid the other, he has been, but he has reformed. That will never do for me, rejoined [s]he; I wi[s]h my future companion to need no reformation: a [s]entiment worthy the attention of our whole [s]ex; the general adoption of which, I am per[s]uaded, would have a happy influence upon the manners of the other. I hope neither you, nor I, Eliza, [s]hall ever be tried by a man of debauched principles. Such characters I conceive to be totally unfit for the [s]ociety of women, who have any claim to virtue and delicacy. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-210.jpg) \- external link  - Page 207. ] I intend to be with you, in about a month. If agreeable to you, we will vi[s]it, and [s]pend a few weeks with the afflicted Mrs. Richman. I [s]incerely [s]ympathize with her, under her bereavement. I know her fondne[s]s for you will render your company very con[s]oling to her; and I flatter my[s]elf that I [s]hould not be an unwelcome gue[s]t. Make my re[s]pects to your mamma; and believe me ever your's, Julia Granby . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-211.jpg) \- external link  - Page 208. ] - -  Hartford DEAR MADAM, I HAVE arrived in [s]afety, to the man[s]ion of our once happy and [s]ocial friends. But I cannot de[s]cribe to you, how changed, how greatly changed this amiable family appears [s]ince I left it. Mrs. Wharton met me at the door; and tenderly embracing, bade me a cordial welcome. You are come, Julia, [s]aid [s]he, I hope, to revive and comfort us. We have been very [s]olitary during your ab[s]ence. I am happy madam, [s]aid I, to return; and my endeavors to re[s]tore cheerfulne[s]s and content, [s]hall not be wanting. But, where is Eliza? By this time we had reached the back parlor, whither Mrs. Wharton led me; and the door being open, I [s]aw Eliza, reclined on a [s]ettee, in a very thoughtful po[s]ture. When I advanced to meet her, [s]he never moved; but [s]at "like patience on a monument, [s]miling at grief!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-212.jpg) \- external link  - Page 209. ] I [s]topped involuntarily, and involuntarily rai[s]ing my eyes to heaven, exclaimed, is that Eliza Wharton! She bur[s]t into tears; and attempted to ri[s]e, but [s]unk again into her feat. Seeing her thus affected, I [s]at down by her; and throwing my arm about her neck, why the[s]e tears? [s]aid I. Why this di[s]tre[s]s, my dear friend? Let not the return of your Julia give you pain! She comes to [s]ooth you with the con[s]olations of friend[s]hip! It is not pain, [s]aid [s]he, cla[s]ping me to her brea[s]t; it is plea[s]ure, too exqui[s]ite for my weak nerves to bear! See you not, Julia, how I am altered? Should you have known me for the [s]prightly girl, who was always welcome at the haunts of hilarity and mirth? Indeed, [s]aid I, you appear indi[s]po[s]ed, but I will be your phy[s]ician. Company, and change of air will, I doubt not, re[s]tore you. Will the[s]e cure di[s]orders of the mind, Julia? They will have a powerful tendency to remove them, if rightly applied; and I profe[s]s con[s]iderable [s]kill in that art. Come, continued I, we will try the[s]e medicines in the morning. Let us ri[s]e early, and [s]tep into the chai[s]e; and after riding a few miles, call and breakfa[s]t with Mrs. Freeman. I have [s]ome commi[s][s]ions from her daughter. We [s]hall be agreeably entertained there, you know. Being [s]ummoned to [s]upper, I took her by the hand, and we walked into another room, where we found her brother, and his wife, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-213.jpg) \- external link  - Page 210. ] with her mamma waiting for us. We were all very chatty; even Eliza re[s]umed, in a degree, her former [s]ociability. A [s]ettled gloom, notwithstanding, brooded on her countenance; and a deep [s]igh often e[s]caped her, in [s]pite of her evident endeavors to [s]uppre[s]s it. She went to bed before us; when her mamma informed me that her health had been declining for [s]ome months, that [s]he never complained, but [s]tudiou[s]ly concealed every [s]ymptom of indisposition. Whether it were any real disorder of body, or whether it aro[s]e from her depression of [s]pirits, [s]he could not tell; but supposed they operated together, and mutually heightened each other. I inquired after Major Sanford; whether he and Eliza had a[s][s]ociated together during my ab[s]ence? Sometimes, [s]he [s]aid, they seemed on good terms; and he frequently called to [s]ee her; at others, they had very little, if any corre[s]pondence at all. She told me that Eliza never went abroad, and was very loath to [s]ee company at home; that her chief amusement con[s]i[s]ted in [s]olitary walks; that the dreadful idea of her meeting Major Sanford in the[s]e walks, had now and then intruded upon her imagination; that [s]he had not the lea[s]t evidence of the fact, however; and indeed, was afraid to make any inquiries into the matter, le[s]t her own [s]u[s]picions [s]hould be discovered; that the major's character was wor[s]e than [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-214.jpg) \- external link  - Page 211. ] ever; that he was much abroad, and frequently entertained large parties of worthie[s]s bacchanalians at his hou[s]e; that common report [s]aid he treated his wife with indifference, neglect, and ill nature; with many other circumstances, which it is not material to relate. Adieu, my dear friend, for the pre[s]ent. When occa[s]ion requires, you [s]hall hear again from your affectionate Julia Granby . - -  Hartford Good news, Charles, good news! I have arrived to the utmo[s]t bounds of my wi[s]hes; the full po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of my adorable Eliza! I have heard a quotation from a certain book; but what book it was I have forgotten, if I ever knew. No matter for that; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-215.jpg) \- external link  - Page 212. ] the quotation is, that "[s]tolen waters are [s]weet, and bread eaten in [s]ecret is plea[s]ant." If it has reference to the plea[s]ures, which I have enjoyed with Eliza, I like it hugely, as Tri[s]tram Shandy's father [s]aid of Yorick's sermon; and I think it fully verified. I had a long and tedious [s]iege. Every method which love could fugge[s]t, or art invent, was adopted. I was [s]ometimes ready to despair, under an idea that her re[s]olution was unconquerable, her virtue impregnable. Indeed, I [s]hould have given over the pur[s]uit long ago, but for the hopes of [s]ucce[s]s I entertained from her parlying with me, and in reliance upon her own [s]trength, endeavoring to combat, and counteract my de[s]igns. Whenever this has been the ca[s]e, Charles, I have never yet been defeated in my plan. If a lady will con[s]ent to enter the li[s]ts again[s]t the antagoni[s]t of her honor, [s]he may be [s]ure of loo[s]ing the prize. Be[s]ides; were her delicacy genuine, the would bani[s]h the man at once, who presumed to doubt, which he certainly does, who attempts to vanqui[s]h it! But, far be it from me to critici[s]e the pretensions of the [s]ex. If I gain the rich reward of my di[s][s]imulation and gallantry, that you know is all I want. To return then to the point. An unlucky, but not a miraculous accident, has taken place, which mu[s]t [s]oon expo[s]e our amour. What [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-216.jpg) \- external link  - Page 213. ] can be done? At the fir[s]t di[s]covery, ab[s]olute di[s]traction [s]eized the [s]oul of Eliza, which has [s]ince terminated in a fixed melancholy. Her health too is much impaired. She thinks herself rapidly declining; and I tremble when I [s]ee her emaciated form! My wife has been reduced very low, of late. She brought me a boy a few weeks pa[s]t, a dead one though. The[s]e circum[s]tances give me neither pain nor plea[s]ure. I am too much ingro[s][s]ed by my divinity, to take an intere[s]t in any thing el[s]e. True, I have lately [s]uffered my[s]elf to be [s]omewhat engaged here and there, by a few jovial lads, who a[s][s]i[s]t me in di[s]pelling the anxious thoughts, which my perplexed situation excites. I mu[s]t, however, [s]eek [s]ome means to relieve Eliza's di[s]tre[s]s. My finances are low; but the la[s]t fraction [s]hall be expended in her [s]ervice, if [s]he need it. Julia Granby is expected at Mrs. Wharton's every hour. I fear that her inquisitorial eye will [s]oon detect our intrigue, and obstruct its continuation. Now there's a girl, Charles, I [s]hould never attempt to [s]educe; yet [s]he is a mo[s]t alluring object, I a[s][s]ure you. But the dignity of her manners forbid all asfaults upon her virtue. Why, the very expression of her eye, bla[s]ts in the bud, every thought, derogatory to her honor; and tells you plainly, that the fir[s]t in[s]inuation of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-217.jpg) \- external link  - Page 214. ] kind, would be puni[s]hed with eternal banishment and di[s]plea[s]ure! Of her there is no danger! But I can write no more, except that I am, &c. Peter Sanford . - -  Hartford Oh , my friend! I have a tale to unfold; a tale which will rend every nerve of [s]ympathizing pity, which will rack the brea[s]t of [s]en[s]ibility, and un[s]peakably di[s]tre[s]s your benevolent heart! Eliza---Oh the ruined, lo[s]t Eliza! I want words to expre[s]s the emotions of indignation, and grier which oppre[s]s me! But I will endeavor to compo[s]e my[s]elf; and relate the circum[s]tances as they came to my knowledge. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-218.jpg) \- external link  - Page 215. ] After my la[s]t letter, Eliza remained much in the [s]ame gloomy [s]ituation as I found her. She refu[s]ed to go, agreeably to her promi[s]e, to vi[s]it your mamma; and under one pretext or another, has con[s]tantly declined accompanying me any where el[s]e, [s]ince my arrival. Till la[s]t Thur[s]day night [s]he [s]lept in the [s]ame bed with me; when [s]he excu[s]ed her[s]elf, by [s]aying [s]he was re[s]tle[s]s, and [s]hould di[s]turb my repo[s]e. I yeilded to her humor of taking a different apartment, little [s]u[s]pecting the real cau[s]e! She frequently walked cut; and though I [s]ometimes followed, I very seldom found her. Two or three times, when I happened to be awake, I heard her go down [s]tairs; and on inquiry in the morning, [s]he told me that [s]he was very thir[s]ty, and went down for water. I ob[s]erved, a degree of hesitancy in her an[s]wers, for which I could not account. But la[s]t night, the dreadful my[s]tery was developed! A little before day, I heard the front door opened with great caution. I [s]prang from my bed, and running to the window, [s]aw by the light of the moon, a man going from the hou[s]e. Soon after I perceived a foot[s]tep upon the [s]tairs, which carefully approached and entered Eliza's chamber. Judge of my a[s]toni[s]hment, my [s]urpri[s]e, my feelings, upon this ecca[s]ion! I doubted not but Major Sanford was the per[s]on I had [s]een; and the di[s]covery of Eliza's guilt, in this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-219.jpg) \- external link  - Page 216. ] infamous intrigue, almo[s]t deprived me of thought and recollection! My blood thrilled with horror at this [s]acrifice of virtue! After a while I recovered my[s]elf, and put on my clothes. But what to do, I knew not; whether to go directly to her chamber, and let her know that [s]he was detected; or to wait another opportunity. I re[s]olved on the fir[s]t. The day had now dawned. I tapped at her door; and [s]he bid me come in. She was [s]itting in an ea[s]y chair by the [s]ide of her bed. As I entered [s]he withdrew her handkerchief from her face; and looking earne[s]tly at me, [s]aid, what procures me the favor of a vi[s]it, at this early hour, Mi[s]s Granby? I was di[s]turbed, [s]aid I, and wi[s]hed not to return to my bed. But what breaks your re[s]t; and calls you up [s]o un[s]ea[s]onably, Eliza? Remor[s]e, and de[s]pair, an[s]wered [s]he, weeping. After what I have witne[s][s]ed, this morning, rejoined I, I cannot wonder at it! Was it not Major Sanford whom I [s]aw go from the hou[s]e [s]ome time ago? She was [s]ilent, but tears flowed abundantly. It is too late, continued I, to deny, or evade. An[s]wer my que[s]tion [s]incerely; for, believe me, Eliza, it is not malice, but concern for you, which prompts it. I will an[s]wer you, Julia, [s]aid [s]he. You have discovered a [s]ecret, which harrows up my very [s]oul! A [s]ecret, which I wi[s]hed you to know, but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-220.jpg) \- external link  - Page 217. ] could not exert re[s]olution to reveal! Yes! It was Major Sanford; the man who has robbed me of my peace; who has triumphed in my de[s]truction; and who will cau[s]e my [s]un to [s]it at noon! I [s]hudder, [s]aid I, at your confe[s][s]ion! Wretched, deluded girl! Is this a return for your parent's love, and a[s][s]duous care; for your friends' [s]olicitude, and premonitory advice? You are ruined, you [s]ay! You have [s]acrificed your virtue to an abandoned, despicable profligate! And you live to acknowledge and bear your infamy! I do, [s]aid [s]he; but not long [s]hall I [s]upport this burden! See you not, Julia, my decaying frame, my [s]aded cheek, and tottering limbs? Soon [s]hall I be insensible to cen[s]ure and reproach! Soon [s]hall I be [s]eque[s]tered in that man[s]ion, "where the wicked cea[s]e from troubling, and where the weary are at re[s]t!" Re[s]t! [s]aid I, can you expect to find re[s]t either in this world, or another, with [s]uch a weight of guilt on your head? She exclaimed, with great emotion, add not to the upbraidings of a wounded [s]pirit! Have pity upon me, Oh! my friend, have pity upon me! Could you know what I [s]uffer, you would think me [s]ufficiently puni[s]hed! I wi[s]h you no other puni[s]hment, [s]aid I, than what may effect your repentance and reformation. But your mother, Eliza! She cannot long be ignorant of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-221.jpg) \- external link  - Page 218. ] your fall; and I tremble to think of her distress! It will break her widowed heart! How has [s]he loved; how has [s]he doated upon you! Dreadful is the requital which you have made! My mother, rejoined [s]he---Oh, name her not! The very found is di[s]traction to me! Oh! my Julia, if your heart be not [s]hut again[s]t mercy and compa[s][s]ion towards me, aid me through this trying [s]cene! Let my [s]ituation call forth your pity, and induce you, unde[s]erving as I am, to exert it in my behalf! During this time, I had walked the chamber. My [s]pirits had been rai[s]ed above their natural key, and were exhau[s]ted. I [s]at down, but thought I [s]hould have fainted, till a copious [s]lood of tears gave me relief. Eliza was extremely affected. The appearance of calamity which [s]he exhibited would have [s]oftened the mo[s]t obdurate anger. Indeed, I feared [s]ome immediate and fatal effect. I therefore [s]eated my[s]elf be[s]ide her; and assuming an air of kindne[s]s, compo[s]e your[s]elf, Eliza, [s]aid I; I repeat what I told you before, it is the pure[s]t friend[s]hip, which thus intere[s]ts me in your concerns. This, under the direction of charity, induces me again to offer you my hand. Yet you have erred again[s]t knowledge and rea[s]on; again[s]t warning and coun[s]el. You have forfeited the favor of your friends; and reluctant will be their [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-222.jpg) \- external link  - Page 219. ] forgiveness. I plead guilty, [s]aid [s]he, to all your charges. From the general voice I expect no clemency. If I can make my peace with my mother, it is all I [s]eek or wi[s]h on this [s]ide the grave. In your benevolence I con[s]ide for this. In you, I hope to find an interce[s][s]or. By the remembrance of our former affection and happiness, I conjure you, refu[s]e me not. At present, I entreat you to conceal from her this distressing tale. A [s]hort reprieve is all I a[s]k. Why, [s]aid I, [s]hould you defer it? When the painful ta[s]k is over, you may find relief in her lenient kindne[s]s. After [s]he knows my condition, I cannot [s]ee her, re[s]umed [s]he, till I am a[s][s]ured of her forgivene[s]s. I have not [s]trength to [s]upport the appearance of her anger and grief. I will write to her what I cannot [s]peak. You mu[s]t bear the melancholy me[s][s]age, and plead for me, that her displeasure may not follow me to the grave; whither I am rapidly ha[s]tening. Be a[s][s]ured, replied I, that I will keep your [s]ecret as long as prudence requires. But I mu[s]t leave you now: your mamma will wonder at our being thus clo[s]etted together. When opportunity presents, we will conver[s]e further on the [s]ubject. In the mean time, keep your[s]elf as compo[s]ed as po[s][s]ible, if you would avoid [s]u[s]picion. She rai[s]ed her cla[s]ped hands, and with a piteous look, threw her handkerchief over her face, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-223.jpg) \- external link  - Page 220. ] and reclined in her chair, without [s]peaking a word. I returned to my chamber, and endeavored to di[s][s]ipate every idea which might tend to di[s]order my countenance, and break the [s]ilence I wi[s]hed to ob[s]erve, relative to what had happened. When I went down, Mrs. Wharton desired me to [s]tep up, and inform Eliza that breakfa[s]t was ready. She told me [s]he could not yet compo[s]e her[s]elf [s]ufficiently to [s]ee her mamma; and begged me to excu[s]e her absence as I thought proper. I accordingly returned for an[s]wer to Mrs. Wharton, that Eliza had re[s]ted but indifferently, and being [s]omewhat indi[s]po[s]ed, would not come down, but wi[s]hed me to bring her a bowl of chocolate, when we had breakfa[s]ted. I was obliged [s]tudiou[s]ly to [s]uppre[s]s even my thoughts concerning her, left the emotions they excited might be ob[s]erved. Mrs. Wharton conversed much of her daughter, and expre[s][s]ed great concern about her health and [s]tate of mind. Her return to this [s]tate of dejection, after having recovered her [s]pirits and cheerfulness, in a great degree, was owing, [s]he feared, to [s]ome cau[s]e unknown to her; and [s]he entreated me to extract the [s]ecret, if po[s][s]ible. I a[s][s]ured her of my be[s]t endeavors, and doubted not, I told her, but I [s]hould be able in a few days to effect what [s]he wi[s]hed. Eliza came down and walked in the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-224.jpg) \- external link  - Page 221. ] garden before dinner; at which [s]he commanded her[s]elf much better than I expected. She [s]aid that a little ride might, [s]he imagined, be of [s]ervice to her; and a[s]ked me if I would accompany her a few miles in the afternoon. Her mamma was much plea[s]ed with the propo[s]ition; and the chai[s]e was accordingly ordered. I ob[s]erved to Eliza, as we rode, that with her natural and acquired abilities, with her advantages of education, with her opportunities of knowing the world, and of tracing the virtues and vices of mankind to their origin, I was [s]urpri[s]ed at her becoming the prey of an in[s]idious libertine, with who[s]e character [s]he was well acquainted, and who[s]e principles [s]he was fully appri[s]ed would prompt him to deceive and betray her. Your surprise is very natural, [s]aid [s]he. The [s]ame will doubtle[s]s be felt and expre[s][s]ed by every one to whom my [s]ad [s]tory is related. But the cau[s]e may be found in that unre[s]trained levity of di[s]po[s]ition, that fondne[s]s for di[s][s]ipation and coquetry which alienated the affections of Mr. Boyer from me. This event fatally depre[s][s]ed, and en[s]eebled my mind. I embraced with avidity the con[s]oling power of friend[s]hip, en[s]naringly offered by my [s]educer; vainly inferring from his marriage with a virtuous woman, that he had[s]een the error of his ways, and for[s]aken his licentious practices, as he affirmed, and I, fool that I was, believed it! [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-225.jpg) \- external link  - Page 222. ] It is needle[s]s for me to rehear[s]e the persidious arts, by which he in[s]inuated him[s]elf into my affections, and gained my confidence. Suffice it to [s]ay, he effected his purpo[s]e! But not long did I continue in the delu[s]ive dream of [s]en[s]ual gratification. I [s]oon awoke to a mo[s]t poignant [s]en[s]e of his ba[s]ene[s]s, and of my own crime and mi[s]ery. I would have fled from him; I would have renounced him for ever; and by a life of [s]incere humility and repentance, endeavored to make my peace with heaven, and to obliterate, by the rectitude of my future conduct, the guilt I had incurred; but I found it too late! My circumstances called for attention; and I had no one to participate my cares, to witne[s]s my distress, and to alleviate my [s]orrows, but him. I could not therefore prevail on my[s]elf, wholly to renounce his [s]ociety. At times I have admitted his vi[s]its; always meeting him in the garden, or grove adjoining; till of late, the weather, and my ill health induced me to comply with his [s]olicitations, and receive him into the parlor. Not long, however, [s]hall I be [s]ubject to the[s]e embarra[s][s]ments. Grief has undermined my con[s]titution. My health has fallen a sacrifice to a di[s]ordered mind. But I regret not its departure! I have not a [s]ingle wi[s]h to live. Nothing which the world affords can re[s]tore my former [s]erenity and happine[s]s! [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-226.jpg) \- external link  - Page 223. ] The little innocent I bear, will quickly disclose its mother's [s]hame! God Almighty grant it may not live as a monument of my guilt, and a partaker of the infamy and sorrow, which is all I have to bequeath it! Should it be continued in life, it will never know the tenderne[s]s of a parent; and, perhaps, want and di[s]grace may be its wretched portion! The greate[s]t con[s]olation I can have, will be to carry it with me to a [s]tate of eternal re[s]t; which, vile as I am, I hope to obtain, through the infinite mercy of heaven, as revealed in the go[s]pel of Chri[s]t. I mu[s]t [s]ee Major Sanford again. It is necessary to conver[s]e further with him, in order to carry my plan of operation into execution. What is this plan of operation, Eliza? [s]aid I. I am on the rack of anxiety for your [s]afety. Be patient, continued [s]he and you [s]hall [s]oon be informed. To morrow I [s]hall write my dreadful [s]tory to my mother. She will be acquainted with my future intentions; and you [s]hall know, at the [s]ame time, the de[s]tination of your lo[s]t friend. I hope, [s]aid I, that you have formed no re[s]olution again[s]t your own life. God forbid, rejoined [s]he. My breath is in his hands, let him do what [s]eemeth good in his [s]ight! Keep my [s]ecret one day longer, and I will never more impo[s]e [s]o painful a [s]ilence upon you. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-227.jpg) \- external link  - Page 224. ] By this time we had reached home. She drank tea with compo[s]ure, and [s]oon retired to re[s]t. Mrs. Wharton eagerly inquired whether I had found out the cau[s]e of Eliza's melancholy. I have urged her, [s]aid I, on the [s]ubject; but [s]he alledges that [s]he has particular rea[s]ons for pre[s]ent concealment. She has, notwith[s]tanding, promi[s]ed to let me know, the day after to morrow. Oh, [s]aid [s]he, I [s]hall not re[s]t till the period arrives. Dear, good woman, [s]aid I to my[s]elf, I fear you will never re[s]t afterwards! This is our pre[s]ent [s]ituation. Think what a [s]cene ri[s]es to the view of your Julia! She mu[s]t [s]hare the di[s]tre[s][s]es of others, though her own feelings, on this unhappy occa[s]ion, are too keen to admit a moment's [s]erenity! My greate[s]t relief is in writing to you; which I [s]hall do again by the next po[s]t. In the mean time, I mu[s]t beg leave to [s]ub[s]cribe myself, [s]incerely yours, Julia Granby . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-228.jpg) \- external link  - Page 225. ] - -  Hartford All is now lo[s]t; lo[s]t, indeed! She is gone! Yes, my dear friend, our beloved Eliza, is gone! Never more [s]hall we behold this once amiable companion, this once innocent and happy girl. She has for[s]aken, and, as [s]he [s]ays, bid an everla[s]ting adieu to her home, her afflicted parent and her friends! But I will take up my melancholy [s]tory where I left it in my la[s]t. She went, as [s]he told me [s]he expected, into the garden, and met her dete[s]table paramour. In about an hour [s]he returned, and went directly to her chamber. At one o'clock I went up, and found her writing, and weeping. I begged her to compo[s]e her[s]elf, and go down to dinner. No; [s]he [s]aid, [s]he could not eat; and was not fit to appear before any body. I remon[s]trated again[s]t her immoderate grief; repre[s]ented the injury [s]he mu[s]t [s]u[s]tain by the indulgence of it, and conjured her to [s]upre[s]s the violence of its emotions. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-229.jpg) \- external link  - Page 226. ] She entreated me to excu[s]e her to her mamma; [s]aid [s]he was writing to her, and found it a ta[s]k too painful to be performed with any degree of compo[s]ure; that [s]he was almo[s]t ready to [s]ink under the weight of her affliction; but hoped and prayed for [s]upport, both in this, and another trying [s]cene, which awaited her. In compliance with her de[s]ire, I now left her; and told her mamma that [s]he was very bu[s]y in writing; wi[s]hed not to be interrupted at pre[s]ent; but would take [s]ome refre[s]hment, an hour or two hence. I vi[s]ited her again, about four o'clock; when [s]he appeared more calm and tranquil. It is fini[s]hed, [s]aid [s]he, as I entered her apartment, it is fini[s]hed. What [s]aid I, is fini[s]hed? No matter, replied [s]he; you will know all to morrow, Julia. She complained of exce[s][s]ive fatigue, and expre[s][s]ed an inclination to lie down; in which I a[s][s]i[s]ted her, and then retired. Some time after, her mamma went up, and found her [s]till on the bed. She ro[s]e, however, and accompanied her down [s]tairs. I met her at the door of the parlor, and taking her by the hand, inquired how [s]he did? Oh, Julia, mi[s]erably indeed, [s]aid [s]he. How [s]everely does my mother's kindne[s]s reproach me! How in[s]upportably it increa[s]es my [s]elf-condemnation! She wept; [s]he wrung her hands, and walked the room in the greatest agony! Mrs. Wharton was exceeding [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-230.jpg) \- external link  - Page 227. ] di[s]tre[s][s]ed by her appearance. Tell me, Eliza, [s]aid [s]he, tell me the cau[s]e of your trouble! Oh, kill me not by your my[s]terious concealment! My dear child, let me, by [s]haring, alleviate your affliction! A[s]k me not, madam, [s]aid [s]he; O my mother, I conjure you not to in[s]i[s]t on my divulging to night, the satal [s]ecret which engro[s][s]es and di[s]tracts my mind! To morrow I will hide nothing from you. I will pre[s]s you no further, rejoined her mamma. Chu[s]e your own time, my dear; but remember, I mu[s]t participate your grief, though I know not the cau[s]e. Supper was brought in; and we endeavored to prevail on Eliza to eat, but in vain. She [s]at down, in compliance with our united importunities; but neither of us ta[s]ted food. It was removed untouched. For a while, Mrs. Wharton and I gazed in [s]ilent angui[s]h upon the [s]pectacle of woe, before us! At length, Eliza ro[s]e to retire. Julia, [s]aid [s]he, will you call at my chamber, as you pa[s]s to your own? I a[s][s]ented. She then approached her mamma, fell upon her knees before her, and cla[s]ping her hand, [s]aid, in broken accents, Oh madam! can you forgive a wretch, who has for[s]eited your love, your kindne[s]s, and your compa[s][s]ion? Surely, Eliza, [s]aid [s]he, you are not that being! No, it is impo[s][s]ible! But however great your tran[s]gre[s][s]ion, be a[s][s]ured of my forgivene[s]s, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-231.jpg) \- external link  - Page 228. ] my compa[s][s]ion, and my continued love! Saying this, [s]he threw her arms about her daughter's neck, and affectionately ki[s][s]ed her. Eliza [s]truggled from her embrace, and looking at her with wild de[s]pair, exclaimed, this is too much! Oh, this unmerited goodne[s]s is more than I can bear! She then ru[s]hed precipitately out of the room, and left us overwhelmed in [s]ympathy and a[s]toni[s]hment! When Mrs. Wharton had recovered herself a little, [s]he ob[s]erved, that Eliza's brain was evidently di[s]ordered. Nothing el[s]e, continued [s]he, could impel her to act in this extraordinary manner. At fir[s]t [s]he was resolved to follow her; but I di[s][s]uaded her from it, alledging, that as [s]he had de[s]ired me to come into her chamber, I thought it better for me to go alone. She acquie[s]ced; but [s]aid [s]he [s]hould not think of going to bed; but would, however, retire to her chamber, and [s]eek con[s]olation there. I bade her good night; and went up to Eliza, who took me by the hand and led me to the toilet, upon which [s]he laid the two inclo[s]ed letters, the one to her mamma, and the other to me. The[s]e, [s]aid [s]he, contain what I had not re[s]olution to expre[s]s. Promi[s]e me, Julia, that they [s]hall not be opened till to morrow morning. I will, [s]aid I. I have thought and wept, continued [s]he, till I have almo[s]t exhau[s]ted my [s]trength, and my rea[s]on. I would now [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-232.jpg) \- external link  - Page 229. ] obtain a little re[s]pite, that I may prepare my mind for the account I am one day to give at a higher tribunal than that of earthly friends. For this purpo[s]e, what I have written, and what I [s]hall yet [s]ay to you, mu[s]t clo[s]e the account between you and me. I have certainly no balance again[s]t you, [s]aid I. In my brea[s]t you are fully acquitted. Your penitential tears have obliterated your guilt, and blotted out your errors with your Julia. Henceforth, be they all forgotten. Live, and be happy. Talk not, [s]aid [s]he, of life. It would be a vain hope, though I cheri[s]hed it my[s]elf. "That I mu[s]t die, it is my only comfort; Death is the privilege of human nature; And life without it were not worth our taking. Thither the poor, the pri[s]oner and the mourner Fly for relief, and lay their burdens down!" You have forgiven me, Julia; my mother has a[s][s]ured me of her forgivene[s]s, and what have I more to wi[s]h? my heart is much lightened by the[s]e kind a[s][s]urances; they will be a great [s]upport to me in the dreadful hour which awaits me! What mean you, Eliza? [s]aid I. I fear [s]ome de[s]perate purpo[s]e labors in your mind. Oh, no, [s]he replied; you may be a[s][s]ured your fear is groundle[s]s. I know not what I [s]ay; my brain is on fire; I am all confusion! Leave me, Julia; when I have had a little re[s]t, I [s]hall be compo[s]ed. The[s]e letters have almo[s]t di[s]tracted me; but they are [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-233.jpg) \- external link  - Page 230. ] written, and I am comparatively ea[s]y. I will not leave you, Eliza, [s]aid I, unle[s]s you will go directly to bed, and endeavor to re[s]t. I will, [s]aid [s]he, and the [s]ooner the better. I tenderly embraced her, and retired, though not to bed. About an hour after, I returned to her chamber, and opening the door very [s]oftly, found her apparently a[s]leep. I acquainted Mrs. Wharton with her [s]ituation, which was a great con[s]olation to us both; and encouraged us to go to bed. Having [s]uffered much in my mind, and being much fatigued, I [s]oon fell a[s]leep; but the rattling of a carriage, which appeared to [s]top at a little di[s]tance from the hou[s]e, awoke me. I li[s]tened a moment, and heard the door turn [s]lowly on its hinges. I [s]prang from my bed, and reached the window ju[s]t in time to [s]ee a female handed into a chai[s]e by a man who ha[s]tily followed her, and drove furiou[s]ly away! I at once concluded they could be no other than Eliza and Major Sanford. Under this impression I made no delay, but ran immediately to her chamber. A candle was burning on the table; but Eliza was not there! I thought it be[s]t to acquaint her mamma with the melancholy di[s]covery; and [s]teping to her apartment for the purpo[s]e, found her ri[s]ing. She had heard me walk, and was anxious to know the cau[s]e. What is the matter, Julia, [s]aid [s]he; what is the matter? Dear madam, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-234.jpg) \- external link  - Page 231. ] [s]aid I, arm your[s]elf with fortitude! What new occurrence demands it? rejoined [s]he. Eliza has left us! Left us! what mean you? She is ju[s]t gone! I [s]aw her handed into a chai[s]e, which in[s]tantly di[s]appeared! At this intelligence [s]he gave a [s]hriek, and fell back on her bed! I alarmed the family, and by their a[s][s]i[s]tance [s]oon recovered her. She de[s]ired me to inform her of every particular relative to her elopement, which I did; and then delivered her the letter which Eliza had left for her. I [s]u[s]pect, [s]aid [s]he, as [s]he took it; I have long [s]u[s]pected, what I dared not believe! The angui[s]h of my mind has been known only to my[s]elf, and my God! I could not an[s]wer her, and therefore withdrew. When I had read Eliza's letter to me, and wept over the [s]ad fall; and, as I fear, the total lo[s]s of this once amiable and accompli[s]hed girl, I returned to Mrs. Wharton. She was [s]itting in her ea[s]y chair; and [s]till held the fatal letter in her hand. When I entered, [s]he fixed her [s]treaming eyes upon me, and exclaimed, O Julia, this is more than the bitterness of death! True, madam, [s]aid I, your affliction mu[s]t be great; yet that all-gracious Being, who controls every event, is able, and I tru[s]t, di[s]po[s]ed to [s]upport you! To Him, replied [s]he, I de[s]ire humbly to re[s]ign my[s]elf; but I think I could have borne almo[s]t any other calamity with greater re[s]ignation and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-235.jpg) \- external link  - Page 232. ] compo[s]ure than this. With how much comparative ea[s]e could I have followed her to the grave, at any period [s]ince her birth! Oh, my child, my child! dear, very dear ha[s]t thou been to my fond heart! Little did I think it po[s][s]ible for you to prepare [s]o dreadful a cup of [s]orrow for your widowed mother! But where, continued [s]he, where can the poor fugitive have fled? Where can [s]he find that protection and tenderne[s]s, which, notwithstanding her great apo[s]tacy, I [s]hould never have withheld? From whom can [s]he receive tho[s]e kind attentions, which her [s]ituation demands. The agitation of her mind had exhau[s]ted her [s]trength; and I prevailed on her to refresh, and endeavor to compo[s]e her[s]elf to re[s]t; a[s][s]uring her of my utmo[s]t exertions to find out Eliza's retreat, and re[s]tore her to a mother's arms. I am obliged to [s]uppre[s]s my own emotions; and to bend all my thoughts towards the alleviation of Mrs. Wharton's anxiety and grief. Major Sanford is from home, as I expected; and I am determined, if he return, to [s]ee him my[s]elf, and extort from him the place of Eliza's concealment. Her flight, in her pre[s]ent [s]tate of health, is inexpre[s][s]ibly distressing to her mother; and, unle[s]s we find her [s]oon, I dread the effects! I [s]hall not clo[s]e this, till I have [s]een or [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-236.jpg) \- external link  - Page 233. ] heard from the vile mi[s]creant who has involved a worthy family in wretchedne[s]s! Friday Morning \---Two days have elap[s]ed without affording us much relief. La[s]t evening, I was told that Major Sanford was at home. I immediately wrote him a billet, entreating and conjuring him to let me know where the haple[s]s Eliza had fled. He returned me the following an[s]wer. "Mi[s]s Granby need be under no apprehensions, re[s]pecting the [s]ituation of our beloved Eliza. She is well provided for, conveniently accommodated, and has every thing to make her happy, which love or affluence can give. Major Sanford has [s]olemnly [s]worn not to discover her retreat. She wi[s]hes to avoid the accu[s]ations of her friends, till [s]he is better able to bear them. Her mother may re[s]t a[s][s]ured of immediate information, [s]hould any danger threaten her amiable daughter; and al[s]o of having seasonable notice of her [s]afety." Although little dependence can be placed upon this man; yet the[s]e a[s][s]urances have, in a great degree, calmed our minds. We are, however, contriving means to explore the refuge of the wanderer; and hope, by tracing his [s]teps, to accompli[s]h our purpo[s]e. This we have engaged a friend to do. I know, my dear Mrs. Sumner, the kind [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-237.jpg) \- external link  - Page 234. ] intere[s]t you will take in this di[s]a[s]trous affair. I tremble to think what the event may be! To relieve your [s]u[s]pen[s]e, however, I [s]hall write you every circum[s]tance, as it occurs. But at pre[s]ent, I [s]hall only enclo[s]e Eliza's letters to her mamma, and me, and, [s]ub[s]cribe my[s]elf your [s]incere and obliged friend, Julia Granby . - Tuesday . MY HONORED AND DEAR MAMMA, In what words, in what language [s]hall I addre[s]s you? What [s]hall I [s]ay on a subject which deprives me of the power of expression? Would to God I had been totally deprived of that power before [s]o fatal a subject required its exertion! Repentance comes too late, when it cannot prevent the evil lamented. For your kindne[s]s, your more than maternal affection towards me, from my infancy to the pre[s]ent moment, a long life of filial duty and unerring rectitude could hardly compen[s]ate. How greatly deficient in gratitude mu[s]t I appear then, while I confe[s]s, that precept and example, coun[s]el and advice, instruction and admonition, have been all lo[s]t upon me! [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-238.jpg) \- external link  - Page 235. ] Your kind endeavors to promote my happiness have been repaid by the inexcu[s]able folly of [s]acrificing it. The various emotions of [s]hame, and remor[s]e, penitence and regret, which torture and di[s]tract my guilty brea[s]t, exceed de[s]cription. Yes, madam, your Eliza has fallen; fallen, indeed! She has become the victim of her own indi[s]cretion, and of the intrigue and artifice of a de[s]igning libertine, who is the hu[s]band of another! She is polluted, and no more worthy of her parentage! She flies from you, not to conceal her guilt, that [s]he humbly and penitently owns; but to avoid what [s]he has never experienced, and feels her[s]elf unable to [s]upport, a mother's frown; to e[s]cape the heart-rending [s]ight of a parent's grief, occa[s]ioned by the crimes of her guilty child! I have become a reproach and di[s]grace to my friends. The con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of having forfeited their favor, and incurred their disapprobation and re[s]entment, induces me to conceal from them the place of my retirement; but, le[s]t your benevolence [s]hould render you anxious for my comfort in my pre[s]ent situation, I take the liberty to a[s][s]ure you that I am amply provided for. I have no claim even upon your pity; but from my long experience of your tenderne[s]s, I pre[s]ume to hope it will be extended to me. Oh, my mother, if you knew what the [s]tate of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-239.jpg) \- external link  - Page 236. ] my mind is, and has been, for months pa[s]t, you would [s]urely compa[s][s]ionate my ca[s]e! Could tears efface the [s]tain, which I have brought upon my family, it would, long [s]ince have been wa[s]hed away! But, alas, tears are vain; and vain is my bitter repentance! It cannot obliterate my crime, nor re[s]tore me to innocence and peace! In this life I have no ideas of happine[s]s. The[s]e I have wholly resigned! The only hope which affords me any [s]olace, is that of your forgivene[s]s. If the deepe[s]t contrition can make an atonement; if the severest pains, both of body and mind, can restore me to your charity, you will not be inexorable! Oh, let my [s]ufferings be deemed a [s]ufficient puni[s]hment; and add not the insupportable weight of a parent's wrath! At pre[s]ent, I cannot [s]ee you. The effect of my crime is too obvious to be longer concealed, to elude the invidious eye of curio[s]ity. This night, therefore, I leave your ho[s]pitable man[s]ion! This night I become a wretched wanderer from thy paternal roof! Oh, that the grave were this night to be my lodging! Then [s]hould I lie down and be at re[s]t! Tru[s]ting in the mercy of God, through the mediation of his [s]on; I think I could meet my heavenly father with more compo[s]ure and confidence, than my earthly parent! Let not the faults and misfortunes of your daughter oppre[s]s your mind. Rather let the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-240.jpg) \- external link  - Page 237. ] conviction of having faithfully di[s]charged your duty to your lo[s]t child, [s]upport and con[s]ole you in this trying [s]cene. Since I wrote the above, you have kindly granted me your forgivene[s]s, though you knew not how great, how aggravated was my offence! You forgive me, you [s]ay: Oh, the harmonious, the tran[s]porting [s]ound! It has revived my drooping [s]pirits; and will enable me to encounter, with re[s]olution, the trials before me! Farewell, my dear mamma! pity and pray for your ruined child; and be a[s][s]ured, that affection and gratitude will be the la[s]t sentiments, which expire in the brea[s]t of your repenting daughter, Eliza Wharton .

MY DEAR FRIEND, By that endearing title you permit me [s]till to addre[s]s you, and [s]uch you have always proved your[s]elf, by a participation of my di[s]tre[s][s]es, as well as by the con[s]oling voice of pity and forgivene[s]s. What de[s]tiny Providence de[s]igns for me, I know not; but I have my forebodings that this is the la[s]t time I [s]hall ever acco[s]t you! Nor does this apprehension ari[s]e merely from a di[s]turbed imagination. I have rea[s]on to think my[s]elf in a confirmed con[s]umption, which commonly proves fatal to per[s]ons in my [s]ituation. I have carefully concealed every complaint of the kind from my mamma, for fear of di[s]tre[s][s]ing her; yet I have never been in[s]en[s]ible of their probable i[s][s]ue, and have bidden a [s]incere welcome to them, as the harbingers of my [s]peedy relea[s]e from a life of guilt and woe! I am going from you, Julia. This night [s]eparates us, perhaps, for ever! I have not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-242.jpg) \- external link  - Page 239. ] resolution to encounter the tears of my friends; and therefore [s]eek [s]helter among [s]trangers; where none knows, or is intere[s]ted in my melancholy [s]tory. The place of my [s]eclu[s]ion I [s]tudiou[s]ly conceal; yet I [s]hall take mea[s]ures that you may be apprized of my fate. Should it plea[s]e God to [s]pare and re[s]tore me to health, I [s]hall return, and endeavor, by a life of penitence and rectitude, to expiate my pa[s]t offences. But [s]hould I be called from this [s]cene of action; and leave behind me a helple[s]s babe, the innocent [s]ufferer of its mother's [s]hame, Oh, Julia, let your friend[s]hip for me extend to the little [s]tranger! Intercede with my mother to take it under her protection; and transfer to it all her affection for me; to train it up in the ways of piety and virtue, that it may compen[s]ate her for the afflictions which I have occa[s]ioned! One thing more I have to reque[s]t. Plead for me with my two be[s]t friends, Mrs. Richman and Mrs. Sumner. I a[s]k you not to paliate my faults; that cannot be done; but to obtain, if po[s][s]ible, their forgivene[s]s. I cannot write all my full mind [s]ugge[s]ts on this [s]ubject. You know the purport; and can better express it for me. And now, my dear Julia, recommending my[s]elf again to your benevolence, to your charity and (may I add?) to your affection; and entreating that the fatal con[s]equences of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-243.jpg) \- external link  - Page 240. ] my folly, now fallen upon my devoted head, may [s]uffice for my puni[s]hment; let me conjure you to bury my crimes in the grave with me, and to pre[s]erve the remembrance of my former virtues, which engaged your love and confidence; more e[s]pecially of that ardent esteem for you, which will glow till the la[s]t expiring breath of your de[s]pairing Eliza Wharton . - -  Hartford I have , at la[s]t, accompli[s]hed the removal of my darling girl, from a place where [s]he thought every eye accu[s]ed, and every heart condemned her. She has become quite romantic in her notions. She would not permit me to accompany her, le[s]t it [s]hould be reported that we [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-244.jpg) \- external link  - Page 241. ] had eloped together. I provided amply for her future exigencies, and conveyed her by night to the di[s]tance of ten or twelve miles, where we met the [s]tage, in which I had previou[s]ly [s]ecured her a [s]eat. The agony of her grief at being thus obliged to leave her mother's hou[s]e, baffles all de[s]cription. It very [s]en[s]ibly affected me, I know. I was almo[s]t a penitent. I am [s]ure I acted like one, whether I were [s]incere or not. She cho[s]e to go where [s]he was totally unknown. She would leave the [s]tage, [s]he [s]aid, before it reached Bo[s]ton, and take pa[s][s]age in a more private carriage to Salem, or its vicinity, where [s]he would fix her abode; chalking the initials of my name over the door, as a [s]ignal to me of her re[s]idence. She is exceedingly depre[s][s]ed; and [s]ays [s]he neither expects nor wi[s]hes to [s]urvive her lying in. In[s]anity, for aught I know, mu[s]t be my lot, if [s]he [s]hould die. But I will not harbor the idea. I hope, one time or other, to have the power to make her amends, even by marriage. My wife may be provoked, I imagine, to [s]ue for a divorce. If [s]he [s]hould, [s]he would find no difficulty in obtaining it; and then I would take Eliza in her [s]tead. Though I confe[s]s that the idea of being thus connected with a woman whom I have been able to di[s]honor would be rather hard to [s]urmount. It would hurt even my delicacy, little as you [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-245.jpg) \- external link  - Page 242. ] may think me to po[s][s]e[s]s, to have a wife whom I know to be [s]educible. And, on this account, I cannot be po[s]itive that even Eliza would retain my love. My Nancy and I have lived a pretty uncomfortable life, of late. She has been very [s]u[s]picious of my amour with Eliza; and now and then expre[s][s]ed her jealous [s]entiments a little more warmly than my patience would bear. But the news of Eliza's circum[s]tances and retirement, being publicly talked of, have reached her ears, and rendered her quite out-rageous. She tells me [s]he will no longer brook my indifference and infidelity; intends [s]oon to return to her father's hou[s]e, and extricate her[s]elf from me intirely. My general reply to all this, is, that [s]he knew my character before we married, and could rea[s]onably expect nothing le[s]s than what has happened. I [s]hall not oppo[s]e her leaving me, as it may conduce to the execution of the plan I have hinted above. To morrow I [s]hall [s]et out to vi[s]it my disconsolate fair one. From my very [s]oul I pity her; and wi[s]h I could have pre[s]erved her virtue con[s]i[s]tently with the indulgence of my pa[s][s]ion. To her I lay not the principal blame, as in like ca[s]es, I do to the [s]ex in general. My fine[s][s]e was too well planned for detection, and my [s]nares too deeply laid for any one to e[s]cape who had the lea[s]t warmth in her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-246.jpg) \- external link  - Page 243. ] constitution, or affection in her heart. I [s]hall, therefore, be the le[s]s whim[s]ical about a future connection, and the more [s]olicitous to make her reparation, [s]hould it ever be in my power. Her friends are all in arms about her. I dare [s]ay I have the imprecations of the whole fraternity. They may thank them[s]elves in part; for I always [s]wore revenge for their dislike and coldne[s]s towards me. Had they been politic, they would have conducted more like the aborigines of the country, who are [s]aid to wor[s]hip the devil out of fear. I am afraid I [s]hall be obliged to remove my quarters; for Eliza was [s]o great a favorite in town, that I am looked upon with an evil eye. I plead with her before we parted la[s]t, to forgive my [s]educing her; alledged my ardent love, and my inability to po[s][s]e[s]s her in any other way. How, [s]aid [s]he, can that be love which de[s]troys its object? But granting what you [s]ay, you have fru[s]trated your own purpo[s]e. You have deprived your[s]elf of my [s]ociety, which might have been innocently enjoyed. You have cut me off from life in the mid[s]t of my days. You have rendered me the reproach of my friends, the di[s]grace of my family, and a di[s]honor to virtue and my [s]ex! but I forgive you, added [s]he. Yes, Sanford, I forgive you; and [s]incerely pray for your repentance and reformation. I hope to be the la[s]t wretched female, [s]acrificed by you to the arts of fal[s]ehood and [s]eduction! [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-247.jpg) \- external link  - Page 244. ] May my unhappy [s]tory [s]erve as a beacon to warn the American fair of the dangerous tendency and de[s]tructive con[s]equences of associating with men of your character, of destroying their time, and ri[s]king their reputation by the practice of coquetry and its attendant follies! But for the[s]e, I might have been honorably connected; and capable, at this moment, of diffu[s]ing and receiving happine[s]s! But for your arts, I might have remained a ble[s][s]ing to [s]ociety, as well as the delight and comfort of my friends! Your being a married man un[s]peakably aggravates both your guilt and mine. This circum[s]tance annexes indelible [s]hame to our crime! You have rent a[s]under the tendere[s]t ties of nature! You have broken the bonds of conjugal love, which ought ever to be kept [s]acred and inviolate! You have filled with grief and di[s]content the heart of your amiable wife, whom gratitude, if no other principle, [s]hould have induced you to cheri[s]h with tenderne[s]s; and I, wretch that I am, have been your accomplice! But I cea[s]e to reproach you. You have acted but too con[s]i[s]tently with the character, which I was [s]ufficiently appri[s]ed you [s]u[s]tained. The blame then may be retorted on my[s]elf, for di[s]regarding the coun[s]els, warnings and admonitions of my be[s]t friends. You have prided your[s]elf in the character of a libertine. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-248.jpg) \- external link  - Page 245. ] Glory no longer in your [s]hame! You have accompli[s]hed your de[s]igns; your dreadful de[s]igns again[s]t me! Let this [s]uffice. Add not to the number of tho[s]e deluded creatures, who will one day ri[s]e up in judgment again[s]t you, and condemn you. By this time we had nearly reached the inn, and were [s]oon to part. I [s]eized her hand and exclaimed, you mu[s]t not leave me, Eliza, with that awful anathema on your lips! Oh, [s]ay that you will forget my pa[s]t faults. That, [s]aid [s]he, I [s]hall [s]oon do; for in the grave there is no remembrance! This to my mind, was a har[s]her [s]entence than the other; and almo[s]t threw me into de[s]pair. Never was [s]o wrought upon before! I knew not what to [s]ay or do! She [s]aw my di[s]tre[s]s, and kindly [s]oftened her manner. If I am [s]evere, [s]aid [s]he, it is becau[s]e I wi[s]h to impre[s]s your mind with [s]uch a [s]en[s]e of your offences again[s]t your Maker, your friends and [s]ociety in general, as may effect your repentance and amendment. I wi[s]h not to be your accu[s]er, but your reformer. On [s]everal accounts, I view my own crime in a more aggravated light than yours; but my con[s]cience is awakened to a conviction of my guilt. Yours, I fear is not. Let me conjure you to return home, and endeavor by you future kindne[s]s and sidelity to your wife, to make her all the amends in your power. By a life of virtue and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-249.jpg) \- external link  - Page 246. ] religion, you may yet become a valuable member of [s]ociety, and [s]ecure happine[s]s both here and hereafter. I begged leave to vi[s]it her retirement next week, not in continuation of our amour, but as a friend, [s]olicitous to know her [s]ituation and welfare. Unable to [s]peak, [s]he only bowed a[s][s]ent. The [s]tage being now ready, I whi[s]pered [s]ome tender things in her ear, and ki[s][s]ing her cheek, which was all [s]he would permit, [s]uffered her to depart. My body remains behind; but my [s]oul, if I have any, went with her! This was a horrid lecture, Charles! She brought every charge again[s]t me, which a fruitful and gloomy imagination could [s]ugge[s]t! But I hope, when [s]he recovers, [s]he will resume her former cheerfulne[s]s, and become as kind and agreeable as ever. My anxiety for her [s]afety is very great. I tru[s]t, however, it will [s]oon be removed; and peace and pleasure be re[s]tored to your humble [s]ervant, Peter Sanford . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-250.jpg) \- external link  - Page 247. ] - -  Hartford The drama is now clo[s]ed! A tragical one indeed it has proved! How [s]incerely, my dear Mrs. Sumner, mu[s]t the friends of our departed Eliza, [s]ympathize with each other; and with her afflicted, bereaved parent! You have doubtle[s]s [s]een the account, in the public papers, which gave us the melancholy intelligence. But I will give you a detail of circum[s]tances. A few days after my la[s]t was written, we heard that Major Sanford's property was attached, and he a pri[s]oner in his own hou[s]e. He was the la[s]t man, to whom we wi[s]hed to apply for information re[s]pecting the forlorn wanderer; yet we had no other re[s]ource. And after waiting a fortnight in the mo[s]t cruel [s]u[s]pen[s]e, we wrote a billet, entreating him, if po[s][s]ible, to give [s]ome intelligence concerning her. He replied, that he was unhappily [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-251.jpg) \- external link  - Page 248. ] deprived of all means of knowing him[s]elf; but hoped [s]oon to relieve his own, and our anxiety about her. In this [s]ituation we continued, till a neighbor (purpo[s]ely, we [s]ince concluded) [s]ent us a Bo[s]ton paper. Mrs. Wharton took it, and incon[s]cious of its contents, ob[s]erved that the peru[s]al might divert her, a few moments. She read for [s]ome time; when it [s]uddenly dropped upon the floor. She cla[s]ped her hands together, and rai[s]ing her [s]treaming eyes to heaven, exclaimed, It is the Lord; let him do what he will! Be [s]till, O my [s]oul, and know that he is God! What, madam, [s]aid I, can be the matter? She an[s]wered not; but with inexpre[s][s]ible anguish depicted in her countenance, pointed to the paper. I took it up, and [s]oon found the fatal paragraph. I [s]hall not attempt to paint our heart felt grief and lamentation upon this occa[s]ion; for we had no doubt of Eliza's being the per[s]on de[s]cribed, as a [s]tranger, who died at Danvers, la[s]t July. Her delivery of a child; her dejected [s]tate of mind; the marks upon her linen; indeed, every circumstance in the adverti[s]ement convinced us beyond di[s]pute, that it could be no other. Mrs. Wharton retired immediately to her chamber, where [s]he continued overwhelmed with [s]orrow that night and the following day. Such, in fact, has been her habitual frame ever [s]ince; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-252.jpg) \- external link  - Page 249. ] though the endeavors of her friends, who have [s]ought to con[s]ole her, have rendered her somewhat more conver[s]able. My te[s]timony of Eliza's penitence, before her departure, is a [s]ource of comfort to this di[s]con[s]olate parent. She fondly cheri[s]hed the idea, that having expiated her offence by [s]incere repentance and amendment, her deluded child finally made a happy exchange of worlds. But the de[s]perate resolution, which [s]he formed, and executed of becoming a fugitive; of de[s]erting her mother's hou[s]e and protection, and of wandering and dying among [s]trangers, is a mo[s]t di[s]tre[s][s]ing reflection to her friends; e[s]pecially to her mother, in who[s]e brea[s]t [s]o many painful ideas ari[s]e, that [s]he finds it extremely difficult to compo[s]e her[s]elf to that re[s]ignation, which [s]he evidently [s]trives to exemplify. Eliza's brother has been to vi[s]it her la[s]t retreat; and to learn the particulars of her melancholy exit. He relates, that [s]he was well accommodated, and had every attention and a[s][s]i[s]tance, which her [s]ituation required. The people where [s]he re[s]ided appear to have a lively [s]en[s]e of her merit and misfortunes. They te[s]tify her mode[s]t deportment, her fortitude under the [s]ufferings to which [s]he was called, and the [s]erenity and compo[s]ure, with which [s]he bid a la[s]t adieu to the world. Mr. Wharton has brought back [s]everal [s]craps of her writing, containing mi[s]cellaneous [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-253.jpg) \- external link  - Page 250. ] reflections on her [s]ituation, the death of her babe, and the ab[s]ence of her friends. Some of the[s]e were written before, [s]ome after her confinement. The[s]e valuable te[s]timonies of the affecting [s]en[s]e, and calm expectation [s]he entertained of her approaching di[s][s]olution, are calculated to [s]ooth and comfort the minds of mourning connections. They greatly alleviate the regret occa[s]ioned by her ab[s]ence, at this awful period. Her elopement can be equalled only by the infatuation which cau[s]ed her ruin. "But let no one reproach her memory. Her life has paid the forfeit of her folly. Let that [s]uffice." I am told that Major Sanford is quite frantic. Sure I am that he has rea[s]on to be. If the mi[s]chiefs he has brought upon others return upon his own head, dreadful indeed mu[s]t be his portion! His wife has left him, and returned to her parents. His e[s]tate, which has been long mortgaged, is taken from him; and poverty and di[s]grace await him! Heaven [s]eldom leaves injured innocence unavenged! Wretch, that he is, he ought for ever to be bani[s]hed from human [s]ociety! I [s]hall continue with Mrs. Wharton, till the lenient hand of time has a[s][s]uaged her [s]orrows; and then make my promi[s]ed vi[s]it to you. I will bring Eliza's po[s]thumous papers with me, when I come to Bo[s]ton, as I have not time to copy them now. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-254.jpg) \- external link  - Page 251. ] I fore[s]ee, my dear Mrs. Sumner, that this di[s]a[s]trous affair will [s]u[s]pend your enjoyments, as it has mine. But what are our feelings, compared with the pangs which rend a parent's heart? This parent, I here behold, inhumanly [s]tripped of the be[s]t [s]olace of her declining years, by the en[s]naring machinations of a profligate debauchee! Not only the life, but what was [s]till dearer, the reputation and virtue of the unfortunate Eliza, have fallen victims at the [s]hrine of libertini[s]m! Dete[s]ted be the epithet! Let it henceforth bear its true [s]ignature, and candor it[s]elf [s]hall call it lu[s]t and brutality! Execrable is the man, however arrayed in magnificence, crowned with wealth, or decorated with the external graces and accomplishments of fa[s]hionable life, who [s]hall pre[s]ume to di[s]play them, at the expen[s]e of virtue and innocence! Sacred names! attended with real ble[s][s]ings; ble[s][s]ings too u[s]eful and important to be trifled away! My re[s]entment at the ba[s]e arts, which mu[s]t have been employed to complete the [s]eduction of Eliza, I cannot [s]uppre[s]s. I wi[s]h them to be expo[s]ed, and [s]tamped with univer[s]al ignominy! Nor do I doubt but you will join with me in execrating the mea[s]ures by which we have been robbed of [s]o valuable a friend; and [s]ociety , of [s]o ornamental a member. I am,  &c. Julia Granby .

Oh, Deighton, I am undone! Mi[s]ery irremediable is my future lot! She is gone; yes, [s]he is gone for ever! The darling of my [s]oul, the centre of all my wi[s]hes and enjoyments is no more! Cruel fate has [s]natched her from me; and [s]he is irretrievably lo[s]t! I rave, and then reflect: I reflect, and then rave! I have not patience to bear this calamity, nor power to remedy it! Where [s]hall I fly from the upbraidings of my mind, which accu[s]es me as the murderer of my Eliza? I would fly to death, and [s]eek a refuge in the grave; but the forebodings of a retribution to come, I cannot away with! Oh, that I had [s]een her; that I had once more a[s]ked her forgivene[s]s! But even that privilege, that con[s]olation was denied me! The day on which I meant to vi[s]it her, mo[s]t of my property was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-256.jpg) \- external link  - Page 253. ] attached, and to [s]ecure the re[s]t, I was obliged to [s]hut my doors, and become a pri[s]oner in my own hou[s]e! High living, and old debts, incurred by extravagance, had reduced the fortune of my wife to very little, and I could not [s]atisfy the clamorous demands of my creditors. I would have given millions, had I po[s][s]e[s][s]ed them, to have been at liberty to [s]ee, and to have had power to pre[s]erve Eliza from death! But in vain was my anxiety; it could not relieve; it could not liberate me! When I fir[s]t heard the dreadful tidings of her exit, I believe I acted like a madman! Indeed, I am little el[s]e now! I have compounded with my creditors, and re[s]igned the whole of my property. Thus, that [s]plendor and equipage, to [s]ecure which, I have [s]acrificed a virtuous woman, is taken from me; that poverty, the dread of which prevented my forming an honorable connection with an amiable and accompli[s]hed girl, the only one I ever loved, has fallen, with redoubled vengeance, upon my guilty head; and I mu[s]t become a vagabond in the earth! I [s]hall fly my country as [s]oon as po[s][s]ible; I [s]hall go from every object which reminds me of my departed Eliza! But never, never [s]hall I eradicate from my bo[s]om the idea of her excellence; or the painful remembrance of the injuries I have done her!

The image of her, as [s]he appeared when mounting the carriage which conveyed her for ever from my [s]ight, [s]he waved her hand in token of a la[s]t adieu, will always be pre[s]ent to my imagination! The [s]olemn coun[s]el [s]he gave me before we parted, never more to meet, will not cea[s]e to re[s]ound in my ears! While my being is prolonged, I mu[s]t feel the di[s]graceful, and torturing effects of my guilt in [s]educing her! How madly have I deprived her of happine[s]s, of reputation, of life! Her friends, could they know the pangs of contrition, and the horror of con[s]cience which attend me, would be amply revenged! It is [s]aid, [s]he quitted the world with composure and peace. Well [s]he might! She had not that in[s]upportable weight of iniquity, which [s]inks me to de[s]pair! She found consolation in that religion, which I have ridiculed as prie[s]tcraft and hypocri[s]y! But whether it be true, or fal[s]e, would to heaven I could now enjoy the comforts, which its votaries evidently feel! My wife has left me. As we lived together without love, we parted without regret. Now, Charles, I am to bid you a long, perhaps, a la[s]t farewell. Where I [s]hall roam in future, I neither know nor care; I [s]hall go where the name of Sanford is unknown; and his per[s]on and [s]orrows unnoticed.

I have not money to [s]upport me with my profligate companions; nor have I any reli[s]h, at pre[s]ent, for their [s]ociety. By the virtuous part of the community, I am [s]hunned as the pe[s]t and bane of [s]ocial enjoyment. In [s]hort I am debarred from every kind of happiness. If I look back, I recoil with horror from the black catalogue of vices, which have [s]tained my pa[s]t life, and reduced me to indigence and contempt. If I look forward, I [s]hudder at the pro[s]pects which my foreboding mind pre[s]ents to view, both in this and a coming world! This is a deplorable, yet ju[s]t picture of myself! How totally the rever[s]e of what I once appeared! Let it warn you, my friend, to [s]hun the dangerous paths which I have trodden, that you may never be involved in the hopele[s]s ignominy and wretchedne[s]s of Peter Sanford .

Is [s]he then gone! gone in this mo[s]t distressing manner! Have I lo[s]t my once loved friend; lo[s]t her in a way which I could never have conceived to be po[s][s]ible. Our days of childhood were [s]pent together in the [s]ame pur[s]uits, in the [s]ame amu[s]ements. Our riper years encrea[s]ed our mutual affection, and maturer judgment mo[s]t firmly cemented our friend[s]hip. Can I then calmly re[s]ign her to [s]o [s]evere a fate! Can I bear the idea of her being lo[s]t to honor, to fame, and to life! No; [s]he [s]hall [s]till live in the heart of her faithful Lucy; who[s]e experience of her numerous virtues and engaging qualities, has imprinted her image too deeply on the memory to be obliterated. However [s]he may have erred, her [s]incere repentance is [s]ufficient to re[s]tore her to charity. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-260.jpg) \- external link  - Page 257. ] Your letter gave me the fir[s]t information of this awful event. I had taken a [s]hort excursion into the country, where I had not [s]een the papers; or if I had, paid little or no attention to them. By your directions I found the di[s]tre[s][s]ing narrative of her exit. The poignancy of my grief, and the unavailing lamentations which the intelligence excited, need no delineation. To [s]cenes of this nature, you have been habituted in the man[s]ion of [s]orrow, where you re[s]ide. How [s]incerely I [s]ympathize with the bereaved parent of the dear, decea[s]ed Eliza, I can feel, but have not power to expre[s]s. Let it be her con[s]olation, that her child is at re[s]t. The re[s]olution which carried this deluded wanderer thus far from her friends, and [s]upported her through her various trials, is astonishing! Happy would it have been, had [s]he exerted an equal degree of fortitude in repelling the fir[s]t attacks upon her virtue! But [s]he is no more; and heaven forbid that I [s]hould accu[s]e or reproach her! Yet, in what language [s]hall I expre[s]s my abhorrence of the mon[s]ter, who[s]e dete[s]table arts have bla[s]ted one of the faire[s]t flowers in creation? I leave him to God, and his own con[s]cience! Already is he expo[s]ed in his true colors! Vengeance already begins to overtake him! His [s]ordid mind mu[s]t now [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-261.jpg) \- external link  - Page 258. ] [s]uffer the deprivation of tho[s]e [s]en[s]ual gratifications, beyond which he is incapable of enjoyment! Upon your reflecting and [s]teady mind, my dear Julia, I need not inculcate the le[s][s]ons which may be drawn from this woe-fraught tale; but for the [s]ake of my [s]ex in general, I wi[s]h it engraved upon every heart, that virtue alone, independent of the trappings of wealth, the parade of equipage, and the adulation of gallantry, can [s]ecure la[s]ting felicity. From the melancholy [s]tory of Eliza Wharton, let the American fair learn to reject with disdain every in[s]inuation derogatory to their true dignity and honor. Let them de[s]pi[s]e, and for ever bani[s]h the man, who can glory in the [s]eduction of innocence and the ruin of reputation. To a[s][s]ociate, is to approve; to approve, is to be betrayed! I am, &c. Lucy Sumner .

The day after my arrival, Mrs. Sumner propo[s]ed that we [s]hould vi[s]it the [s]ad [s]pot which contains the remains of our once amiable friend. The grave of Eliza Wharton, [s]aid [s]he, [s]hall not be unbedewed by the tears of friend[s]hip. Ye[s]terday we went accordingly, and were much plea[s]ed with the apparent [s]incerity of the people, in their a[s][s]urances that every thing in their power had been done to render her [s]ituation comfortable. The minute[s]t circumstances were faithfully related; and from the [s]tate of her mind, in her la[s]t hours, I think much comfort may be derived to her afflicted friends. We [s]pent a mournful hour, in the place where [s]he is intered, and then returned to the inn, while Mrs. Sumner gave orders for [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf104&image=104-263.jpg) \- external link  - Page 260. ] a decent [s]tone to be erected over her grave, with the following in[s]cription: "THIS HUMBLE STONE, IN MEMORY OF ELIZA WHARTON, IS INSCRIBED BY HER WEEPING FRIENDS, TO WHOM SHE ENDEARED HERSELF BY UNCOMMON TENDERNESS AND AFFECTION  . ENDOWED WITH SUPERIOR ACQUIREMENTS, SHE WAS STILL MORE DISTINGUISHED BY HUMILITY AND BENEVOLENCE  . LET CANDOR THROW A VEIL OVER HER FRAILTIES, FOR GREAT WAS HER CHARITY TO OTHERS  . SHE SUSTAINED THE LAST PAINFUL SCENE, FAR FROM EVERY FRIEND; AND EXHIBITED AN EXAMPLE OF CALM RESIGNATION  . HER DEPARTURE WAS ON THE 25th DAY OF JULY, A. D.  \---, IN THE 27th YEAR OF HER AGE, AND THE TEARS OF STRANGERS WATERED HER  GRAVE."
