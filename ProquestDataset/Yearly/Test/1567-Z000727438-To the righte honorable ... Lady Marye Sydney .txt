 to his poffteritye to resemble his doynges, as a glasse and mirroir to theym of moste excellent vertues, so when histories are published to the common proffyt of al men, euery one goeth aboute to confirme himselfe to the vertuous conuersation and lyfe of suche as excelled amongst the elders, wherein me seameth Nycephorus saied veray well, that those whiche write Histories, and kepe not that which is profitable and praise worthie (as it were) in their stoare house at hoame, but rather beinge benefyciall to the common welthe, do expose so common a profitt to the generall commoditie of all men, are (as it were) th'executours of Gods diuine prouidence, because they comprise and packe vpp in one worke or volume (as in a common treasore, sondrye sortes of noble deedes, without inhibition or lett to any degree, to resorte thereunto, and learne by othermens misdeeds, to direct better his owne doinges, and not with th'exchange of the worlde to alter also his minde, but rather asmuche as lyeth in hym, to ymitate the lyfe and conuersation of theym, who haue lyued well before, wherein seinge in this worlde the nature of man in all ages, althoughe the singler personnes bee chaunged, remeineth stil one, so also the good fortunes, felicities, calamities and miseries whyche happen both in publike gouernement and to euerye priuate state, tourne alwayes to one effect and are lyke those of tymes paste, so that by the benefyt of stories, presentinge afore oure eyes a true kallender of things of auncient date, by the commendacion of vertuous, and valyaunt personnes and actes: we be drawen by desyer to treade the stepps of their renowme, and on thother syde, considering the sinister fortune & horrible cases, which haue happened to certeine miserable soules, we behold both th'extreme points wherunto the fraile condicion of man is subiect by infirmitie, and also are there by toughte by the viewe of other mens harmes to eschew the like inconueniences in our selues: wherein (righte honorable) like as I haue rather touched sleightelye, then vsed tearmes of commendacion at large according to the worthynes of so precious a Iewell as the knowledg of histories, for that now a dayes euery mans mouth is open to commende the frute distilling from so florishynge a vine so for my part, beyng more forwarde then hable to discharge my zeale in that behalfe, haue bestowed some of my voyed howers whilest I was in the other sides the Sea, in forcynge certeyne Tragicall Discourses oute of theyr Frenche tearmes, into our Englishe phrase, presumyng to commende vnto your Ladishypp the frutes and effecte of my trauayle, folowynge therein the order of suche as haue spente tyme in the lyke studye, who are wounte to declare theyr good wyll, by bestowynge theyr labours: wherewithe beinge vnhappelye denyed other frendshypp of fortune to make good my desyer in gyuing an vnfayned showe of the dutye and seruice I owe you and the house whereof you tooke youre begynnynge, am here vppon tearmes of humilitye for preferment of this rude and simple dedication of theis forein reapportes to youre honor, to whose vertues, as I haue chiefelye respected to gyue due renowme, by preferrynge a true purtraict of your conuersation and lyfe in the vertues giftes and ornamentes of the noble ANGELIQVA chaste PAROLYNA , constrant IVLIA and renowned CARMOSYNA wyth others, whose integretye of life hath gyuen theim a crowne of immortalitye, wyth a glorious remembrance of theyr names for euer after theyr deathe, so my seconde indeuor was bent to obserue the necessitie of the tyme, chiefly, for that vppon the viewe and examples of oure Auncesters lyues, the fraile ympes of this age, maye fynde cause of shame in theyr owne abuses, wyth desyer to exchaunge their badd condicion and order of lyuynge, wyth the studye and desyer to ymitate the vertue of their predecessours, whose lyfe and renowme after death, argueth the vndoubted rewarde, at tendynge (as a thynge of course) the vertuouse and well disposed, where of the contrarye, appeare wounderfull formentes and sharpp pennaunce prouided to plage the abhominable and vicious lyuer: Besides it is a principle and chiefe rule in our nature and disposition to bee rather instructed by examples of familyar authorityes, then reformed by seueritye of lawes, for that the one seames to gouerne vs by awe and commaundement, and in the other appeares a consent of oure fancie, marchinge alwayes accordynge to the direction of our owne willes, for whiche cause the Historians of olde tyme (in theyr seuerall recordes of the actes, conquestes, and noble attemptes of Princes and greate men) haue lefte oute nothynge seruynge for the ornamente and institution of mannes lyfe, not forgettynge to sett oute also in naturall coollers, theyr tyrannye and other vices, withe contempte of vertue, yf theyr lyues were founde guiltye in any suche offence: But when they paynte oute a good kynge, a magistrate without touche of partiall or couetous mynde, a courtyar loyall and withoute dissimulation, A minister of the Churche not smellynge of hypocrysye, but searchynge purelye the honor of God, A Ladye chaste, honeste, curteouse, a louer of charitye, vsynge a deuoute reuerence to God and feare to hys lawes, yt is then that they allure (by traines of familyarisye) euerye successiou to embrace and beholde (as in a glasse) the vndoubted meane that is hable and wyll brynge theym to the lyke perfection in vertue, whyche also moued me to vse a speciall discrecion in collynge oute suche examples as beste aggreed wyth the condicion of the tyme, and also were of moste freshe and famylyar memorye, to the ende that wyth the delyte in readynge my dedication, I maye also leaue to all degrees, an appetitt and honeste desyere to honor vertue and holde vice in due desestation. And albeit at the firste sighte theis discourses maye importe certeyne vanytyes or fonde practises in loue, yet I doubte not to bee absolued of suche intente by the iudgement of the indifferent sorte, seinge I haue rather noted diuersitie of examples in sondrye younge men and women, approuynge sufficientlye the inconuenience happenynge by the pursute of lycenceous desyer, then affected in anye sorte suche vncerteine follyes: For heare maye bee seene suche parternes of chastetye, and maydes so assured and constant in vertue, that they haue not doubted rather to reappose a felicitye in the extreme panges of death, then to fall by anye violent force into the daunger of the fleshelye ennemye to theyr honour: In lyke sorte appeareth here an experience of wonderfull vertues in men, who albeit hadd power to vse and commande the thinge they chieflye desyered, yet (bridlynge wythe maine hande) The humour of theyr inordinate luste, vanquished all mocions of sensualytye, and became maisters of theym selues, by abstaynynge from that whereunto they felte prouocation by nature: who desyereth to see the follye of a foolishe louer passionynge hymselfe vppon creditt, the impudencie of a maide or other woman renouncynge the vowe of her fayth or honor due to virginittie, the sharpp pennance attendynge the rashe choice of greate Ladyes in seekynge to matche in anye sorte wythe degr ees of inferior condicion: or who wisheth to bee priuie to th'inconueniences in loue, howe he frieth in the flame of the fyrste affection, and after groweth not onelye colde of hymselfe, but is easelye conuerted into a contrarye shapp and disposition of deadlye hate, maye bee heare assisted wyth more then double expeperience touchinge all those euills: the curtesie of an enemye on the behalfe of hys aduersarye, wythe a wounderfull lyberalitye in the other in retournynge the benefytt receyued, is heare set furthe in suche lyuelye coollers, that there seames to lacke nothynge for the ornament and decoracion of suche a woorke. And who takes pleasure to beholde the fyttes and panges of a frantique man incensed to synister conceites by the suggestion of frettynge Ielouzye, foreynge hym to effectes of absolute desperation, The due plage of disloyaltye in both kyndes, wyth the glorye of hym who marcheth vnder the enseigne of a contrarye vertue, a man of the churche of dissolute lyuyng punished with publike reproche, or the villenie of the greedye vsurer makyng no conscience to preferr oppen periury in suppressynge th'innocent cause, maye fynde here to satisfye his longynge at full, neyther do I thynke that oure Englishe recordes are hable to yelde at this daye, a Romant more delicat and chaste, treatynge of the veraye theame and effectes of loue, then theis hystories, of no lesse credit then sufficient authoritie, by reason the moste of theym were within the compasse of memorye, wherein as I with the tormentes that pinched here suche as labored in a passion of follye and fonde desyer, maye worke a terror to all those that hereafter vnhappelye Syp of the cupp of suche ragynge infection, so touchinge the commendable partes of anye Ladye or woman of meaner condicion, mencioned in this volume of discourses, I synde theym farr to lighte to kepe wayghte wyth the ballance, wherein are paised the qualityes of your honor, whyche seame to haue a certeine affinitye and resemblance wyth suche as were the verye vertuse and causes of commendacion in any that euer deserued the title of moste perfect or iustlye renowmed: For yf euer the Quene of Carya was meritorious for her magnanimytye and bountifull disposition, the quene of Saba whiche some writers call Nycaula , suche that both the olde and newe testament affirme, that she traueled from the ende of the worlde and extreme confynes of the lande of Iuda , to come and heare the doctrine of Salomon , wyth whome she disputed no lesse learnedly then wyth profoude iudgement, or if the constant Ladye Claudina a Christrian borne in the harte of Europe hath purchassed a crowne of eternetye, in kepinge her fayth and vowe to God and the worlde euen to the laste seperacion of 6 her sowle and bodye, or yf any other, eyther of antiquitye or familyar experience, of what degree and condicion so euer, haue bene noted of renowme for the gyfte of nobilitye in anye sorte, your Ladishipp maye boldelye chalenge place wyth the best, eyther for moderate gouernement. whose effectes in all thynges you attempte, argue your worthie participacion with the excellent giftes of temperance, and wonderful modestie in, the ij. moste famous Erles of leicester & Warwike your brotherne, & most vertuous and renowmed Ladye the Countesse of Huntington your syster, to whose glorie and general loue amongst all sortes of people in this lande, I nede not add further circumstance or increase yf praise, considerynge the whole state, firinge theyr eyes vppon theym wyth an vnfained zeale and admiracion of their wisdome and vertues, do aduouche in more ample sorte their good will that waye, then I am eyther worthie or hable to declare. And for your clemencie to the case of th'afflicted, vprighte dealynge wythout eraction or cause of grudge to any, wonderfull respecte to the honor of your callynge, wyth dutyfull awe and feare of Godd, and obedience to my Lord your husbande, or other arguments or effects, wherein consistes the praise of a vertuous mind, or ought to appeare the frutes of true nobilitie, they make you not so muche honored in your contreye, as embrased of strangers, who neuer sawe nor knewe you but by name, who also doubte not to make your sincere and deuout order of lyuynge, a lookyng glasse to beholde & followe your vertues, and by your order of doing, to drawe the plat and foundacion of their owne life, which shal suffice for this tyme (good madam) for the commendacion of that, whiche is sufficietly perfect of it self, & so generallie honored of all degrees that it nede not th'assisttae of any peculiar praise: hublie crauing for my part a priuiledge of fauor at your hades so far furthe, as it maye bee lawfull for me to laye theis firste frutes of my trauel vppon the alter alredye garnished wyth other oblacions of your euerlastynge glorye as a remembrance of an humble sacrifice, whiche, I make of my litle labor and contynuall seruice vowed to your Ladishipp so longe as God and nature will allow my abode in this miserable vale; at my chamber at Paris , XXII.
