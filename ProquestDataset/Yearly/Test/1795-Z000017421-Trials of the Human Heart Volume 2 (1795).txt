I am obliged to you for the very generous [s]entiments [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-183.jpg) \- external link  - Page 004. ] expressed in tho[s]e letters, towards my whole family, and beg leave to inform you, that your kind wi[s]hes, re[s]pecting my [s]on's happiness, are amply fulfilled, as he was yesterday married to a very amiable woman, possessing a fortune of twenty thou[s]and pounds. I am, madam, your humble [s]ervant, F. RAINSFORTH. WITH this letter, my dear Celia, came a parcel containing all the letters I had ever wrote to Rainsforth; and believe me, the unfeeling tenor of his father's letter did not hurt me half [s]o much, as the idea of his cruelty, in [s]uffering his father fir[s]t to peru[s]e, and then return them; my pride was alarmed, my [s]en[s]ibility [s]hocked! a man in whom I placed [s]uch implicit confidence; one whom I thought endowed with every virtue. Celia, I feel a painful void in my heart; I feel that I [s]hall never again place a confidence in any man. My cou[s]in He[s]ter has frequently told me, that Rainsforth was decietful, that he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-184.jpg) \- external link  - Page 005. ] [s]aw my partiality and played upon it, merely for his own diver[s]ion; but I always doubted; nay, to [s]uch a height was my enthusiasm rai[s]ed, I could not have believed it po[s][s]ible for one who wore [s]o fair a [s]emblance of virtue, to be [s]o very fal[s]e, [s]o unaccountably wanton in his cruelty towards an inoffensive girl, who[s]e whole [s]oul was ab[s]orbed in one affectionate wi[s]h for his felicity: why, when I had taught my heart to re[s]ign him without a murmur; why, when the fir[s]t hard trial was pa[s]t, and every hope was extinguished, did he [s]eek to awaken a pa[s][s]ion, which, tho' rea[s]on had in [s]ome mea[s]ure repelled its violence, was [s]till tender, [s]till ardent in my bo[s]om. Oh! my friend, had he without renewing the corre[s]pondence which we had mutually agreed to drop, given his hand to Mi[s]s Kingly, I [s]hould not have complained; no, my Celia, [s]o pure was my love, that I [s]hould have exulted in his felicity, and whil[s]t I thought him worthy of every ble[s][s]ing, have rejoiced to [s]ee them placed within his reach. But alas! he is not worthy, and perhaps this poor gentle affectionate girl, for [s]uch I am told [s]he is, may [s]oon experience a change in his [s]entiments, when [s]he has neither the power to leave him, nor liberty to complain of his conduct.

I begin to be more compo[s]ed; I am resolved to de[s]pi[s]e the whole [s]ex; they may wear a [s]emblance of virtue, but the reality of it is foreign to their hearts. Every occurrence of life will be now equally indifferent to me; I have vowed to devote my[s]elf to my mother while [s]he lives, and whenever heaven plea[s]es to call her away, my incessant prayer [s]hall be [s]oon to follow; I do not wi[s]h to go before her, becau[s]e, I [s]ee her only hope of [s]upport mu[s]t proceed from me; and unboundedly grateful will be my heart, if by any means whatever I can pre[s]erve her from mi[s]ery. May 29 th . It was certainly a wi[s]e di[s]pen[s]ation of Providence, that prevented my union with Rainsforth; had I been [s]eparated from my dear mother, where now would [s]he have found a comforter. My father is in pri[s]on Celia; my whole fortune is expended; but thank heaven, I have [s]till health and [s]trength to work. I live in a mi[s]erable apartment in the Fleet pri[s]on, I [s]it lo[s]t as it were to every thing but mi[s]ery; but yet, my dear Celia, I can look up to heaven with gratitude; I am not a wife, I am not a mother, I feel not the [s]trong chords of maternal [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-186.jpg) \- external link  - Page 007. ] affection twining round my heart, and wringing it with unutterable angui[s]h; I might have been more wretched than I am: and whil[s]t I can [s]ay that, let me expre[s]s only gratitude towards the great Ruler of the universe, who has not tried me beyond my [s]trength to [s]upport. Can you think, my friend, that in this mi[s]erable [s]ituation I have yet one ray of comfort breaks on my benighted [s]oul; yes, Celia, I have: my dear mother is at length convinced, that my love, my dutiful attentions, are the re[s]ult of the feelings of my heart. On me alone [s]he now re[s]ts; to me alone looks for comfort; her eyes once more beam on me with affection; her heart again is lift up to heaven for my felicity; and who my dear friend, who that knows the ju[s]t value of maternal love, would not gladly re[s]ign wealth, nay almo[s]t every consideration, to enjoy [s]o ine[s]timable a ble[s][s]ing. I cannot at this time give you particulars; indeed, I know not why I [s]hould write to you at all, for [s]ure my letters convey no plea[s]ure to your friendly bo[s]om, but I cannot give up the greate[s]t plea[s]ure of my life, unle[s]s you expre[s]sly de[s]ire it. To you I can unfold my thoughts; to you, tell the [s]orrows of my heart; and as I write, fond fancy repre[s]ents you as feeling for my afflictions: I [s]ee the tear of [s]ympathy tremble in your eye; I hear the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-187.jpg) \- external link  - Page 008. ] [s]oft cheering voice of con[s]olation break from your lips: I am [s]oothed; I am comforted by the thought: [s]urely, my Celia, will not refu[s]e, this almo[s]t only con[s]olation to her afflicted MERIEL. MERIEL to CELIA. -  Fleet pri[s]on June 10 th , 1778. I have now [s]at down, to give you the particulars of a [s]cene, which, when I la[s]t wrote, I could not command [s]ufficient composure to deleniate. I had been out one afternoon on particular bu[s]ine[s]s; indeed to look after [s]ome employment, whereby I might conduce to the [s]upport of the family. On my return I found my mother weeping [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-188.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] over a bit of paper, which [s]he held in her hand. I enquired the cau[s]e. She gave me the paper, and I read on it, "Barwell, Sheriff's officer, Carey-[s]treet." "Your father is arre[s]ted, Meriel," [s]aid [s]he. "Gracious heaven!" [s]aid I, "then we are all ruined: but what is the [s]um; at who[s]e [s]uit is he arre[s]ted." "At the [s]uit of that villain Dell," [s]he replied, "for fifty pounds, which he has lent him; no doubt at the gaming table; he al[s]o threatens him with a prosecution for a criminal corre[s]pondence with his wife. Oh heavens!" continued [s]he, redoubling her tears, "when [s]hall I die and be at peace." It was in vain to offer consolation. I did not even attempt it, but resolved, if po[s][s]ible, to [s]ee if any thing could be done, either to ward off the impending blow, or to extricate us from the difficulties attending it. I went immediately to an attorney, made him acquainted with the ca[s]e, and reque[s]ted his advice. He told me there was no redre[s]s, that the money mu[s]t be paid, and in ca[s]e of the pro[s]ecution, it was mo[s]t likely he would be ca[s]t with damages. This intelligence was an additional weight upon my [s]pirits. However, I proceeded to Careystreet, where I found this thoughtle[s]s father [s]urrounded by unfortunate men of the lowest cla[s]s, with a bowl of punch before him, and in the very act of [s]inging a drinking [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-189.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] [s]ong. When he [s]aw me, he looked aba[s]hed. I a[s]ked if I coud [s]peak to him in another room, for my [s]oul [s]hrunk from the [s]ociety of tho[s]e unhappy beings, with whom he [s]eemed [s]o plea[s]ed. When we were accommodated with another apartment, I a[s]ked him, how this debt was contracted, and by what means he meant to di[s]charge it. I cannot repeat to you the an[s]wer he made; it was [s]o replete with contradiction, that I had [s]carcely patience to hear him out. When he had fini[s]hed, I enquired, if that debt was paid, were there no others of the [s]ame [s]ort. "Con[s]ider [s]ir," [s]aid I, "it will not be long I [s]hall have it in my power to an[s]wer the[s]e demands, and when my money is entirely expended, where is my dear mother to find [s]upport." "Ah Meriel," [s]aid he, "you are always more anxious about her than me, you don't care what becomes of your father." "I [s]hould think, [s]ir," [s]aid I with [s]ome warmth, "that I had given [s]ufficient proof of my attention to the happine[s]s of both. I am [s]orry to u[s]e any language to a father, which may be deemed improper; but I mu[s]t [s]ay, had you paid as much attention to your own happine[s]s as was undoubtedly your duty, many of the afflictions, if not all which have fallen upon our family, might have been avoided. I will pay this money [s]ir, and I hope you will not think I take too [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-190.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] great a liberty if I advi[s]e you, hereafter to [s]hun [s]uch unworthy acquaintance as Dell, and [s]trive rather to obtain [s]ome genteel employment, by which the[s]e kind of [s]cenes may in future be avoided. "You talk like a very unfeeling girl, Meriel," [s]aid he. "Do you imagine then it is [s]o ea[s]y for a man, born and brought up a gentleman, to [s]ubmit to the drudgery of servitude: no Mi[s]s; if your ideas are [s]o mean, mine are not, I will [s]tarve fir[s]t, and would rather [s]ee you [s]tarve than have my family di[s]graced by your following any [s]ervile, mean employment." Believe me, Celia, when he uttered the[s]e [s]entiments, I felt [s]o irritated by his fooli[s]h pride, that had not the idea of my [s]uffering mother at that moment obtruded on my mind, I [s]hould have left him to his fate. However, I [s]tifled my ri[s]ing anger, and having given him a draught on my banker to di[s]charge the arre[s]t, returned to con[s]ole my mother. When I entered, I was [s]urpri[s]ed to [s]ee her grief more violent than ever. She was wringing her hands and weeping with great bitterne[s]s. After many fruitless enquiries concerning this fre[s]h torrent of [s]orrow, I learnt that Mr. Le[s]age, the banker, with whom I had placed the trifling remnant of my fortune, was declared a bankrupt. To de[s]cribe my feelings is impo[s][s]ible. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-191.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] However I [s]aw my mother wanted comfort, and I exerted my utmo[s]t power to [s]tifle emotions, which if indulged, would only [s]erve to increase her angui[s]h. "We mu[s]t go to pri[s]on," [s]aid [s]he, "we mu[s]t all go to pri[s]on, and who is to [s]upport us there?" "Providence, my dear mother," [s]aid I, "We will place our hopes on that benign power, who never for[s]akes tho[s]e, who, in full confidence of [s]upport, exert their utmo[s]t abilities and rely on him only for [s]ucce[s]s. Come, come, chear up, thank God, I am healthy and able to work." She gazed on me for a moment; then throwing her arms round me, [s]he cried, "oh! my child, I will doubt your virtue no longer; your heart mu[s]t be pure, or you could not thus rely on heaven for [s]upport; but oh! my dear Meriel, it will wound my heart severely to [s]ee you obliged to labour for subsistence." "Do not think of it," [s]aid I; "let me [s]ee you but tolerably happy and I [s]hall not regret any hard[s]hip, however severe: I will never leave you, my beloved mother; only let me be once more called the child of your affection, and I [s]hall think my[s]elf completely rewarded for every suffering it may plea[s]e heaven to inflict." A few days after this, my father was removed to this mi[s]erable place: we [s]old the be[s]t part [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-192.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] of our furniture and cloaths to di[s]charge the debts owing among our trades people. My mother then came to my father: I do not [s]leep in the pri[s]on, but come here every morning; I perform all their dome[s]tic offices, go out for their provi[s]ion, &c. but as yet, have not been able to procure any work. Indeed, I had hope of being employed by an embroiderer, but on being a[s]ked to give [s]ecurity, for the [s]afety of whatever work I might be entru[s]ted with; I unfortunately happened to mention, being related to Mr. Mo[s][s]op's family; of cour[s]e, the ma[s]ter of the [s]hop applied to my aunt for my character. Celia, this aunt denied any knowledge of me, [s]aid [s]he had no relation who was in circum[s]tances to want employment of that kind, that [s]he had [s]ome knowledge of a young woman of the name of Howard, [s]he believed, I might be very honest but I was certainly no relation of her's. Thus my dear girl, was my laudable design fru[s]trated; for the man naturally enough ob[s]erved if I could be guilty of telling a lie; I might be capable of wor[s]e actions. I hope, however, in a [s]hort time to procure [s]omething to do; for our little [s]tock of money dimini[s]hes very fa[s]t. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-193.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] Augu[s]t 15 th , 1778. Of all the [s]cenes through which we are doomed to pa[s]s, [s]ure none is [s]o truly painful, as that of being witne[s]s to the death of tho[s]e whom nature has placed in a near relation to us; whom, [s]pite of all their errors, we cannot wholly dive[s]t our hearts of tenderness for; and to [s]ee them approach the awful confines of eternity in a frame of mind, that renders all offered comfort ineffectual, to calm their doubts and fears, when the retro[s]pect of their pa[s]t lives fills them only with horror; and the idea of futurity brings nothing but de[s]pair. Such a [s]cene I have lately pa[s]t; my father is no more: he is I hope at peace; to think otherwi[s]e would be an agony too great to bear: poor man, to the very la[s]t he was addicted to the fatal errors that had undone him. Few were the hours he [s]pent in the apartment with my mother, being chiefly at a place, which they call the tap, where he could drown his care, as he vainly imagined, and where he was frequently drawn in to play cards, tho' sometimes for the la[s]t [s]ix-pence he had in his pocket. One evening, at this place he quarrelled with his antagoni[s]t, and high words en[s]ued; from words they went to blows, and my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-194.jpg) \- external link  - Page 015. ] father recieved a [s]troke on his temple, which leveled him with the ground. He fell with the back of his head again[s]t an iron fender which cut him [s]everely and fractured the [s]kull; all a[s][s]i[s]tance was vain; he langui[s]hed four days, in all the complicated agonies of pain of body and di[s]tre[s]s of mind; tho' I flatter my[s]elf he had [s]ome internal comfort in his la[s]t moments, as he [s]eemed more compo[s]ed for about two hours before his death. He earne[s]tly reque[s]ted forgivene[s]s of both my mother and my[s]elf, for the manifold injuries he had done us; but to my great comfort, mentioned no particulars: he al[s]o made a declaration before witne[s][s]es that the man who [s]truck the unfortunate blow, was entirely guiltle[s]s of intentional malice, as he had been the fir[s]t aggre[s][s]or him[s]elf; and the fall was entirely accidental. He expressed a wi[s]h to [s]ee his [s]i[s]ter; in compliance with his earne[s]t de[s]ire I went to her, told her of the melancholy accident, and earnestly reque[s]ted [s]he would vi[s]it my dying father. "Upon my word Meriel," [s]aid [s]he, "I am extremely [s]orry for this [s]hocking affair; but you know child my [s]eeing him will be of no u[s]e; it will only be hurting my own feelings, with out being of the lea[s]t [s]ervice to your father. I never can bear [s]cenes of this kind; my [s]en[s]ibility is [s]o exqui[s]ite, that, was I to [s]ee my poor brother in this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-195.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] situation, I [s]hould not recover it for a month. Ah! poor man, he was always getting into [s]ome mi[s]chief or other; he never pro[s]pered in any thing after his marriage with your mother." "You cannot [s]uppo[s]e, madam, that the want of pro[s]perity was to be attributed to that union." "Why, I don't know, Meriel, my brother never loved your mother, but was artfully drawn in." "By whom, madam?" "By your grand mother, Mi[s]s, who wi[s]hed to get a good [s]ettlement for her daughter. Your mother too, pretended [s]uch a violent affection for him, that he could not refu[s]e [s]ome little return of kindne[s]s, and they never cea[s]ed their arts till they had noo[s]ed him fa[s]t." "You talk in riddles, madam, my mother brought my father a genteel fortune." "It was nothing, Mi[s]s, to the fortune he might have expected, if he had not offended his father; I always [s]aid no good would come of the match." "It is much to be wi[s]hed, indeed, madam," [s]aid I, "that [s]uch a union never had taken place; it would have [s]pared my dear mother many [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-196.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] years of [s]evere angui[s]h, and my unfortunate [s]elf would never have [s]een the light." As I [s]aid this my heart was [s]o oppre[s][s]ed I could not refrain my tears. "Ble[s]s me! my dear," [s]aid Mrs. Mo[s][s]op, in an affected accent of kindne[s]s; "I did not mean to vex you, you are not to be blamed for your parents faults." "If they have faults, madam," [s]aid I, "be a[s][s]ured I wi[s]h not to hear of them; it would be a painful topic at any time, but pardon me, if I [s]ay, at this particular [s]ea[s]on, it is a cruel one. I come to intreat you to vi[s]it a brother, who is poor and dying in pri[s]on. I [s]hould think, had he millions of faults, at this moment they would be all forgotten; that you would remember only his afflictions, and that he was your brother." I [s]poke this with [s]ome warmth; my aunt he[s]itated for an an[s]wer; at length [s]he told me [s]he would come the next morning. "It will be too late, madam," [s]aid I, "it is thought he cannot live the night out." "Dear, dear," [s]he replied, "it is [s]o unfortunate that I have a large party coming this afternoon, but if they leave me in any tolerable [s]ea[s]on"---I would hear no more, but turning from her with a mixture of contempt and pity, I returned to the habitation of mourning and death. When I entered [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-197.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] the room, my father enquired eagerly if [s]he would come; I thought it would be wrong to di[s]turb his la[s]t moments, with an account of her unfeeling conduct, I therefore only told him, [s]he was not able to come that evening, but would be there early in the morning. "It will be too late then," [s]aid he, "I mu[s]t write to her." It was in vain we remon[s]trated; he would be rai[s]ed in the bed, with a de[s]ign to write; but his head would not permit him to trace even a [s]ingle letter: he was [s]eized with faintings and when he recovered [s]eemed to have forgot his de[s]ign. He [s]poke but little afterwards, was wholly taken up in prayer: tho' he frequently cried out in agony, "'tis all in vain, I cannot be forgiven." A worthy well di[s]po[s]ed clergyman prayed be[s]ided him, and [s]aid a great deal to compo[s]e him, and calm his doubts. It had in [s]ome mea[s]ure the de[s]ired effect: and about four o'clock in the morning, he re[s]igned his [s]oul into the hand of Him who gave it. My mother's [s]orrow is not to be described. All thought of our dreadful, de[s]olate [s]ituation was entirely ab[s]orbed in this heavy affliction. I did not attempt to interrupt her grief, as I thought, if [s]uffered to take its natural cour[s]e, time would meliorate a [s]orrow, which, any attempt at pre[s]ent to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-198.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] [s]often, would but increa[s]e. In the cour[s]e of the next day, we expected my aunt to make the promi[s]ed vi[s]it; but as the day passed without [s]eeing her, in the evening my mother de[s]ired me to go to her again, and inform him of our lo[s]s. I went, but was [s]uffered to wait near an hour, before [s]he appeared; nor did my cou[s]ins come near me, tho' I heard them laughing and talking in the next room. Ah! [s]aid I, mentally, the afflicted are never admitted chearfully; they are left to indulge their own [s]ad thoughts in [s]olitude. Cruel He[s]ter and Su[s]an, had you been in affliction, would not I have abridged my own plea[s]ures to comfort and con[s]ole you. When my aunt entered the room [s]he began; "realy Meriel I have not been able to vi[s]it my brother before; but now I have half an hour to [s]pare, I will [s]end for a coach, and we will go together." "Your vi[s]it will no doubt be acceptable to my mother, dear madam," [s]aid I, "but my father is no longer in a [s]ituation."--- "He is dead then," cried [s]he eagerly. I bowed my head in [s]ilence. "Well," continued [s]he, "I rather expected it, and I am much obliged to you for calling, to let me know, as I [s]hould have [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-199.jpg) \- external link  - Page 020. ] been greatly [s]hocked to have found him dead, when I had called, as I certainly [s]hould, either this evening or to-morrow morning." "My mother bid me a[s]k your advice concerning the funeral madam, and not only your advice, but your a[s][s]i[s]tance." "A[s][s]i[s]tance, for what child?" "Could you advance us a little money?" "Money, Mi[s]s Howard! You a[s]toni[s]h me; it is impo[s][s]ible you can be in want of money, when you came to po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of [s]o hand[s]ome a fortune within the[s]e two years." "I am very [s]orry madam, that you can [s]uppo[s]e me capable of [s]uffering my parents to langui[s]h in pri[s]on for fifty pounds, if I could have commanded [s]uch a [s]um." "Why as to that Meriel, I thought you were acting like a prudent girl, and meant to take care of your[s]elf; for I know you paid a great deal of money for your father, and might have continued [s]o doing till you had ruined your[s]elf." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-200.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] "I [s]hould certainly have paid this la[s]t debt, madam, had not the failure of Mr. Le[s]age put it entirely out of my power." "Oh I remember hearing, that you lo[s]t [s]ix hundred pounds by his failure, but you [s]urely had a larger [s]um by you than that." "Indeed aunt, that [s]ix hundred pounds was all the dependence I had in the world." "Upon my word Meriel, I never was more a[s]toni[s]hed in my life. How have you contrived to run thro' all that money. Your mother and your[s]elf mu[s]t have been very extravagant, and when that is the ca[s]e, nothing will [s]ave people from ruin. I am very [s]orry child, very [s]orry; but it is not in my power to help you; I have a large family, and the education of my daughters is expen[s]ive. As to my poor brother, why, my advice is, that you have him buried as privately, and with as little expen[s]e as po[s][s]ible. You will remember me to your mother; tell her I am really concerned at her trouble; but it is entirely out my power to help her, nor indeed, do I think it would be of any u[s]e; for was [s]he releived from the[s]e difficulties, [s]he would [s]oon be involved by her imprudence, in others of the [s]ame [s]ort." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-201.jpg) \- external link  - Page 022. ] When I repeated this conver[s]ation to my mother, [s]he [s]aid, "it is no more than I expected, my dear child; but I let you go to make trial of her heart, that you might be convinced, how little dependence is to be placed on profe[s][s]ions of friend[s]hip, made to us in our pro[s]perity; and how little assistance is to be hoped from relations. We will [s]ell every valuable of our cloaths and plate, to lay your father decently in the ground, and to pay the debt for which I now am become liable. It will, I am certain, leave us almo[s]t de[s]titute; but when we have our liberty, we can perhaps gain employment of [s]ome kind or other, I will not mind how abject; for I would rather hardly earn, or indeed beg my bread from [s]trangers, than be [s]ubject to the unkindness of haughty, unfeeling relations." This re[s]olution was immediately executed, and when all expences were discharged, we found our[s]elves po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of five guineas, [s]ome trifling hou[s]ehold furniture, and the meane[s]t of our cloaths. With the[s]e we left that abode of mi[s]ery, the Fleet prison, and have taken a cheap lodging, on the Surry [s]ide of Blackfriars bridge. I have endeavoured to get [s]ome work, but as yet without effect; and what adds to my uneasiness, is, that my dear mother's health [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-202.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] daily declines. As I have no other amusement, I [s]pend a good deal of time at my pen. I have wrote [s]everal little poems, which I intend to correct and offer to [s]ome book[s]eller. Perhaps by that means, I may obtain [s]omething towards our [s]ub[s]i[s]tance. I feel a tran[s]ient ray of hope dawn upon my mind. My mother [s]miling, tells me, I am too [s]anguine; but my dear Celia, I always was inclined to take the brighte[s]t [s]ide of the pro[s]pect, to hope for the be[s]t, and when di[s]appointment arrives, to [s]ubmit with as much patience as I can. I am what is generally termed a ca[s]tle builder; it is a weakness (if it de[s]erves the appellation) from which I derive amu[s]ement at lea[s]t, and tho' I know at the very moment I am indulging tho[s]e [s]anguine ideas, that my hopes have no more foundation, than the bubble blown from the pipe of a playful boy; yet I cannot help being plea[s]ed with the airy fabric of my own creating, and as [s]oon as one vanishes, (to continue the allu[s]ion) I puff out another, and [s]o prevent my[s]elf from becoming a prey to de[s]pair. And, believe me Celia, I con[s]ider this di[s]po[s]ition, as one of the choice[s]t gifts of heaven. Adieu my friend; may you be happier than your MERIEL. MERIEL to CELIA. -  London December 5 th , 1778. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-203.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] It is now [s]ome months [s]ince I have taken up my pen to addre[s]s my dear Celia. Several times lately I have e[s][s]ayed to do it, but unable to bear a retro[s]pect of my late heavy affliction, have from time to time, deferred the painful recital, till I begin to fear my dear friend will think I am either numbered with the dead, or become forgetful of her friend[s]hip. I have a long tale to tell my dear girl, a tale, which I fear, will [s]teal many a tear from your eyes as you peru[s]e it. In my la[s]t I informed you of my mother's ill health, and how unable we were to procure any proper advice or a[s][s]i[s]tance. From that time her malady daily increa[s]ed. I fini[s]hed my little collection of poems and pre[s]ented them to a book[s]eller; but he told me, I had mi[s]taken my talents, and that the whole collection was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-204.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] not worth a guinea. Di[s]heartened and dispirited I returned to my mother, and now gave up my whole time to watching and attending her. Her di[s]order increa[s]ed with [s]uch rapidity, that in the cour[s]e of a few weeks [s]he was con[s]ined to her bed. What a prospect had I now before me, a beloved parent [s]inking by [s]low degrees into the grave; when I had no method of procuring the comforts, and even the nece[s][s]aries of life were denied. I had parted with all our apparel, except a change of linen, and had now pa[s]t one whole day without food. My mother made no complaints; but her pale wan countenance, was to me a thou[s]and times more affecting than unavailing exclamations. Our credit had been long lo[s]t in the neighbourhood, and I knew that in a few days we mu[s]t inevitably peri[s]h for want. In this [s]ituation, I took a re[s]olution to go out in the clo[s]e of the evening and [s]olicit the charity of the benevolent. I told my tale of [s]orrow to many of my own [s]ex. They either heard me not, or di[s]believed my a[s][s]ertions, and after sauntering through the [s]treets near three hours, one cold wet night in October, I at length collected about [s]ix-pence, and with it having procured [s]ome trifling nouri[s]hment for my almo[s]t fami[s]hed parent, I returned, allowing my[s]elf only a halfpenny roll. When I carried my little mor[s]el to her bed[s]ide, [s]he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-205.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] anxiou[s]ly enquired how I had procured it. "Some charitable di[s]po[s]ed per[s]on," [s]aid I, "gave me the means; take it my mother, eat and be comforted." Sinking nature required [s]upport; [s]he eat the offered mor[s]el, but [s]ea[s]oned it with tears of heartfelt angui[s]h. The next day I determined again to try my new employment, and for that purpo[s]e wandered out towards the park. It was Sunday, the day was fine, I went in and [s]eating my[s]elf on a bench, looked at the gay throng that crowded the mall, compared their situations with my own, and began to think myself the mo[s]t unfortunate of human beings. I knew I had never deviated from the path of virtue; I had never committed any action de[s]erving [s]uch abject mi[s]ery, and I [s]aw many women who had forfeited all claim to honour and re[s]pect, enjoying all the luxuries of life. At that moment rea[s]on, religion, integrity for[s]ook me; and I wi[s]hed my[s]elf in the [s]ame [s]ituation with tho[s]e victims to vice, if by [s]o doing, I could procure [s]u[s]tenance for my mother. You will, perhaps a[s]k, my dear Celia, if we had no friends whatever, to whom we could apply for relief; alas! my dear girl, you [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-206.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] know nothing of the world; tho[s]e who have drank deep of the cup of affliction can tell, that poverty and friend[s]hip are utter strangers to each other. While I was indulging the[s]e painful reflections, an elderly gentlewoman, [s]eated her[s]elf be[s]ide me, and viewing my per[s]on and dre[s]s with a [s]crutinizing eye, began [s]ome trifling di[s]cour[s]e, and at length a[s]ked me, if I was born in London. From chatting at fir[s]t on indifferent [s]ubjects, we began to remark the different appearances of the pa[s][s]ing multitude. The old lady's remarks were ju[s]t and pertinent; her discourse breathed the true [s]pirit of philanthropy. I imagined I had found a friend, and without re[s]erve unbo[s]omed my[s]elf to her; related my [s]tory of pa[s]t and pre[s]ent di[s]tre[s]s; [s]he heard me with attention, and, me thought, I [s]aw a gleam of compa[s][s]ion pa[s]s acro[s]s her features. I [s]eized the propitious moment, and in the humble[s]t accent petitioned relief. "Poor child," [s]aid [s]he, "I believe your [s]tory to be true; innocence and [s]implicity, are indeliably marked upon your countenance; what is in my power I will do for you, tho' the means are but [s]mall." She then drew forth her pur[s]e, and pre[s]ented me with half a crown: it is only for tho[s]e who have been in [s]imilar circum[s]tances to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-207.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] concieve the tide of joy that ru[s]hed upon my heart at the po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of this little piece of [s]ilver; I eagerly ki[s][s]ed the hand that conveyed it to me, and would have [s]poke, but tears were the only thanks I could return; they were the [s]incere[s]t, for they came warm from the heart. I left my [s]eat with precipitation, and was preparing to return home; but my benefactress [s]topped me. "Mi[s]s Howard," [s]aid [s]he, "I believe I have it my power to [s]erve you; meet me here again to-morrow." I promi[s]ed to meet her and returned to my mother with a heart lightened of half its [s]orrows. No doubt, [s]aid I, this lady will endeavour to extricate us from our pre[s]ent di[s]tre[s]s, and put us in [s]ome way of earning future [s]ub[s]i[s]tance. Elated with the[s]e hopes, I repaired next day to the appointed place; but after having waited two hours was obliged to return without [s]eeing my benefactre[s]s. Something has detained her unexpectedly, [s]aid I, [s]he will undoubtedly come to-morrow: but to-morrow pa[s][s]ed as ye[s]terday had done, and I was again di[s]appointed. The third morning, tho' I had u[s]ed the mo[s]t rigid economy, I found my[s]elf again [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-208.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] pennyless. However, [s]piritle[s]s and mi[s]erable as I was, I determined once more to repair to the park. My pace was [s]low, my looks dejected and my eyes [s]treaming with tears. I had hardly proceeded half the length of the mall, when I heard my[s]elf called, and turning round perceived my benefactre[s]s. "My good girl," [s]aid [s]he, "I almo[s]t feared I [s]hould not meet you, I have been obliged to go into the country [s]ince I [s]aw you, but I had not forgot you; come dry your eyes, I have met with a gentleman who will be your friend, if you mind how you behave your[s]elf. He has [s]ent you half a guinea; and if you will come this evening and [s]up at my hou[s]e, in Soho [s]quare, I will introduce you to him." "Alas! madam," [s]aid I, "my appearance at your hou[s]e will only di[s]grace you; nor can I [s]uppo[s]e any gentleman will greatly intere[s]t him[s]elf in behalf of a poor unfortunate girl, without requiring a return which virtue and religion will not [s]uffer me to make." "Don't be fooli[s]h, child," [s]aid the old lady, "virtue and religion are very pretty words; but pray tell me, will they keep your mother from [s]tarving." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-209.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] "Oh! madam," I replied, "will it not be wor[s]e than death to brand her name with infamy? Alas! I never could bear the [s]corn of the world, and the reproofs of my own con[s]cience, oppre[s][s]ed with guilt and [s]hame. Tempt me not, dear madam, to for[s]ake the path of rectitude; let me retain my innocence, and come what may, I [s]hall die in peace." "This is fine talking, Mi[s]s Howard, but let me tell you, it is a very [s]elfi[s]h way of arguing. You acknowledge, that the lo[s]s of virtue would make you unhappy. Are you not already unhappy in a [s]uperlative degree; and does that unhappine[s]s in the lea[s]t contribute to relieve your own or your mother's wants. No, does not the [s]ight of your misery rather increa[s]e hers? Come, then, my dear girl, act the heroine, take this load of [s]orrow upon your[s]elf, and [s]ave a parent, whom you tenderly love, from peri[s]hing with famine." This was a [s]trange way of arguing, Celia, yet it had the de[s]ired effect, I thought it was po[s][s]ible to hide my infamy from my mother, and confine my mi[s]ery to my own bo[s]om. When the old woman found my re[s]olution began to waver, [s]he plied me with sophistical arguments, de[s]cribed in glowing colours [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-210.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] the gaiety and [s]plendor in which many women of loo[s]e characters lived, and contrasted it [s]trongly with my poor mi[s]erable apartment, where my [s]ure attendants were pinching cold and hunger, and my only companion a beloved parent [s]inking under the complicated evils of [s]ickne[s]s and famine. "Oh! [s]ave me! [s]ave me!" cried I eagerly, "from the dreadful thought, teach me how to [s]natch her from impending destruction, to admini[s]ter [s]upport to her wasting frame, and comfort her declining hours. Do with me as you will; [s]ave, protect my dear mother, and let me be the only sacrifice." Having brought me to this horrible resolution, and received my promi[s]e of coming to her hou[s]e in the evening; [s]he left me, and I repaired home; by the way procuring a bottle of wine and [s]ome other nece[s][s]aries for my mother. She had been anxious at my long [s]tay, and when I produced the refreshments, again enquired how I had purchased them. A lie, (the [s]ir[s]t I had ever told her) now [s]ugge[s]ted it[s]elf; I [s]aid I had performed a little work for a lady in the neighbourhood, and [s]he had liberally rewarded me; but when I mentioned going out again in the evening, the pathetic [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-211.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] manner in which [s]he intreated me to guard my honour, as my only trea[s]ure, and as I wished to pre[s]erve her heart from breaking, almo[s]t [s]taggered my re[s]olution: but having given her [s]ome refre[s]hment, I [s]aw her spirits revive, and that by degrees [s]he [s]unk into a [s]weet refre[s]hing [s]lumber. I determined to [s]acrifice every other con[s]ideration rather than [s]ee her reduced again to the extremity of mi[s]ery [s]he had [s]o lately experienced. Oh! ye rigidly virtuous of my own [s]ex, turn not from me with horror and contempt, con[s]ider my agonizing di[s]tre[s]s, glance with an eye of compa[s][s]ion over the dreadful resolution, and let a tear of pity blot the offence from your memories. Great and painful were the [s]truggles of my [s]oul, while gazing on my [s]leeping parent. I knelt by the bed[s]ide, and would have prayed, but, alas! that con[s]olation was denied me. How could I addre[s]s a Being of infinite purity, when I was going to offer my[s]elf a [s]acrifice at the [s]hrine of guilt and pollution. I thought I [s]hould have [s]unk under the agonies I endured; once I wi[s]hed for death, but then the thought of what my poor mother would [s]uffer, immediately repelled the impious de[s]ire; at length, I clasped my hands and rai[s]ing my eyes to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-212.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] heaven, cried, "Father of mercy direct me, oh! give me fortitude to bear thy di[s]pen[s]ations as I ought, or pardon the weakne[s]s of an afflicted mortal." I then ki[s][s]ed my [s]leeping mother, and with a heart almo[s]t broken repaired to Soho. The old woman received me cordially, but reproved my pen[s]ive countenance and [s]wolen eyes; [s]he made me drink [s]ome tea, and then taking me up [s]tairs, in[s]i[s]ted on my dre[s][s]ing my[s]elf in a brown lute[s]tring nightgown, with a cap and linen [s]uitable. We then went into an elegant parlour, and in a few moments Mr. Welldon was announced: he was a man upwards of thirty, of a comely per[s]on, polite addre[s]s, and in[s]inuating manner; he regarded me with vi[s]ible attention, and when he [s]poke to me, it was with a mixture of re[s]pect and polite freedom. My feelings during [s]upper were beyond description, poignant: I could [s]carcely re[s]train my tears, but the reproving looks of the old woman told me how much they would offend her: I therefore endeavoured to [s]ti[s]le my emotions; but when the cloth was removed and [s]he aro[s]e to quit the room, I involuntarily caught her hand, and with a look which pleaded [s]trongly for compa[s][s]ion bur[s]t into tears. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-213.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] "Why, what does the girl cry for?" [s]aid [s]he [s]neeringly, "was it not by your own desire you came here? come, Mr. Welldon, you mu[s]t get the better of the[s]e pretty airs, tho' perhaps, indeed you may think her the more agreeable for them." Then di[s]engaging her hand from my gra[s]p, [s]he left the room. "Then I am inevitably lo[s]t," cried I, cla[s]ping my hands in a wild agony, and redoubling my tears. "My [s]weet girl," [s]aid Mr. Welldon, "this di[s]tre[s]s, which is too acute, to be con[s]trued into affectation, greatly [s]upri[s]es me. Was it not by your own free will that you came here to meet me?" "It was, it was," [s]aid I, "but oh! [s]ir, if you only knew the angui[s]h it has co[s]t me, to form the horrid de[s]ign, you would pity me, indeed you would commi[s]erate my sufferings." "Dear creature," [s]aid he, drawing his chair clo[s]e to mine, "you know not how greatly your [s]orrow intere[s]ts me; tell me, is there any thing within the compa[s]s of my fortune, can re[s]tore peace to your agitated bo[s]om; [s]ay how can I [s]erve you, how render you happy?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-214.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] "Oh! there is one way, and only one way," [s]aid I, "by which you can promote my happine[s]s," and I dropped on my knees before him. "Ri[s]e, ri[s]e, my dear girl," [s]aid he, "and do not he[s]itate to point out this only way, by which I can prove my[s]elf your friend." "This humliating po[s]ture be[s]t [s]uits me," I replied, "here will I remain till I move your heart to compa[s][s]ion: indeed I am not that vile creature you may perhaps think me. I always avoided the inticements of vice till this fatal night; but the mi[s]eries of a beloved parent, [s]inking to the grave, oppressed by [s]ickne[s]s and poverty drove me to [s]acrifice my honour, to procure the means of prolonging her invaluable existence: if you are [s]incere in your profe[s][s]ions of friend[s]hip, relieve my dear mother, and oh! I be[s]ceeh you, [s]pare the virtue of her wretched daughter." "Ri[s]e, then, my afflicted girl," [s]aid he, "you [s]hall be convinced of my [s]incerity; I will obey the dictates of humanity; we will in[s]tantly go to your mother." He then left me for a few moments, when returning, he led me to a coach, and taking my direction, ordered the coachman to drive to our poor habitation. I he[s]itated at going away in the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-215.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] cloaths the old woman had made me put on, but my deliverer told me he had paid for them. When we arrived at our lodging, a mixed [s]en[s]ation of pain and plea[s]ure dwelt upon my mind, and as I ran up [s]tairs my limbs trembled [s]o, they would [s]carce [s]upport me; Mr. Welldon followed me up: I opened the door of the apartment, and ru[s]hing to the bed[s]ide, cried "[s]ee my dear mother, the friend which heaven hath [s]ent us." My poor mother rai[s]ed her[s]elf feebly in the bed, looked fir[s]t at me, then at Mr. Welldon, then pointing to my altered dre[s]s and crying "the[s]e are the wages of infamy, all but this I could have born patiently." She fell back in a fit. I thought [s]he was gone forever; frantic with de[s]pair, I tore off the dre[s]s which had [s]o much alarmed her, and throwing my[s]elf on the bed be[s]ide her, vowed never more to ri[s]e, but that my life [s]hould expiate my intended offence. Mr. Welldon had ran away for medical a[s][s]i[s]tance, and entered the room with an apothecary, ju[s]t as my mother gave [s]ome [s]igns of returning life. Proper remedies were immediately applied and Mr. Welldon [s]oon convinced my reviving parent, that I had not entailed infamy on her latter days, or ha[s]tened the period of her exi[s]tence by guilt or [s]hame. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-216.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] Our generous benefactor, now [s]upplied me with money, not only to procure every nece[s][s]ary, but every comfort of life; and engaged the apothecary to attend my mother every day: but his care was all in vain; her di[s]order daily gained ground, and I [s]aw her end rapidly approaching. One day, when Mr. Welldon called to [s]ee us, my mother beckoned him to the bed[s]ide. "Sir," [s]aid [s]he, "if the prayers of a poor dying mortal are heard in heaven, you will undoubtedly be rewarded for your benevolence, towards a helple[s]s widow and orphan. To your genero[s]ity I owe the honour of my child: oh! may [s]he never again be tempted to doubt the care of a watchful providence; and to avoid a temporary evil, ru[s]h into la[s]ting mi[s]ery. To your care Mr. Welldon I commit her, poor and defencele[s]s as [s]he is; I do not fear your integrity; for the man, who in the gay hour of uncontrouled pa[s][s]ion could [s]ave an innocent creature from de[s]truction, will never lay a deliberate plan for her [s]eduction. Meriel, you mu[s]t be humble and indu[s]trious, and tru[s]t heaven for [s]upport." Mr. Welldon promi[s]ed he would be my guardian and protector from every evil.

Celia, I feel I am unable to proceed, the moment that [s]evered me from my dear mother will be always remembered as the mo[s]t painful of my life. Adieu till I am more compo[s]ed. MERIEL. MERIEL to CELIA. December 25 th , 1778. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-218.jpg) \- external link  - Page 039. ] I again [s]it down to proceed in my melancholy narrative; a month from the time of my dear mother's death mu[s]t be passed over in [s]ilence; my affliction was poignant, but time and the efforts of rea[s]on by degrees [s]oftened it. Mr. Welldon [s]uffered that time to elap[s]e before he ventuted to [s]ee me; he had placed me with a friend of his, who is a milliner, and tho' he [s]ent every day to enquire after my health, he avoided vi[s]iting me, fearing the cen[s]ure of the world might injure my reputation. My grief being in a great mea[s]ure abated, Mrs. Lacour took an opportunity of [s]peaking to me concerning my future pro[s]pects in life: "Mr. Welldon," [s]aid [s]he, "intends, if you approve the plan, that you [s]hall remain with me till you have attained a competent [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-219.jpg) \- external link  - Page 040. ] knowledge of the millinery bu[s]ine[s]s, to be able to [s]upport your[s]elf without being any longer trouble[s]ome to your benefactor. I know, Mi[s]s Howard," continued [s]he, "that Mr. Welldon does not think you an incumbrance, and that you are in no danger of any improper attempts from him; as I have heard him [s]ay the innate goodne[s]s of your heart has rai[s]ed you [s]o in his e[s]teem, that he regards you in the light of a [s]i[s]ter; and as [s]uch will [s]erve and protect you: but my dear young lady, you are po[s][s]e[s][s]ed of [s]trong [s]en[s]ibility and to [s]uch a heart as your's dependance mu[s]t be a heavy burthen. As another motive for your endeavouring to render your[s]elf independent, I mu[s]t inform you that Mr. Welldon will in a few weeks be married, and however innocent your mind, believe me the world will readily ca[s]t illiberal cen[s]ures on a young woman who lived in a [s]tate of dependance on a married man; and [s]hould it reach his lady's ears might be the [s]ource of great unea[s]ine[s]s, if not the cau[s]e of an irreparable breach between them." I was convinced of the propriety of the[s]e arguments, and chearfully acquie[s]ced, while my heart overflowed with gratitude towards my generous benefactor, and I breathed a [s]ilent prayer to heaven, that his felicity in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-220.jpg) \- external link  - Page 041. ] the married [s]tate might be equal to his deserts. A few days after this, Mr. Welldon called. I could not refrain my tears at [s]ight of this worthy man. Pa[s]t [s]cenes of [s]orrow ru[s]hed upon my mind, which joined to the recollection of my then forlorn, dependant [s]ituation almo[s]t overcame me. He [s]uffered me to ea[s]e my full heart, and then gently enquiring after my health, and how I liked Mrs. Lacour's family, hinted at my remaining with her, till I had attained a competent knowledge of her bu[s]ine[s]s. "I know, my dear Mi[s]s Howard," [s]aid he, "that your education and accomplishments fit you to be placed in a more elevated [s]phere. But my good girl mu[s]t con[s]ider that tho[s]e accompli[s]hments in her pre[s]ent circum[s]tances will be of no u[s]e. Nay, if they are [s]uffered to appear will only excite the envy and ill nature of tho[s]e with whom [s]he is at pre[s]ent obliged to a[s][s]ociate. I would by no means have you neglect tho[s]e brilliant talents, with which nature has endowed you. It is not to be doubted, but you will find leisure hours when the pen or the pencil will be a happy relief to your mind, and prevent your dwelling too intently on pa[s]t melancholy events. But let tho[s]e hours of relax [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-221.jpg) \- external link  - Blank Page. ] [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-222.jpg) \- external link  - Page 043. ] months. Mr. Welldon then told me he had provided me an apartment to my[s]elf, and begged my acceptance of the furniture it contained. "This day three weeks, Mi[s]s Howard," [s]aid he, "will make me the happiest of men in a union with a young lady of great merit, on whom I have de[s]ervedly placed my affections. We [s]hall [s]et off immediately on a vi[s]it to the continent to [s]ee [s]ome relations, who re[s]ide con[s]tantly in the [s]outh of France, [s]o that it may be a long time before I [s]ee you again. In this little pocket-book you will find a trifle to an[s]wer your immediate expences, and a direction to a gentleman, in the city, where in ca[s]e of any future exigencies, you may apply, and he will give you both a[s][s]i[s]tance and advice. God ble[s]s you, my dear girl; you have my be[s]t wi[s]hes, and may re[s]t a[s][s]ured of my unalterable friend[s]hip." He then [s]aluted me with the affection of a brother, and took his leave. Soon after he was gone, Mrs. Lacour, by way of diverting my mind from the gloom our parting had ca[s]t over it, a[s]ked me if I had no curio[s]ity to [s]ee the apartment Mr. Welldon had furni[s]hed for me. I followed her up two pair of [s]tairs, into a neat back room, where was a tent bed, of [s]triped Manchester, with every nece[s][s]ary apurtenance, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-223.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] a ca[s]e of drawers, a neat dre[s][s]ing ca[s]e, and a [s]mall trunk, the key of which Mrs. Lacour gave me, and bidding me with a [s]mile examine my trea[s]ures, went down [s]tairs. On opening the trunk I found it contained a piece of grey lute[s]tring, two pieces of dark chintz, each enough for a gown, about ten yards of mu[s]lin, and a piece of fine linen. Removing the[s]e, I di[s]covered at the bottom, a neat edition of the Engli[s]h poets, together with a bible and common prayer book; here al[s]o, I found a roll of drawing paper, which led me to imagine I was [s]upplied with other materials for this elegant amu[s]ement, and on opening the drawers, I found I had not been deceived in my conjectures; for there I found a box of crayons, pencils and colours, and a leather writing ca[s]e, in which was a letter of truely brotherly advice. On opening a light clo[s]et that adjoined my bed chamber, I di[s]covered another mark of the friendly attention of my benefactor; for there was a [s]mall piano forte, with a collection of mu[s]ic by the be[s]t ma[s]ters. My little pocket-book contained a bank note for fifty pounds. Oppre[s][s]ed by a [s]en[s]e of the[s]e numerous obligations, my heart almo[s]t bur[s]ting with grateful emotions, I [s]unk on my knees by the bed [s]ide, and poured forth my thanks [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-224.jpg) \- external link  - Page 045. ] to the great Di[s]po[s]er of all things, entreated that the choice[s]t of his ble[s][s]ings might be [s]howered on my benefactor, and prayed his mercy ever to protect and direct me, nor [s]uffer me again, impiou[s]ly to doubt his power and watchful care. The next morning, I entered on my new employment with alacrity. It is an employment that keeps the mind continually amufed. Mrs. Lacour is an amiable, chearful woman, and [s]ome of her young people, sensible, well informed girls. I do not like Mr. Lacour: he appears to me a pert, illiterate coxcomb. But this does not give me any great unea[s]ine[s]s, as I am not much in his company, except at meal times. When the bu[s]ine[s]s of the day is fini[s]hed, I retire to my own apartment, where writing, reading or mu[s]ic, [s]weetly relaxes and chears my mind: the time never hangs heavy; I feel a charming [s]erenity pervade my heart, and Hope, that bright cele[s]tial gue[s]t, again has taken up her re[s]idence in my bo[s]om. On a Sundy evening, I never fail vi[s]iting the dear [s]pot, that contains all that was earthly of my beloved mother. I cannot de[s]cribe my [s]en[s]ations when I approach the place. They are far from painful Celia, for the remembrance of her piety and virtue is a balm to my heart; and while my eye is [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-225.jpg) \- external link  - Page 046. ] fixed on the grave where [s]he lies, my mental faculties behold her ble[s][s]ed [s]pirit beatified, and enjoying the fullne[s]s of heavenly bli[s]s in that man[s]ion, where, I tru[s]t, I [s]hall one day again embrace her. When I return from the[s]e contemplations, my [s]oul is [s]o attuned to harmony, that I [s]ing the hymns or anthems [s]uited to the day, with a pleasure unde[s]cribable. I have wrote a few lines, which you will find fully expre[s][s]ive of the frame of my mind. I cannot help regreting, my deare[s]t friend, the happy days I [s]pent with you in the convent, tho' all-chearing Hope bids me look forward; and while I take my pre[s]ent lot with gratitude, humbly a[s]pire to a ble[s][s]ed hereafter. Enclo[s]ed are the lines I mention; I [s]ing it to that [s]weet plaintive air, we were both [s]o fond of. I [s]hall [s]ometimes plea[s]e my[s]elf with the thought, that we may perhaps after you have received this, both [s]ing it at the [s]ame moment. God ble[s]s you my dear Celia. MERIEL. OH! cea[s]e, vain bu[s]y fancy cea[s]e To dwell on [s]cenes long pa[s]t, When every hour was wing'd with peace, With joy too great to la[s]t. But come, [s]weet Hope, cele[s]tial pow'r, Thy healing comfort bring; Oh [s]ooth my mind, and let me [s]oar Upon thine airy wing. When thro' the vaulted ai[s]le I roam, And breath the [s]igh [s]incere, Or o'er my mother's hallowed tomb Drop the [s]ad filial tear: 'Tis thou can[s]t chear the [s]olemn hour, Can[s]t peace and comfort bring, Elate my thoughts, and bid them [s]oar, Upon thine airy wing. Methinks I hear thee whi[s]p'ring [s]ay; Mortal, thy tears give o'er, Thy mother, thou in realms of day, Shalt meet to part no more.

I can percieve they perfectly under[s]tand each other, tho' the prudent wife either does not, or will not, [s]ee the intimacy that [s]ub[s]i[s]ts between them. It has often been a [s]ubject of wonder to me, how people, who[s]e tempers and dispositions are the very rever[s]e of each other, could voluntarily put on the hymeneal yoke together; and yet we daily [s]ee in[s]tances of [s]en[s]e and folly; virtue and vice; understanding and ignorance; politene[s]s and vulgarity; youth and age; beauty and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-228.jpg) \- external link  - Page 049. ] deformity, being linked in the [s]ame chain: nay, what is more [s]urpri[s]ing that both parties eagerly put it on. How are we to account for the[s]e incon[s]i[s]tencies in human nature, nothing can be more oppo[s]ite than the dispositions of Mon[s]ieur and Mrs. Lacour, and yet I have been told that it was a marriage of inclination and on the lady's [s]ide, entirely again[s]t the approbation of her friends; hence we mu[s]t [s]uppo[s]e, that either love throws a mi[s]t over the di[s]cerning optics of its votaries, or that their is a fate in marriage, which it is impo[s][s]ible to counteract. You will, perhaps, wonder, my dear Celia, that among the many long epi[s]tles I have lately wrote to you, the name of Rainsforth has never e[s]caped me: indeed, I have had afflictions of [s]o much heavier a nature, than merely the lo[s]s of a lover, that [s]ome months pa[s][s]ed in which I hardly remembered there was [s]uch a per[s]on in being: however in my pre[s]ent [s]ituation, being more ea[s]y in my mind, thought has frequently recurred to the period when I expected to have been united to him by indi[s][s]oluble ties. When I think of him, I am feelingly convinced that my heart is [s]till attached; I almo[s]t doubt the intelligence of his infidelity, tho' conveyed to me by the hand of his father: I feel a re[s]tle[s]s curio[s]ity to be informed of his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-229.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] happine[s]s; I fancy, [s]ometimes that he might have heard reports to my di[s]advantage; he might have been informed of my unfortunate elopement, of my thoughtle[s]s correspondence with Pringle: every circum[s]tance may have been exaggerated; and he may not be [s]o culpable as I at fir[s]t thought him. The[s]e ideas often crowd my imagination. But he is married, Celia, and let his virtues be ever [s]o briliant, he can be nothing to me. I have heard by mere accident that my brother is in a fair way of making his fortune in India; I have wrote to him [s]everal times, but recieved no an[s]wer; not even a line has arrived from him, [s]ince the bill, which I mentioned in a former letter, was paid. Mr. Mo[s][s]op's family are I find removed into the country, and as to any of tho[s]e who called them[s]elves my friends in the day of pro[s]perity, if I meet them now they [s]tare me confidently in the face, but do not in the lea[s]t recollect me. Mrs. Lacour, tells me, that when fortune removes friends to any con[s]iderable di[s]tance from each other, the party who is the favourite of the fickle goddess almo[s]t immediately becomes near-fighted, and is afflicted with a [s]hort memory.

I was ye[s]terday [s]ent to wait on a lady with [s]ome caps, &c. in St. James's [s]quare. When having waited about half an hour in a cold empty parlour, I thought I heard a voice that was familiar to my ears, but could not recollect who[s]e it was. I was [s]triving to call it to my memory in vain, when the door opened, and who [s]hould I behold but Mi[s]s Pringle, and another young lady. "Come into this room young woman," [s]aid [s]he, "here is a fire, and we will look over your trumpery." I went in my heart [s]inking as I moved; for I knew enough of this once affectionate friend to [s]uppo[s]e [s]he would not readily acknowledge an acquaintance with a milliner's apprentice. I [s]aw, the moment [s]he ca[s]t her eyes on me, [s]he recollected me; but as I did not wi[s]h to [s]hew an inclination to renew our acquaintance, I ca[s]t down my eyes and remained [s]ilent, thinking that if [s]he did not choo[s]e to take notice of me, [s]he might [s]ettle it within her[s]elf that I did not know her. But the lady's curio[s]ity was more predominent than her pride. She looked at me [s]everal times and at length cried "if I did not think it almo[s]t impossible I [s]hould [s]ay your name was Howard." "My name is Howard, ma'am," [s]aid I coldly. "Why, [s]ure as I am alive, it is Meriel [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-231.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] Howard." "The very [s]ame, Mi[s]s Pringle." "La! my dear girl, why how came you in this [s]ituation, [s]uch a fortune as you had left you." "We are all [s]ubject to vici[s][s]itudes of fortune," [s]aid I [s]miling, "but I am extremely happy in my pre[s]ent [s]ituation." "Happy!" [s]aid [s]he, lifting up her eyes in [s]urprize. "I am a[s]toni[s]hed to hear you [s]ay [s]o, for my part I [s]hould be the mo[s]t miserable creature on earth, was I reduced to carry a band-box." "Happine[s]s and mi[s]ery, Mi[s]s," [s]aid I, "are in general the re[s]ult of our own ideas: if I am content in my humble [s]tation, I am in my own mind as happy, nay, perhaps happier than the woman, who riding in a chariot and pair, envies one who[s]e [s]uperior fortune can command four or [s]ix hor[s]es." She did not [s]eem to comprehend me, but turning to the other lady, [s]aid, "well I vow [s]i[s]ter it is very a[s]toni[s]hing; but this young woman, only four years ago, had a fortune of four thou[s]and pounds, her father lived in the neighbourhood of our countryhouse. My brother was very fond of her once, and I believe [s]he did not altogether di[s]like him, did you Meriel? I fancy your little heart never regained its liberty." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-232.jpg) \- external link  - Page 053. ] "I rather [s]uppo[s]e, Mi[s]s Pringle, that it never was a captive. If at one time I was fooli[s]h enough to fancy my[s]elf in love with your brother, it was before I had the power of di[s]tingui[s]hing a real from an ideal pa[s][s]ion, or before I was a competent judge of what would be mo[s]t conducive to my own happiness." "Aye," [s]aid [s]he, "you can talk of it with a great deal of compo[s]ure now, but you certainly was very fond of him once or you would not have re[s]olved to run away with him; nay, can you deny that you were out of your [s]en[s]es about him, when you heard he was married." This cruel reflection on my unfortunate malady, which was occa[s]ioned by the severest affliction that ever child indured, was more than my [s]pirits could [s]upport, I turned my face from her to to hide the tears that trickled fa[s]t from my eyes; but could not command my voice to give her an an[s]wer, when [s]he continued: "Well, but where are Mr. and Mrs. Howard, and ma[s]ter Richard?" "My brother is in India---I have no parents." "Poor, dear girl," [s]aid the other young lady, now [s]peaking for the fir[s]t time, "that is a dreadful thing.

She took my hand, and I [s]aw her mild eyes gli[s]ten with compa[s][s]ion. I wi[s]hed to put an end to this painful conver[s]ation, and therefore de[s]ired to know if they would keep any of the caps. "Oh, yes, I [s]hall have [s]everal, but [s]top Meriel, I mu[s]t let my mother know you are here. Dear, how [s]he will be [s]urprized; and you [s]hall go down to Baker, [s]he will pay you, and do have a gla[s]s of wine before you go, and a bit of bride cake: you don't know I am married." "I wi[s]h you much happine[s]s madam," [s]aid I, coldly; "but I cannot [s]tay to take any refre[s]hment: I have been here much longer than I ought to have [s]taid." You mu[s]t know, my dear Celia, that my pride was hurt at the idea of [s]tanding fir[s]t to be catechi[s]ed by the mother, and then be dismissed to the hou[s]e-keeper for wine and cake; and this treatment from a girl, who once called her[s]elf my friend, and thought her[s]elf honoured by the title. However, I could not e[s]cape; the mother was called, and the bell rang for Mrs. Baker. I answered Mrs. Pringle's que[s]tions in as [s]hort a manner as po[s][s]ible; but ob[s]tinately refused going down with the hou[s]e-keeper. "Ah! poor girl," [s]aid Mrs. Pringle, in an [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-234.jpg) \- external link  - Page 055. ] affected whi[s]per to her daughter; "let the wine be brought up, my dear; you [s]ee [s]he cannot as yet [s]ubmit to the alteration in her [s]ituation." "You are mi[s]taken madam," [s]aid I, "I do not feel the lea[s]t embara[s][s]ment from the reflection that I owe my [s]upport to industry: it is what many, more worthy than my[s]elf are obliged to do, it is by no means humiliating. True dignity is [s]eated in the [s]oul, nor can any [s]ituation make me forget the re[s]pect ever due to my[s]elf. I cannot but reflect ladies, that I am the [s]ame Mi[s]s Howard, whom [s]ome few years ago, you were [s]o extremely fond of, and eagerly [s]triving which could [s]hew her the mo[s]t respect. Tho' I am now bereaved of that fortune, which I percieve was the magnet which attracted your attentions. I can make proper di[s]tinctions; as a trades per[s]on, I can ea[s]ily [s]ubmit to be turned over to your hou[s]e-keeper for payment; but remembering I have once been your companion, am [s]till your equal, I cannot [s]ubmit to be placed on a level with your [s]ervants." They could not an[s]wer. Shame and a[s]toni[s]hment tied their tongues. I curt[s]ied [s]lightly and followed Mrs. Baker out of the room. While [s]he was paying me, the loquacious [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-235.jpg) \- external link  - Page 056. ] quacious hou[s]e-keeper informed me that her ma[s]ter had been married about three weeks; that he never [s]aw Mi[s]s Pringle till within a month of their union; that he danced with her at a ball, and was [s]truck with her pleasing per[s]on, and in[s]inuating manner; "but I can [s]ee," continued [s]he, "it will not be a very happy union; and Mi[s]s Sally, poor girl, will be more unhappy than ever. It was a [s]ad thing, [s]ir John left her dependant on her brother." "What then," [s]aid I, "your ma[s]ter is a baronet?" "No," [s]aid [s]he, "his father was a knight, but the title died with him. He was a wealthy citizen, and was knignted for carrying an addre[s]s to the king on [s]ome particular occasion." I had now recieved my money, and not wi[s]hing to pry into the [s]ecrets of a family, with whom I de[s]ired not to form any connection, I wi[s]hed Mrs. Baker a good morning, and left the hou[s]e. In the hall I met Mi[s]s Sally. "You will have a long walk Mi[s]s Howard," [s]aid [s]he; "had I any command here, you [s]hould not carry that heavy box." "It is not heavy, Mi[s]s," [s]aid I. "But it is cumber[s]ome," [s]he replied, "and you are not accu[s]tomed to [s]uch employment." She then opened the door [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-236.jpg) \- external link  - Page 057. ] her[s]elf, and [s]miling, with a [s]weet look of benevolence, wi[s]hed me a good morning. I pitied the dear girl, for [s]ure I am, if [s]he is dependant on her brother, her new [s]i[s]ter will not contribute to make her life very comfortable. As I walked home, I could not avoid reflecting on this rencounter with Mi[s]s Pringle; nor did my heart entirely approve my own conduct: there was too much pride in the manner in which I [s]poke to her: indeed, [s]ince I have been poor, Celia, I have di[s]covered that I am very proud, much more [s]o than is becoming; I will endeavour to correct this error, and in future adapt my [s]entiments to the [s]tation in which it has plea[s]ed Providence to place me. I have met with many civilities from [s]ome of Mrs. Lacour's cu[s]tomers; e[s]pecially a Mrs. Moreton, who is a woman of very genteel fortune, at lea[s]t, if I am to conjecture from the manner in which [s]he lives: [s]he is very fond of poetry, and has advi[s]ed me to endeavour to rai[s]e a [s]ub[s]cription for the publication of tho[s]e poems I formerly mentioned to you. Mrs. Lacour does not disapprove the plan, and I am by this indulging woman, allowed more time to pur[s]ue my favourite [s]tudy, than I [s]hould have met with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-237.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] in any other place. I have obtained [s]everal very re[s]pectable names to my [s]ub[s]cription; and have [s]ome cards of propo[s]als printed which I keep in the [s]hop to pre[s]ent to the ladies who con[s]tantly frequent it. I cannot [s]ay, Celia, but it would be much more pleasing to me, could I obtain a living by the exertion of any of my natural talents, than by following the [s]traight forward path of the plodding woman of bu[s]ine[s]s; be[s]ides I was never de[s]igned for a milliner, I cannot flatter, I cannot tell a woman whom age, and other natural defects, have rendered extremely plain, that a full dre[s]s cap with artificial flowers [s]mall handkerchief, and all the gay trappings that belong to the [s]miling [s]ea[s]on of eighteen, will become her face and figure: and yet this is a very nece[s][s]ary ingredient in the compo[s]ition of a milliner. I wi[s]h to my heart [s]ome other plan could be [s]truck out, where I [s]hould not be obliged to [s]ay and atte[s]t things [s]o directly contrary to my own opinion. I am not [s]o happy in this family as I at fir[s]t thought I [s]hould be, Mr. Lacour pays me too much attention lately; I hate the forward concieted fellow, tho' were it only to mortify Mademoi[s]elle I could take a plea[s]ure in li[s]tening to his nonsense; but when I reflect that by [s]o doing I may wound the peace of a de[s]erving woman, who treats me with tenderne[s]s, and favours [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-238.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] me with her e[s]teem, I feel [s]uch a mixture of horror end dete[s]tation ri[s]e in my heart, that I frequently an[s]wer his pa[s][s]ionate [s]allies with an acrimony, that makes him bite his lips with vexation. I [s]hall be glad when my time is expired, tho' I have as yet thought of no elligible plan to pur[s]ue in future. Adieu, my friend, believe in every change of fortune I am your's affectionately. MERIEL. MERIAL to CELIA, -  London July 15 th , 1780.

In my la[s]t I mentioned my de[s]ign of publi[s]hing [s]ome poems by subscription; but in that de[s]ign I am di[s]appointed, as well as in every other from which I have ever hoped to extract either plea[s]ure or comfort. About a month [s]ince I recieved the following letter, from the gentleman to whom Mr. Welldon gave me a direction; I transcribe it for your peru[s]al, that you may [s]ee how unfortunate I am in having the mo[s]t innocent actions of my life wre[s]ted in [s]uch a manner as to be made to appear to my disadvantage. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-240.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] - Friday-[s]treet, May 3 d . MISS HOWARD, WHEN your friend, Mr. Welldon, left England he did not propo[s]e [s]taying above [s]ix weeks or two months at mo[s]t; but unfortunately for him he has been detained on the continent by a continued [s]eries of ill health, and he is now at Aix-la-Chappelle in a very dangerous [s]tate. When la[s]t I [s]aw him he gave me a very particular account of your fir[s]t acquaintance with him, an account which I mu[s]t confe[s]s rai[s]ed you both in my opinion, as it proved the goodne[s]s of your hearts: he al[s]o informed me in what manner he had placed you with Mrs. Lacour, and de[s]ired I would frequently call and enquire how you went on, and whether you were [s]atisfied with the treatment you received. Family unea[s]ine[s]s, and various vexations have prevented my fulfilling my promise, till la[s]t Thur[s]day, when I called at Mrs. Lacour's, and the re[s]ult of that vi[s]it leads me to trouble you with this letter; for as I mu[s]t naturally feel intere[s]ted in the welfare of every one dear to Mr. Welldon, I think it my duty to give you a little advice, and to let you know in what light you are [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-241.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] considered by the major part of the family where you re[s]ide. At the time I made my vi[s]it you were out, waiting on [s]ome ladies: Mrs. Lacour [s]poke of you in the tendere[s]t manner, but [s]aid you were by no means calculated for the bu[s]ine[s]s Mr. Welldon had placed you in; her [s]en[s]ibility is very great [s]ir, [s]aid [s]he, and her notions [s]o very refined and delicate, [s]he is totally unable to bear the rude and often in[s]ulting manners of many of our cu[s]tomers: be[s]ides, [s]ir, [s]he loves study too well ever to make any great proficient at her needle. Mrs. Lacour being called away, a pert, forward French woman undertook to fini[s]h your character: [s]he threw out the mo[s]t malignant a[s]per[s]ions on your conduct in general, [s]aid you had made yourself the laughing [s]tock of the whole family, that many of the ladies who frequented the [s]hop, di[s]tingui[s]hed you by the appellation of little [s]cribbler: that you were thoughtle[s]s, extravagant, proud, vain, and indolent: and that you had by your artful conduct alienated the affection of mon[s]ieur Lacour from his wife, and in all the[s]e a[s][s]ertions [s]he wss joined by her companions, who [s]eemed to con[s]ider you only as a fit object of ridicule. Tho' I could not avoid [s]eeing the motive that in[s]tigated the[s]e women was envy, yet the reviewers call it [s]ad tra[s]h, and my lady [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-242.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] I mu[s]t think you have not conducted yourself altogether in the prudent manner I [s]hould have expected from the character Mr. Welldon gave of you. Con[s]ider Mi[s]s Howard, indu[s]try is the only hope you can have of future [s]upport: let me conjure you therefore, as a friend, to throw a[s]ide the pen, and apply to your needle, and let your inventive fancy be exerted to decorate the per[s]ons of your fair country women. Believe me, the hill of Parna[s][s]us is too high for you to climb, unle[s]s you had the hand of independance to help you up; the fine[s]t turned poem will be entirely overlooked by the world when u[s]hered into it by an obscure author; while a raph[s]ody of non[s]en[s]e will be univer[s]ally read and applauded when the author is publicly known to be favoured with the [s]miles of fortune. We will [s]uppo[s]e, my dear, that you had fini[s]hed a plea[s]ing elegant poem, e[s][s]ay, novel, or what not; and that [s]ome book[s]eller [s]hould for a trifling con[s]ideration engage to introduce it to public notice; a new publication no [s]ooner makes it appearance than the people of fa[s]hion enquire, who the author is. "Have you read the new poem my lady?" [s]ays [s]ir Timothy Trifle. "No not I, is it good for any thing?" "'Pon honour I don't know, Pedegree told me it was wrote by a little milliner, who lived at Lacour's," [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-243.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] "Prithee, dear [s]ir Timothy, no more, I am quite [s]ick already; what can a milliner's girl know of litirature?" Thus my dear, you will find people of fa[s]hion will not give your book a peru[s]al: and tho' there are [s]ome few who may read it with plea[s]ure, and give it the encomiums its merit de[s]erves, they will be a[s]hamed to avow an opinion contrary to that of their [s]uperiors; while the generality of the world [s]atisfied with the [s]entence already pa[s][s]ed, will not be at the trouble of reading and judging for themselves: the con[s]equence will be you will not [s]ell enough to pay the expence of printing and paper, and you will have the mortification to [s]ee your poems u[s]ed as wa[s]te paper, to wrap up parcels, &c. I flatter my[s]elf, your natural good [s]en[s]e will lead you to con[s]ider this letter in the friendly light it was intended, that you will do your utmo[s]t to cradicate from the minds of your companions every idea they may have formed to your di[s]advantage, that you will drop all thought of [s]hining in the literary world, and apply your[s]elf chearfully to that employment by which you may hope to pa[s]s through life with comfort and re[s]pectability. I am, your [s]incere wellwi[s]her, H. FRIENDLY. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-244.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] The reception of this letter made me very unea[s]y, e[s]pecially the part which mentioned the illne[s]s of my kind hearted benefactor: I was grieved al[s]o to find what a bubble I had been to Mademoi[s]elle and all the apprentices, as they had all pretended to be greatly plea[s]ed with my writings, and had often [s]aid it was a thou[s]and pities, [s]o bright a genius [s]honld be buried in oblivion: however it opened my eyes to their deceit and flattery; and I determined to be more upon my guard in future. I felt extremely grateful to Mr. Friendly for the trouble he had taken in writing to me, an[s]wered his letter immediately, promi[s]ed to profit by his advice, and reqne[s]ted to be again favoured with a few lines whenever he [s]hould hear from Mr. Welldon. From this time I applied my[s]elf with great a[s][s]iduity to my employment; tho' I could not help noticing a vi[s]ible alteration in Mrs. Lacour's behaviour: [s]he became cold and di[s]tant, frequently [s]poke to me in a tone of di[s]plea[s]ure, and [s]eemed carefully to avoid my conver[s]ation, except what was ab[s]olutely nece[s][s]ary in the bu[s]ine[s]s. The apprentices treated me with di[s]re[s]pect, and Mademoi[s]elle aimed at me the mo[s]t pointed [s]arca[s]ms. Things were in this [s]ituation, when one day as I was [s]itting pen[s]ive in a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-245.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] little back parlour, where we u[s]ually breakfasted, I was [s]urpri[s]ed by the [s]udden entrance of Mon[s]ieur Lacour, who began in the u[s]ual [s]train to profe[s]s his admiration, and audaciou[s]ly [s]olicited return of his illicit pa[s][s]ion. "Your in[s]olence [s]ir," [s]aid I, "is insufferable, I can no longer [s]ubmit to it, and if ever again you [s]hock my ears with [s]uch infamous [s]olicitations I will inform your much injured wife of your intimacy with Mademoiselle." I then would have left the room but he threw him[s]elf between me and the door, and [s]eizing my hand, impudently [s]wore, my threat proceeded only from jealousy. "But come my [s]weet creature," [s]aid he "do not let that make you unea[s]y, I will promi[s]e never to [s]peak to Bagatelle again." He then fell on his knees with a look of ludicrous grimace, which at another time would only have made me laugh: but at that time I felt far different [s]en[s]ations. Unable to free my[s]elf from his gra[s]p, and hurt at the mean opinion he entertained of me, all my fortitude for[s]ook me, and I bur[s]t into tears. At that moment the door opened, and in rushed Mrs. Lacour, Mademoi[s]elle and Mr. Friendly. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-246.jpg) \- external link  - Page 067. ] "Oh Meriel!" cried Mrs. Lacour; "I could not have believed"---She would have fallen to the ground, had I not [s]prang forward to catch her as [s]he fainted. "You [s]ee [s]ir," [s]aid Mademoi[s]elle to Mr. Friendly, as we were [s]upporting Mrs. Lacour to a chair. "You [s]ee [s]ir, I told you only the truth." Mon[s]ieur, in the general confu[s]ion walked unob[s]erved away. My di[s]tre[s]s was very great to [s]ee Mrs. Lacour in this [s]ituation. I feared it might be of dangerous con[s]equence, as [s]he was far advanced in her pregnancy. I [s]upported her in my arms, chafed her temples with Hungary water, and on the fir[s]t return of life, begged her not to think me [s]o guilty as I appeared. She [s]hook her head, pu[s]hed me from her, and leaning on Mademoi[s]elle's arm, went out of the room. I then addre[s][s]ed Mr. Friendly as a stranger; for I did not at that time per[s]onally know him; and entreated he would endeavour to heal this breach between Mrs. Lacour and my[s]elf: "indeed [s]ir," [s]aid I, "[s]he is the only friend I have; I would [s]ooner die than injure her." I then related briefly every thing that had pa[s]t, and fully explained the cau[s]e of the tears he [s]aw me [s]hed. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-247.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] "Appearances are undoubtedly again[s]t you Mi[s]s Howard," [s]aid he, "but I am willing to believe you innocent. I am extremely [s]orry there is any di[s][s]ention between you and Mrs. Lacour, [s]he being as you have ju[s]t remarked, your only friend. I yesterday received a letter from Mrs. Welldon, informing me that her hu[s]band died about a fortnight [s]ince. She mentions you as a per[s]on of whom Mr. Welldon [s]poke in his la[s]t moments, and de[s]ires me to give you fifty pounds, to buy mourning; at the [s]ame time [s]he bids me inform you it is the la[s]t you will receive from her." I was [s]o overcome, indeed I may [s]ay stupified with grief, I was totally unable to answer. He [s]aw and I believe pitied my di[s]tre[s]s and thus continued. "I have added to this little pre[s]ent fifty pounds more; and would advi[s]e you to leave this family immediately, and in [s]ome genteel neighbourhood open a little [s]hop, endeavour to gain employment; be prudent and indu[s]trious, and I have no doubt of your [s]ucce[s]s; but prithee, good my girl, burn your pens and paper, and believe me, a woman makes as awkward a figure engaged in literary pur[s]uits, as a coun[s]ellor would do [s]eated at a tambour frame or bu[s]ied in assorting colours for embroidery." I promi[s]ed to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-248.jpg) \- external link  - Page 069. ] remember his friendly advice, he paid me the money and took his leave. I was now anxious to [s]ee Mrs. Lacour but all attempts to that purpo[s]e were fruitle[s]s. I wrote a letter prote[s]ting my innocence and received a verbal an[s]wer by one of the aprentices that the thing was too plain to admit of any doubt, that [s]he wi[s]hed me well but had no de[s]ire ever to [s]ee me again. I retired to my apartment with a heart overcharged with [s]orrow. At any other time, the death of my benevolent friend Mr. Welldon would have been in it[s]elf a [s]ufficient affliction: but now I had the additional one of knowing I had tho, unintionally, injured the health of a woman, I [s]incerely e[s]teemed, incurred the cen[s]ures of the world, and ca[s]t an indeliable blemi[s]h on my reputation, which it had ever been my [s]tudy to pre[s]erve un[s]ullied. In the[s]e melancholy reflections I pa[s]t the day; in the evening the [s]ervant brought me up a candle and [s]ome [s]upper: but I was too much agitated to eat, and went early to bed, tho' I was fully convinced that to [s]leep would be impo[s][s]ible. About twelve o'clock I heard a great bustle below, and fearing for Mrs. Lacour I jumped out of bed and opening my chamber door to li[s]ten, plainly heard one of the young [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-249.jpg) \- external link  - Page 070. ] women [s]ay, "[s]he cannot live, the doctor [s]ays it is impo[s][s]ible." Terrified beyond measure I put on a few cloaths and ran ha[s]tily down [s]tairs, determined at all events to [s]ee this dear [s]ufferer, and by convincing her of my innocence re[s]tore her mind to peace. The danger [s]he was in had thrown the family into [s]uch confu[s]ion, that I found no opposition made to my entering the appartment. The curtains were clo[s]e drawn round the bed, and there was little light in the room, [s]o that [s]he did not perceive me when I entered, I found the agitation of her mind had thrown her into a premature labour, and that the [s]urgeon imagined her life to be in iminent danger. Every other thought was now ab[s]orbed in my anxiety for her. I beckoned her [s]i[s]ter who was [s]etting by the bedside. She came to me, I told her the di[s]tre[s]s of my mind and begged her to believe me not guilty. "Dear Meriel," [s]aid [s]he, "I never thought you [s]o, nor would my poor [s]i[s]ter have ever entertained an idea to your prejudice, had it not been for the insinuations of Bagatelle, who has now plainly discovered the motive which led her [s]o maliciously to a[s]per[s]e your character: however no one can now have a doubt of your innocence. Mademoi[s]elle went out about eight this evening, which greatly [s]urpri[s]ed us, as my [s]i[s]ter was [s]o ill. As the evening [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-250.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] advanced, her ab[s]cence became more astonishing, and about an hour [s]ince a per[s]on called who had [s]een Bagatelle and the ungrateful Lacour get into a chai[s]e at an inn door and drive off for Dover." Tho' my heart bled for Mrs. Lacour, I could not but rejoice that this proceeding of theirs was a convicing proof of my innocence. I inquired, if this unfortunate woman had been informed of their per[s]idy, and being an[s]wered in the affirmative, and told that the intelligence had precipitated her illne[s]s, I a[s]ked, if I might be permited to [s]peak to her. When [s]he was informed that I was in the room, [s]he called me to her with a faint voice, and taking hold of my hand, [s]aid, "Meriel, forgive me, I have injured you; but I was my[s]elf decieved." She could not [s]ay more, her pains became excruciating, and after continuing many hours in a [s]tate of exqui[s]ite torture, [s]he resigned her breath, having given birth to a female infant who [s]urvived her mother but a few moments. Lacour's flight, and his wife's death was [s]oon [s]pread abroad; and it was di[s]covered that he had not only collected all the debts, previous to his departure, but had al[s]o stripped the hou[s]e of every thing valuable, [s]o [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-251.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] that when the creditors brought in their accounts, there was not [s]ufficient property to pay five [s]hillings in the pound. Every thing was immediately [s]eized, and the hapless Mrs. Lacour would have been obliged to the pari[s]h for a decent funeral, had not her [s]i[s]ter, tho' but in indifferent circumstances and my[s]elf borne the expence between us. When I had paid every nece[s][s]ary respect to the memory of this unfortunate woman, I began to think of my own affairs. You may remember my mentioning a Mrs. Moreton, from whom I had recieved many civilities. She lived at a [s]mall village a few miles out of town. To her I applied for advice, in my pre[s]ent embarra[s][s]ing [s]ituation. She received me with politene[s]s, told me [s]he would exert her[s]elf to the utmo[s]t to [s]erve me and [s]aid [s]he thought I might make my bu[s]ine[s]s an[s]wer very well in Ken[s]ington, where [s]he had many friends to whom [s]he could recommend me. To a heart formed for all the endearing and [s]ocial ties of life, how every little kindne[s]s is received with gratitude, and how does it feel the attentions even of common civility. I feel my[s]elf growing attached to this Mrs. Moreton, her manner is the mo[s]t prepo[s]e[s][s]ing, her form ellegant and and [s]he po[s]e[s][s]es the polite accomplishments in an imminent degree. She is the wife of an officer now in India, by whom [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-252.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] [s]he has two lovely children, her man[s]ion is a little terre[s]tial paradi[s]e. Every thing about it is neat, compact, and charming. I have not as yet met with an apartment to [s]uit me, tho' I have [s]een [s]everal, however it is determined I [s]hall not have a [s]hop but carry on my bu[s]ine[s]s as a chamber milliner. My heart almo[s]t [s]inks at the idea of a young, unprotected creature like my[s]elf, venturing upon [s]uch a plan, but what can I do, convinced as I am of the impo[s][s]ibility of ever doing any thing in the literary way, I [s]hall never more renew my attempts. I mu[s]t remember the la[s]t words of my dear mother, "be humble, patient and industrious, and rely on heaven for [s]upport." Let me have your prayers, my beloved Celia. But I need not a[s]k them, I am [s]ure my [s]weet benevolent friend looks round the whole univer[s]e with an eye of heavenly complacency, and wi[s]hes every bo[s]om as tranquil as her own; and that your happine[s]s may never be dimini[s]hed, is the fervant prayer of MERIEL. MERIEL to CELIA. -  Ken[s]ington Augu[s]t 23 d , 1780.

My Sundays I always [s]pend with Mrs. Moreton, accompanying her to church in the morning, [s]he dines [s]o late, it is impo[s][s]ible to go in the afternoon. She has introduced me to the family of a Mr. Belger, a man of great genius, and independent fortune: Mrs. Belger is the mo[s]t exqui[s]itely beautiful woman I ever beheld; but [s]he has no accompli[s]hments, nor can I think [s]he has been even decently educated; indeed, I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-254.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] have heard it whi[s]pered that [s]he is not his wife; however, [s]he goes by his name, does the honours of his table, and has by him a [s]weet little girl, the very image of her beautiful mother: this child has more firmly knit the bonds that holds her faithful to its father; but tho' every look, word and action, [s]peaks the ardency and purity of her attachment: he treats her with a cold re[s]pect, which I am [s]ure mu[s]t cut her to the [s]oul: he is civil, polite, but di[s]tant. In this family I [s]pend many agreeable hours; I think Mr. Belger the mo[s]t [s]en[s]ible man I ever conver[s]ed with, indeed, the more I conver[s]e with him the more I am convinced of my own ignorance; he kindly endeavours to in[s]truct me, directs my ta[s]te in the choice of authors, corrects my judgment, and takes great plea[s]ure in improving me in both music and drawing. To confe[s]s the truth, I have but little time to [s]pare for the[s]e persuits; but I [s]ometimes [s]teal a few hours from re[s]t to perform my nece[s][s]ary employments, that I may the next day have a little time to attend to Mr. Belger's in[s]tructions. We cannot quite agree about religious matters, but I di[s]pute with him, nor have I any doubt of making a convert of him; for at pre[s]ent, my dear Celia, this agreeable man either is or pretends to be an infidel; I rather think it is the latter, for he [s]aid the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-255.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] other evening he loved to hear my sentiments delivered with [s]uch charming enthusiasm, tho' they were in direct oppo[s]ition to his own. I have had [s]ome doubt about the propriety of continuing my intimacy in this family, as Mrs. Belger is [s]uppo[s]ed to be only his mi[s]tre[s]s; but her whole conduct is [s]uch as may call a blu[s]h upon the cheek of many an in[s]olent woman, who looking with mercile[s]s di[s]dain on her poor fallen [s]i[s]ters, [s]miles contemptou[s]ly and thanks heaven [s]he is virtuous. Mrs. Belger is a tender, exemplary mother, a kind mi[s]tre[s]s to her [s]ervants, a good chri[s]tian, and a meek, obedient, faithful, I had almo[s]t [s]aid wife; but the my[s]tic words have not pa[s][s]ed that can render her character re[s]pectable in every eye: you will therefore [s]ay, my dear Celia, [s]he is an improper companion for a girl who[s]e reputation has once been doubted, and cannot be regained by a[s][s]ociating with a woman, who[s]e character is [s]u[s]picious: True, my dear girl, but I feel my[s]elf [s]o attached to the family [s]o grateful for the attentions [s]hewn me, and am [s]o con[s]cious of my own [s]olitary friendle[s]s [s]ituation, that my heart deprived of every affection, every fond hope on which it once re[s]ted, naturally clings to tho[s]e who[s]e kindness [s]ooths its anxieties to re[s]t.

I have been [s]o frightened, my dear Celia, that I believe it will be [s]ometime before I recover my[s]elf; and I cannot but con[s]ider it a great mercy that I am alive and able to relate the cau[s]e of my terror. In the apartment adjoining the room where I [s]leep, the maid of the hou[s]e [s]leeps with two of the younger children, for they have a large family. About four o'clock this morning, I was awoke by a [s]en[s]e of [s]uffocation, and [s]tarting up, perceived my chamber to be full of [s]moak, I jumped out of bed and looking round to fee that there was no appearance of fire in the room, ventured to open one of the windows a little way to di[s]per[s]e it. I then opened the door, which led to the childrens room, here the [s]moak was more thick, and I found the [s]mell of fire grow [s]tronger; but what were my [s]en[s]ations, on going into their apartment to [s]ee a ba[s]ket of cloaths which [s]tood on a chair by the bed[s]ide all on fire, and the curtains of the bed which were fortunately of woolen ju[s]t beginning to burn. I had not an in[s]tant for con[s]ideration, Providence directed me; for I am con[s]cious that rea[s]on was for a few moments intirely suspended, I ran back to my own bed; dragged of a blanket and immediately threw it over the burning ba[s]ket, at the [s]ame time [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-257.jpg) \- external link  - Page 078. ] pouring on it a large pan of water, which [s]tood in the room, and had been placed there for the purpo[s]e of wa[s]hing the children. I then awoke the [s]ervant, and took the dear little innocents out of the bed; they had been [s]o nearly [s]uffocated it was with difficulty I awoke them, and when brought into the air blood gu[s]hed from their no[s]es: when I had a little recovered them and laid them in my bed, I returned to the other chamber, [s]ent the maid down for more water, and having entirely extingui[s]hed every appearance of fire, began to have the u[s]e of reflection: my own almo[s]t miraculous e[s]cape from [s]o horrible a death, the [s]afety of the children, nay, the pre[s]ervation of the lives and property of the whole family, impre[s][s]ed my mind with [s]uch awful gratitude towards the Power, who had in [s]uch unexpected danger in[s]pired and directed me, that I threw my[s]elf on my knees and bur[s]t into tears of unfeigned thankfulne[s]s. Had I not di[s]covered it at the time I did, we mu[s]t all have inevitably peri[s]hed; for the re[s]t of the family lay in apartments built di[s]tinctly from this part of the hou[s]e: the apartments I occupied were over the [s]hop, and this room really belonged to me, but as I had no u[s]e for it I gave it up to the [s]ervant and children. The ma[s]ter, mi[s]tre[s]s, three more children and two apprentices, [s]lept on [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-258.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] the ground floor behind the [s]hop, [s]o that the whole front of the hou[s]e might have been in flames, before they would have discovered it. I a[s]ked the girl how [s]he imagined the accident had happened; [s]he [s]aid [s]he often was obliged to [s]it up very late for her ma[s]ter, that [s]he had been up that night, till near two o'clock, and being obliged to work very hard in the day time, [s]he was very [s]leepy and weary; that [s]he imagines [s]he mu[s]t have left the candle burning on the floor, and that it had caught [s]ome of the linen that hung from the ba[s]ket. You may ea[s]ily [s]uppo[s]e I was not inclined to go to bed again, I therefore dre[s][s]ed my[s]elf, and waited the ri[s]ing of the family. When I heard Mrs. Newtram up, I took the two young children in my hand and went down. "You are up early, Mi[s]s Howard," [s]aid [s]he, "I hope the children have not been making a noi[s]e to di[s]turb you." "I was up much earlier than you can imagine," I replied, "but believe me the[s]e little dears have been very quiet and good, but I was [s]adly alarmed this morning at four o'clock." "Alarmed, my dear ma'am, at what?" "At an accident which had like to prove fatal to us all." "Good God!" [s]aid [s]he, "what can have been the matter?" "Come, come, my good Mrs. Newtram," [s]aid I, [s]eeing her turn pale, "there is no occa[s]ion for terror [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-259.jpg) \- external link  - Page 080. ] now, the danger is pa[s]t, you [s]ee your children are [s]afe, but we have been all on fire up [s]tairs to night." "Merciful heaven!" [s]aid [s]he, "that carele[s]s Betty." "Do not blame the girl Mrs. Newtram, fatigued as [s]he is in the day time, [s]he cannot be supposed capable of [s]itting up till two or three o'clock in the morning, e[s]pecially when we recollect [s]he in general ri[s]es at [s]ix, to perform her daily avocations; and I will ju[s]t beg leave to mention that it is my earne[s]t wi[s]h [s]he may be forgiven: [s]he has [s]uffered enough already from her fright, do not, therefore, reproach her, and I will be answerable [s]uch an accident never happens again in any place where [s]he is." I then took Mrs. Newtram up [s]tairs, and [s]hewed her the things that had been on fire. When [s]he [s]aw the imminent danger to which her children had been expo[s]ed, [s]he caught them in her arms and with all the enthu[s]ia[s]m of maternal affection, ble[s]t heaven for their pre[s]ervation. "Oh! Mi[s]s Howard," [s]aid [s]he, "how can we ever be grateful enough for your quick recollection in [s]uch an alarming [s]ituation; we are bound to con[s]ider you as our guardian angel." I [s]topped the good woman in the mid[s]t of her acknowledgments, to renew my entreties for Betty's pardon, and that [s]he might [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-260.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] be continued in her place. "I can deny you nothing," [s]aid [s]he; "but I am afraid Mr. Newtram will be inveterate again[s]t her." "That will be cruel indeed," [s]aid I, "for he was him[s]elf undoubtedly the prior cau[s]e of the accident, by keeping [s]uch very late hours." She then went down [s]tairs, and I went to breakfa[s]t; which before I had half fini[s]hed was interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Newtram. He repeated every acknowledgment before made by his wife, [s]ealed Betty's pardon, and declared he wi[s]hed for nothing more, than for [s]ome opportunity to convince me of his gratitude, and that he would almo[s]t lay down his life to [s]erve me. Thus you [s]ee, my dear Celia, this accident will in the end terminate for my good, as it [s]eems to have [s]ecured the affection and friend[s]hip of tho[s]e, in who[s]e hou[s]e I re[s]ide; and in ca[s]e of future trouble I make no doubt, but I [s]hall find in the[s]e worthy people, a kindne[s]s nearly maternal. Farewell my friend; your's ever. MERIEL. MERIEL to CELIA. -  Ken[s]ington December 5 th , 1780.

I always am one of the party. Sometimes I perform on the piano forte; [s]ometimes [s]ing, and always meet with [s]uch applau[s]e, as almo[s]t makes me vain; indeed the prai[s]es of Mr. Belger only, are [s]ufficient for that purpose. He is the only man I could ever think perfectly agreeable, [s]ince the conduct of Rainsforth gave me [s]o very de[s]picable an opinion of the whole [s]ex. But of one thing I am convinced; it is dangerous to enter into arguments with per[s]ons who have an improper opinion of religious matters. I have had frequent conver[s]ations with Mr. Belger on this topic, and in[s]tead of being able to convince him of his errors. (You will tremble whem I tell you) I have only imbibed his principles, and find doubt ari[s]ing in my mind concerning the mo[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-262.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] sacred parts of the holy writings. Oh! my dear Celia, pray for your weak friend, that [s]he may not be lo[s]t by li[s]tening to this insinuating man. I have indeed made frequent re[s]olutions to avoid his company, and as frequently broke them. I take my heart [s]everely to ta[s]k. Surely Celia, after it has [s]uffered [s]o much from the perfidy of the [s]ex, it cannot be [s]o weak, nay [s]o wicked, as to feel an attachment for a man who is another's right. Do not fear for me, my beloved friend; if I cannot command my feelings, I can my actions. Should I at [s]ome future period di[s]cover that Rainsforth is not the capricious character, he at pre[s]ent appears, I will never have the mortification to reflect, I have rendered my[s]elf unworthy of his e[s]teem: if otherwi[s]e, it [s]hall never be in the power of any man to boa[s]t, that he has triumphed over the virtue of Meriel Howard. No Celia, I may be unfortunate, but I never will be guilty. Bu[s]ine[s]s does not an[s]wer [s]o well as I expected. Many, I believe, employed me at fir[s]t from motives of curio[s]ity, and that being gratified, they return to tho[s]e they formerly dealt with; and I have now scarcely enough to employ my[s]elf, and one young woman, whom Mrs. Moreton has recommended to me. However, I keep up my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-263.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] [s]pirits as well as I can, and hope for better times. My letters are few, you [s]ay lately. Indeed I have nothing either new or interesting to write about. When I have, you [s]hall hear from your MERIEL. MERIEL to CELIA. -  London February 9 th , 1781. What a world this is, my friend, and of what a medly of [s]trange inconsistent characters is it compo[s]ed. Were it not impious, I could wi[s]h I had never entered it. Some few years [s]ince, I believed every heart glowed with humanity, friend[s]hip and [s]incerity toward each other. Yes, Celia, at the time I left the convent the[s]e were [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-264.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] my ideas of the world. Nay it is but very lately I began to perceive how erroneous my opinion was; but believe me, the more we know of mankind the le[s]s we find to admire or e[s]teem. The heart grows hardened by repeated di[s]appointments, and from having an unbounded confidence in our fellow-creatures, we begin to [s]u[s]pect every one of hypocrisy. My dear friend, I am [s]till the [s]port of capricious fortune. Deceived, betrayed by tho[s]e I mo[s]t loved and tru[s]ted, I have no comfort left but my dependance on heaven, (which thank God, I have regained) and the con[s]cious integrity of my own heart. Some little time after my la[s]t letter, Mrs. Moreton called on me one morning, in her way to town, and a[s]ked if I would take a ride with her. She was in Mr. Belger's carriage. I had nothing to prevent me and immediately complied. We proceeded to town, and [s]topped at a [s]ilk mercer's. Mrs. Moreton ordered [s]ome [s]ilks to be put up, but when [s]he came to pay for them, di[s]covered [s]he had left her pur[s]e behind her. I had money sufficient about me, and therefore offered to pay the amount of the bill. "Do [s]o, my dear," [s]aid [s]he, "it will be all the [s]ame. I can pay you again when we get home." It came to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-265.jpg) \- external link  - Page 086. ] upwards of ten pounds, as [s]he purcha[s]ed a piece of [s]ilk for a lady whom [s]he expected out of the country. When we returned the expected lady was arrived. She approved the [s]ilk, and after dinner took a walk to my apartments, where [s]he ordered [s]ome very elegant linen to be made: the lace [s]he cho[s]e it to be trimed with, was two guineas per yard. You can get this done by Saturday afternoon, [s]aid Mrs. Moreton, for we are obliged to pay a vi[s]it to very particular people, and this lady would wi[s]h to have it to wear. As [s]oon as they were gone, I wrote to a laceman in town, to [s]end me more of the lace; for the handkerchief, apron, and ruffles were all to be full trimed. As I had dealt with him before, he did not he[s]itate. The mu[s]lin I had by me; and on Saturday afternoon, according to their de[s]ire, I took the whole [s]uit home, which, when fini[s]hed, came to near fifty pounds. They were much plea[s]ed with it, and de[s]ired I would bring my bill on Monday morning, about twelve o'clock. I had a [s]mall gold watch by my [s]ide, which was given me by Mr. Welldon. It was of no great value, but for the [s]ake of the doner, it was highly prized by me. "Meriel, my love," [s]aid Mrs. Moreton, "I have [s]ent my watch to be cleaned; I [s]hall be at a lo[s]s to know how time goes: do lend me your's for this evening." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-266.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] "I [s]et great [s]tore by it, madam," [s]aid I, "it was the gift of a decea[s]ed friend; but I think you will be careful of it." "As I would of my own," [s]he replied, as [s]he took it. "Stay, madam," [s]aid I, "there is a little trinket to it which I have vowed never to part with." (It was a [s]mall locket which contained a lock of my dear mother's hair). She [s]uffered me to take it off, and Mr. Belger's coach coming to the door to attend the ladies, they [s]et me down at my own lodging, and proceeded to town. The next day, being Sunday, I dined at Mr. Belger's, where I was [s]urpri[s]ed to hear that the ladies had [s]ent home the carriage, without returning them[s]elves, and that Mrs. Moreton's children were in town with her. However I felt no unea[s]ine[s]s or [s]u[s]picion, and on Monday morning repaired to Mrs. Moreton's with my bill: but to my utter a[s]toni[s]hment found the hou[s]e entirely [s]hut up, and was informed by a neighbour, that it was a ready furni[s]hed hou[s]e, which [s]he had occupied near a twelve-month, and that [s]he had di[s]charged her [s]ervant on Saturday morning; that they had every rea[s]on to suppose [s]he did not intend to come back again, for [s]he had not paid the hou[s]e rent, and was be[s]ides in debt to every body in the neighbourhood, who would tru[s]t her; and that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-267.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] on going into the hou[s]e, which the landlord had done early this morning, they found nothing in it that had ever belonged to her; but mi[s][s]ed a con[s]iderable quantity of linen, which had been lent her when [s]he took the hou[s]e. I was now fatally convinced that my confidence in Mrs. Moreton had been ill placed; the linen I had made, the money I had lent, had, altogether, greatly contributed to reduce my finances, and I began to [s]ee the difficulties, in which this ungenerous conduct would involve me. At fir[s]t, it [s]truck me, that Mr. Belger had been acce[s][s]ary to her departure; but in this I was deceived, for on calling there, I found they were as greatly [s]urprized as I had been, and that her [s]pecious appearance had [s]o far impo[s]ed on him, that he had lent her twenty guineas only a few days before. Overwhelm'd with this new affliction, I returned to my lodging; but judge if you po[s][s]ibly can, of my increa[s]ed angui[s]h, when, on entering my bed-chamber, I [s]aw my bureau had been forced open, all my ca[s]h gone, and with it a quantity of edging to a large amount. Almo[s]t ready to [s]ink with the terror that [s]eized my mind, I rang the bell violently, and nobody immediately an[s]wering, I ran down to Mrs. Newtram's apartments and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-268.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] enquired after Kitty. "Ble[s]s me, Mi[s]s Howard," [s]aid Mrs. Newtram, "did you not di[s]charge her before you went out this morning." "No, indeed I had not the mo[s]t di[s]tant thought of [s]uch a thing." "Well, that's [s]trange now; for you had not been out above five minutes, before [s]he came down crying, and begged one of the apprentices to go for a coach, [s]aid you had di[s]charged her at a moment's warning, but [s]he would go directly home to her mother. When the coach came, we helped her in with her boxes, and [s]he drove away, ordering the man to [s]top at the White Hor[s]e Cellar, Piccadilly." "I'm undone," [s]aid I, "what will become of me;" and [s]unk almo[s]t fainting, into a chair. Mrs. Newtram got me [s]ome hart[s]horn and water, after which I began to [s]hed tears, which in [s]ome mea[s]ure relieved me. "Dear Mi[s]s," cried Mrs. Newtram, "what can have happened: have you lo[s]t any of your friends?" "Oh!" [s]aid I, "I have no friends; I am the mo[s]t unfortunate creature breathing, nor do I know how to extricate my[s]elf from the difficulties that [s]urround me." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-269.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] I then gave her an account of Mrs. Moreton's departure, of the money, &c. I had tru[s]ted her with, and concluded with the di[s]covery I had ju[s]t made of Kitty's dishonesty. "Why to be [s]ure Mi[s]s Howard," [s]aid [s]he, "it is a [s]ad lo[s]s; but you [s]hould have been upon your guard again[s]t Mrs. Moreton; you certainly knew [s]he was a woman of dubious character; and to tell you the truth, Mr. Newtram and I have often [s]aid it was a great pity, [s]o [s]weet a young lady [s]hould be [s]o intimate, with a woman of that kind: then there is Mrs. Belger, why all the world knows [s]he is no better than [s]he [s]hould be; and you can't think what ill natured things have been [s]aid in the neighbourhood, about your being [s]o much with them." "As to Mrs. Moreton," [s]aid I, "believe me, I had not the lea[s]t idea, but that [s]he was a woman of re[s]pectable character; and tho' I have heard [s]ome things, not quite [s]o much to Mrs. Belger's advantage, I never [s]aw a woman in my life who[s]e whole conduct demanded more re[s]pect and e[s]teem." "Upon my word Mi[s]s," [s]aid [s]he, "I am [s]urprized to hear you talk [s]o, when you know (drawing up her head) Mr. Belger [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-270.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] is not her hu[s]band; but that I have a very good opinion of you, I [s]hould think you was as bad as [s]he." "I think, Mrs. Newtram," [s]aid I, "as you [s]eem to know Mrs. Moreton's character [s]o well it would have been but friendly to have given me a little warning." "Why, la! Mi[s]s, you know it was no bu[s]ine[s]s of mine, and you told me your[s]elf you knew her before you came to [s]ettle here: but, how do you mean to do? I suppose you have [s]ome friends to whom you can apply; if you have any letter, or any thing to [s]end to town one of our young men [s]hall take it." "I tell you again Mrs. Newtram, I have not a friend in the world; I am a poor solitary being, unconnected with the world, or any one in it; and were I this moment to leave it, not one tear of affection or regret would be [s]hed upon my grave." "Dear, now that's very odd, mo[s]t people have [s]ome friend or other, but I [s]uppo[s]e you have offended all your's." "They are dead," [s]aid I, "and unle[s]s you favour me with your advice and a[s][s]i[s]tance, I know not to whom el[s]e to apply." "To be [s]oure, I'll [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-271.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] give you the be[s]t advice in my power, but had you not better apply to Mr. Belger?" "Oh no, I would wi[s]h to hide my distress from him in particular." "You are in debt? I [s]uppo[s]e," a[s]ked Mrs. Newtram, in a quick accent. "Yes, I owe above forty guineas." "Well, and there is a quarter's rent of the lodging due, that's eight more, then there's the laundre[s]s and the baker." "True," [s]aid I, in an humble tone, "but I [s]uppo[s]e my furniture will [s]ell for as much as will pay them." "And is that all your dependance? then I [s]hall take care that we loo[s]e nothing: here, Newtram," continued [s]he, opening a door that looked into the [s]hop, "here, [s]tep here:" when he came in, [s]he told him my [s]ituation and concluded, "then you know, as that is the ca[s]e, we had better take care of our[s]elves, and be the fir[s]t to take the furniture." "That's true dame," [s]aid he, "[s]o d'ye [s]ee, Mi[s]s, we'll [s]end for a man to 'prai[s]e the goods to-morrow." A[s]toni[s]hment almo[s]t [s]u[s]pended my faculties: "ju[s]t heaven!" [s]aid I, "is this friend[s]hip?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-272.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] "Friend[s]hip," [s]aid [s]he, tartly, "I have a large family Mi[s]s, and all my friend[s]hip mu[s]t be exerted for my children: if I was inclined to give you the eight guineas you owe me I cannot do it in ju[s]tice to the[s]e little innocents." Celia, [s]he pointed to the two children I had [s]aved from the fire: I fixed my eyes on the unoffending infants, a fre[s]h flood of tears bur[s]t from them, I folded my hands upon my bo[s]om and remained [s]ilent. It was now one o'clock and the [s]ervant brought in their dinner; they [s]at down to table, but did not a[s]k me to partake, I [s]hould not have noticed the impropriety of my remaining in their apartment, had I not been rou[s]ed from my [s]tupefaction by the youngest girl, who getting from her [s]eat brought her plate of victuals and laid it in my lap, and taking up a bit put it towards my mouth crying, "there Mi[s][s]y eat [s]ome dinnee." I ki[s][s]ed the dear child, and apologizing for my intru[s]ion went up to my apartment; where I vented my full heart, in an unrestrained [s]lood of tears. Toward evening Betty came into my room; [s]he [s]aid her mi[s]tre[s]s was gone out, and [s]he had [s]tolen up unknown to her ma[s]ter [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-273.jpg) \- external link  - Page 094. ] to [s]ee if [s]he could do any thing for me. "You have had no dinner," [s]aid the kind girl, "pray let me get you [s]ome tea." She then made up the fire, and pre[s]ently provided this repa[s]t, which however disinclined, I forced my[s]elf to take, to ea[s]e poor Betty's anxiety. When [s]he had removed the tea things and lighted a candle, [s]he went down [s]tairs again, and I [s]at pen[s]ive and [s]olitary, retracing the pa[s]t events of my life. Alas! [s]aid I, how very hard is my fate. Po[s][s]e[s][s]ed as I am of a heart moulded to compassion, glowing with univer[s]al affection towards my fellow creatures, I am con[s]tantly thrown among people, who[s]e every feeling is ab[s]orbed in [s]elf. Yet [s]ure humanity is the child of nature; it is a heavenly [s]park of intellectual fire, implanted in our [s]ouls by the hand divine. Every heart is endowed with it more or le[s]s; but an intercourse with the world contributes to blunt tho[s]e keen [s]en[s]ations, till by degrees they are entirely deadened, and we can look on a [s]cene of mi[s]ery without the lea[s]t emotion, if it interferes not with our own intere[s]t or happiness. Yet I cannot think that I [s]hall ever arrive at that happy [s]tate of torpidity, for [s]ure, while I can feel my own [s]orrows, I [s]hall never be in[s]en[s]ible to the woes of others; for never yet did I [s]ee a per[s]on in affliction, but I made their ca[s]e my own, and my heart would [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-274.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] instantly overflow with pity. But alas! no heart melts with pity for me. Even Mrs. Newtram [s]eems to have forgot that [s]he has daughters, or [s]he would [s]urely compa[s][s]ionate my [s]ufferings, by reflecting that tho[s]e darlings of her heart may perhaps one day be in the [s]ame [s]ituation. I was [s]till pur[s]uing this melancholy train of thought, when I was [s]tartled by a gentle tap at the door. I aro[s]e and opened it, but was [s]urpri[s]ed to [s]ee Mr. Belger enter the room. "Dear Mi[s]s Howard," [s]aid he, "forgive this liberty. I have been informed of your di[s]tre[s]s by your officious landlady, whom I have left chattering to to Mrs. Belger, while I [s]lipped away to offer any a[s][s]i[s]tance in my power to my charming little friend." I bowed my head, but could not an[s]wer. I motioned towards a chair. He [s]eated him[s]elf and continued: "My dear Meriel, I have long feared what is now realized; I knew from the fir[s]t moment I [s]aw you, that you were never de[s]igned for the [s]tation, in which you have lately moved. The elegance of your manner, the delicacy of your [s]entiments convince me you are far superior to tho[s]e women with whom it has been your misfortune to be obliged to a[s][s]ociate." "Indeed, Mr. Belger," [s]aid I, "I am conscious of that [s]uperioty in nothing but misery. I look round me with a de[s]ponding eye, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-275.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] and think the world does not contain [s]o friendle[s]s, [s]o wretched a creature as my[s]elf." "From my [s]oul do I pity you," [s]aid he, taking my hand, "and wi[s]h it was in my power effectually to [s]erve you without offering any thing that might alarm your sensibility; but that is impo[s][s]ible. I know of but one method, by which you can be extricated from your pre[s]ent difficulties." "Alas, [s]ir," I replied, "I have not the lea[s]t hope of being extreated. All my furniture will be [s]eized to-morrow, and I [s]hall turned from this habitation without knowing how to provide another." "Not [s]o, beloved girl," [s]aid he. "You cannot think I will [s]uffer it. Long have I adored your merits. You mu[s]t have [s]een my ardent affection, which has [s]o often bur[s]t thro' the thin veil, prudence obliged me to throw over it; and if vanity has not mi[s]led me, I flatter my[s]elf I am not altogether indifferent to you; if [s]o, my dear creature, what remains, but that we this night bid adieu to all the[s]e vexations? Let us defy the malignant cen[s]ures of the world, and happy in each other's affections, ri[s]e [s]uperior to the narrow bounds impo[s]ed by prie[s]t-craft and [s]uper[s]tition; dare to think and act for our[s]elves, and [s]eek that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-276.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] felicity on the continent, which a concurrence of untoward circum[s]tances prevents our enjoying in England." Amazement had taken entire po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of me during this [s]peech; I was almo[s]t dedeprived of the power of utterance. At length I exclaimed "good God! how have I de[s]erved this in[s]ult? Ungenerous man, have you forgot Mrs. Belger." "Dear Meriel," [s]aid he, "do not rai[s]e imaginary ob[s]tacles. You as well as all the re[s]t of the world know I am not married to that woman." "But you are bound to her, [s]ir, by every tie of honour and gratitude." "Mi[s]s Howard," [s]aid he, gravely, "can you lay your hand upon your heart, and [s]ay you do not regard me with a [s]entiment more lively than friend[s]hip." "If I know that heart, Mr. Belger, it will never love whom it cannot e[s]teem. And whatever may be its feeling I have learnt to conquer." I could not fini[s]h what I intended to [s]ay, my tears flowed [s]o fa[s]t they almo[s]t choaked me. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-277.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] "Deare[s]t, gentle[s]t girl," [s]aid he, "I [s]ee the tenderne[s]s you vainly [s]trive to hide, then come let us fly to France and in[s]ure at once both your own happine[s]s and mine." "What will become of your Emma," [s]aid I, "Can you re[s]olve to for[s]ake your child?" "Thank you, my [s]weet girl, for the remembrance, [s]he [s]hall be the companion of our flight." "And [s]o drive her poor mother to distraction. No, Mr. Belger, never [s]hall it be [s]aid of Meriel Howard, that [s]he had by her perfidy placed a dagger in the heart of an innocent woman; nor [s]hall you forget this confiding, affectionate woman. Has [s]he not [s]acrificed every con[s]ideration to you, friends, reputation, all that can render life desireable. If [s]he is not your wife, [s]he ought to have been [s]o long [s]ince. And tho' you were dearer to me than the vital tide that nouri[s]hes my heart, that heart [s]hould break rather than injure her. In the mid[s]t of poverty and di[s]tre[s]s, if I can pre[s]erve my integrity un[s]haken, I [s]hall [s]till have one comfort, of which no earthly power can deprive me." Leave me Mr. Belger, I wi[s]h to be alone. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-278.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] "Unkind girl to treat me thus, when it was my intention to extricate you from the[s]e impending difficulties and placed you in affluence." "You would have degraded me to infamy, I thank your genero[s]ity." "By heavens! Mi[s]s Howard I will marry you." "No, Mr. Belger, that would be only u[s]ing the [s]acred ceremony as a cloak to per[s]idy and deceit. Leave me, [s]ir, my re[s]olution is [s]ixed, and not the cruele[s]t tortures poverty and its attendant evils can inflict [s]hall tempt me to alter it." I then broke from him, and going into an inner apartment fa[s]tened the door, and waited till I was certain he had left the hou[s]e. Tho' I now found my[s]elf plunged in the mo[s]t mi[s]erable [s]ituation, I felt a [s]ecret satisfaction in reflecting I had acted with propriety in regard to Mr. Belger, as rea[s]on plainly pointed out how little hope there could be of felicity with a man, who could, guided merely by the caprice of pa[s][s]ion, for[s]ake a woman [s]o faithful, and [s]o tender as Mrs. Belger. Religion al[s]o told me, how little I [s]hould de[s]erve, [s]hould I be [s]o [s]elfi[s]h as to fix the ba[s]is of my own pro[s]perity, on the mi[s]ery of a fellow creature, "Almighty Father," [s]aid I, "a[s][s]i[s]t me with thy grace that I may be enabled to per[s]orm my duty [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-279.jpg) \- external link  - Page 100. ] in every [s]tate of life, and allot me what trials thy infinite wi[s]dom [s]hall think proper." I breathed this [s]hort prayer as I retired to bed, a [s]weet [s]erenity came over my mind, and I enjoyed a profound [s]leep till near eight the next morning. I will now conclude this long letter; be a[s][s]ured you [s]hall not long wait for the [s]equel of my melancholy tale. Your's ever MERIEL. MERIEL to CELIA. -  London March 2 d , 1781. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-280.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] I judge of my dear Celia's impatience, by what I [s]hould feel where [s]he in the situation in which I was, when I concluded my la[s]t: I will not trifle with you, but proceed in my narrative. The next morning I aro[s]e and went down [s]tairs to Mr. Newtram, told him I was ready to admit the per[s]ons he had mentioned into the apartment to value the furniture, and hoped there would be more than [s]ufficient to pay all I owed: I was continuing to [s]peak to him, when turning my head I [s]aw the laceman enter the [s]hop. He pretended not to know my situation, tho' I am certain he had been [s]ent for by Newtram, and told me a long [s]tory, to which I paid but little attention, about having a large [s]um to make up, &c. I de[s]ired him to wait a little while, and I made no [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-281.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] doubt but I [s]hould have [s]ufficient to di[s]charge his bill. Alas! my Celia, I did not at that time think of the va[s]t difference between selling and buying. I knew the little furniture I po[s][s]e[s][s]ed, together with what Mr. Welldon had given me, had co[s]t more than [s]ixty pounds and were at pre[s]ent nearly as good as new. But when the man had looked them over, and taken an inventory, he offered me only thirty five guineas for the whole, in which was included my piano forte. I urged how much more they had co[s]t me, and how little they had been u[s]ed. He an[s]wered that was nothing to him; he could afford to give no more; there were [s]ome things would be of no u[s]e to him; they would lay a dead [s]tock upon his hands, and if I did not choo[s]e to take that, it was all very well, he had rather leave them than have them. What could I do? I found I mu[s]t either [s]ell them or go to pri[s]on, and tho' I knew not by what means to [s]upport life, liberty had [s]till [s]ome charms for me. I took the money, and turning toward my creditors, for by this time they were all a[s][s]embled, laid the money on the table, and de[s]ired Mr. Newtram to pay them all as far as it would go; but they were not to be [s]atisfied with this. "You have good cloaths, Mi[s]s Howard," [s]aid Newtram, "you cannot expect poor people will [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-282.jpg) \- external link  - Page 103. ] [s]et down quietly with their lo[s]s, and [s]uffer you to go off with a trunk full of finery." "Alas! [s]ir," [s]aid I, "the cloaths you mention are [s]o few and compo[s]ed of [s]uch indifferent materials, I did not think they would be of any value but to the owner. There are [s]ome few pices of edging, [s]ir," continued I, turning to the laceman, "which I mu[s]t beg of you to take again." My trunks were now brought down [s]tairs. Mrs. Newtram cho[s]e out the be[s]t of my gowns, linen, &c. which were [s]et down at le[s]s than half their value: the edgings were produced, when to my utter a[s]toni[s]hment, the laceman declared he would not take them without an allowance of one third of what I had paid him for them only a few months before. At length all demands were di[s]charged, my furniture taken away, and my[s]elf left solitary in the empty rooms: I went down [s]tairs and delivered up the keys. I had done nothing but weep all day, and had taken no kind of nouri[s]hment [s]ince my breakfa[s]t, and it was now four o'clock in the afternoon. Mrs. Newtram did not a[s]k me to [s]it down; but when I left the parlour I felt my[s]elf [s]o [s]ick and faint that I was obliged to [s]it down on the foot of the [s]tairs, where my feelings became [s]o poignant that I thought I [s]hould have been [s]uffocated. Poor Betty came to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-283.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] me, and endeavoured to comfort me, but her own [s]obs were [s]o audible as to prevent my under[s]tanding what [s]he [s]aid: In a few moments Mrs. Newtram came out of the parlour. "Dear me, Mi[s]s Howard," [s]aid [s]he, "you will make your[s]elf quite ill with fretting, and then, what is to become of you; come, come, cheer up, all will be well again, by and by; one of our young men will call you a coach, you don't con[s]ider how [s]oon it is dark this time of the year." "I don't want a coach," [s]aid I, "there is nothing very heavy to carry; I will tye up a few things in a handkerchief and leave the re[s]t till I have [s]ome [s]ettled place of abode, when I will [s]end for them." "But it's a wet evening, child," [s]aid [s]he, "and a long walk to town." "No matter, I will not have a coach." "Perhaps, Mi[s]s Howard, you will be affronted, but if you cannot pay for one, accept the[s]e five [s]hillings." Celia, this vile o[s]tentation, this [s]hew of genero[s]ity, after [s]he had [s]tripped me of almost every thing, awakened my re[s]entment. "No, Mrs. Newtram," [s]aid I, "if I am obliged to borrow money, I have a few more cloaths left, on which I imagine I can rai[s]e it; but at pre[s]ent I have a few [s]hillings, which is [s]ufficient for this evening, to-morrow I will [s]end for my cloaths." She flung [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-284.jpg) \- external link  - Page 105. ] into the parlour, muttering [s]omething about ingratitude, pride and poverty. It was a cold rainy evening, the latter end of October, when with a [s]mall bundle in my hand, and a load of grief at my heart, I [s]et forward on foot from Ken[s]ington; I had not proceeded far before I heard a quick [s]tep behind me, and pre[s]ently was acco[s]ted by Mr. Belger. "Where are you going my dear creature, this cold, wet night?" "I am going to town, [s]ir, and am in ha[s]te." "Where [s]hall you lodge in town?" "Indeed, I do not know." "My dear Mi[s]s Howard, you are I fear more di[s]tre[s][s]ed than you are willing to confe[s]s, believe me I am your friend, con[s]ide in me, I will not [s]uffer you to want any a[s][s]i[s]tance in my power to give; but we cannot conveniently con[s]ult what is be[s]t to be done, thus in the open [s]treet; [s]tep into this hou[s]e, (we were ju[s]t oppo[s]ite an hou[s]e of entertainment,) I have ordered my carriage here to take me up, and when we have had a cup of tea we will proceed to town together." "No, [s]ir," [s]aid I, "it is to no purpo[s]e to [s]olicit me, I am determined to go on to town immediately." "Than let me call a coach, my dear girl, you mu[s]t not be thus expo[s]ed to the inclemency of the weather." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-285.jpg) \- external link  - Page 106. ] "Mr. Belger, if you wi[s]h me to believe you my friend, leave me, nor thus increa[s]e my almo[s]t in[s]upportable load of angui[s]h, by making offers which I neither can nor will accept." "Then let me have the plea[s]ure of [s]upplying you with ca[s]h till it is in your power to repay me." This too I obstinately refu[s]ed, and the rain ju[s]t then increa[s]ing, he cea[s]ed his [s]olicitations after [s]aying I [s]hould always find a friend in him, he left me to pur[s]ue my uncomfortable walk. It was near [s]even o'clock, when I arrived in town, with only a few [s]hillings in my pocket no friend to apply to and entirely at a lo[s]s how to di[s]po[s]e of my[s]elf that night, as the people in London are fearful of taking strangers into their hou[s]es, without a proper recommendation; not having [s]ufficient resolution to apply to any hou[s]e for a lodging I kept walking on till I came to the [s]trand, where, ju[s]t as I was pa[s][s]ing a large haberdasher's [s]hop, a carriage overturned, the hor[s]es took fright, and I ran with many others into the [s]hop, for [s]afety; I had not been there above five minutes, before I heard a female voice exclaim, good God! can it be? yes, I am certain it is Mi[s]s Howard; the lady had now come clo[s]e up to me, and on rai[s]ing my eyes, I beheld Amelia Sidney a young lady whom I had once or twice [s]een at my aunts. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-286.jpg) \- external link  - Page 107. ] Shall I confe[s]s, that [s]hame at being [s]een in [s]o draggled a condition was the fir[s]t sensation I felt, however, Amelia [s]oon made me forget that, when kindly taking my hand in the [s]oft voice of affection, [s]he [s]aid, "my dear Mi[s]s Howard, where have you hid your[s]elf all this time;" then ob[s]erving my wet cloak and bonnet, [s]he continued: "You have been walking in the rain my love, I have a coach waiting, give me leave to [s]et you down wherever you wi[s]h to go." The [s]oothing voice of tenderne[s]s as [s]oon wrings tears from the afflicted heart, as does the churli[s]h voice of chiding, but then the one drops gently, while the [s]ofte[s]t sensations pervade the [s]oul, the other is the [s]ource of [s]uch real angui[s]h, that memory will retain the pain they occa[s]ion for years afterwards. I could not an[s]wer the kind mi[s]s Sidney, but followed her in [s]ilence to the coach, when we were [s]eated [s]he again renewed her que[s]tion, "where will you be [s]et down?" The angui[s]h of my heart now bur[s]t out, and I cried, I have no home: all places are alike to me, "then you [s]hall go home with me," [s]aid Amelia. "Oh Mi[s]s Sidney," [s]aid I, "do not think by thus accpting your kind offer of [s]tepping into the coach I mean to throw my[s]elf on your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-287.jpg) \- external link  - Page 108. ] benevolence, my only motive was to have an opportunity of enquiring whether you could recommend me to any place, where I might lodge for a little time, till I could con[s]ider how to di[s]po[s]e of my[s]elf in future. Favour me with your advice, dear lady, for indeed I have no friends in the world, who intere[s]ts them[s]elves the lea[s]t in my welfare." She pre[s][s]ed my hand and after [s]oftly [s]aying, "be comfored, my dear," remained [s]ilent, till the coach [s]topped, [s]he then a[s][s]i[s]ted me to alight, and leading me up [s]tairs left me a few moments in the drawing room; but [s]oon returned with her mother. Mrs. Sidney received me with the chearful [s]mile of an old friend, and Amelia brought a change of cloaths which [s]he in[s]i[s]ted on my putting on. Supper [s]oon came in. The manner which Mrs. Sidney and her daughter ob[s]erved towards me, was delicate and attentive in the extreme. Not a word [s]caped them that had the lea[s]t appearance of curio[s]ity; they [s]eemed to treat me as tho' I had been paying an expected vi[s]it, and to con[s]ider my company as an obligation; when the cloath was removed, I told my amiable ho[s]te[s]s, I thought it but right [s]he [s]hould know by what means I became reduced to [s]o di[s]tre[s]t a condition, but Amelia [s]topped me. "Dear Mi[s]s Howard," [s]aid [s]he, "if it is in our power to [s]erve you, do not he[s]itate to point out [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-288.jpg) \- external link  - Page 109. ] the way, and you will not find us backward in performing it; but I in[s]i[s]t that you do not enter into explanations which may be painful to you. You have no doubt been unfortunate, as [s]uch and knowing the excellence of your heart, you have a claim upon my friend[s]hip, I am ready to prove my[s]elf your [s]incere well wi[s]her, but I have no right to enter into a minute inve[s]tigation of your pa[s]t conduct." "But, my dear lady," [s]aid I, "it is ab[s]olutely nece[s][s]ary, you [s]hould be acquainted with many pa[s]t incidents of my life, that you may better concieve my pre[s]ent [s]ituation and be enabled to favour me with your advice, for my future conduct. "Well, my dear," [s]aid Mrs. Sidney, "whatever you think proper," "I thank heaven madam," [s]aid I, "tho' I [s]hall [s]hall acquaint you with many errors, [s]ome of which I tremble but to think on, (for at that moment, Celia, I remembered my impious de[s]pondency, and the divine interpo[s]ition of providence which delivered me at the very moment, when to avoid temporal mi[s]ery I was ru[s]hing into guilt.) Yet I have done nothing to make me a[s]hamed, and tho' my reputation has been [s]ullied. "We have all our errors, Mi[s]s Howard," [s]aid Amelia, "and we all hope to have tho[s]e errors forgiven, then [s]hould we not be always ready to forgive the errors of our fellow [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-289.jpg) \- external link  - Page 110. ] creatures. Come my dear girl let me per[s]uade you to drop the [s]ubject, whatever have been your errors I am [s]ure you now renounce them, and whatever are your misfortunes we will [s]trive to aleviate, if we cannot entirely remove them." "You are very good, Mi[s]s Sidney, but give me leave to proceed, I will not detain you long." I then in as few words as po[s][s]ible compri[s]ed the whole of my [s]ufferings, not even endeavouring to veil my errors, from the time of my father's imprisonment, till the pre[s]ent day; [s]he li[s]tened with attention, and taking my hand [s]aid, "Conviction [s]its on your countenance, I will not doubt your relation, my dear Meriel, becau[s]e it has been delivered with [s]uch ingenious frankne[s]s that to hear is to believe; but you have been [s]trangely mi[s]repre[s]ented, by tho[s]e who[s]e duty it was to defend rather than a[s]per[s]e your character." She then informed me that the Mo[s][s]ops had propogated the mo[s]t malignant cen[s]ures again[s]t me, and from at fir[s]t pointing me out as an object of ridicule to entertain their friends, at length repre[s]ented me as fit only for their contempt. In [s]hort, folly, ignorance, hypocrisy, and profligacy, had been [s]et forward, as the mo[s]t [s]triking traits in my character, and at the very moment when Amelia met me, [s]he [s]uppo[s]ed me [s]unk into infamy and [s]hame. "But," [s]aid [s]he, "I [s]aw you was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-290.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] unhappy, and I know it is our duty not to remember the faults, when an opportunity offers, wherein we may be of [s]ervice to a per[s]on in di[s]tre[s]s, I am now more than ever convinced of the propriety of [s]uch a mode of conduct, for had I not acted thus, I [s]hould never have known how much Mi[s]s Howard had been injured, and how little her unworthy friends de[s]erved [s]uch a relative, but I beg," continued [s]he, "you will con[s]ider your[s]elf at home. Believe me, you are as welcome as a [s]i[s]ter, and whenever you hear of a [s]ituation which you think will [s]uit you, my mother and I will give you every nece[s][s]ary recommendation, but do not be in a hurry to leave us, we [s]hall not [s]oon be tired of your company." She then [s]hewed me to a neat bed-chamber adjoining her own, and wi[s]hing me a good nights repo[s]se, left me. And who is this benevolent girl? methinks I hear you [s]ay. She is, my dear Celia, the daughter of a man, who by indu[s]try in a re[s]pectable line of bu[s]ine[s]s, brought up a numerous family in a reputable manner. He lived to [s]ee his [s]ons well [s]ettled in the world, and had [s]aved enough to leave at his death, Mrs. Sidney and this, his only daughter a comfortable independence. Amelia had a genteel, but yet u[s]eful education, [s]he was equally qualified to [s]hine in public or [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-291.jpg) \- external link  - Page 112. ] private life, [s]he preferred the latter. Her mother's happine[s]s con[s]tituted her own, [s]he read to her, worked with her, confidered her peace as the main [s]pring for all her actions, and loved her with a tender re[s]pect bordering on devotion. Yet with a plea[s]ing graceful peron, a lively di[s]po[s]ition, and a large [s]hare of good [s]en[s]e, has this amiable girl reached her twety-fifth year, without one offer of marriage, [s]he has had many lovers, but [s]he declares they all de[s]erted their colours, when they under[s]tood, [s]he would have no fortune till the death of her mother. "So you [s]ee, my dear," [s]aid [s]he, one day [s]miling "I am de[s]tined to wear the willow as long as I live." More [s]hame for the male world if [s]he is, Celia, for I think I could venture to pronounce him a happy man, who [s]hould be [s]o fortunate as to obtain [s]uch a wife. I have been in this kind family, now near a month, but have not as yet heard of any thing, that I think will [s]uit, tho' I am determined to take almo[s]t any [s]ituation rather than remain a burthen upon the benevolence of Amelia and her mother; who, tho' they have [s]ufficient for all the comforts and [s]ome of the elegancies of life, I am [s]ure, cannot a[s][s]ord to have me con[s]tantly with them. I [s]ent for the re[s]t of my cloaths the day after I left Ken[s]ington, but received no me[s][s]age [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-292.jpg) \- external link  - Page 113. ] from thence, nor have I heard a [s]yllable of Mr. Belger, I hope you will grant me the credit of not wi[s]hing it. I even gave the person who went for my things a [s]trict charge, not to mention in what part of the town I re[s]ided. March 3 d . A lady called this evening at Mrs. Sidney's, who [s]aid [s]he had heard of a place which [s]he thought would [s]uit me: it is to be companion to an elderly lady in the country, to read to her, walk with her help entertain her company and attend a little to the domestic concerns of the family. The [s]alary, I find, is but [s]mall, that [s]hall be no objection, I never was extravagant in dre[s]s, and I think I [s]hall hardly begin now. I am to go to-morrow morning at ten o'clock to [s]peak to a lady, who is a di[s]tant relation of Mrs. Rooksby, and who has been de[s]ired by her to look out for the kind of per[s]on [s]he wants. I wi[s]h I may be [s]o lucky as to [s]ucceed in this application, as I tru[s]t I could render my[s]elf agreeable to the old lady, and I would likewise exert my[s]elf to be u[s]eful. The mail goes to-morrow, before I [s]hall have time to write again, but my Celia, may depend on my [s]eizing the fir[s]t opportunity, to let her know my [s]ucce[s]s. Adieu, my beloved friend, tho' I can never love you le[s]s, you mu[s]t be [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-293.jpg) \- external link  - Page 114. ] henceforth content, to [s]hare with the generous truely benevolent Amelia the affections of your MERIEL. MERIEL to CELIA. -  London March 12 th , 1781. Celia , my beloved Celia, when is my heart to be at re[s]t, when [s]hall I [s]ay, "peace dwells in my bo[s]om, its anxieties are hu[s]hed, doubt, fear, and incertitude, are no more." Alas! I fear Meriel will never feel that heavenly [s]atisfaction, 'till [s]huddering on the verge of eternity, [s]he fixes her hope on the verge of eternity, [s]he [s]ixes her hope on things immortal, immutable and unchangeable. But forgive me my friend, when I took [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-294.jpg) \- external link  - Page 115. ] up my pen, I meant not to complain, indeed I did not, I am fully [s]en[s]ible if my ble[s][s]ings were mea[s]ured only according to my demerits, I [s]hould be poor indeed, but our heavenly father, portions out our comforts according to the mea[s]ure of his love. Alas! if our de[s]erts were only con[s]idered, who would dare abide the deci[s]ion; friend[s]hip is his choice[s]t be[s]t gift, and have I not found that pure and un-alloyed in the brea[s]ts of Celia and Amleia. As to love; It is an empty [s]ound, The haughty fair one's je[s]t On earth un[s]een or only found To warm the turtles ne[s]t. Oh yes there is love on earth; [s]incere, tender, affectionate, faithful, ardent hearts, but they were not formed for me, Celia; and I mu[s]t learn [s]ubmi[s][s]ion without repining, you wonder what all this means, I cannot tell you ju[s]t now; when I am more compo[s]ed I will re[s]ume my pen. How [s]trange does it appear that I [s]hould be an object of malice or envy to others, who never harboured a wi[s]h to the prejudice, or envied the good fortune of any one. The morning after I [s]ent off my la[s]t, my dear Celia, I dre[s][s]ed my[s]elf neat but very [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-295.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] plain, and at ten o'clock found my[s]elf at the door of Mr. Kingly, in Golden [s]quare, the [s]ervant, who opened it, told me his lady was not come down: he begged I would wait in a parlour, where there was a fire, and brought me a new[s]paper to amu[s]e me. In about twenty minutes, he returned and defired me to walk up [s]tairs. I followed him into a back drawing room, where an elegant woman [s]at preparing to make tea, and a nur[s]e was in the room with a very young child. The lady aro[s]e and received me with every mark of politene[s]s; but I was [s]carcely [s]eated before a voice [s]truck my ears, which vibrated to my throbbing heart, I felt my face glow, but had not a moment for thought, before the door opened, and Rainsforth entered the room holding a boy about twelve months old in his arms. Surpri[s]e threw me entirely off my guard, I gave a [s]udden [s]hriek and fainted. What pa[s][s]ed during my indi[s]po[s]ition I cannot tell, but when I recovered, I found the lady [s]itting be[s]ide me on the [s]opha, applying volatiles to my no[s]e and temples, while a maid [s]ervant [s]tood by with water, but neither Rainsforth or the children were in the room. "Are you [s]ubject to the[s]e ill turns, my dear mi[s]s?" [s]aid the lady. "No madam," [s]aid I, "but [s]udden [s]urpri[s]e will [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-296.jpg) \- external link  - Page 117. ] [s]ometimes [s]erve me thus." "Do you know Mr. Kingly? Was it his pre[s]ence that cau[s]ed [s]uch violent emotions?" "Only that you call him Kingly, madam, I [s]hould [s]ay the gentleman who came in ju[s]t now was a Mr. Rainsforth, of Plymouth." "Is your name Howard?" [s]aid the lady vi[s]ibly agitated. I an[s]wered in the affirmative. "Then," [s]aid [s]he, "I can account for the exclamation with which he left the room. You are right in your conjectures Mi[s]s Howard, Rainsforth and Kingly are one and the [s]ame person. He took my name on our union, of which I [s]uppo[s]e you were unacquainted. "I was indeed, a [s]tranger to it, madam, or I [s]hould not have pre[s]umed to have intruded here; pardon the involuntary confu[s]ion I have occa[s]ioned, and permit me to retire." "You are not as yet [s]ufficiently recovered," [s]aid [s]he, "to venture out. Pray, [s]top, and compo[s]e your[s]elf, and if it will not occa[s]ion a return of your di[s]order, we will [s]end for Mr. Kingly to take his breakfa[s]t." I was beginning to apologize for the di[s]agreeable interruption I had given, but [s]he [s]topped me. "I [s]hall not li[s]ten to a [s]yllable of excu[s]e. I am [s]ure it was unintentional, but I will not forgive it on any other terms than its never being mentioned in future." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-297.jpg) \- external link  - Page 118. ] Kingly, as I mu[s]t henceforth call him, was now [s]ummoned to breakfa[s]t, I endeavoured to command my countenance; but I fear to little effect; I attempted to ri[s]e, when he entered the room, but my limbs refused their office. He bowed and took his [s]eat in [s]ilence, a cup of tea was handed him: his hand trembled [s]o he could not rai[s]e it to his mouth. I did not dare lift my eyes, lea[s]t I [s]hould encounter his, I felt my face alternately red and pale; and it was with difficulty I could re[s]train my tears. We were all [s]ilent for near five minutes. Mrs. Kingly [s]eemed the lea[s]t embarra[s][s]ed of the three, and at length ventured to [s]ay, "my dear Kingly you forget your politene[s]s to day, pray help Mi[s]s Howard to [s]ome muffin." "I believe," [s]aid he, "it is by [s]ome other name we mu[s]t addre[s]s this lady now." Surpri[s]e at what he uttered tempted me to rai[s]e my eyes with a kind of inqui[s]itive look." "My name is [s]till Howard," [s]aid I, "nor have the lea[s]t intention of altering it." "Were you not on the point of being married about two years [s]ince?" I was more a[s]toni[s]hed than ever at this que[s]tion. I knew not what to an[s]wer: to have mentioned any thing of my intended union with Kingly before his wife, would perhaps have only [s]erved to make her unhappy. At length I an[s]wered, I was, it is true, near being [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-298.jpg) \- external link  - Page 119. ] married about that time, but I had every rea[s]on to [s]uppo[s]e you, as well as the re[s]t of my acquaintance, knew the cau[s]e of the match being broke off. I have never had a thought [s]ince of altering my condition. "It is very [s]trange," [s]aid he, and the conver[s]ation dropped. I then began to recollect the rea[s]on which had brought me to the hou[s]e of a man whom I wi[s]hed, of all others, mo[s]t to avoid, and turning to Mrs. Kingly made the nece[s][s]ary enquiries concerning the place I wanted to engage for. Having received answers greatly to my [s]atisfaction, I aro[s]e to take my leave, referring her to Mrs. Sidney for my character. "I dare [s]ay there will be no nece[s][s]ity to make tho[s]e enquiries," [s]aid [s]he, "but if you will mention any day when you will favour me with your company to dinner, I will introduce you to my aunt, who is fortunately now in town." I told her if [s]he would favour me [s]o far, as to give me a line to Mrs. Rook[s]by, I would wait on that lady at any time [s]he would plea[s]e to appoint, but mu[s]t beg leave to decline the propo[s]ed honour of dining with her, as I feared it would not be po[s][s]ible to di[s]engage my[s]elf from the kind friends with whom I at pre[s]ent re[s]ided, till an ab[s]olute [s]ettlement obliged me to leave them. Indeed, my dear Celia, I felt there would be a great [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-299.jpg) \- external link  - Page 120. ] impropriety in endeavouring to cultivate an intimacy with Mrs. Kingly, for [s]hould [s]he not have been acquainted with the connection that formerly [s]ub[s]i[s]ted between her hu[s]band and my[s]elf, and [s]hould by any means hereafter hear of it, [s]he might naturally [s]uppo[s]e I cultivated her acquaintance, that I might the more ea[s]ily enjoy her hu[s]band's [s]ociety; and if, as I [s]u[s]pect, [s]he already knows how near we were being united by the tendere[s]t ties, [s]he would certainly approve a conduct, which would [s]hew how much her happine[s]s was preferred to my own gratification. I will con[s]e[s]s I wi[s]hed for nothing more than a conver[s]ation with Kingly, for I plainly perceived [s]ome my[s]tery couched beneath the few [s]entences that pa[s][s]ed, while we were at breakfa[s]t: But this wi[s]h I was [s]en[s]ible would be both improper and imprudent to [s]eek to gratify. Mrs. Kingly having therefore named a day, when [s]he thought it would be convenient for her aunt to [s]ee me, and mentioned an hour when [s]he would call and take me to her, I took my leave. I [s]lightly regarded Kingly's countenance, as I wi[s]hed him good morning, and di[s]covered in it [s]trong traits of wonder and impatience. When I teturned to Mrs. Sidney's, Amelia di[s]covered by my looks the agitation of my mind. I thought it would be wrong to have [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-300.jpg) \- external link  - Page 121. ] any concealments from [s]uch worthy friends, I therefore briefly related all that concerned Rainsforth, and my unfortunate rencounter with him that morning. "Upon my word, Meriel," [s]aid [s]he, "every word you utter excites fre[s]h wonder. I remember hearing of the affair you mention, but it was always [s]poken of in [s]uch a ludicrous [s]train, that I have my[s]elf frequently joined in the laugh again[s]t you, con[s]idering you as a poor, fond girl, who fancied every man who but [s]poke a civil word was in love with you, and returned this imaginary pa[s][s]ion with all the enthusiastic ardor of romantic affection." I made Mi[s]s Sidney no an[s]wer, but going to my trunk, returned with all the letters which had pa[s][s]ed between Rainsforth and my[s]elf. "This proof of your fortitude and magnanimity," [s]aid [s]he, when [s]he had peru[s]ed them, "was only wanting to complete my e[s]teem for your character; for, it is from the[s]e letters only, that I have learnt in what manner you di[s]po[s]ed of your fortune. Generous, noble [s]pirited girl, it is only for [s]uch hearts as yours to be tried in the ordeal of affliction; but [s]urely heaven has [s]ome future reward in [s]tore, that will amply compen[s]ate the [s]ufferings you are ordained to endure." "Oh! my dear Amelia," [s]aid I, "have I not already an ample compen[s]ation in your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-301.jpg) \- external link  - Page 122. ] friend[s]hip and affection. Prai[s]es from your lips are balm to my wounded heart: may I never forfeit your e[s]teem." "That I am [s]ure you never will. I only blu[s]h to think how long I remained a [s]tranger to your merits; but the real diamond is always enveloped in a cru[s]t, thro' which it is only on near in[s]pection, we can di[s]cover its intrin[s]ic value." "Ah! flatterer," [s]aid I, [s]miling, while the tear of grateful affection [s]tole from my eye. Oh! Celia, when I forget the friend[s]hip of Amelia Sidney, the benefits received from her hands, the mi[s]ery from which [s]he [s]natched me, may I be forgot by that Providence to whom we can only look for [s]upport. Ble[s]s her, all-bounteous heaven; make her felicity as boundle[s]s as the benevolence of her heart; let her comforts be many, and her afflictions few: and when this tran[s]itory [s]cene is pa[s]t, [s]oft and gentle be her pa[s][s]age to the grave. May [s]he "Peaceful [s]leep out the [s]abbath of the tomb, "And wake to raptures in a life to come." Pope . And may you, my dear Celia, [s]hare the [s]ame envied fate. For me, I was born to bu[s]tle on a [s]ea of trouble; and [s]o as the busfetting waves do not deprive me of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-302.jpg) \- external link  - Page 123. ] [s]upport held out by the heavenly cherub Hope, I have [s]till a comfort remaining, that will bear me up under all my troubles, and lead me to a harbour of eternal re[s]t. Adieu, my friend, I will continue my narrative in a few days. MERIEL. MERIEL to CELIA. -  London March 14 th , 1781. Knowing , my dear Celia's impatience to be informed of what followed my interview in Golden-Square, I [s]hall proceed without any preface. After the conver[s]ation I mentioned in my la[s]t, it [s]truck Amelia that Kingly would [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-303.jpg) \- external link  - Page 124. ] undoubtedly endeavour to [s]ee me, as his mind mu[s]t be in the [s]ame [s]tate of painful uncertainty in regard to my conduct, as I was, when I reflected on his. I told her I would by no means wi[s]h to [s]ee him, and reque[s]ted the [s]ervant might be permitted to deny me in ca[s]e any gentleman [s]hould call. Our mea[s]ures were but ju[s]t [s]ettled when a knock at the door announced a vi[s]itor, and by listning at the top of the [s]tair-ca[s]e, I plainly heard Kingly's voice. He [s]eemed much disappointed at not finding me at home, and left word he would call at twelve o'clock the next day: accordingly I wrote the following note to be delivered when he came. TO MR. KINGLY. MISS HOWARD's compliments to Mr. Kingly; reque[s]ts as a particular favour, he will not give him[s]elf the trouble to call any more, as Mr. Kingly cannot be ignorant, that there are many forcible rea[s]ons exi[s]ting, which renders it totally improper for Mi[s]s H. to recieve his vi[s]its. She de[s]ires no explanation of pa[s]t incidents; [s]incerely wi[s]hes Mr. K. every felicity; but is certain any intercour[s]e between them, will not tend to promote it. It is that rea[s]on only, which urges Mi[s]s H. to avoid an intimacy with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-304.jpg) \- external link  - Page 125. ] the very amiable Mrs. Kingly, who[s]e happiness, [s]he devoutly prays may be permanent, and of long duration. When he came, this note was delivered to him by the [s]ervant. He a[s]ked for pen and ink, and left the following. - I AM convinced I have been decieved; an explanation is ab[s]olutely nece[s][s]ary to my repo[s]e. I find you are the [s]ame charming, delicate girl, I once adored; nay, which even at this moment I find dearer to my heart, than aught the world contains be[s]ide. Then, think not, I will [s]it tamely down, while you [s]uppo[s]e me an unfeeling, capricious mon[s]ter. There is one way, by which I can clear my[s]elf; there is one, who can plead my cau[s]e, and you not refu[s]e to li[s]ten. I re[s]pect that [s]en[s]e of propriety, which urges you to refu[s]e a per[s]onal interview; but I mu[s]t be re[s]tored to your e[s]teem, or be wretched for ever. Your friend, F. KINGLY. The next morning Mrs. Kingly called as [s]he had appointed, and took me with her in the chariot to Mrs. Rook[s]by. This old [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-305.jpg) \- external link  - Page 126. ] lady is extremely plea[s]ing in her manner. Her per[s]on, tho' advanced in years, retains many traces of grace and elegance. She expre[s][s]ed her approbation of me, in the politest terms, and [s]aid, [s]he [s]hould con[s]ider her[s]elf extremely fortunate in the acqui[s]ition of [s]uch a companion. Her terms were much more liberal than I had been led to expect; and as we were [s]oon agreed, [s]he reque[s]ted me to appoint an early day for my removal to her hou[s]e. "Bu[s]ine[s]s of a very particular nature," [s]aid [s]he, "required my pre[s]ence in London, which I have not visited before for upwards of twenty years, nor [s]hall I now remain in it long; but while I do [s]tay, I [s]hall wi[s]h to enter into a few of its amu[s]ements, and I am certain I [s]hall receive double [s]atisfaction from them all, when I am favoured with your company." It was then determined, that day week [s]hould be the time of my removal, and we took our leave. When I was again in the carriage with Mrs. Kingly, [s]he [s]aid, "it gives me great plea[s]ure to find my aunt is likely to make [s]o agreeable an addition to her family; nor have I the lea[s]t doubt, but you will be [s]atisfied with your [s]ituation, as [s]he is a woman of an ea[s]y, chearful di[s]po[s]ition. And now my dear Mi[s]s Howard, as we have settled this important bu[s]ine[s]s, you mu[s]t give me leave to execute a commi[s][s]ion, I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-306.jpg) \- external link  - Page 127. ] yesterday undertook. I have a letter for you," continued [s]he, [s]miling. "You may perhaps gue[s]s from whom. Come, no drawing back, I can a[s][s]ure you there will not be the lea[s]t impropriety in your recieving it, and I flatter my[s]elf I have intere[s]t [s]ufficient to obtain an an[s]wer." She then put the letter into my hand. You may judge my confusion. It was impo[s][s]ible to [s]peak, for I was utterly at a lo[s]s what to [s]ay. I believe, I never looked more like a fool. Mrs. Kingly [s]aw my embarra[s][s]ment, and kindly, did not [s]eem to expect me to [s]peak, but began a conver[s]ation on things quite foreign to the [s]ubject. When we arrived at Mrs. Sidney's door, [s]he refu[s]ed to alight; but wi[s]hing me a good day, [s]aid, [s]he [s]hould expect to hear from me [s]oon. I ran up [s]tairs to Amelia, and putting the letter into her hand, cried, open it, read it for me, for indeed I have not re[s]olution to read it my[s]elf. Enclo[s]ed my dear Celia, is a copy of the letter; al[s]o of one from Mrs. Kingly, in which it was enclo[s]ed; when you have peru[s]ed them, I am [s]ure you will lament with your poor friend, that [s]uch merit as Rainsforth's, (for [s]till I love that name,) [s]hould be [s]evered from her, by the malice of tho[s]e, who could really reap no advantage from her di[s]appointment.

I think when you have read, you will admire Mrs. Kingly as much as you pity your MERIEL. MRS. KINGLY to MISS HOWARD. March 9 th , 1781. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-308.jpg) \- external link  - Page 129. ] I feel , my dear Mi[s]s Howard, that I am under an indi[s]pen[s]ible nece[s][s]ity of writing to you, to reque[s]t you will attend to the explanation [s]o ardently de[s]ired by Mr. Kingly; and from which your rigid [s]en[s]e of propriety, urges you to recede: but in what manner [s]hall I addre[s]s you, dear, amiable young lady, when I am [s]en[s]ible I have, tho' unknowingly, [s]tepped between you and happiness. Often have I heard your name, oft li[s]tened to your commendations, from lips which never [s]poke, but they conveyed pleasure to my heart. My father's family lived in terms of the greate[s]t intimacy with that of Mr. Rainsforth's; Frederic and my[s]elf were nearly of the [s]ame age, were frequently together, we [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-309.jpg) \- external link  - Page 130. ] learnt to dance at the [s]ame [s]chool, and at our annual ball I was always [s]elected for his partner. Our infantine attachment was noticed by both our parents, and Frederic was often [s]milingly called my little hu[s]band. As we increa[s]ed in years, this attachment grew weaker on the part of Frederic, but in my bo[s]om it gathered new [s]trength; the many good qualities [s]o con[s]picuous in the boy, became dignified virtues in the bo[s]om of the man. I always wept when duty called him from his native place, and rejoiced unfeignedly at his return. When my uncle made me his heire[s]s, my parents began to [s]hew [s]ome di[s]approbation of my vi[s]ible partiality; and when I repeatedly refu[s]ed the mo[s]t [s]plendid offers, treated my pa[s][s]ion with a rigour, which [s]erved only to make its impression on my heart more indeliable. Ju[s]t before old Mr. Rainsforth met with the misfortune, which was, I under[s]tand, the fir[s]t cau[s]e of your [s]eparation from his [s]on. I lo[s]t both my parents within a very [s]hort period of each other, and became my own mistress: I know not how to proceed, I am at a lo[s]s for words, in which I can acknowledge a weakne[s]s, which I fear you will condemn; but anxious to re[s]tore peace to the bo[s]om of Rainsforth and pro[s]perity to his family; and perfectly unacquainted with his engagements to the amiable Mi[s]s Howard, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-310.jpg) \- external link  - Page 131. ] I [s]o far over[s]tepped the bounds pre[s]cribed our [s]ex, as to write to him making a tender of my[s]elf and fortune: in[s]tead of writing an an[s]wer to this letter, he came him[s]elf, thanked me in the tendere[s]t manner for what he termed my generous de[s]igns in his favour; but declared his heart was under a prior engagement. He then expiated largely on the virtues of Mi[s]s Howard, and declared, tho' for the pre[s]ent, fortune had placed insuperable barriers to ob[s]truct your union, he [s]hould ever hold him[s]elf as bound to you, and while you remained [s]ingle, con[s]ider him[s]elf not at liberty to marry any other woman. He reque[s]ted that tho' unable to accept the offered honour of my hand, he might not be deprived of my friend[s]hip, and declared he [s]hould always think on me with gratitude and affection. From this time I [s]edulou[s]ly endeavoured to conquer a pa[s][s]ion, which I found preyed upon my peace of mind, and when I heard of the fortune left his family flattered myself I had [s]ucceded: I [s]incerely rejoiced in the pro[s]pect of his felicity in an union with you, which he told me would now [s]oon be compleated: but one morning he came to me in vi[s]ible agitation, and taking my hand, cried, "dear Margaret, I am di[s]appointed in my tendere[s]t hopes, Meriel Howard is [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-311.jpg) \- external link  - Page 132. ] married." I tried to per[s]uade him he had been mi[s]informed; but he [s]aid there was no room for doubt, as it had been confirmed by your own hand. He now vi[s]ited me every day, and I will confe[s]s to you, I exerted my[s]elf to divert his melancholy; I in [s]ome mea[s]ure [s]ucceeded; and one day as we were chatting together on indifferent [s]ubjects, he suddenly caught my hand and cried, "if my lovely friend would accept the offer of a heart that was once devoted to another, happine[s]s might yet be my portion; but I dare not indulge [s]o [s]weet a hope." I will not repeat to you, Mi[s]s Howard, the many conversations we had on this [s]ubject; [s]uffice it to [s]ay we were [s]oon united. From that happy moment, his tenderne[s]s, his a[s][s]iduity, has every day increa[s]ed: I [s]aw his heart [s]till beat true to its fir[s]t attachment; but I al[s]o [s]aw his [s]truggles to [s]uppre[s]s its emotions. He never indulged him[s]elf in talking of you, carefully avoiding every place where he might chance to hear your name mentioned. The violent agitation, which you was thrown into by his entering the room the other morning, and an exclamation which broke from him, as he caught you, when you were falling to the ground, made me readily conceive who it was I had the honour to entertain. I felt for you both, more than I can expre[s]s: I had long been acquainted with your virtues, though a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-312.jpg) \- external link  - Page 133. ] [s]tranger to your per[s]on, and I wi[s]hed earnestly for power to aleviate [s]ufferings, of which I con[s]idered my[s]elf the cau[s]e. I ea[s]ily under[s]tood your generous motive for declining vi[s]iting at my hou[s]e. I e[s]teem, I venerate you for it, tho' I am certain no ill con[s]equence could en[s]ue from an intimacy between two hearts [s]o cha[s]te, [s]o much under the guidance of religion and honour, as your's and Mr. Kingly's. The day after I fir[s]t had the plea[s]ure of [s]eeing you, I perceived Mr. Kingly to be melancholy and absent. I pre[s][s]ed to know the cau[s]e. He was at fir[s]t embarra[s][s]ed; at length he candidly told me he wi[s]hed much for a conver[s]ation with you, to clear up [s]ome my[s]teries which at pre[s]ent tormented him beyond mea[s]ure; that he had called on you twice, but you absolutely refu[s]ed to [s]ee him. He then shewed me your note, and a[s]ked, if he were to write a few lines, whether I would prevail with you to read them, and grant him an answer. I readily promi[s]ed him to comply with this reque[s]t, and I hope, my dear Mi[s]s Howard, you will by an an[s]wer, re[s]tore peace to his bo[s]om; for I am well convinced, he will never be happy while he imagines you [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-313.jpg) \- external link  - Page 134. ] think him unworthy your regard. I am, dear young lady, with every [s]entiment of esteem, and every kind wi[s]h for your happiness, Your friend in [s]incerity, M. KINGLY. MR. KINGLY to MISS HOWARD. March 9 th , 1781. That you are [s]till unmarried, my dear Meriel, is to me the cau[s]e of great astonishment; that you are depre[s][s]ed in your circum[s]tances, and obliged to [s]eek by servitude the nece[s][s]ary means to [s]upport life, gives the accute[s]t pangs to a heart, that ever wi[s]hed and would have rejoiced in your hap [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-314.jpg) \- external link  - Page 135. ] pine[s]s. I fear we have both been deceived; but why that deceit has been practi[s]ed again[s]t us, I am at a lo[s]s to think. I know you never were a favourite with the Mo[s][s]op's. They envied virtues they had not [s]pirit to imitate; but why they [s]hould thus labour to render two unoffending beings [s]o completely mi[s]erable, is altogether unaccountable. I have, my dear friend, (the blu[s]h of [s]hame crim[s]ons my cheek while I write it) but I have doubted your virtues. I have thought you fal[s]e, capricious, light and undeserving: and much I fear, you have been taught to think me the vile[s]t of my [s]ex. But let me ha[s]ten to exculpate my[s]elf from [s]o black a charge. Let me trace back to the time that even at this moment my [s]oul shudders to think upon. Let me lead your ideas back to the letter [1] I wrote informing you of the happy change in my father's fortune. I was ha[s]tily preparing to come to London, from which place unavoidable bu[s]ine[s]s had detained me much longer than my impatience could well brook; when one morning I met young Mo[s][s]op, who at that time belonged to a [s]hip lying at Plymouth. After the u[s]ual [s]alutations, he a[s]ked me if I had that morning any letters from London. I replied, I had been from home all the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-315.jpg) \- external link  - Page 136. ] morning. You will, no doubt, on your return, find letters, [s]aid he; for I have ju[s]t heard from He[s]ter, who mentions having [s]een her cou[s]in, and that [s]he was employed in writing to you. My heart [s]unk, my dear Meriel, at this intelligence; for, as in my letter I had mentioned the time I [s]hould leave Plymouth, I did not expect an an[s]wer, and naturally thought, it mu[s]t have been something particular had occa[s]ioned your writing. I left Mo[s][s]op and in[s]tantly returned home; where I found a letter, the contents of which had nearly fired my brain. It is indeliably imprinted on my memory; it can never be forgotten. The[s]e were the words: SIR, THE receipt of your la[s]t favour, occasioned a mixture of both pain and plea[s]ure in my bo[s]om. I was extremely happy to hear of your increa[s]e of fortune; but pained to find you [s]till retained your partiality for me. Ab[s]ence, my good [s]ir, and a variety of incidents, has entirely obliterated from my heart, every trace, of what I once called love. But I find I was deceived, in supposing my[s]elf actuated by that pa[s][s]ion. I [s]hall ever remember Mr. Rainsforth with the mo[s]t grateful e[s]teem; but my heart, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-316.jpg) \- external link  - Page 137. ] all its tendere[s]t affections, are devoted to another object; to whom, to-morrow morning I mean to plight my faith, in the mo[s]t [s]olemn manner. I imagined a knowledge of this event, would prevent your intended journey to the metropolis. I [s]hould be greatly obliged, if you would [s]eal up all my letters and give them to my cou[s]in Mo[s][s]op, who will [s]end them to town in a parcel to his [s]i[s]ter. At the [s]ame time, plea[s]e to inform me whether you would wi[s]h yours to be returned, or whether I have your permission to con[s]ign them to eternal oblivion. I [s]incerely wi[s]h you may meet with a woman, more calculated to make you happy, than was the woman, who now, for the la[s]t time, [s]igns her[s]elf, MERIEL HOWARD. I cannot give you the lea[s]t idea of the poignancy o my feelings, or the madne[s]s of my actions, at this cruel, in[s]ulting letter. I was ab[s]olutely frantic: my father endeavoured to [s]ooth me. He had always expre[s][s]ed a di[s]like at my propo[s]ed union with you, tho' for what rea[s]on I never could learn. He told me I ought to rejoice at having discovered your light, changeable di[s]po[s]ition, before it was in your power to injure my honour. I li[s]tned to him with reverence; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-317.jpg) \- external link  - Page 138. ] I knew he never yet had expre[s][s]ed a wi[s]h, which did not ultimately tend to my good: I endeavour to calm my tran[s]ports, and [s]trove to per[s]uade my[s]elf I [s]hould [s]oon hate you. I wrote you a long letter, wherein I gave vent to the angui[s]h of my heart. I then [s]ealed up all the dear pledges of your affection, and which till that moment had been pre[s]erved as the choice[s]t trea[s]ures I po[s][s]e[s][s]ed, and went to [s]eek Mo[s][s]op. "You did not tell me," [s]aid I, "your cou[s]in Meriel was married." "Dear Rainsforth," [s]aid he, "I had not courage to inform you of her perfidy, as I knew you loved the unworthy girl." "She has desired," [s]aid I, "to have her letters returned; here they are: you are to [s]end them to your [s]i[s]ter. Oh! Mo[s][s]op, I could not have believed Meriel Howard"---"I am [s]orry," [s]aid he, interrupting me, "I had not before warned you of her di[s]po[s]ition. She always was of a fickle temper, I could have told you of many in[s]tances of her levity of heart, which [s]he [s]o effectually hides under an affectation of [s]entiment and re[s]erve; but you were [s]o bigoted to her, you would not have believed my a[s][s]ertions." He then told me, you were once attached to a married man, one Pringle, whom he was intimate with in London; that you eloped from your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-318.jpg) \- external link  - Page 139. ] father's hou[s]e, and it was to be feared you had rea[s]on to repent your ra[s]hne[s]s. "Consummate hypocrite," [s]aid I. "But from this moment I era[s]e her from my heart; I will never [s]uffer my[s]elf to mention her name; I will be happy, [s]pite of her cruel arts to undermine my peace." From that time I carefully avoided, even the [s]ociety of Mo[s][s]op, lea[s]t I [s]hould hear your name, and be tempted to break my re[s]olves; and in a very [s]hort time I yeilded to the entreaties of my friends, and gave my hand to the lovely, amiable woman, whom you have [s]een, and whom I am [s]ure you love; for her [s]oul is congenial with your own. Meriel, I will not pretend to [s]ay I had forgot you; but the engaging qualities of my wife, the innocent beauties of my children had in a great mea[s]ure, filled that void in my heart, which the lo[s]s of you had occa[s]ioned. Indeed, I had began to fancy my[s]elf happy, when your pre[s]ence and sudden illne[s]s, the other morning, awakened my long [s]tifled tenderne[s]s, convinced me I had been deceived, and that we both were de[s]tined to be mi[s]erable. My wife, the be[s]t, the kinde[s]t of her [s]ex, [s]ee's my [s]ufferings, and generou[s]ly pitties them. Ah! my dear friend, how are [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-319.jpg) \- external link  - Page 140. ] thosesufferings augmented, when I reflect that the angui[s]h which oppre[s][s]es me, is conveyed to her gentle bo[s]om, and [s]he pines in [s]ecret at the want of that ardent affection, which would con[s]titute the whole happine[s]s of her life. She has promi[s]ed me, to deliver this to your hands; matchle[s]s tenderne[s]s! let her [s]oft pleadings prevail my dear Mi[s]s Howard; write to me, if it is but one line, to [s]ay you do not quite de[s]pi[s]e me. Tell me al[s]o, whether you wrote that cruel letter; and if you did, what were your rea[s]ons for it. But, ah! it is impo[s][s]ible, you are the [s]ame charming, amiable woman, I once adored beyond life, and who[s]e image only the pang that di[s]olves every tie of nature, can era[s]e from my heart. Oh! Margret, thou much e[s]teemed woman, pardon the[s]e involuutary wanderings of my pen, I would die rather than injure you: this once forgive my wayward heart, and henceforth my every hour of life [s]hall be devoted to thee. Meriel, dear lo[s]t Meriel, if you wi[s]h to [s]ave me from di[s]traction, write one line of comfort to the wretched F. KINGLY. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-320.jpg) \- external link  - Page 141. ] CAN you concieve, my dear Celia, the poignancy of my feelings when I had read this horrid detail of the impo[s]ition that had been practi[s]ed, thus to ruin the peace of Kingly and my[s]elf. He[s]ter Mo[s][s]op was the per[s]on, my [s]u[s]picions re[s]ted on, yet why [s]he [s]hould endeavour to undermine my happiness, when it would by no means conduce either to her intere[s]t or felicity remains [s]till an inexplicable riddle. I cannot tell you how often I read the dear letter which undecieved me, in regard to Kingly's conduct; how often I pre[s][s]ed it to my heart, and bathed it in my tears: amiable youth, charming engaging woman, cried I, as I alternately read the letters of Frederic and his Margaret; may your happine[s]s be as complete as you are de[s]erving: never will Meriel abu[s]e the confidence you have placed in her. My re[s]olution in what manner to conduct my[s]elf was [s]oon formed. I determined to an[s]wer Kingly's letter, and to commit it un[s]ealed to the care of his amiable wife; I laid my projected plan before the friendly Amelia, and finding it met her approbation, immediately [s]at down to put it in execution; the following is a copy of my letter to Kingly. SIR, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-321.jpg) \- external link  - Page 142. ] HAD not the letter I have ju[s]t peru[s]ed been written in your hand, and delivered to me by Mrs. Kingly, I [s]hould be tempted to think [s]ome whining [s]chool boy had tried the extent of his genius in its compo[s]ition. In the name of common [s]en[s]e, my good friend, to what do the[s]e piteous complaints tend, or from whence do they proceed? are you not the hu[s]band of a woman, every way calculated to make the connubial [s]tate a [s]tate of bli[s]s? have you not two lovely children, the pledges of her tendere[s]t affections; and has not Providence bountifully [s]howered its favours on you? have you not health, ea[s]e and plenty? and yet [s]imple mortal, that you are, do you complain and [s]igh, becau[s]e you were not permitted to unite your fate with one, who, if you knew her half [s]o well as I do, you would find entirely de[s]titute of many of tho[s]e amiable qualities which [s]o eminently di[s]tingui[s]h Mrs. Kingly. For [s]hame Kingly, for [s]hame, you almo[s]t tempt me to laugh; your pre[s]ent conduct is like that of a [s]poilt child, who having in his po[s][s]e[s][s]ion every valuable elegant toy his indulgent parents can procure him, by chance di[s]covers [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-322.jpg) \- external link  - Page 143. ] an in[s]ignificant trifle, which at [s]ome pa[s]t period had amu[s]ed his fancy; but being now out of his reach, he raves, blubbers and roars, throws from him with wild impetuo[s]ity, tho[s]e already in his po[s][s]e[s][s]ion, and with the right, wayward [s]pirit of contradiction refuses to be pacified. You are mi[s]taken in [s]uppo[s]ing young Mo[s][s]op decieved you in regard to my character; nature formed me thoughtle[s]s, volatile and capricious: It is true, while you remained with me, I restrained my natural levity; but no [s]ooner were you ab[s]ent than I relap[s]ed into my former folly, and innumerable are the giddy inconsistent actions I have committed; among which, no doubt you will reckon my writing [s]uch an unaccountable letter, merely to try the [s]trength of your pa[s][s]ion; to be [s]ure, I did not think you would have re[s]ented it [s]o highly; but when I found that my folly was the means of promoting your intere[s]t, I heartily rejoiced in your felicity, nor once wi[s]hed to recall the tran[s]action. You are in another error in [s]uppo[s]ing me unhappy. I am one of tho[s]e thoughtle[s]s, incon[s]iderate beings, who [s]eldom lay any thing long to heart. My fortune is gone, it is true; but, it was di[s]po[s]ed of in [s]uch a way, as I can never repent. My health and [s]pirits are [s]till unimpaired; then con[s]ider, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-323.jpg) \- external link  - Page 144. ] my good friend, how little I have to regret, how much to be thankful for. It has [s]truck me, [s]ince our interview in Golden-Square, that you might, perhaps, imagine my illne[s]s was occa[s]ioned by your [s]udden appearance. Do not encourage that idea; it is a fal[s]e one. I am [s]ometimes [s]ubject to tho[s]e kind of fits; and they generally [s]eize me without a moment's warning. I flatter my[s]elf you will now be [s]atisfied. Be a[s][s]ured, there is nothing can give me greater plea[s]ure, than to [s]ee you and the lovely woman to whom your fate is united, enjoy uninterrupted felicity; for volatile and giddy as I am, I have yet a heart that exults in the pro[s]perity of every [s]urrounding object. Believe me, Kingly, true felicity is placed within your reach, take the proffered ble[s][s]ing, and enjoy it with gratitude, nor let your own di[s]contented fancies da[s]h with gall the cup which Providence pre[s]ents, overflowing with joy and peace. From the tenor of your letter, I [s]hould think you a hero of romance, lamenting in pathetic [s]trains the di[s]appointment of his fir[s]t love. Pr'ythee, my good friend, [s]hake off the boy, a[s][s]ume the man of [s]en[s]e, and learn to e[s]timate true happine[s]s, not by the incon[s]i[s]tent wi[s]hes of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-324.jpg) \- external link  - Page 145. ] your wayward heart, but by its own intrin[s]ic value. Adieu, and believe me your [s]incere well wi[s]her. MERIEL HOWARD. I will not pretend to tell you, what pain it co[s]t me, my dear Celia, to write a letter [s]o foreign to my feelings: to be obliged, as it were, to accu[s]e my[s]elf of folly and inconsistency; that would render me contemptible in the eyes of the only man, to whom I wished to appear amiable. But there was no other way to re[s]tore his peace, there was no other way to pre[s]erve the happine[s]s of a woman, who not only loved him with the mo[s]t enthu[s]ia[s]tic pa[s][s]ion, but had placed an unbounded confidence in me, and [s]hewn a friend[s]hip for me, which I [s]hould have cea[s]ed to de[s]erve, could I once have been [s]o mean as to envy her the po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of the man, who con[s]tituted the whole of her earthly felicity. But tho' I wi[s]hed Kingly to remain in his error, I could not bear to be thought meanly of by this dear woman; I therefore took an opportunity, when I thought it mo[s]t likely he would not be at home, and waited on Mrs. Kingly. I gave her the letter, but at the [s]ame time told her, tho' I wi[s]hed her hu[s]band to think my a[s][s]ertions true, I hoped [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-325.jpg) \- external link  - Page 146. ] [s]he would kindly believe I was not indeed the very incon[s]i[s]tent character I had represented my[s]elf, I then pre[s]ented to her a paper, briefly containing every circum[s]tance which had pa[s][s]ed between Kingly and myself, and enclo[s]ing the letter I had received, as I imagined, from his father. She read them with attention, and then declared it was not old Mr. Rainsforth's writing; [s]aid [s]he knew his hand perfectly well, and al[s]o, that he was a man incapable of writing [s]o inhuman a letter. "That there has been a [s]trange deception practi[s]ed, is very evident, my dear madam," [s]aid I, "but I make no doubt you will join me in thinking, it will be much better to conceal it from Mr. Kingly, as he would undoubtedly think as an officer and as a man of honour, he was under a necessity of re[s]enting the ungenerous conduct of Mr. Mo[s][s]op." "Dear, con[s]iderate girl," [s]aid [s]he, taking my hand, "how do you contrive to ri[s]e every moment higher in my esteem. It appears a degree of cruelty to suffer Mr. Kingly to retain [s]uch an erroneous opinion of your conduct." "But I mu[s]t in[s]i[s]t, my dear madam," [s]aid I, "on your keeping my [s]ecret. Remember it was on the promi[s]e of inviolable [s]ilence alone that I entrusted you." "But," cried [s]he, tenderly, "I fear you are unhappy." "Indeed, I am not," I replied. "Since tho[s]e occurrences I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-326.jpg) \- external link  - Page 147. ] have ju[s]t related to you, I have had [s]o many trials, [s]o many heavy afflictions, that I had [s]eldom thought on Mr. Rainsforth within the[s]e la[s]t two years, except it was to rejoice, that by not being united to me, he had escaped a large [s]hare of [s]orrow, as he would unavoidably have taken a part in all my afflictions." "Ah! deceiver," [s]aid [s]he, smiling, "you cannot per[s]uade me, that the heart once tenderly attached to [s]uch a man as Kingly, can [s]o ea[s]ily regain its tranquility. "But you do not reflect, my dear madam, that I thought him a fal[s]e hearted [s]wain, and [s]trove with a laudable pride to banish him from my remembrance." "True," [s]he replied, "but you are now undeceived." "Well, but believe me, it was too late to awaken the long [s]tifled pa[s][s]ion. My heart is ju[s]t in the [s]ituation it was before I [s]aw him. Nay, I really think it is ea[s]ier; for I am now convinced that he is not altogether unworthy the happine[s]s that awaits him." I then purpo[s]ely changed the conver[s]ation, enquired when [s]he had [s]een her aunt, and how long that lady thought of remaining in town. "I long to go into the country," [s]aid I, "for there never was a woman [s]o passionately fond of [s]till life as I am; I doat on a gloomy grotto; and a moonlight night, with a nightingale under my window, and a [s]treamlet ju[s]t near enough for its murmurs [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-327.jpg) \- external link  - Page 148. ] to be agreeable, fills me with delight." "You are of a melancholy turn then," [s]aid [s]he. "By no means," I replied, "I am the chearfule[s]t creature breathing when free from noi[s]e and bu[s]tle; but if you wi[s]h to [s]ee me completely [s]tupid, u[s]her me into a crowded drawing-room, my faculties immediately take their flight, and I appear what I am in reality, a mere cypher to fill up the number of the company." "I wi[s]h," [s]aid [s]he, "our hou[s]e in Devonshire was near my aunt's, I [s]hould, I am very certain, pa[s]s many a happy hour in your [s]ociety." "You are at a great di[s]tance from her then?" "So far, that we [s]eldom meet above once in a year." This information plea[s]ed me, you may be [s]ure, my dear Celia, for I wi[s]h not to be often in company with Kingly. However, I did not expre[s]s my satisfaction, and Mrs. Kingly continued. "Even when I do vi[s]it Mrs. Rook[s]by, I take an opportunity when Mr. Kingly is from home: for he has [s]uch an invincible aver[s]ion to her [s]on, that he will never, if he can po[s][s]ibly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-328.jpg) \- external link  - Page 149. ] avoid it, [s]pend an hour in his company." "Does Mr. Rook[s]by live with his mother?" [s]aid I. "Not in general, but in the [s]ummer [s]ea[s]on he frequently makes her a vi[s]it of [s]ome months continuance, e[s]pecially if his finances run [s]hort. Clement," continued [s]he, "is not a bad hearted lad, but he is thoughtle[s]s and extravagant; and what offends Mr. Kingly [s]o highly is, he has an intrigue with a woman [s]uppo[s]ed to be married. Her influence over him is a[s]toni[s]hing, and her extravagance knows no bounds; the connection, I believe, has been of long duration; but he has not publicly avowed it till within the[s]e two months. Bu[s]ine[s]s for his mother took him to the continent, and when he returned [s]he accompanied him." "It is a great pity," [s]aid I. But at that moment hearing Kingly's voice in the hall, I aro[s]e to take my leave; and as he entered the room I left it. To-morrow, my dear Celia, I take leave of the amiable, friendly Amelia, and her worthy mother, and enter into Mrs. Rooksby's family. I am happy to find her [s]on is not much at home, as I have met with [s]o many vexations from the unmeaning assiduities of the men, that I wi[s]h to avoid as much [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-329.jpg) \- external link  - Page 150. ] as po[s][s]ible all intercour[s]e with the [s]ex: for except Kingly, I can hardly believe there is a good one in the world. There was another, Celia, but he is now no more. Dear [s]hade of the benevolent, di[s]intere[s]ted Welldon, if from thy bli[s]sful abode thou could[s]t, now look down, and behold the heart thy virtue [s]natched from ruin, thou would[s]t [s]ee it overflowing with [s]uch grateful remembrance, [s]uch veneration and affection, as nothing but the hand of death can extingui[s]h. Adieu! my dear Celia, I will write again when I can tell you how I like my [s]ituation. MERIEL. [1] See Vol, I. p. 152. MERIEL to CELIA. -  April 20th, 1781\. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-330.jpg) \- external link  - Page 151. ] I have now been in this family nearly a month, and feel my[s]elf as happy as you can imagine, by contra[s]ting my pre[s]ent with my late friendle[s]s and de[s]olate condition. Mrs. Rook[s]by has [s]een a good deal of company [s]ince I have been with her, and goes frequently into public. I find, my dear Celia, that [s]en[s]ibility is not always an object of ridicule; for Mrs. Rook[s]by and Mrs. Kingly can [s]hed tears at a tragedy without endeavouring to conceal, or blu[s]h for their weakness. I have received [s]everal very genteel pre[s]ents from the la[s]t mentioned lady, and whenever her aunt [s]pends a day with her in Golden-Square, I take that opportunity to vi[s]it Mi[s]s Sidney, and [s]o avoid a meeting which I am [s]en[s]ible cannot be very de[s]irable to any of the parties. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-331.jpg) \- external link  - Page 152. ] I have not as yet [s]een Mr. Rook[s]by, but this evening his mother has a rout previous to her leaving town, and [s]he informs me he will certainly be their. The good old lady pathetically laments her [s]ons unfortunate attachment, [s]ays, [s]he is certain, from good information, that he is the dupe of an artful de[s]igning woman. "She has caught him in her deep laid [s]nare," [s]aid [s]he, "and he holds him[s]elf bound to her by gratitude and honour; for I am convinced real affection had little or no [s]hare in fir[s]t forming the connection. He fir[s]t became acquainted with her at Oxford, where [s]he pa[s][s]ed for the wife of an old coun[s]ellor. Her form, I am told, is very lovely, and it could not be supposed that a lad of nineteen, [s]hould repul[s]e, or fly the advances of a beautiful accomplished woman. When he came to town [s]he left her hu[s]band and two lovely children, and followed him, when a lodging was taking for her a few miles from London. When he went to the continent [s]he met him at Dover, and in[s]i[s]ted on going with him, and during their journey, the infatuated boy con[s]ented to her returning and living publicly with him in a hou[s]e he has taken for the purpo[s]e." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-332.jpg) \- external link  - Page 153. ] "He has been acquainted with her [s]ome years, then," [s]aid I. "It is above three years," [s]he replied, "[s]ince he fir[s]t [s]aw her." It is really a [s]ad thing, my dear Celia, that an abandoned woman [s]hould prey upon the fortune and de[s]troy the peace of this young man: yet if the tears and intreaties of a fond mother cannot break the fatal charm that holds him, [s]ure every other effort will be ineffectual. But now my friend, I mu[s]t throw a[s]ide my pen, and be fine lady enough to declare it is for the purpo[s]e of dre[s][s]ing, I begin to wi[s]h we were in the country, I am already [s]ick of parade, [s]hew and farce; for really a fa[s]hionable life is nothing better. How tire[s]ome to be plagued with the civil howdye's of fifty women, who are immen[s]ely happy to hear you are well, and would [s]ay, with the [s]ame [s]ang froid, they were immen[s]ely [s]orry if they were told you were dead. Oh what a mi[s]erable figure I [s]hould make in the beau monde . 21 [s]t . Really this Mr. Rook[s]by is a very tolerable being, and if I did not begin to fear he may be the cau[s]e of future vexation to me I [s]hould like to pa[s]s an hour or two in his company, now and then well enough. This morning at breakfa[s]t Mrs. Rook[s]by [s]aid [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-333.jpg) \- external link  - Page 154. ] "how happy my dear Mi[s]s Howard, [s]hould I be, if your charms and engaging qualities were to draw Clement from his unhappy engagement; I have indulged the mo[s]t plea[s]ing hopes from [s]ome expre[s][s]ions of admiration and [s]urpri[s]e, which broke from him on being introduced to you la[s]t night." "They were merely words of cour[s]e, madam," [s]aid I, [s]miling, "when he knew I was honoured with your approbation, he could not be [s]o wanting in politene[s]s as to expre[s]s any di[s]like." "But what will you [s]ay my dear," [s]he replied, "when I tell you he has ab[s]olutely engaged him[s]elf to dine with me to day, a favour he has not vouch[s]afed above twice [s]ince I came to town." "We will hope, madam, he is returning to a proper [s]en[s]e of his duty." "Ah! Meriel, I wi[s]h he may entertain a proper [s]en[s]e of your merit; how happy [s]hould I be in [s]uch a daughter; how certain would he be of happine[s]s, if ble[s][s]ed with [s]uch a wife." "Dear madam, you over power me; you over rate my merits, and indeed I feel it is impo[s][s]ible I [s]hould ever love any man [s]ufficient to become his wife." "Come," [s]aid [s]he, "be candid, you cannot forget Kingly." "Indeed, madam, if I know my own heart, it never yet harboured an improper wi[s]h; I e[s]teem both Mr. and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-334.jpg) \- external link  - Page 155. ] Mrs. Kingly, but I [s]hould be extremely sorry to [s]ee any misfortune di[s][s]olve their union, but let us drop the [s]ubject, I wi[s]h to remain [s]ingle; let me only enjoy your friend[s]hip my dear madam, and I [s]hall be the happie[s]t creature on earth." At dinner time Mr. Rook[s]by arrived. I endeavoured to be unembarra[s][s]ed in my manner, but after what had pa[s][s]ed in the morning it was impo[s][s]ible. He was attentively polite; but I [s]aw his dear mother watch every look, and [s]mile approbation, whenever any thing e[s]caped him that could be con[s]trued into tenderne[s]s. She pre[s][s]ed me to play and [s]ing: [s]ome little drawings too, which [s]he has honoured by hanging in the drawing-room, were [s]ubmitted to his in[s]pection. "They are va[s]tly well executed," [s]aid he. "Clara draws very prettily." "I hope," [s]aid his mother, "you do not make compari[s]ons." "A[s][s]uredly I do," he replied ha[s]tily, "but every compari[s]on mu[s]t only convince me of Mi[s]s Howard's evident [s]uperiority, not only in every virtue, but in every accompli[s]hment." I hope, my dear Celia, this young man will not take it into his head to fancy him[s]elf in love with me. I never can like him; be[s]ides, I am determined never to marry. Adieu, my dear [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf328v2&image=328-335.jpg) \- external link  - Page 156. ] friend, I wi[s]h I was in the convent with you; but it was not my fate to pa[s]s a [s]erene, unruffled life, and I mu[s]t be as patient as I can till my hour of re[s]t arrives.
