 What is Poetry?---Poetry! that Proteus-like idea, with as many appellations as the nine-titled Coreyra! Give me, I demanded of a scholar some time ago, give me a definition of poetry? "Tres-volontiers,"---and he proceeded to his library, brought me a Dr. Johnson, and overwhelmed me with a definition. Shade of the immortal Shakspeare! I imagined to myself the scowl of your spiritual eye upon the profanity of that scurrilous Ursa Major. Think of poetry, dear B---, think of poetry, and then think of---Dr. Samuel Johnson! Think of all that is airy and fairy-like, and then of all that is hideous and unwieldy; think of his huge bulk, the Elephant! and then---and then think of the Tempest ---the Midsummer Night's Dream---Prospero---Oberon---and Titania! ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) A poem, in my opinion, is opposed to a work of science by having, for its immediate object, pleasure, not truth; to romance, by having for its object an indefinite instead of a definite pleasure, being a poem only so far as this object is attained; romance presenting perceptible images with definite, poetry with in definite sensations, to which end music is an essential , since the comprehension of sweet sound is our most indefinite conception. Music, when combined with a pleasurable idea, is poetry; music without the idea is simply music; the idea without the music is prose from its very definitiveness. What was meant by the invective against him who had no music in his soul? ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)     ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) To sum up this long rigmarole, I have, dear B---,what you no doubt perceive, for the metaphysical poets, as poets, the most sovereign contempt. That they have followers proves nothing--- No Indian prince has to his palace More followers than a thief to the gallows.
