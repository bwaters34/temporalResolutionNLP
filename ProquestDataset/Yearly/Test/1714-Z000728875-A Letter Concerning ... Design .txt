 so, for some time. Otherwise the first Draught or Design shoud have accompany'd the Treatise; as the Treatise does this Letter. But the Design having grown thus into a Sketch , as the Sketch afterwards into a Picture ; I thought it sit Your Lordship shoud either see the several Pieces together, or be troubled only with that which was the best; as undoubtedly the great one must prove, if the Master I employ sinks not very much below himself, in this performance. Amusements of such an inferior Kind as these; especially were they such as they may naturally at first sight appear. I pretend not here to apologize either for them , or for my-self . Your Lordship however knows I have naturally Ambition enough to make me desirous of employing my-self in Business of a higher Order: since it has been my fortune in publick affairs to act often in concert with You, and in the same Views on the Interest of Europe and Mankind. There was a Time, and that a very early one of my Life, when I was not wanting to my Country, in this respect. But after some years of hearty Labour and Pains in this kind of Workmanship, an unhappy Breach in my Health drove me not only from the seat of Business, but forc'd me to seek these foreign Climates; where, as mild as the Winter's generally are, I have with much adoe liv'd out this latter-one ; and am now, as Your Lordship finds, employing my-self in such easy studys as are the most sutable to my state of Health, and to the Genius of the Country where I am confin'd. a kind of spirit of Prophecy, from what I have observ'd of the rising Genius of our Nation, That if we live to see a Peace any way answerable to that generous spirit with which this Warr was begun, and carry'd on, for our own Liberty and that of Europe , the Figure which we are like to make abroad and the Increase of Knowledge, Industry and Sense at home, will make united in this Kind, will show evidently, how much she has been owing to those Councells, which taught her to exert herself so resolutely in behalf of the common Cause , and that of her own Liberty , and happy Constitution , necessarily included. reigning Taste was in many Degrees inferiour to the French . The long Reign of Luxury and Pleasure, under King Charles the Second , and the foreign helps and study'd advantages given to Musick in a following Reign, cou'd not raise our Genius the least in this respect. But when the Spirit of the Nation was grown more Free ; tho' engag'd at that time in the fiercest Warr, and with the most doubtfull success, we no sooner began to turn our-selves towards Musick and enquire what Italy in particular produc'd, but in an instant we outstrip'd our neighbouring French , enter'd into a Genius far beyond theirs, and rais'd our-selves an Ear , and Judgment not inferiour to the best now in the World. our own native Growth in this Kind worthy of being mention'd; yet since the Publick has of late begun to express a Relish for Engravings, Drawings, Copyings, and for the original Paintings of the chief Italian Schools (so contrary to the modern French ) I doubt not, that in very few Years, we shall make an equall progress in this other Science. And when our Humour turns Us to cultivate these designing Arts; our Genius, I am perwaded, will naturally carry Us over the slighter Amusements, and lead Us to that higher, more seriouse, and noble Part of Imitation , which relates to History , Human Nature , and the chief Degree or Order of Beauty ; I mean that of the rational Life; distinct from the merely vegetable and sensible ; as in Animals, or Plants: according to those several Degrees or Orders of Painting, which Your Lordship will find suggested in this extemporary Notion I have sent You. Kind have miscarry'd amongst Us; since the Genius of our Nation has hitherto been so little turned this way, that through several Reigns we have patiently seen the noblest publick Buildings perish (if I may say so) under the hand of one single Court-Architect; who, if he had been able to have profited by Experience, wou'd have long since, at our expence, have proved the greatest Master in the World. But I question whether our Patience is like to hold much longer. The devastation so long committed in this Kind, has made Us begin to grow rude and clamorous at the hearing of a new Palace spoilt, or a new Design committed to some rash or impotent Pretender. yet Two of the noblest subjects for Architecture; our Princes Palace and our House of Parlement . For I can't but fancy that when Whitehall is thought of, the neighbouring Lords and Commons will at the same time be plac'd in better Chambers and Apartments than at present; were it only for Majesty's sake and as a Magnificence becoming the Person of the Prince, who here appears in full solemnity. Nor do I fear that when these new subjects are attempted, we shou'd miscarry as grossly as we have done in Others before. Our State in this respect, may prove perhaps more fortunate than our Church ; in having wayted till a national Taste was form'd, before these Edifices were undertaken. But the Zeal of the Nation cou'd not, it seems, admit so long a Delay in their Ecclesiastical Structures; particularly their Metropolitan . And since the Zeal of this sort has been newly kindled amongst Us, we may see actually from after the many Spires arising in our great City, with such hasty and suddain growth as may be the occasion perhaps that our immediate Relish may be hereafter censur'd as retaining much of what Artists call the Gothick Kind. Whitehall treated like a Hampton-Court , or even a new Cathedral like St. in such publick Structures. Even those Pieces too are brought under the common Censure, which, tho' rais'd by private Men, are of such a Grandeur and Magnificence, as to become National Ornaments. The ordinary Man may build his Cottage, or the plain Gentleman his Country-House according as he fancys: But when a great Man builds, he will find little Quarter from the Publick, if instead stead of a beautyfull Pile, he raises, at a vast expence, such a false and counterfeit Piece of Magnificence as can be justly arraign'd for its Deformity by so many knowing Men in Art, and by the whole People ; who, in such a Conjuncture, readily follow their Opinion. moves successfully without 'em. There can be no Publick , but where they are included. And without a Publick Voice , knowingly guided and directed, there is nothing which can raise a true Ambition in the Artist; nothing which can exalt the Genius of the Workman; or make him emulous of after-Fame, and of the approbation of his Country , and of Posterity . For with these he naturally, as a Freeman , must take part: in these he has a passionate Concern, and Interest, rais'd in him by the same Genius of Liberty , the same Laws and Government by which his Property and the Rewards of his Pains and Industry are secur'd to him, and to his Generation after him. Art and Science . And for the designing Arts in particular, such as Architecture , Painting and Statuary , they are in a manner link'd together. The Taste of one kind brings necessarily that of the Others a long with it. When the free spirit of a Nation turns it-self this way; Judgments are form'd; Criticks arise; the publick Eye and Ear improves; a right Taste prevails, and in a manner forces its way. Nothing is so improving, nothing so natural, so con-genial to the liberal Arts; as that reigning Liberty and high spirit of a People, which from the Habit of judging in the highest Matters for themselves, makes 'em freely judge of other subjects, and enter thorowly into the Characters as well of Men and Manner's , as of the Products or Works of Men, in Art and Science. So much, My Lord, are we owing to the Excellence of our national Constitution, and legal Monarchy; happily fitted for Us; and which alone cou'd hold together so mighty a People; all sharers (tho' at so far a distance from each other) in the Government of themselves ; and meeting under one Head in one vast Metropolis ; whose enormous Growth, however censurable in other respects, is actually a Cause that Workmanship and Arts of so many Kinds arise to such perfection. Arts, I will not pretend to guess. This I only know; that 'tis so much for their advantage and Interest to make themselves the chief Partys in the Cause, that I wish no Court or Ministry, besides a truly virtuous and wise one, may ever concern themselves in the Affair. For shou'd they do so; they woud in reality do more harm than good: since 'tis not the Nature of a Court (such as Courts generally are) to improve, but rather corrupt a Taste . And what is in the Beginning set wrong by their example, is hardly ever afterwards recoverable in the Genius of a Nation. as she now does. Nor can one, me thinks, with just reason regret her having hitherto made no greater Advancement in these affaires of Art. As her Constitution has grown, and been establish'd, she has in proportion fitted herself for other Improvements. There has been no Anticipation in the Case. And in this surely she must be esteem'd wise, as well as happy; that e're she attempted to raise herself any other Taste or Relish, she secur'd her self a rightone in Government . She has now the advantage of beginning in other Matters, on a new foot. She has her Models yet to seek, her Scale and Standard to form, with deliberation, and good Choice. Able enough she is at present to shift for her-self; however abandon'd or helpless she has been left by those whom it became to assist her. Hardly, indeed, cou'd she procure a single Academy for the training of her Youth in Exercises. As good Souldjers as we are, and as good Horses as our Climate affords, our Princes rather than expend their Treasure this way, have suffer'd our Youth to pass into a foreign Nation, to learn to ride. As for other Academys , such as those for Painting, Sculpture, or Architecture, we have not so much as hear'd of the Proposal; whilst the Prince of our rival Nation raises Academys, breeds Youth, and sends Rewards and Pensions into foreign Countrys, to advance the Interest and Credit of his own. Now is not withstanding the Industry and Pains of this foreign Court, and the supine Un-concernedness of our own; the national Taste however rises, and allready shews it-self in many respects beyond that of our so highly assisted Neighbours; what greater Proof can there be of the superiority of Genius in one of these Nations, above the other? Gazetts from Paris , that 'tis resolved at Court to establish a new Academy for political affairs. "In it the present Chief-Minister is to preside: having under him fix Academists dou ez des Talens necessaires \---No Person to be receiv'd under the age of twenty five. A Thousand Livers Pension for each Scholar---Able Masters to be appointed for teaching them the necessary Sciences, and instructing them in the Treatys of Peace and Alliances: which have been formerly made ---The Members to assemble three times a Week--- C'est de ce Seminaire (says the Writer) qu'on tirera les Secretaires d' Ambassade ; qui par degrez pourront monter a de plus hauts Emplois ." Institutions, I can't but look upon an Academy for Minister's as a very extraordinary Establishment; especially in such a Monarchy as France , and at such a Conjuncture as the present. It looks as if the Ministers of that Court had discover'd lately some new Methods of Negotiation, such as their Predecessours Richelieu and Mazarin never thought of: or that, on the contrary, they have found themselves so declin'd, and at such a loss in the Management of this present Treaty as to be forc'd to take their Lesson from some of those Ministers with whom they treat: a Reproach of which, no doubt, they must be highly sensible. Reflections upon Politicks, or the Methods which the French may take to raise themselves new Ministers, or new Generals; who may prove a better Match for Us than hitherto, whilst we held our old . I will only say to Your Lordship on this subject of Academys ; that indeed I have less concern for the Deficiency of such a one as this, than of any other which cou'd be thought of, for England ; and that as for a Seminary of Statesmen , I doubt not but, without this extraordinary help, we shall be able, out of our old Stock, and the common course of Business, constantly to furnish a sufficient Number of able-headed and duly qualify'd Persons to serve upon occasion, either at home, or in our foreign Treatys; as often as such Persons accordingly qualify'd shall duly, honestly, and bon a fide be requir'd to serve. Amusement in this Place and Circumstance Your Lordship has by it a fresh Instance that I can never employ my Thoughts with satisfaction in any subject, without making You a Party. For even this very Notion has had its rise chiefly from the Conversation of a certain Day which I had the Happiness to pass a few Years since in the Country, with Your Lordship. 'Twas there You shew'd me some Ingravings which had been sent You from Italy . And one in particular, I well remember; of which the subject was the very same with that of my written Notion inclos'd. But by what Hand it was done, or after what Master, or how executed, I have quite forgot. 'T was the Summer-season; when You had Recess from Business. And y have accordingly calculated this Epistle and Project for the same Recess and Leisure. For by the time this can reach England , the Spring will be far advanc'd, and the national Affaires in a manner over, with those who are not in the immediate Administration. regard to my Country I shou'd dare throw such Amusements as these in your way. Yet even in this Case, I wou'd venture to say however, in defense of my Project, and of the Cause of Painting ; that cou'd my young Hero come to Your Lordship as well represented as he might have been, either by the Hand of a  1 repute, when I first travell'd here in Italy ) the Picture it-self, whatever the Treatise prov'd, wou'd certainly have been worth notice, and might have become a Present worthy of our Court, and Prince's Palace ; especially were it so bless'd as to lodge within it a royal Issue of her Majesty's. Such a Piece of Furniture might well sit the Gallery, or Hall of Exercises, where our young Princes shou'd learn their usual lessons. And to see Virtue in this Garb and Action, might perhaps be no slight Memorandum hereafter to a royal Youth who shou'd one Day come to undergo this Tryal himself; of which his own Happiness, as well as the Fate of Europe and of the World wou'd in so great a Measure depend. and setting off my Amusements with the best Colour I am able; that I may be the more excusable in communicating them to Your Lordship and expressing thus, with what Zeal I am, Naples March. 6.N.S. 1712.
