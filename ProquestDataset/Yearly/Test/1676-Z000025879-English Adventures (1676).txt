 that affected Gravity which the Nobility and Gentry had put on, to please the deceased King; they dedicated themselves to that way of Life, which was more sutable to their own Genius , as well as to their Monarch's: And by their so warmly embracing the Change, manifested it was the product of their Inclinations. King Henry , for some Reasons of State, (with none of which I resolve to meddle) was married to the Widow of his Brother Arthur , whose Virtue being greater than her Beauty, had a much larger share in his Esteem, than in his Love. For that passion will receive no Laws but what it freely gives unto it self; and is a King over Kings, nay, some presume to say, has been even a Pope over Popes. While the Complements of Sorrow, were paying to Henry VII. our young King, attended by Howard , who was afterwards Duke of Norfolk , went privately in disguise, to divert himself a Hunting in the Forest near Greenwich ; but his own Apartments at Baynards Castle, were lock'd up, as if he himself had been a close Mourner in them; which the unknowing and good natur'd of the Court, ascrib'd to an excess of Grief; for when 'tis real, it hates to have Lookers on. And believing this themselves, easily and gladly infused it into others. So that the first five years of Nero's Reign, gave not greater hopes to the Romans , than this supposed Mourning did to the English ; so apt are good Subjects to believe well of their Princes, when they have but the least Rise to do it. But while the Ignorant were entertaining themselves, with the prospect of Felicities to come, our Henry and Howard , were entertaining themselves with the Recreations of the Countrey, and contriving how to employ their Youth, in those enjoyments, which are most relished by it. They went to a Keepers Lodge in the Forest, who knew not who they were; but finding them Liberal to the height, they were proportionably served. The morning being fair, it invited them to hunt a Stag; the Chace was long, and the Hounds often changing; the Company was dispers'd: whereby the King was as much alone in the Forest, as he was thought to be in the Court. When he had even tyred himself with hard Riding, and [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF237BA&area=prose&forward=textsFT) by the heat of the day, came to a large Tree which overshadowed a Brook; the shade and the murmur, invited him to alight, and to cast himself on the Grass, where he soon fell asleep. By accident a young Gentleman, whose name was Charles Brandon , was then returning from his Travels, and from the High-way, hearing the Cry of the Hounds, spur'd his Horse into the Forest, to share in the Sport which Fortune seem'd to Present him. He therefore leaving himself absolutely to her conduct, laid the Reins on the Horses neck at the meeting of three paths, that he might take his choice; the Horse took the middlemost, which he had not walked in a Furlong, but his Rider saw in the same path, a young Gentleman, handsom to admiration, coming towards him, with his Arm interwoven, in that of a Gentlewomans, whose Beauty, Stature, Shape, and Motion, struck him with new astonishment. And to speak the Truth, never any Mans admiration was paid with greater justice, than his was to that adorable Stranger; her Natural Perfections, needlesly owed something to the Dress she was then in, which resembled that of Diana in the Chace; and the Habit of a Nymph which she then wore, discover'd so many Charms to Brandon , that his Eyes saw more captivating shapes than his Fancy could have imagin'd. While he was entertaining himself in Raptures, at the sight of so much Beauty; and with Envy, at the person who seem'd to be the Monarch of it; he saw the hunted Stag, all imbos'd, brush into the path these Lovers were in; who were so intent, in what they said and did, that they neither saw Brandon , who was before them; nor heard the Stag, who was galloping after them. But Brandon being sensible of their danger, cryed out to them aloud twice or thrice to look to themselves; for the inraged Beast was burnished, and it was near Rutting-time: had he been certain the fury of the Stag would have been onely employed against the Gentleman, possibly he had not given the warning which he then did; since to have been freed from such an Enemy, by such an accident, was more desirable, than to dispossess him of such a Mistriss was hopeful, or so much as promising. The two Lovers, at the repeated cryes of the Stranger, turned their eyes towards him, and observing he pointed earnestly at something behind them, they instantly looked that way; but the notice his civility and care had given, was so far from being beneficial to them, the danger being so near, as the Gentleman, to avoid it, flung himself into the Wood; and the Lady having three times shreek'd, fell all along, having no more the courage to stir out of the place, than her Lover had to stay in it. The Stag immediately began to run at her, with his Antlers; but before he did her any hurt, though he twice pierc'd her cloaths, Brandon had leap'd off of his Horse, drew his Sword, and had made the furious Beast quit the assault of a defenceless Enemy, to mind the attack of an assaulting one. But when Brandon had got between the Lady and the Stag, both his and her greatest apprehensions were past; and though she got up, with all the agility which Fear does usually inspire, yet she could not abandon her generous Protector; and being unable, but by her Prayers for his safety, to contribute towards it, she was making those for him on her knees, and with too much ardency, to be singly the Product of Gratitude. For the service he then did her, could not be greater than her sense of it, or the merit and good meen of the person who paid it; since, in one word, he was in our Sex, what the Lady was in hers. The place in which this Accident hapned, was so near to that where our Monarch lay asleep, as the cryes and shreeks had awak'd him; and by their continuance, being guided to the place from whence they came, he saw what put him in mind of that Hero, the Noble Order of whose Knighthood, he himself was the Head; whether this remembrance, or his admiration of the beauty of the Nymph, which his heart, by some secret emotions, told him was, or sooner would be his Conqueror, did awhile make him continue moveless, I cannot tell; but as soon as he had seen the danger her Protector was in, (for his Cloaths were all bloody) or rather to participate in the Duty and Honour of her deliverance, his Generosity, or growing Flame, made him immediately draw his Sword, and by a menacing Cry, compell'd the Stag to turn towards him, and then to run so fiercely at him; that by his too intent gazing on his new Mistriss, he had like to have received from the irritated Beast more fatal wounds, than had been yet given him by the Beauty he was serving. How many glorious Successes had our Nation been rob'd of, and how many stupendious Vicissitudes had the World avoided, if the fury of the Stag had not been diverted by the destiny of the King; but though the mournfullest effects of it, were hinder'd by his Agility, yet he could not avoid the shock, but was by the impetuosity of it, cast upon the ground, with such violence, that it depriv'd him for a moment of the use of his senses. The Stag had so overshot himself, by missing what he meant should only have stopped his career, that before he could turn about to finish what he had in part failed of, our Monarch had recover'd spirits enough to see his danger, but not to revenge or prevent it; and just as the Stag was running at him the second time, at which the Nymph made a great shreek, Brandon generously bestrid the Kings body, and with undaunted courage, and great dexterity, defended it long eenough for our Prince to get up, and with his Sword in his hand to contribute to the death of that Enemy, which had been so near acting his. The Stag was no sooner fallen, but our Monarch and Brandon forgetting to acknowledge to one another, the mutual obligations they had so recently given, and received, went hastily as it had been by Concert, to offer their Services to the Beauty to whom they had paid such signal ones, who received them both, with the Retributions which their good Meens and their Actions so abundantly merited. Her fear being vanished, which had too much conquer'd the vermillion of her Face, the lovely red re-assumed the Throne again, with so much lustre, as never two hearts at once, were vanquish'd with so much celerity, and so little resistance, as our Henry's and Brandon's were. But when together with her exterior Charms, those of her Discourses had united themselves, neither of our Gallants could tell by which of the Senses, Love made the shortest approach to their Hearts. She saluted them both, with a grace peculiar to herself, and with words as inchanting as her eyes so that they both began to believe that what Poets fancied, was to them a reality, and that this was the Goddess of the Forest. But as soon as she perceiv'd Brandon's cloaths all wet with his blood, and that some still trickled from a wound he had in the Neck; his could not run faster from the Hurt, than hers did from her Face; so that taking hastily an Incarnation Skarf, which was cast about her shoulder, she went with it trembling and blushing to her new Adorer, and desired his permission with her hand to stop that blood, which had been so obligingly shed in her service. Brandon received the charming favor on his knees, and told her, trembling and blushing more than she, I thought, Madam, the delight of being wounded in the honour of your service, was incapable of any accession; but this unmeritable condescention of yours, has convinced me of that error; and nothing could diminish my joy, but that 'tis rais'd by your trouble . But, Madam, ( he continued ) how could the person, whom you blest with such evidences of your favor, before your danger, abandon you in it? Ah! how unworthy was he of those felicities I saw you confer on him. These last words he accompanied with a sigh, and she heard them with a smile; which our young Lover knew not how to interpret. But our Monarch more sensibly wounded, by this kindness of his new Conqueress to his Rival, than he had been by the Stag, leaning against a Tree, and folding his arms one within another, by some sighs, which reached the Ladies ear, made her turn hastily towards him, and then to ask him, Whether he had also received any wound, which needed her assistance? Our Henry reply'd, with a look which told her his passion , Yes, Madam, I have received a wound, and a more dangerous one than his;[![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF237BA&area=prose&forward=textsFT) for that, if he of us two which most needs the happiness of your concernment, has the best title to it, your charity has hitherto been misimployed. The fair Nymph was cover'd with blushes at this unexpected Declaration, and Brandon was so peek'd at it, that [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF237BA&area=prose&forward=textsFT) had not she immediately interpos'd both her Prayers and Commands, and added her Promises, that she would forgive their disrespect to her, if they forgave each other, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF237BA&area=prose&forward=textsFT) as in a moment the calm was as great, as the storm else would have been. And finding, by the temper of these two Gallants, that the fire she had supprest by her authority and presence, might revive in her absence, she conjur'd them for her sake to promise solemnly they would eternally become friends; and that they would evidence they had granted her earnest request, by an immediate embracing of one another: it was impossible to tell which of them was most expeditious in paying his obedience; for though by accident they were engaged in a difference, yet by inclination they had contracted so good an opinion of each other, that nothing less than being Rivals, could have hinder'd them at first sight from being friends. The fair Mediatress of this Peace, was doubly pleas'd with it; for she not only hinder'd a quarrel between persons to whom she was much obliged, but the manner of their obeying her, gave her a welcome evidence of the Ascendant she had over them. Every one of the three being ignorant who the other two were, and all being desirous [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF237BA&area=prose&forward=textsFT) not longer to continue in that unhappiness, she entreated her two Deliverers, to acquaint her who they were. Our Monarch immediately acquainted her his name was Tudar , that he had the happiness to belong to the King, and the great honour to be his Kinsman; and that he was that morning come from the melancholy of the Court, to divert himself a Hunting. Brandon immediately paid him those respects which his being of the Royal Blood, were justly due unto him; and with all the civility imaginable, beg'd his pardon, for what his ignorance of his quality had made him guilty of, and could only apologize for; protesting he so highly reverenced every one of the sacred blood of his Prince, that his own to the last drop of it, should be joyfully shed in the duty of their service. Our Prince repaid his Civility with fresh Embraces, and there began that friendship which our most celebrated Historians have Recorded, and with Justice too, since it never ended but with their Lives. The fair Lady who had asked the question, was so pleas'd, that she owed her safety to one of the Royal Blood, and with the celerity and chearfulness he had paid to her commands, that she could not but express her joy and gratitude at both; but in words and actions so taking, that if any part of our Kings heart did remain unconquer'd until then, it continued so no longer. And therefore begging to know her name, she told him it was Izabella ; that she was Daughter to my Lord --- that she was come from London , the usual place of her Fathers residence, to visit some Companions of hers, at a Palace near the Forest; that to divert the Ladies and Gentry of the Neighborhood, they were engaged to Act a Play called Endimion , in which she was to represent Diana , and therefore to try her Habit, was drest in it, that morning when walking to enjoy the freshness of it, they had been more than Witnesses of her disaster, for they generously freed her from it. Brandon then in obedience to her commands, told her his Name, and that he was a younger Son of a Noble Family; that one of the pleasingst and fatalst accident that the invention or malice of Destiny could possibly contrive, had necessitated him to Travel into Foreign Countries, to subdue, or at least mitigate his melancholy. And then to divert the fair Izabella's more particular inquiry, and to satisfie his own impatience, beg'd her, with a visible concernment, to let him know who the happy Gentleman was who had possest the honour of attending her before her danger, and was guilty of forsaking her in it. The King, who knew nothing of this before, and was not a little alarm'd at Brandon's sighing, when he asked the question, continued in a deep silence, expecting her answer; which she made smilingly, and by desiring him to consider, if he were not too curious to press for that a second time, which she had denied the first. Brandon beg'd her Pardon; which she assured him of, if he would, as they returned to Charleton , for that was the name of the Palace to which she intended to go, acquaint her with that Story by Retail, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF237BA&area=prose&forward=textsFT) which what he had said of it in Epitomy, made her desirous to hear. Brandon conjur'd her more than once, to dispense with his obedience therein, since it would renew his grief, and he fear'd infect her with it. But this Reply adding to her Curiosity, he was at last vanquished by her, and the Kings intreaties, having put herself in the midst, and walking softly towards Charleton, Brandon having cast up his eyes to Heaven, and fetch'd a groan from the very bottom of his heart, began the ensuing Relation. than it is, that others fall into them, both against their inclination and intention. This latter is what I can experimentally aver; but whether it proceeds from the influence of the Stars at our Nativity, or from a Fatality to which all Men are subjected, or from some other occult cause, I dare not determine; but this I know that the crime I fell into, was not so much my sin, as it is my punishment. But before I proceed to acquaint you with the particulars, which I more than hope will incline you to be of my belief, I must beg you, that what I am to tell you, purely to obey you, may be kept as great a secret, as otherwise I resolved it should eternally have been, and as you will easily perceive the nature of it requires. Izabella , and our Monarch, having promis'd what he asked, he thus continued: My Father having spent much of his time and blood in our late sad and intestine Wars, abhorring the necessary cruelties in them, and loathing the vicissitudes of a Court-life, retired for ever to a Castle of his own in Glocestershire , where he determined to bury himself alive. But one day being drawn to a Kinsmans Wedding, by the importunity of a bosome friend, he saw at it, a Gentlewoman, so handsom, that what all the beauties of England (which doubtless is their highest Sphere) could not perform on him in twenty years, she did in a moment; for, Madam , 'tis the fate of some Families, to fall in Love at first sight. My Father passionately inquired of his Friend if he knew her, and being assured he did, and that if she were not his near Kinswoman, he would not scruple to affirm, he knew no person in the World, whose virtue and softness of humor, exceeded hers; but withall told him, the calamities of the Civil Wars had so ruin'd her Parents fortune, as they were unable to give her a Portion, in the least answerable to her birth and merit. My Father, who knew that happiness has its solid Throne only in the mind, and that wealth is an excess, which may often be more dangerous than useful, courted this Lady, and having found the character his Friend had given him of her, exactly true, at last married her; from that Union, my elder Brother and I descended, whose Educations were such, that if we were no great Proficients in our Studies and Exercises, it was our own faults: possibly never any Friendship was greater, than that, between my Brother and I; we seem'd to have but one Soul, which actuated both our Bodies; and we were dearer to each other, by the tyes of Friendship, than by those of Blood. We were never admitted to see a Court or an Army; and my Father who had taken a Surfet of both, gave our earlier years such ill impressions of them, that we joyfully dedicated the hours of our vacancy to no other pleasures, but those of Hunting and Hawking, and such harmless divertisements of a Countrey life. In these innocent employments, my Brother attain'd to his twentieth, and I to my nineteenth year; but as if Fortune had envied us this little tranquility, a near Friend of my Mothers dyed, and left to her care her onely Daughter, which Legacy she sent her at the last gasp, with the little she had saved out of the general shipwrack, occasion'd by the bloody contentions of the two Roses. My Mother manifested the esteem she had of the dead, by her care of the living: nor could that generosity be noblier employ'd, than on this young Gentlewoman, whose name was Victoria ; for she was so charming and lovely, that the very first hour she came to live with my Mother, my Brother and I began to feel a passion in our hearts, which till that moment, we had never been acquainted with. Could I draw you, Madam , her Picture to the Life, you would excuse our being so soon vanquish'd: for I thought then, nothing could be so perfect; and should have still continued in that belief, had not my sight this day convinc'd me of my Error. My Brother never told me of his passion, neither did I acquaint him with mine; which was the first and onely Secret we kept in reserve from one another. I will not, Madam , so much misimploy your patience, as to tell you all the Services I paid the charming Victoria ; nor all the arts and assiduities I used to make them acceptable to her; neither will I particularize my Brothers part, in the like design. 'Tis enough you know, that after above one years languishing, I had only this ill-natur'd consolation, that I judged my Brother was as unsuccessful as I; so that the reservedness, and severity of Victoria's carriage, made me often in despair and anger, resolve to abandon so hopeless a Love; nay, I was in my heart almost despising my Brother, for his not assuming the like resolution. But alas! I soon found 'tis Love which gives Laws to us, and not we to Love; for I so strongly renew'd my Chains, as a Pennance, for having intended to break them, that I had merited Victoria's contempt, had she but known I lov'd her so much then, and had lov'd her no more formerly. But as my passion increast, I thought her coldness did; and in all her deportment both to my Brother and me, she manifested such an indifferency, that I could not be more troubled at it, than I was pleas'd to observe my Friend wore the same Livery. While things were in this posture, one morning he went out very early a Hunting, my Page, who was fond of that recreation, very officiously waked me, to give me notice of it; hoping I would be a sharer in it, and consequently he, who usually attended me. This being the first time he had designed to separate me from any of his recreations, as well as businesses (except that great one of his Love) I resolved to follow him, and learn the cause; but after having for some hours fruitlesly inquired after him, and neither hearing of him, nor the cry of the Hounds, I returned home melancholy, and weary; and the Servant which waited on me in my Chamber, being out of the way, I cast my self on a Bed with a Canopy which was in a Closet within the drawing Room, endeavoring by a little sleep to abate my being tired in body, and troubled in mind. I had not slept half an hour, but I was awakened by the noise of one walking in the same Room. The curtains of the Canopy being not close shut, I saw through the opening, that it was the fair Victoria . The curiosity of a young Lover made me continue conceal'd, to discover what brought her thither; I saw she was discompos'd, and while she was looking in her Glass, to adjust herself, my Brother came in, who running to her with open arms, embrac'd and kist her, at which she made no resistance, but blushed exceedingly. My Amazement and Grief at so surprizing an Accident, is not to be exprest: But one of the Maid-servants coming into the outward Room to rub it, I heard Victoria say, Alas! we shall be discover'd, unless you make haste away . My Brother at this, prest her much to name the hour and the signal; to which, at last, trembling and blushing, she answer'd, This night at midnight, and three soft strokes at the upper part of her Chamber door, should be the sign for admittance . But she added, Forget not, Sir, there is nothing but a painted Wainscot between your Mothers Beds-head and mine, and therefore if you speak one word, it may be over-heard, and I shall be ruin'd . My Brother promis't her hastily an exact obedience; then having again kist and embrac'd her, went into the outward Chamber, from whence he aloud order'd the Servant to call his Page to him; and as soon as the Coast was clear, Victoria also went hastily away. Judge, Madam , I humbly beg you, (continued Brandon ) what my condition was, at what I had heard and seen; for I confess I am not able to relate it: Amazement, Jealousie, and Anger, or rather Fury, did so torment me by turns, nay, sometimes all at once, that I knew as little what was fit to do, as what was fit not to be done. Sometimes I resolved to make Friendship and Nature yield to my resentments, and in a Duel killing my Brother, convince Victoria , she had made an unjust choice; but soon that angry Resolve resign'd it self to the Sacred names of Brother and Friend. Neither could I in calmer thoughts with any shadow of Justice condemn him for having done to me, but what I doubt I should have done to him, had my success been equal to his. My Rage finding no fit object on my Brother to discharge it self, I determin'd to be revenged on her, and by immediately detecting her sin to my Mother, get her banisht with ignominy out of a Family, where her too much kindness to one of it, was an affront to all the rest. But then my Love, or rather Pity, to ruine what I had so lately ador'd, shook that resolution, and in a few moments afterwards intirely conquer'd it. So that finding no single object on which to vent my Despair, I was so Criminal (for which, Madam , said Brandon to Izabella , I most humbly beg your pardon) as to Curse the whole Sex: for since she who I then believ'd the greatest ornament of it, and possessor of the strictest virtue in it, had so abandon'd herself, I rashly and criminally concluded all of them merited, what at that time I too heartily wish'd might befall them. In these Disorders, locking up the Chamber door, and walking many turns in it, I began to grow more moderate, and then my evil Genius did let me see, that what I had consider'd as my highest misfortune, was what I might more reasonably esteem the contrary; since if I prevented my Brother in the assignation agreed on between Victoria and him, which was no difficult work to perform, I should both satisfie my Revenge, and my Love. When this fatal Project was admitted, Alas! with what Raptures was it entertain'd; and all the dictates of Remorse, for betraying my Mistriss, my Friend, and my Brother, how chearfully were they sacrific'd to the imagined felicities which were to attend the Action. In brief, Madam , I so cautiously order'd the Design, that it succeeded to my wish. But while I was in my Brothers place, and in all the pleasures of triumphant Love, I did hear him many times give the appointed signal at the door; but you will easily believe, I took care Victoria should not, in whose embraces I spent the happy and guilty Night; and just as the Day began to dawn, having agreed with her the next Night, to repeat my joyes, I retired a back way to my own Chamber, where having for some time celebrated my double victory, I drest my self, and with impatience enough waited to observe how my deluded Brother would resent so wounding a disappointment; never till then having in the least consider'd, what might be the consequences of it, so much the delight of involving him in it had blinded me. My Chamber was next to the great Square, in which the Stair-case was carried up, and from whence Victoria was to come down to the Chappel, which every morning and evening she failed not to do. I had not been long on the attendance, when through a little opening of my door, which I had made on purpose, I saw my Brother come to the foot of the Stairs, walking short turns, and every moment casting up his eyes, to observe when she would descend: At last she appeared, but as soon as she saw him, her face was cover'd with blushes; but his, at the sight of her, became pale as Death; and such a shaking seized on all his limbs, as it too evidently discover'd the storm in his Soul. Victoria , either ashamed to look on him, who she believ'd that night had rifled her greatest treasure; or else minding her steps, looked not on him, till she was within seven or eight of the bottom; but then casting a look towards him as full of modesty as fire, and thinking none could hear her, she told him, I hope, Sir, you are now satisfied \---He, without giving her leave to finish what she had begun, reply'd, in a furious tone, Yes, I am satisfied;---But 'tis, That you are the falsest of Women; and ere long, you shall be satisfied my Resentment shall be as great as my Affront . Then without so much as staying for her Answer, he flung away in such rage, that I who saw it, am not able to describe it. The poor Victoria , at so amazing an usage, became white as Innocence, and gave no sign that she was alive, but by an universal trembling. The fright I was in, lest she should fall down those steps, on which her astonishment had seized her, made me run out of my concealment, and so timely, that I catch'd her in my Arms just as her Senses had forsaken her; whereby I prevented that Death by her fall on the pavement, which her grief made her desire. All the Servants in the Family, who were not then employ'd in the necessary functions of it, were gone to the Chappel, and so were my Father and Mother, whereby missing of all help, I carried Victoria into my Chamber, and there by bowing her body, rubbing her temples, and casting water on her face, I brought her at last out of her fainting, and then conjur'd her to tell me the cause of it. She onely answer'd me with a deep sigh; at which I smil'd, and acquainted her I had heard all that had past between her and my Brother. She knew I had too much concernment for her, not to be sensible of her then condition, and therefore having awhile reflected on my smiling, on a sudden she cast her eyes towards me, and fixing them stedfastly on me, she told me, I conjure you , Brandon, to tell me, and truly too, where you lay last night . I instantly answer'd, With the greatest Beauty of the World ; and then told her, how I came to over-hear her Assignation with my Brother, and had by my Art, repair'd the misery of her unkindness. All the while I was making that short Narrative, I saw her colour come and go, her heart ready to force a passage through her breast, and in so many other Agonies, that had she actually made me as unfortunate as she once intended, the sight of her then suffering would have been too severe a revenge: But alas! when I came to the end of my information, she fetch'd a hideous skreem, and fell dead on the Bed, to which at first I had carried her. I cannot tell you, Madam , which of my Griefs were greater; to see her in that condition, or to find her having made me happy against her will, had reduced her to it: however, I endeavour'd all I could to restore her to her Senses, which at length I effected; but she had no sooner open'd her eyes, and saw her self in my Arms, then she relaps'd, and so long, and so dangerously, that when I fear'd I could not recover her from Death, I resolved to accompany her in it. But when I began to despair of her return, she came to herself again, and while I was on my knees celebrating my joyes for it, and renewing my passionate request, to know what was the occasion of that sorrow, which was so dangerous to her and me; she strove to go away, but not being strong enough to do it, she fell again upon the Bed, and told me, in an Accent too moving to be imitated, Ah Brandon, you have ruin'd your Brother, and me, and your self, if at least the friendship you have hitherto paid him, be not a fiction; for I am your Brothers wife, and this morning --- A crowd of sighs, and a torrent of tears, stop'd the passage of her words; but alas! what she had said, reduced me to a condition as worthy of pity as hers was; which as soon as she observ'd, it heightned her own afflictions, so that she employ'd a quarter of an hour, and with interrupted words, in telling me, That my Brothers Hunting the day before, was but a pretence to go the earlier abroad, to meet her with a Priest, by appointment in a Grove, where they had been married . At the end of this Relation, her Woman, who had mist her at the Chappel, and had in vain sought her over all the House, came to inquire of me, if I could tell her where she was; there finding her in a fainting condition, by her help, we brought Victoria to her own Chamber; and her Distemper every moment increasing, she took her Bed, and I retired. My Father and Mother having miss'd her at their Devotions, concluded some indisposition was the cause of it; wherefore they came to visit her, and finding she was in a high Fever, they went hastily to their Closets, to write for two of the eminentest Physitians in the Countrey. I took that opportunity to steal into her Chamber, kneel'd by her Beds-side, and in more tears and sighs, than words, convinced her of the vastness of my grief, and then advised her to send immediately for my Brother, and to tell him, She had locked him out of her Chamber one night, meerly to try his temper; but since she found he resented that seeming unkindness so highly, she beg'd his pardon for it, was really sorry she had committed that fault, and would endeavour to repair it by all the actions of her Life . This was the best counsel I could then present her; and asking her, Whether she approved it, and if it were her pleasure I should send my Brother to wait on her? She onely told me with a sigh, Do what you will . Then turning from me, she fell a weeping in such excess, that I thought she would be drown'd in her own tears. As soon as I heard my Mother coming in at one door, I slip'd out at the other, and went to seek my Brother; for I was confident if he went not to visit her, it would both increase her danger, and possibly discover the cause of it. At last I found him in a Grove of the Park, lying his full length, near a Brook, and in troubles almost as great as mine. I told him Victoria was fallen into a burning Fever; and by the fierceness of the beginning, my Mother more than feared the End would be fatal, and therefore had sent two Expresses for the Doctors. That I came then from waiting on her, but I had found her so alter'd, as the change had amazed me; since I thought I saw the image of Death in that face, which till then, had been all life. I added, that in a whisper, she had desired me to send him speedily to her, and that I would so order it, as to entertain my Mother, while she herself was speaking alone to him; since she had something on her heart to say, that till she had told him, and received his answer on it, she should be in torments. At first my Brother seem'd unmov'd at her danger, and request; but I, at length, prevail'd with him to go, where we found my Mother all in tears, the violence of Victoria's Fever, so greedily increasing on her. The vastness of my Mothers affliction, was no ill preparative, to melt my Brothers heart; when he came to Victoria's Bed, she resign'd to him her place, and I, to allow them the freer liberty to discourse, drew her to a Window, under pretence of seeing from thence, if either of the Doctors were coming. I never could learn what in particular past between them, but I saw him at last kneel down by her, (for my eyes were still turned that way) and laying his lips to her burning hand, seem'd thereby to seal her Pardon. But my Mother, who apprehended such Visits might be hurtful to the fair Patient, ordered us both to retire. I cannot better parallel his Grief, than by telling you, Madam , it was equal to his late Fury; and as we walked together into the Park, he discovered to me, how the day before he was secretly married to Victoria ; for he knew he could never have obtain'd my Fathers consent to do it, since her Beauty and Virtue was all her Portion. He further told me with groans, that he trembled to think, 'twas his Brutishness, had reduc'd her to the deplorable state she was then in; and informed me afterwards of their Assignation, her failing, and his resentments at it, (a Relation which alas I knew better than himself;) That though he more than feared, 'twas his outragious Passion, had flung her into the Fever; yet she could not be brought to acknowledge to him, it had done so: But she had beg'd his forgiveness for deluding him, in such moving Words, Actions and Tears, as those confest to him that Truth, which he could not extort from her Mouth; That he had beg'd her Pardon on his knees, for his Crime, which she had granted him with a tenderness so charming, that her forgiving him in such a manner, had wounded him as deeply, as his Barbarity had her. This Account he gave me, in so much affliction and disorder, that it brought on accession to my griefs, which, till then, I believ'd were uncapable of any. The share which he thought I bore in his misery, heightned his friendship, and made him beg of me a thousand Pardons, that he had till then concealed his Marriage from me, which was the first, and should be the last offence he would be guilty of, but that now my lively sense of his grief had extorted from him, that Confession which else he would not have made: for he fear'd when ever his father knew it, if he should also learn I was acquainted with it, 'twould involve me in his disgrace, the apprehension of which only had hitherto sealed his lips; so that he never had been seemingly unkind to me, but to be really the contrary. We then in many embraces renew'd our friendships. Soon after, we saw one of the Doctors Gallop by us; we hastily followed him, to learn his judgment of Victoria's condition, upon which both our own depended. In brief, Madam , the Physitian awhile felt her Pulse, and shook his Head; and having apply'd all that his art and kindness could dictate, he told my mother the seventh day in great grief; That his Patient had more need of a Priest, than of him; And that his skill deluded him, if some distemper of the Mind had not reduc'd her Body to so dangerous a state. But, Madam, (Brandon continued) I perceive your Generosity and Compassion, has made you too large a sharer in poor Victoria's sufferings; I shall not therefore augment it, by particularizing all the fatal passages of this Story. 'Tis too much you know, all the Physitians Care and Art, all my Mothers Kindness and Assiduities, all my Brothers Pardons and Tears, and all my Groans and Submissions, could not in the least prevail with Victoria to live; her scrupulous Virtue, made her judge my Crime was her own; and having lay'n one night in my Arms, she concluded herself unworthy ever after to lie in my Brothers; and that she was only fit for those of death: To which she hastened with such earnestness and resolution, that those who knew not the cause, admired at the action; and I who knew it, deplored it with such excess, that the effect of my sin, was believed singly the product of my good Nature. The Ninth day of her Sickness, was the last of her Life; and had like to have been of my Brothers and mine: For before she locked herself up with her Confessor, and after she had taken an eternal Farewell of my unconsolable Father and Mother, she gave one half hour of her hasty time to me, and one full hour to my poor Brother; but what she said to him to mitigate his sorrows, heighten'd them, since to lose for ever so much Beauty, Virtue, and Goodness, was above the power of Consolation; and from the hour of her death, he courted his own. What she said to me, was consonant to her admirable Virtue; and made me more in love with her Mind, than I had ever been with her Person. The nearer her illuminated Soul approached to the happiness she now enjoyes, the greater the lustre of it did shine; and though she spoke to me innumerable excellent things, yet I shall relate to you but this one. She conjur'd me to flie from Sin; for when it is committed, none can foresee how productive it is in Evil, nor the utmost consequences which attend it. You thought ( she added ) that I had been unchaste, and that gave you the opportunity to be so: But you did not imagine, that by satisfying one voluptuous desire, it should plunge you into Incest, the death of your Mistriss; and alas! I fear, that of your Friend and Brother. All these were not your design, but by one Sin they became your guilt; and by your sorrow, I see they are your punishment: However ( she continued, putting towards me her pale and trembling hand ) I forgive you, and have in tears beg'd of God to do it. Ah! by this so pregnant a Sin, be for ever frighted from committing another: This is the last Request I shall make you; and if you grant it, 'twill be the greatest blessing you can bestow upon your self. The excellency of her Admonitions, the Generosity with which she pardon'd me, the unexpressible sorrow for her death, and my own fatal guilt which had caused it, so powerfully operated on me, that retiring from her more dead than alive, I went trembling to my own Chamber, where having spent an hour in all the Agonies which those Reflections could cast a despairing Soul into, I resolved to forsake for ever my Fathers house, and immediately with some Jewels which my Father had given my Mother, and she had given me, (for I was her Favorite) I stole the back way to the Stables, took one of my best Horses, and Rid towards Dover ; but so overwhelm'd with grief and trouble, as I knew not what I did. From Dover I past the Channel into France , and for two years last past, I served sometimes in the Armies of King [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF237BA&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Francis the Fifth, and sometimes in those of the Emperor Charles the Fifth, where being careless of my life, or rather weary of it, and desirous to lose it, I perform'd some such bold Actions, as I wanted not the offers of great Preferments from those famous Princes. But my unconsolable griefs, which made me do what they thought merited their Favors, made me also decline all those their Generosities offer'd me. And I had still liv'd that wretched and vagabond life, had not a young Gentleman of Glocestershire , who had been my Neighbor there, arrived three weeks since at the French Army, to learn the Art of War, by whom I was assured, That the day of my flight from my Fathers, the fair Victoria dyed; That my Brother having rather languished, than outlived her ten days, followed her; And that by his repeated desires, he was buried in the same Grave with her, for at his death, he had acknowledged she had been his Wife; That my Father and Mother, at the loss of her, him, and in appearance, if not in effect, of me also, so languished away, that they were likewise buried together in one Monument; so that by this Gentlemans importunities, and his telling me, that one afar off related to our Family, was suing for my Estate, and was like to carry it, I was persuaded to return, though without the least hope of relishing Life. But, Madam , continued Brandon , since I had the honour to see you, I begin to cast off that despair, and now that it has been in some small measure useful to your service, in hopes it may be more, I shall cherish it, and only on that Account. The King and Izabella blusht at these last words, and partly to divert Brandon from considering it, and also to pay the just debt of Sorrow and Pity due to his Story, by turns acknowledg'd, he had but too much made good what at first he had said of the greatness of his Misfortune. While they were in Discourses of this nature, our Monarch saw Howard come Galloping towards him; who, from the time he had lost his Prince, had been ranging the Forest to find him, which having thus happily done, the better to Act the disguise the King had resolved to keep; they often embraced each other, Howard still calling him by the name of Tudor , and expressing much trouble for their separation, and joy at their meeting. Howard had no sooner cast his eyes on the fair Izabella , and on Brandon , but he admired them both; and they made him their returns in the same Coin: for doubtless never four persons were more worthy the Name of Perfect, than those were, whom Fortune had by Accident brought together that morning. Soon after they perceiv'd a Chariot coming hastily towards them, attended by six Pages and Footmen, in magnificent Liveries; and in it, only one Lady, whose eyes had attacked our three new Lovers hearts, had not Izabella prepossest the places. This Beauty, as soon as she came to them, alighted out of her Chariot, and without so much as taking notice of our three Gallants, ran with open Arms to embrace and kiss Izabella , which she did a hundred times, and Izabella did the like to her: And then told her Charming Friend, the great obligation she had to her two Deliverers; who immediately in words and actions, so enchantingly presented them her acknowledgments for it, as it renewed their former imaginations, of the Forest being inhabited by Diana , and her Nymphs. The Lady newly arrived, whose name was Utresia , came to seek Izabella in a Chariot, the heat of the day, having turned walking into a trouble; to whom she whisper'd something, at which they both smil'd, and then continued their walk towards Charleton , which was not a Furlong off. The Chariot being too little to carry all five, the three Captives often beg'd of the Ladies that they would go into it, and allow them the honour to walk by it; for the heat began to grow importunate, which yet the Ladies chose to suffer, rather than be guilty of such incivility. They therefore all five walked together till they came to the Gate, where such a crowd of Beauties came to meet Izabella , and to congratulate her Deliverance, (which one of the Pages had run to inform them of) that our Monarch was ravished, to see he had so many charming Beauties his Subjects, and deplor'd the severities of his Fathers Reign, which had hinder'd them from frequenting his Court. They all invited our Prince, Howard , and Brandon , to refresh themselves in the Palace; but our Henry apprehending to be discover'd, despairing also before so many Witnesses, to entertain Izabella alone; and longing to entertain his own thoughts, he took his leave of them, begging and obtaining their permissions to wait on them again: when on a sudden, Brandon turned pale, and fell into a fainting Fit, but so happily for him, that Izabella , who first perceiv'd it, to prevent his falling on the Pavement, supported him in her Arms, till others ran to his assistance; so that even his seeming want of Life, flung him into one of the happiest postures of it. Our King, instead of pitying, envied him, and began to dread a Rival, whose Misfortunes contributed to his Felicity. The obliging Izabella , being sensible that his loss of blood, and his attending on her a-foot, in the great heat, had reduced him to that condition, judged her self tyed to repair the Ill which she had been the occasion of, and therefore desired and obtained of the fair Utresia (who was the Lady of the place) a Room for him, to which he was immediately convey'd, and the nearest Physitian and Chyrurgion sent for. Thus Brandon lodg'd in the house, where of all the world he long'd most to be, his disaster contributing to his design, more than any thing else could have done; so as he only wanted the satisfaction of being in a condition to relish it. In the mean while the King having his Horse brought him by Howard's Groom, did with his Master Gallop to the Lodge, entertaining himself with the various Accidents that morning had produc'd, and at least beginning to find, though he were the Monarch of England , yet he carried in his heart a greater Sovereign than himself. where he was, by the Servants appointed to attend him, and to whose favor he owed, what he receiv'd, he blest those wounds, which had produced for him such advantageous effects. As soon as his Physitian had told the company he might be seen, he received the Visits of all those Beauties; and she in whose service he was hurt, was the most assiduous about him: but though her being so, proceeded chiefly from her gratitude, and good nature, yet he hoped 'twas from a more obliging cause; so apt are Lovers to entertain what they most desire. Yet the great Familiarities he had seen betwixt Izabella , and the handsom Gentleman she was walking with, before her late Adventure, gave him no little alarm; which was much heightened, by his never being able to learn from her, what, or who he was though he often and exceedingly prest it: yet still Brandon flatter'd himself with a belief, that so mean an action of his Rivals, would ruine him in his Mistrisses favour; and when he trembled at the remembrance how partial Love is, and how it will overlook all faults in those to whom it is once given, yet he would again console himself with the belief, that who was kind to a Coward, might be soon induced to become so, to a Man of Valor. While he recover'd, by the help of such pleasing hopes, the Comedy was Acted, and soon after most of the Assembly dispersed themselves; but Izabella continued with Utresia , who was newly married to a Lord so young, as he was sent to Travel; and had committed the care of his House, his Lady, and his Estate, to his Sister, some seven years elder than he, her Name was Maria : and though she was handsom, yet not so to the degree she desired; whereby not being overlikely to be cryed up for a Beauty, she resolv'd to be esteem'd for her Judgment and Discretion. Maria therefore to make her Sister-in-law pass the time of her young Brothers absence the least unpleasantly that she could, had got all the good company of the Neighborhood to that meeting, and by many other divertisements, endeavor'd to do therein what she had design'd. Utresia and Maria being almost never separated from Izabella , and she, at fit hours, seldom absent from Brandon , those four persons spent not ill their time. And though Brandon chiefly made his Addresses to Izabella , yet he could not but observe in Utresia's looks, something which seem'd to tell him, she was somewhat more than civil. Nay, at last, Maria herself became so diligent about him, as it appear'd rather the effect of Kindness, than Care; whereby Brandon found he had most favour from two, where he was not so covetous of it, than from one where he most desired it. His condition permitting him only to divert the Ladies by his discourses, he attempted to do it that way, and was so successful therein, that they admired the Charms of his wit, as much as those of his good looks. One Evening, while Izabella and Maria were enjoying the cool of it, in the Garden, Utresia came to visit Brandon ; but instantly made as if she would retire, pretending she was told, her two friends were then with him: But Brandon so civilly and pressingly conjur'd her not to deprive him of the blessing of her company, because he was deny'd the happiness of theirs, that she blush'd, and obey'd. He thought this was a fit opportunity to learn from her, what Izabella had still deny'd him, and therefore earnestly beg'd her, to know who the Gentleman was, that in her friends distress, had so criminally abandon'd her . Utresia , who found by the manner of his asking the question, how much he was concern'd in it; assur'd him, She was not a little troubled, that her friends Injunctions had tyed her therein to Silence . But she added maliciously and smilingly, I am mistaken, if I guess not at the cause of your inquiry; and therefore all I can do towards satisfying you, is, that 'tis a person whom Izabella loves so entirely, as I believe you would repeat worse wounds than those you have, that she lov'd you as well . Brandon sigh'd and blush'd; and Utresia being thereby more peek'd, told him, I know not what temper the Beauties hearts are of in France and Germany, but if they are of the same as ours, 'tis an unhopeful attempt, to remove a Lover who has once gotten the possession; and whatever your success may have been in those foreign Countries, let me advise you to take care, how you embark your self in a Passion, for Izabella, who I doubt you will find is as constant, as fair . At the close of this warning, Izabella and Maria having ended their Walk, came to visit our Gallant; and Utresia perceiving they were surpriz'd, to find her alone with him, told them in some confusion how it had happen'd. Their entertainment that evening was of Love; and Utresia being of a gay humour, began to inveigh against the Formality of making it in Spain and Italy , and the dulness of it in Germany . Maria , to keep up the discourse, made a satyrical one, against the Levity of the French Courtship, alledging. That Love, which is one of the most intent Acts of the Soul, was, by their airy humor, turned into ridiculousness . This Contest was hardly begun, when one of the Pages came to acquaint Maria and Utresia , that Mr. Wilmore was come to wait on them. They were loth to leave Brandon , and it had been uncivil not to entertain Wilmore; Utresia therefore asked Brandon, If he would allow them to receive the Visit in his Chamber: And added, To incline you to it, I believe his conversation will divert you; for he has been bred in France, and makes it part of his business to introduce their Modes (especially in Love) amongst us, and I fear I shall need his help, to maintain my Argument against my sister . Brandon having assur'd them , That though the Stranger should be the very worst company in the World, yet he had much rather admit of his, than be depriv'd of the honour of theirs. Wilmore was call'd in, and when he had paid his Civilities to all the Company, Utresia engaged him to be her second against Maria , a Province which he willingly accepted; and then began so ingeniously to Raill e those who were constant in Love, without the speedy hopes of a return, making thereby an Amour a solemn business, when the nature of it is pleasant and gay, that he set all the Company a laughing: But Maria , who to continue her assum'd gravity and discretion, said with much seriousness, That it was in Love, as in War, where a General should be cautious how he undertook a Siege; but being engaged in one, he ought to dye, or carry the place . Then turning to Wilmore , she told him, Do you think, Sir, had you beleaguer'd a Fortress, you would sufficiently Apologize for raising your Siege, by saying, the Conquest was not worth the Pain; and you thought the Fort pregnable, but finding it was not, you would attack another that was . Pardon me, Madam, Wilmore reply'd , if I think you mistake the Case; for I never said I was for a Siege in Love: That is the dull method of those Countries whose Discipline in Amours I abominate, I am for the French Mode, where the first day I either conquer my Mistriss, or my Passion. Alexander the Great , lost more time in besieging Tyre , than he employ'd to conquer India . I instance this one example in War, because you made Love a parallel to it; by which, Madam, you may find, That the greatest Generals, as the wisest Lovers, should be storming, and not besieging, what they would take. If this rational method were pursued, Women would be too wise to expect long approaches, and Men not such Fools as to make them. Nor indeed did I ever see any Woman (I mean in France ) cry up Constancy, but she was decaying; for when any thing but Love is to maintain Love, 'tis a proof Beauty cannot do it, and then alas nothing else can. A young Gentleman who was my Fellow Traveller, undertook to besiege a Ladies heart at Monpellier , in meer melancholy wilfulness, because he knew she had given it to another; I left him in that English Rode, and while he was not gaining that Mistriss, I had won and lost twenty: But at last he grew wiser, and then happier. Utresia being pleased at this Story, it netled Maria the more, who said, She had heard of a General, who because he would alwayes storm, and not besiege places, had never taken any; Experience also teaches us, that Fortresses which can soon be taken, will soon be lost. And, Madam , said Wilmore, Experience likewise teaches us, that some Fortresses cost more to take, than they are worth when taken. I who Court Beauties by dozens at once, play a hopefuller Game, than he who only Courts one all his life: he may think he has good luck, if he takes that one; but I am sure I have ill luck, if I take not many; nor did I ever fear that she would be an unconstant Mistriss, after she has been kind: for if she should be, it ought to be more her trouble, than mine . The noise which was made in the Court, at the coming into it, of a Chariot, and some Horsemen, made Izabella , who seem'd least concerned in the dispute, look out at the Window, she knew it to be her Fathers, and one of the Gentlemen coming up, presented her a Letter, which when she had read, she gave it to Utresia and Maria , and then acquainted Brandon with the Contents of it, which were, That her Father being the next morning early to go into Somersetshire ( his Uncle being dangerously sick) she was to come away immediately to him, to receive his orders, during his absence . Izabella obey'd, but exprest more sorrow for losing so much good Company, than for her great Uncles danger; and having with much kindness and concernment recommended Brandon's Cure to Utresia and Maria , (which their growing Passion for him, made a work of Supererogation) making also excuses to him, That her Duty to her Father, drew her from her actual care of him, she took her leave ; but left Brandon more wounded by her Absence, than by the Stag. Utresia and Maria waited on Izabella to her Chariot, and by many embraces in it, seem'd desirous never to leave her; yet the tears at their separation, were the effects of their contentment, for they knew how powerful a Rival was remov'd; and their hopes were greater to win Brandon from each other, than to gain him from her; which evidences Friendship yields to Love, and Sincerity to Dissembling, when once we are throughly engaged in that Passion. While Brandon is recovering of his wounds, and those two Ladies were contriving the most promising wayes to make him sensible of theirs, Izabella came to her Fathers, and found with him a Gentleman newly returned from his Travels, whose name was Goodman ; he was young, rich, and had learn'd rather the empty and vicious Modes of Foreign Countries, than the solid benefit which Voyaging well improved, might have taught him, a fault too common in our young Nobless. As soon as he saw Izabella , he [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF237BA&area=prose&forward=textsFT) startled, and made a great cry, to celebrate his admiration at her beauty; and in short (for Love which terminates in Marriage, is not of the essentials of my History) he fell so desperately in Love with her, that being of an ancient Family, wealthy, and at his own dispose, and my Lord --- being not over-able to give his Daughter a Portion sutable to her Birth; together with Goodman's declaring, 'Twas Felicity sufficient to have such a Wife ; the journey to the dying Uncle was put off, and in three dayes, our amorous young Traveller married Izabella: But with so much melancholy in her Face and Heart, as those few which were present at the Nuptials, too visibly saw she sacrific'd her Happiness, to her Duty; for her Father would admit of no excuses, much less of a denial. Goodman finding himself in possession of so much beauty, minded not so much the title he had to it, as he did the enjoyment of it. While our Henry was thus eternally deprived of what some squeemish Lovers are fondest of, he was so happy as to be ignorant of his misfortune, and was with Howard in the Lodge, hourly consulting how to obtain, what actually he had lost; but he had made a Confident of his Rival: for our young Norfolk , was shot as deeply as his Prince; and was as intently concerned to Cure his own wound, as his Monarch to Cure his. Yet he had the Art to disguise his own condition, and to appear so warmly concern'd for his Masters, as it planted him in a higher station in his favor. He knew the best and shortest Expedient to be well with a young and amorous Prince, was to be trusted and employ'd in his Amours; and he more than hoped, being likely to become a Love Ambassador, with the greater facility to effect his own design, while he seemingly appear'd for his Kings. The news of this hasty Wedding, was the day of it brought to Charleton , and was variously entertain'd by the three chief persons there; Brandon at the receiving it, fell back into a Fever; and Utresia and Maria had like to have been assaulted with the same distemper, but from a different motive; joy and grief, though most opposite passions of the Soul, often producing the like effects. But Brandon , who from a deep sorrow for the death of one Mistriss, was fallen passionately in Love with another, recollecting his thoughts, and summoning all his reason to his assistance, inquired diligently what kind of person Izabella's new Husband was; and being assured, He ow'd his success intirely to his Estate, and Izabella's Obedience to her Fathers positive and stern Commands ; he soon recover'd of his Relapses, concluding, That she who would make herself miserable to please a Parent, would be brought to recompence her self, the latter being the more natural Action . Nor could he forget the Caresses he saw her bestow on her Gallant in the Forest, whose Name it was impossible for him to learn, from whence he judg'd her Constancy was not as great as her Beauty; and that meerly her Duty to her Father having made her marry another, she would satisfie herself, after she had pleas'd him. Brandon also was not so much a stranger to his own merit, as to despair that she who could be anothers besides her Husbands, might be prevail'd with to love a third; for in such cases, the appetite increases with the eating. While he fed his Hopes with this Diet, he mended so visibly, as his two Lovers concluded, his resentments had presented him with his Cure; whereby believing the Fortress was without a Garison, they had the firmer thoughts (but each of them a part) they might become the Possessor of it. I will leave them awhile on their Designs, and return to the Lodge, where our Henry , by the bruise of his Fall, and the emotions of his first Amours, (which are commonly the most ardent) was so much indispos'd, as he stir'd not out for four or five dayes, during which, Howard's servant went to Charleton on the Scout; his first intelligence of importance, was, that Izabella was hastily recalled to London by her Father: which was unwelcome to our Monarch, who expected better opportunities (all the circumstances consider'd) to make his Court to her in the Countrey, than in the City: yet he hoped as she went away on a sudden, her return would be the like; and he promised himself, that by the time she came back, his indisposition would cease, and he might renew his Addresses with more confidence of success. But on the Intelligencers second return, learning she was married, the certain News thereof was brought to Charleton , amazement and trouble was such, as had Howard been ignorant till then of his Passion, he could have been so no longer. After half an hours silence and consternation, the King instantly took Horse, Gallop'd to the Banks-side by the dusk of the evening, where taking Boat, he crost over to Baynards Castle, stealing into his own Apartment, attended onely by our young Norfolk , whom with all the warmth and concernment of a young and first Lover, he in that moment employ'd him to my Lord --- House, giving him so many and such minute instructions, as are too long to be repeated, and could only be dictated by a passionate Lover: But by them his Confident was convinced he had a hard Province, for he must either be false to himself, or to his Prince; he was very unwilling to be the latter, but more to be the former. Howard being dispatch'd on that Embassy, and our Monarch having re-assum'd his Purple, admitted a few of his greatest Counsellors to see him; who believing he had for the last six dayes dedicated himself to his Grief, began with all the Formalities of State and Devotion, To beg him at least to mitigate his entertaining it in such excess, lest it might be destructive to his own Health, and consequently to his Kingdoms . Our Henry in his Heart smil'd at the Gravity and Seasonableness of their Harangues; and at length seem'd to be so much conquer'd by their Intreaties and Reasonings, as he declar'd, That from thenceforth, he would give every day two hours to their Addresses on the Publick Affairs; but the rest of the day he would employ both in the duty of his sorrow, and to conquer the fiercest effects of it . These grave Ministers fail'd not to acquaint the rest of the Court, how excellent a Prince they had, in whose Grief for the Dead, they might be convinc'd what his Care would be of the Living. Nor did they omit by Inference, to make their Auditors sensible how powerful their own Oratory was, which could so soon begin to vanquish an affliction, that without it, might have prov'd unconquerable. The new Queen, when her Father-in-law dyed, was by accident at Windsor , where she resolv'd to continue, till the Royal Solemnities of his Funeral were perform'd, whereby our Henry had the greater liberty: However, frequent Expresses were employ'd between them, to console each other; in which charitable offices, 'tis thought they were not long unsuccessful, since no mourning seems more capable of comfort, than his, which proceeds from wearing a Crown. In the mean time Howard was not idle, for having a Servant who waited on him in his Chamber, called Jeremy , whom he had found by Experiment, had a Genius for all Intrigues, especially amorous ones, he took him apart, and began to consult with him, how to get a Correspondent in my Lord --- House. Jeremy told him, You need, Sir, go no farther; for I liv'd a year in it, and had been deprived of the honour of your service, had I not been dismist thence, by the morosity of the Steward, who suspected (as the old are usually jealous of the young) I had been a little too familiar with Leticia, who was a kind of Governess to Izabella, and who still retains the greatest Ascendent over her . Our young Norfolk ravish'd to have met with such an Agitator, went with him hastily to an old Servants House of his own, which by fortune was next door to Izabella's ; and from thence employ'd Jeremy into my Lord --- House, with strict orders, to inform him of all things whatever, both how the Marriage was made, and how affairs went ever since, or were likely to proceed; and if he could, to get Leticia to come where he then was, which she might do without the least offence to her modesty, the House being a private one, and of good repute. But if he could not prevail with her to come, then that he should discover how the young Couple relish'd one another, and if possibly to engender some disgusts between them; for which service, both he and Leticia should be most prodigally rewarded. Jeremy , who was sollicitous to live well in the wide World, especially by the duty of his calling, for such he iudged the serving of his Master was in any thing; bestir'd himself so vigorously, as in less than half an hour, he usher'd Leticia to his Lord, whom he left alone with her in a Parlor, being too well educated, to listen to his Masters secrets. Leticia , who was no Novice, and had set up her Rest, to make a Fortune by being the sole Confident of the greatest beauty of England , married by constraint to one she despis'd, and who she thought deserved a Monarchs Bed, had Fate been as obliging to her, as Nature was shie to the height, at the beginning of the parley; Howard , who soon found that Gold was an Oratory, which she relish'd above that of Demosthenes , or Cicero , poured such a showre of it into her Lap, that from being stubborn as a Gantlet, she became pliant as a Glove. This golden Key, made Leticia unlock the secrets of the House, and upon promises of greater Rewards, if by her assistance he soon obtain'd the happiness of her Ladies esteem, she took her leave to go about it, as well intentioned for him as he could wish; and he as full of hopes, as the first day of such a Commerce could reasonably bestow on him. While all this was Transacting in the Strand , the King was entertaining his Ministers at Court, they retired just as Howard came thither; who having resolved to serve his Masters Love seemingly, but really his own, made so unwelcome a Narrative of Izabella's fondness, if not doating on her new Husband, which he had discover'd by her onely Confident, whom he had won with large Gifts, and larger Promises, that our Monarchs Passion being heightned, by the difficulties he found, resolved to overcome all Obstacles. And because he esteem'd it but a half Victory to conquer by the Title of King, he strictly commanded Howard , never to discover who he was, till he became successful; yet by him he sent Leticia such Presents to be his Sollicitress, under the name of Tudor , that had she overcome her Lady, as much as the Gifts did her, the King had been happy, and she rich. But though Howard presented her with his Kings Gifts, yet it was for himself; and she had with such celerity planted in her Ladies Heart, a Contempt for her Husband, that she was the apter to listen to her Confidents Elogies, in favor of our young Norfolk , who by a thousand little services and assiduities, insensibly gain'd an interest in Izabella's esteem, and soon after in her Affection; for no progress in nature is more expeditious, than from liking to loving. Howard who judg'd, notwithstanding these prosperous Advances, he should have a hard Chapter of it, unless he got the friendship of the Husband, as well as the affection of the Wife; set himself about it, and effected it with such success, as he was scarce more impatient, when he was out of Izabella's company, than Goodman was, while out of his; whereby had he been jealous of Howard , even that Passion could not have render'd him more inseparable from Howard , than his friendship did; that which gave a beginning to this kindness, was by this accident. Goodman one evening returning from the Theatre with Izabella , was unexpectedly assaulted by a Hectoring Crew in the streets, and being pull'd out of his Coach by them, had suffer'd at their hands what they had pleas'd. By chance Howard returning also from the Play, his Chariot followed Goodmans ; and hearing his Mistriss shreek, look'd hastily to find what might be the cause of it; and seeing those Ruffians begin to Bastonado Goodman , he leap'd out of his Chariot, drew his Sword, and followed by his Pages and Footmen, soon rescued his Friend, by wounding and putting to flight his Assaulters. Goodman , who never was guilty of any one act of courage, but that of marrying Izabella , was so sensible of this deliverance, and so taken with the generosity and valor of his Deliverer, as from thenceforth he dedicated that life to him, which he confest he had preserv'd. Howard , pretending an apprehension that they might attack him again, became his Convoy, and went home in the Chariot with Izabella and him; but she paid him so many thanks for what he had done for her Husband, as he began to fear she approv'd it. As soon as they were got home, Goodman was advised immediately to be let Blood, and withdrew to do it; and Norfolk , in that juncture, made his approaches so successfully, both by the Preparatory, and present assistances of Leticia , as some, from that hour, believe he possest his Mistresses Heart; who not having had her Education in a Court, or so much as ever frequented one, though she contemn'd her Husband, and lov'd her Gallant, yet she much scrupled to act any thing which might evidence the truth of either: so innocent, yet sensible is Nature, till Art and Example has depraved it. Goodman , who from a Countrey education in England , and an Academical one at Saumur , had leap'd into the Licentiousness of London , and by his Fathers death into a plentiful Fortune, soon thought he should pass for a man that smelt of the Village, unless he was in the first File of the debauched, and therefore so assiduously addicted himself to such Company, as he soon Commenced Doctor of those Liberal Sciences. This false step was not forgiven him by Leticia , nor soon after, through her instigation, by Izabella , who inclining to revenge it to the height, was persuaded by her Confident, nothing could merit that Appellation, but being as kind to Howard , as Goodman was to many others. The Hate she had to her Husband, and the Esteem, if not Passion she had for our young Norfolk , made him, as they say, sooner successful, than otherwise he would have been. But when once he had obtained her last Favors, she abandon'd herself so intirely to the dictates of her Passion, as she repented she had so long deny'd herself the pleasures she then enjoy'd. But Howard , who found it less difficult to gain her Love, than to disguise his success from his King, did every day by new inventions endeavor to wean him from a Passion, in which he prophesied he would be unsuccessful. Sometimes he would at once condemn and admire the Rigidity of her Virtue; and at other times, the vigilance of her Husband, who by himself, or incorruptible Spies, was never absent from her; and then would tell his King, Though he acknowledg'd she was charming handsom, yet if Beauty were only what he would enjoy, in case he would make use of his zeal and industry in the duty of his service, he durst undertake in a few dayes to bring into his Embraces as captivating a person as Izabella. But our Henry , who had Idea's of Izabella too pleasing to be remov'd, or peeked with the glory of succeeding in his first Amour, or with the difficulties he found in it, resolv'd unmoveably to persevere in his design; and therefore ordered Howard to pursue it to the utmost. Yet believing it difficult, if not impossible, to vanquish so obstinate a Soul, as he judged Izabella's to be, by the report of Howard , unless he discovered he was her King; and having positively declar'd to him, He scorn'd to owe his Victory in Love, to his Title: ashamed to descend from his first height, he called into his Cabinet a young Gentleman named Denny , who he esteem'd and trusted; and there disclosing to him his Passion for Izabella , employ'd him in it, allowing him to discover, 'twas her King was her Servant. Denny , who knew how much his future hopes depended on his present success, gave himself up absolutely to the management of it; and being supply'd unlimitedly with Money and Jewels, he quickly learn'd the influence Leticia had over her Lady, and won the Confident, to betray the Mistriss; for whatever is to be sold in such Markets, he who bids the highest, is certain to be the Buyer. Leticia had so well improv'd her Fortune in the first Voyage, that she had readily embarked in any second, but greedily became the Factress for a King, who if he did reward her in proportion, to what his Subject had done, she knew she might ever after live at ease with her Jeremy , which was then the utmost of her Ambition; but as our desires commonly grow with our hopes, she became afterwards the Catholick Ambassadress of our Henry's future Amours. One may easily believe, though Denny had gain'd her to his interest, yet her own made her keep from his knowledge the secret, of her Lady with Howard , both that the gaining of Izabella might seem the harder, and the reward of it be the larger. She also was loth to lose our young Norfolk's frequent Presents, which were considerable, as being at a Kings expence, and distributed by a prosperous Lover; and she would often also mind herself, that Nature had not given her two Hands, to become rich but with one. To give her her due, she was more troubled with the fear, that Howard should find she did betray him, than she was to do it. Nor did Leticia find this so difficult an undertaking, as her first had been, since to seduce a chaste Wife, for a Subject, was a more hard task, than after she had made her flexible to the Duke, to make her become the like to his King. Towards the better effecting thereof, she artificially contrived opportunities for our Monarch to see her a walking; but those Rencounters were so short, as they added to his passion: for she never appear'd where he might long gaze on her, and alwayes drest to the highest advantage. But our Prince, the more he beheld her Charms, the more impatient he was to possess them; and therefore by Denny , incessantly prest Leticia . The name of being a Mistress (and the first) to a brave and young Monarch; the safety, as well as benefit of such a Lover; the felicity of a change from a lower Gallant to the highest, were so constantly the Matinades and Vespers, of the Confident, to her Lady, as Howard seem'd at last, to have no Title but possession; which though it be much in War, yet is little in Love, where the whole tenure is at will and pleasure; whereby the way was so well smoothed for our Henry , as the greatest difficulty was to find a fit opportunity, that what had been concluded upon by Mediators, might be ratifi'd by the Principals. Leticia , at length, lighted on this Expedient; Goodman's Birth-day being near, she persuaded her Lady to Celebrate it, by a Feast, a Ball, and at night a Masquerade: The King and Denny , were to be of the latter; who being about one stature, and dressed exactly alike, the one could not be known from the other; they were never to appear at once: so that having Vizards, and other disguises, if one were in the Dance, it was impossible to know which of them he was. The King, impatient to gaze on that Beauty he was so soon to possess, danced awhile among the Masqueraders, while Denny stood in a retir'd place, where the Butlers furnisht, those of them with Wine who were thirsty with the Exercise. He was cover'd with a long stuff Cloak, which was the false Scabberd to his dancing Cloaths, which he was to cast upon the King, when he himself was to thrust into the Masquerade. Leticia had agreed, when the King (who passed for one of the ordinary Masqueraders) should step aside, pretending to drink, Denny should cast on him his Cloak, and leap into his place of the Dance to supply it; which was to be the signal for her, to conduct our Henry so muffled to her own Chamber, and thence to Izabella's , which join'd unto it; and on her return from carrying the King to the field of the Duel, Izabella should counterfeit a fainting Fit, and by her, and Leticia's Maid, should be carried as in a Swoon, to her own Chamber. Our Monarch having therefore awhile danced, the sooner to view his Conqueress, and fancying he might more solidly please himself with the felicities to follow, suddenly leap'd to the retired place where Denny stood, who immediately casting his long Cloak on the King, jumpt himself in among the Dancers, and our Henry , by the ready guidance of Leticia , was brought by a Back-stairs into her Chamber, and from thence into her Ladies, where all the preparatives for his reception, were most tempting and magnificent. She left our Monarch there in all the Heats of a longing Lover, and went to Present him with what she more than imagin'd would cure him of that Fever. When Leticia came again into the room of the Ball, which was her signal to her Lady, she was then by accident talking with our young Norfolk , but she had no sooner cast her eyes on her Confident, then covering her Face, and fetching a deep sigh, she sunk into Howard's arms. Leticia , in an instant, flew to her, called aloud for her own Maid, to help to carry her up to Bed, there to give her some air and rest, which she said she had found in like cases, would in an hour or two restore her. But the Maid not being able to come suddenly enough, by reason of the croud and disorder at this accident, Howard , who believ'd all this Farce to be Tragedy, and having heard what Leticia had said, snatch'd up Izabella in his arms, and carry'd her up so hastily to her own Chamber, that he had almost entred it, before Leticia could overtake him; for the croud cleft itself to make him way to carry off the pretended Fainter, and as soon as he was past, closed again: so as before she could make her way, he was gotten up the stairs, and had certainly gotten into the Chamber; had not Leticia's repeated cryes, of, Hold, Hold , stop'd him, to ask her what occasion'd them: she being fled up, bid him instantly set Izabella down, or he would kill her; for the celerity of his motion, had taken away her breath, which had once before hapned to her in the like extremity; and then by rubbing her face, so cover'd it, as our young Norfolk could not see it; for if he had, it would have discover'd the fallacy: since Izabella so blush'd, at what she was going to do, and so laugh'd in her heart, that chance had like to have made use of one of her Lovers, to be the Adjutant for the other, as if Howard had seen her face, he must have admir'd that a fainting person should have so much vermilion in her cheeks, and mirth in her looks. While the Confident was thus opportunely serving her Lady, and pressing Howard to retire, the Maid being then come to ease him of his office, (for sooner she could not get to them, out of the throng) the King was not without his alarms; he had heard one hastily coming up the stairs, whose tread he knew could not be his Mistresses, and the reiterated cryes, of, Hold, Hold , which he knew were made by Leticia , both which made him believe he was betray'd by design, or some unhappy accident had discover'd him to Goodman and his Companions; he therefore within the Chamber door, drew his Sword, and having that in his Hand, he thought he was abler to give fear, than to receive any impressions of it, but those of being then disappointed of his promised felicity. But, on a sudden, the Vacarme ceased, Howard retired, and Leticia having adjusted the fair Izabella's Hair and Cloaths, lead her cover'd with blushes, where our impatient Monarch expected her. The Maid was order'd out of the Anti-chamber, and Leticia having deliver'd the panting Prey into the Royal Hunters hands, with great modesty and discretion, retir'd into her own Chamber, saying, That so lovely a Subject could not be safelier left, than under the protection of her own King . Let us imitate Leticia's discretion, and not intrude into a Monarchs secrets. But while he and Izabella were doing whatever it was, Leticia , who had engaged some jovial Companions, to entertain Goodman in the Cellar, while the Company was dancing, out of a reasonable apprehension the Assembly might resent their being left without the Master or the Lady of the House, and so abruptly break up, went down for a moment to see that nothing was wanting, and to assure them Izabella began to recover out of her distemper, and had commanded her to pay them all those respects and services, which it had hinder'd her from presenting them. Howard afflicted to the last degree, at his Mistresses indisposition, was retired out of the Dance, and longing to be satisfied from her own mouth, of what her Confident had assured the company, stole out of it, and being perfectly acquainted with all the passages of the House, went up the Back- stairs to Leticia's Chamber, which join'd to Izabella's , and gently opening the door, went softly towards her Bed, the Curtains whereof were shut on that side. Our Monarch, who heard one treading warily in the Chamber, concluded it could be no other but Leticia ; and he being then out of Function, but ravish'd with those delights which had necessitated him to that Cessation, and having a lively sense of Gratitude for her who had been the chief Agent of his felicity, said, Come, come , Leticia, and receive a promise from thy King, of making thee happy in the effects of his favor, as thou hast made him, by those of thy care; the fair Izabella shall be the witness of this inviolable promise, and this Ring (taking a great Diamond from his finger) shall be an earnest of the performance . Howard , who too well knew the voice, and too clearly heard the words, remain'd astonish'd and trembling, as if he had met his Mothers Ghost. But the King, who admir'd Leticia , came not to receive the offer'd security of his favor, open'd hastily the Curtains, and with amazement saw his mistake. This Action of our Monarchs, recover'd Howard in part out of his consternation, at least as much as a Man could be, who saw his Mistress false, and in the embraces of a Rival, on whom he durst not discharge his resentments and fury. Izabella , at the sight of Howard , shreek'd; and the King attributing it to her despair, at having such a witness to her kindness, leapt off the Bed in fury, and had in that instant, given his Favourite some fatal proofs of it, had not Izabella seasonably interpos'd, and had not Leticia also, who was newly return'd into her own Chamber, hearing from thence the shreek of her Lady, which she was not so ignorant as to imagine, was the Product of a Rape on her Chastity, come also into the Room hastily, where a while she stood amazed to find Howard with the King and Izabella ; he with his Sword drawn, and she restraining the hand which held it: but her astonishment ceasing, she became her Ladies Assistant in so charitable an office. Howard having recovered his wits, resolved to put this misadventure into the least ill fold which he could, therefore lifting up his Eyes and Hands, and stepping two or three paces back, sigh'd, and said, Have I, Sir, in one moment so lost your favour; that because fortune has brought me to see your happiness, I must therefore be deprived of my own: Alas, Sir, if this be your resolution, be pleas'd to mitigate so much cruelty, by one act of mercy; and if you will take away your favour, take away a life, which can last but by it. Yet, Sir, vouchsafe to know my Crime, is occasioned by my Duty; for not being ignorant of your Passion for the fair Izabella, I was ambitious to bring you early and true assurances, that her danger was vanish'd: for I knew when you heard of the one, unless the other accompanied it, it would be fatal to you. But now I find the danger of her death is metamorphos'd into an Intrigue of Love, I will presume to hope, since my intention to serve you, produc'd my sin, your generosity will excuse an effect, of which that only is the cause . These words spoken with a melancholy which was visibly real and great, (not for his fault, but for his Mistresses) together with her intercessions and Leticia's , so conquer'd our Henry , as at length to evidence he was appeas'd, Howard was made the Coufident in that Love, wherein he had been at first the principal; the justice of Destiny punishing his unfaithfulness to his King, by making an evidence of his favour his torment, and yet obliging him to be seemingly thankful for it. While these Disorders were thus pacifying, and while they were advising on new Expedients, to give our Monarch other charming appointments, (in which Cabal, one may think our young Norfolk , (without offending him) was but a sorry Counsellor) Fortune, who usually delights to favor those whom she has begun to oblige, presented them with an Accident, much better than all their united and best inventions could have contrived. Many Flambeaux being in the Rooms and Cellars, where the Dancers and Drinkers entertain'd themselves, the House by the negligence, or drunkenness of some which held them, took fire, on a sudden, in two places; and the flame so greedily devour'd all that fed it, as it was impossible for the King, Izabella, Howard , and Leticia , to fly out of it, either by the Great, or Back-stairs. Denny , who knew his Princes danger, leap'd out of the lower Window of the Room in which they were dancing, and running into the street, by the gift of a handful of Gold, got a Ladder clapt up to the Window of our Lovers, and running it up nimbly, freed them from a ruine, which till then they thought inevitable. Our Monarch more concern'd for his Mistriss, than himself, tore down the lights of it; in which Howard was also very active, and making a large passage, that she might the less uneasily get out, she first, then our King, and then Howard, Leticia and Denny , got all safely down; at the Backside of the House, the Confident bringing with her in a small Casket, all her Ladies, and her own Jewels. Leticia , no longer terrified at the danger, took the King aside, and advised him in the confusion which all the company and the street was in, to convey his Mistriss to his own Apartment; and while the World believ'd she perish'd in the Flames, possess'd her undisturbedly in those of Love. Our Henry in Raptures listen'd unto, and observed this counsel, and immediately lead Izabella , to the Thames side, from whence they undiscover'd got to Baynards Castle, where in the most unfrequented quarter of it, she and Leticia were joyfully lodged. But what seem'd the most extravagant in all these Adventures, was, that our Henry , as a fresh and greater evidence of his being reconciled to our young Norfolk , intrusted Izabella to his care, for his Lodgings were next to hers; and our King believing he was fitter for that trust, who had seen her in his Arms, than Denny who but thought it, sacrific'd so much to Izabella's modesty, as to let him who alone knew her kindness, be the only Confident of it. Howard admired at the fantasticalness of his Destiny; and seeing Infidelity to his King, though but in an amorous affair, thus exemplarily persecuted, firmly resolved, by his future Services, to repair his past Crimes; and so signally ever after served his King in his most celebrated Actions and Conquests, that nothing has more Tarnish'd the lustre of that great Monarchs Reign, than his severity (to give it the softest name) to that illustrious Subject, and his great Son the Earl of Surrey ; which some attributed to his having discover'd in process of time, how Howard had deluded him in his first Amours. For the offences of a Subject against his King, are not to be estimated by what they are in their own nature, but by the Resentment he is pleas'd to print upon them; who, if he be of an humor to value a gallantry in Love, more than the Conquest of a Province; an injury in the first, is engraven in Brass, while a service in the last, is written but in Air. The End of the Second Part of English Adventures . Embraces he might find an effectual cure for the late loss of his Father; Goodman , and his deboist companions, had been buried in the ruines of his burnt House, had not some charitable Neighbours, by forcing a passage through the wall of their own Cellar, drag'd them out of his; when drowning and burning seem'd equally to contend, which soonest should act their destinies. After the fumes of his Wine were alay'd by sleep, he learn'd with some amazement and sorrow, that the fatal Fire, which had consum'd his House, had involv'd in the flames his Lady and Leticia , (for that was the general belief) he therefore put on deep mourning, but whether it were also the Livery of his Soul, I cannot determine; since though, when he was alone, he would weep for his loss, yet as often as he could, he would with his Camerades, endeavour to drown the remembrance of it. Izabella and Leticia , who went abroad to divert themselves, but very well disguised, met him in a Chariot so cover'd with black, as a more mortifying sight had hardly ever been seen. It gave them both not little cause of mirth; for it was a new thing indeed, for a Wife to see her Husband in mourning for her death. However they both commended the decency of the performance, but much more their own good fortune, which made them live to be the Witnesses of it. Howard , who so happily evaded the storm he had lately been in, and who justly fear'd in some of those soft moments, where Lovers keep nothing in reserve, Izabella might discover to our Henry , how false he had been to him in his attempts, though not how happy in his success; for that he easily believ'd, her interest would make her preserve a secret, employ'd his most recollected thoughts both how to oblige her from detecting him, and how to make the King tear her from his heart; since while she possest it, terrible apprehensions must possess him. And though he had assum'd too rational and firm Resolutions, never again to be her Lover, yet her abandoning him, though it were for his King, (for Love is so just, as not to respect persons) had fill'd his Soul with revenge, so near all worldly extremes are to one another. At last the result of his thoughts terminated in a double resolution, he courted her, by protesting, He so much valued her felicity above his own, as he more rejoyc'd she was now his Kings, than ever he had, that she had been his . And then by new Vows, solemnly engaged to use his highest industry, to maintain her in that station, to which her Merit more than her Fortune had rais'd her . And at the same time also he attempted his Prince, but obliquely, and in moments well chosen, by putting him in mind, That she had been chiefly, if not onely, conquer'd by his Title, and not by the charms of his Person; for 'twas by the Magick of the name of Monarch, that Denny had more operated in one day, than he had done in twenty, by being forbidden to make use of it . And then added , He could not be so unjust to himself, as to believe he was not as fit an Agent in such an Intrigue as Denny was; but his Competitor had been permitted to use a Spell, which had been absolutely prohibited to him. These Assaults at first, and during the warmth of our Henry's passion, made but light impressions; but when Satiety added its Forces to Howard's Attacks, they began by degrees to give deeper Prints, which yet he confin'd from his Favorites knowledge, and he hoped from so much as his suspitions; for our Henry would often tell him, Though he might grant he owed his possessing her to his Title, yet even That itself made his Tenure the firmer, since she might like whom she would; but if she would onely be kind to a King, she could be so but to him . Howard , though young, yet was a refin'd Courtier enough to discern, since his Master would not only allow his Mistress to be assaulted, but would also defend her by such arguings, the flame was diminish'd; for whatever Lover (especially one who is a Sovereign) does permit his Mistress to be touched, and does not punish the presumption of him who dares do it, does therein manifest a lessening of Love, which is of the nature of Tides, when they do not flow, they quickly ebb. However, though our young Norfolk was pleas'd with this inference, yet he knew well the advances he had made in this ticklish affair for his own security, would but the more hazard it, if they were not push'd to the end with celerity and success. He therefore added to those Attempts, in which he was his own immediate Agent, another contrivance, on the probability of which he more depended, than on his deluding Izabella by his vows and promises, or on his hopes of making his Prince to abandon her, on the Account that she loved not Tudar , but the King. For he had both to his satisfaction and his grief, experimented Izabella was amorous; and therefore as she had first forsaken her Husband for him, and afterwards him for the King, he did from thence conclude, That her Love would not be confin'd, and having now gratifi'd the height of her Ambition, by being Mistress to her Sovereign, she would also gratifie her inclinations, by being kind to one whom she should more like . Howard had a young Woman, whom he secretly entertained for his Divertisement, who was admirably handsom, and her Ingenuity was equal to her Beauty; her, he acquainted with his design, and having engaged her in it, he drest her in one of his Pages Liveries, and prefer'd her to the immediate service of Izabella , more than hopeful, that so lovely a youth, might not be unregarded by an amorous Lady. He spent daily many hours with this feigned Page, whom he call'd Horatio , to instruct him in the shortest, and likeliest methods, to make Izabella in Love with him; with express order when he had found her Passion so violent, as that she was impatient for the Cure, to acquaint him with it, and then to leave the rest to his conduct. Horatio , who perfectly lov'd his Lord, and violently hated Izabella , for having gain'd the greatest share in that Heart, which she had intirely possest; being dictated both by Affection and Revenge, proceeded on the Design, with the zeal and industry, which one whom those two Passions Animates is usually inspired with. Howard , doubtless, made a very fit choice; for whoever attempts a revenge, in which the Agents interest is not as well concern'd as the Principals, will be served but by halfs. Horatio acted his Part, with such Sagacity and Diligence, as in a few dayes, he saw Izabella was pleas'd with no Services but his; that she often cast on him languishing, yet burning looks: and one night, when she and Leticia were locked up in her Cabinet, and he attending in the outward Room, overheard the Confident tell the Lady, If she did not suddenly dismiss Horatio, she would ruine herself, since what was so visible to her, could not long be unseen by the King; for no eyes were so quick and penetrating as a Lovers, and a Monarchs . And to say the truth, it was hardly possible for a Lady capable of Love, not to pay hers to Horatio ; who had all the Graces of a Man, with the Beauties of a Woman. Leticia , who found all her Reasons and Prayers could not prevail with her Lady to discard Horatio , did from thence Prognosticate her ruine, and began to cast about for her own safety. She repented a thousand times, her having lodged Izabella in Baynards Castle; where our Henry having uninterrupted access to his Mistriss, the delight began to lessen; and it was then, that this Confident experimentally found, she had not cultivated those Amours to the best advantage: For Love is heightened by little difficulties, and hardships, and [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFF237BA&area=prose&forward=textsFT) sooner languisheth when it meets with none: since it turns it to a kind of natural Marriage, which is as little durable with Ardor, as most Artificial ones are. Though Horatio , by what he had seen and heard, was himself confident, that his Lady was his Captive, yet he was unwilling to give Howard assurances of it, till by Demonstration he might convince him. One morning while he was busying his thoughts to compass it, Izabella , as soon as she was drest, dismist Leticia , and her Servants, and going into her Cabinet, call'd Horatio thither; she told him, One of her Women had newly so commended his voice, as she was impatient till she heard it . He, immediately obey'd her; for he knew few, if any in the world, excell'd his: But the words he sung, were so amorous, and so rarely animated by him, as Izabella , in the transports of her Passion, kist him; and then blushing, said, There was Magick in that Song . But Horatio , to heighten her Appetite, retiring from her, with a sigh, Humbly beg'd to know what was his Crime, which made her thus design his death; for he must expect that punishment from his Lord , should he ever hear of this favour she had then honour'd him with . Izabella , in all the languishments of her kindness, reply'd, Ah Horatio, wert thou not too young to know all the Charms which attend victorious Love, thou wouldst more apprehend the loss of them, than of thy life . This Izabella spoke in so moving and tender an Assent, as Horatio seem'd touched to the Heart, and therefore folding his Arms within each other, and fetching a deep groan, he fixed his eyes on hers so intently, as if he would never have remov'd them. Izabella's flames being rais'd to the last degree, by these Actions, told him, with all the softnesses of yielding Love, Alas Horatio, do not I venture more than you in the discovery; I shall lose not only my life, but what is of much more value, the unrival'd kindness of my King, while you hazard you know not what; but by not adventuring, you certainly lose the opportunity of making your life happy and considerable: For I who ingross a Monarchs Love, can make him heap on you, all those other contentments, which I cannot present you . But , said Izabella , interrupting herself, Why do I in the Cause of Love, mention any thing but Love? And he who needs being Courted to accept of mine, is but too unworthy of it . But yet Horatio , let not the apprehension of danger deter you; for if your flame equals mine, I can contrive, at once, your happiness, and your security: for the King of late, but rarely, stayes with me all the night. Madam, Horatio reply'd , yet should he visit you any of those nights you destine to my felicity--- Never apprehend it, said Izabella hastily , I need but let him know I am indispos'd, and therefore would take some rest; and he is grown too respectful to deny it me. Then, Madam, said Horatio, making his Approaches to her, with all the humility of a conquer'd Lover , dispose absolutely of a Life, which is without reserve, intirely devoted to you; a Life which was my torment, till this auspicious moment; for I pin'd for that felicity, which your mercy has now bestow'd upon me: Yes, Madam, from the first moment I had the blessing to see you, I deplor'd my Fate, which had given to my King, what could onely make me happy; I resolv'd therefore to mourn away my Life, and the sooner and the more pleasingly to end it, I elected daily to gaze on those Beauties, which could onely present me that cure: for I could not so much as hope that you, who so deservedly possess a mighty Monarchs heart, could vouchsafe to think of conquering a Subjects. Oh Horatio, said Izabella, how little art thou vers'd in the mighty authority of Love; King and Subject, are but Names of Art, but Love is the character of Nature, and therefore is indelible. All our Sex are generally condemn'd to Ambition, but they are inspir'd with Love; I therefore sacrifice to both those Deities: the King has the oblations, extorted to the first; but 'tis Horatio has those, which I willingly pay to the last. The disguis'd Page, seemingly ravish'd with these charming expressions, fell on his knees, as some evidence of it; and having embraced hers, and kist her feet, sealed the Contract, which Izabella hasten'd to conclude, seeing Leticia from the Window Landing at the Water stairs. They therefore agreed that the ensuing Night should compleat their joyes; and having appointed the precise Hour, that Horatio should steal into her Chamber, Izabella undertook to order the Affair so, as by pretending a great Pain in her Head, she would early take leave of our Monarch, and be no more in the Evening interrupted with his Company. Izabella , by her fresh embraces and kisses, and by a Present of Jewels, gave him new earnest of her performance, then dismist him, and fell a reading a Romance, in which employment the deluded Leticia found her. Horatio the same moment ran to Howard , and informed him of his Victory; the Assignation, and all the particulars of both; who being transported, with the joy of it, went immediately to the King, whom he found alone in his Cabinet, and in whose sight he assumed so much melancholy, as our Henry both took notice of it, and prest him to tell the cause. Howard only sigh'd, and cast down his eyes. This Procedure augmented the Kings curiosity, and the stricter silence his Favorite kept, the more his Master urg'd him to break it. At length, seeming vanquisht by his reiterated commands, he told him, Sir, I owe all I have, and all I hope, to your Favor; and to merit that blessing, is what I ambition as much as to possess it: I have therefore had a fierce Conflict within my self, for I fear I am reduced to the miserable choice, of either continuing in your esteem by what will even in my own judgment render me unworthy of it, or to lose it, by what would give me some title to continue it: But since you so positively command me to speak, I have elected the latter; For 'tis more consonant to my duty, as well as inclination, to be ruin'd rather, than merit to be so . The King, at this Introduction, was startled; but impatient, to know what was the cause of it, he listen'd, without interrupting him. Howard having paus'd awhile, to make the Discovery appear the more natural and effectual too, thus continued: I believe, Sir, you may not have forgot how on several occasions I presum'd to disclose some apprehensions I had, that the fair Izabella , was more conquer'd by your Title, than by the Passion she ought to have paid you. I was not so unwise or rude, as to speak on so unwelcome a Subject, without some belief I had ground for it; since I knew nothing was more tender to a magnanimous Prince, than not to have a perfect return of Love from her, whom he had honour'd with his. But withall I was not ignorant, nothing could be more sensible to a good Subject, especially to one whom his King had blest with the highest characters of his Favor, than to see him, pardon the expression, Sir, prostitute his affection to a Mistriss, who received not the happiness with all the impressions of joy, gratitude and sincerity, which her Soul was capable of. I must therefore now by hazarding your Favour, Sir, which is much more considerable to me than Life, acquaint you, my fears were not without reason. I made them my Torment, by confining them to my Breast, till I could make the cause of them as visible to you, as their effects were sensible to me. Our Monarch here, interrupted his Favourite, by saying , Take heed, Howard , what you do; if you proceed no farther, I will attempt to persuade my self to pardon all you have spoke, by attributing it to your zeal for my service, which may incline you to act, though mistakenly, as you have done. But if you persevere after this Caution and Forgiveness, you necessitate me either to ruine my Mistriss, or you: And nothing less than a Demonstration she is false, can make me believe it. Howard unmov'd, (which the King too sensibly observ'd) reply'd: I know my danger is great, but, Sir, my duty is greater; yet I cannot say positively, your Majesty shall by a Demonstration be convinced she is false; but you shall be satisfied she would be so, and that it is her trouble she cannot be so. The King, at this assurance, only nodded his Head, and commanded him to proceed. Howard then told his Prince, I shall now relate to you, Sir, a story, which I know will surprize you . But before I begin, will you be pleas'd to pardon me, if I presume to inquire whether Leticia , has not been so faithful as to disclose her apprehensions to you, that her Lady has, of late, too kindly gaz'd upon a Page I prefer'd to her, whose name is Horatio . The King answer'd, May be she has; but ask no more questions . I will then Sir, Howard said , solemnly protest, That whatever may have but the least shadow of a tendency, to disturb your quiet, I have curiously endeavor'd to prevent, or remove, and will do to the last moment of my life. Your Majesty having trusted me with the care of Izabella , and done me the honour to make me your Confident in that Amour, I dedicated my self so to discharge that Trust, as you should never repent the favour. And therefore I was much more vigilant over her, than had she been my own Mistriss. A while since, I entertain'd Horatio to be one of my Pages, and finding him very diligent, serviceable, and I believ'd faithful, I prefer'd him to wait on Izabella , both as the fittest I had, and to give me notice of all things, for you knew, Sir, my suspitions. I was in a few days, so far from doubting his services were not acceptable to her, as I began to doubt, they were so, but too much I was unwilling to admit of so mean a thought, and therefore thrust it from my heart with so much rudeness, as I hoped 'twould never dare to approach it again. But, Sir, I could not persuade my self against what I saw. For Izabella by stealth, even before me, would often cast such eyes on Horatio , as made me tremble to think they were the looks of Love; and when I would remove those fears, they appear'd too rational to be cast off. While my jealousies were young, I declin'd, Sir, troubling you with them. But the elder they grew, they became the stronger. I therefore determin'd, by one action, to confirm, or ruine them. To effect which, I pretended yesternight some business which might detain me this day many hours, and beg'd Izabella's pardon, if till the evening of it, I paid her not my duties. I went therefore early abroad, but returned privately at Noon, concealing my self in my Closet, till she had dined; for then I knew her Women usually left her alone, and therefore that would be the fittest time to make my discovery. I got unseen, by any, to her Chamber, but found it empty; yet hearing some discoursing in her Cabinet, and seeing the door unlock'd, I enter'd; there I found Izabella and Horatio ; she blush'd, and told me, She expected me not so soon. I reply'd, my business had been disappointed in part. She observed I was surprized to find a Page with her alone, and therefore told me with new blushings, She had been unkind to Horatio , to please herself; for one of her Women had so exceedingly commended his voice, while she was at her dinner, as longing to hear it, she had made him lose his own, to give her that satisfaction; and just as she was persuading him to sing, I had interrupted them. This smooth Relation, I seem'd to take for good payment, and therefore I chid him, for needing to be persuaded to obey his Lady. Horatio therefore immediately sung; but so charmingly, and the words being of the power of Love, he so animated them by his actions, as though your Mistriss, Sir, stood on her guard; yet I too clearly saw, what I so much dreaded; for never Love spoke so significantly in looks, as in hers, to him. The lively sense of your affront, transported me to that degree, as I durst stay no longer in the place; but begging Izabella's permission, to employ Horatio , for one hour, on a pressing business, I took him with me out of her Cabinet, into my own; where locking the door, I asked him with an accent which made him tremble, How he durst be alone in a Closet with his Lady? He reply'd , It was by her Commands, not by his seeking. I bid him, on your life, never again repeat that presumption. He answer'd , Then, Sir, I beseech you, take me out of her service; for while I am in it, 'tis both my duty to obey her, and your Commands that I should do it: and she is never without company, but she calls me alone into her Cabinet, where she is so kind to me--- Villain, I reply'd furiously , How kind? Alas, Sir, said Horatio , you ask in so much anger, as I dare not tell you. Tell me, I answer'd , drawing out my Punniard, or I'll kill thee. He immediately said (but shaking with fear) I will discover all, so you will promise me my Pardon. Discover, said I, to the least circumstance, or thou art dead; and when I have heard all, I will consider if thou art capable of mercy. Horatio then said, I think, Sir, she is in Love with me; for when we are alone, she has more than once embraced and kist me; and she has appointed me this night, at midnight, to steal to her Bed. Traytor, I reply'd , Dost thou not know she is thy Kings Mistriss? Wert thou my Brother, this shall be thy last hour? But because thou hast confest thy sin, I give thee a few moments to reconcile thy Soul to Heaven, and therefore lose them not in fruitless begging of forgiveness from me; for dye thou shalt. Horatio therefore immediately fell to his devotions, but every minute with floods of tears he look'd trembling after me, for I still kept my Punniard in my hand; and when I thought he had prayed long enough, I advanced to kill him. But, O God, Sir, how was I surprized, when opening his shirt, he discover'd to me the breasts of a Woman; but so white, and so firm, as could the fury I was in, have admitted Love, his tears had so softened my temper, that his eyes might have stamp'd it on my heart. How , said our Monarch, interrupting Howard , (for till then he had listned to him, but in all the agonies of offended Love) a Woman? What could be her design? And why was she so long revealing her Sex? That, Sir, said Howard , fill'd me with new wonder; and when I asked her the cause, she told me, her Uncle, to whose care her deceased Father had left her, fell in Love with her, and would have forced her kindness; which to avoid, she had fled from him disguis'd in mans apparel. And I well remember Sir, ( continued Howard ) how one day walking in a Field near the High-way, I saw him in it, and admiring his beauty, which was fitter for the Female Sex, than that she then personated; I stop'd him, and believing by his travelling on foot, he was necessitous, I asked him if he wanted a Service, and if he would be one of my Pages? He told me he would most willingly: I therefore entertained him, gave him my Livery, and prefer'd him to Izabella , who, it seems, being taken with his face, diligence, and voyce, and mistaking his Sex, bestowed on him her Love; by which he confest to me, he hoped so much to benefit himself, as before she could finally discover the fallacy, he might obtain gifts sufficient to maintain him for his life, and a young Gentleman, with whom she had exchanged her heart. This, Sir, is all I have to tell you, but that I keep Horatio lock'd up in my Closet, from whence he cannot escape, till I know the honour of your Commands concerning him, and what your pleasure is on all these discoveries. The King awhile walked in his Cabinet with looks, which too evidently discover'd the agitations of his mind; and then turning to Howard , embrac'd him, and with a sigh said, Thou hast done me at once the highest service and disservice imaginable; for thou hast told me that, which unknown, and unreveng'd, had rais'd her contempt of me; and known, has rais'd my Hate of her . Then pausing awhile, he continued , Oh Howard , how unjustly are Monarchs envied for their Power and Greatness, when the inconstancy of a Mistriss, out-braves both; and when even my Love to her, cannot fix hers to me, she forsakes the Embraces of her Captiv'd King, to Court those of an imagined and despicable Page. Ah why do we allow any of that Sex, to compose our Joyes, when they could hardly be eclips'd, but by their Infidelity. Howard , who found his Prince more sensible of the intended Affront, than he could well have hoped; chang'd his Battery, and casting away all those Reasons with which he had arm'd himself to provoke his Revenge, began seemingly to dissuade him from it, being not ignorant that whoever opposes his Princes Love, without proving the Mistresses crime, as certainly contributes to the heightning of it; as whoever pleads for the pardon of a Mistresses Inconstancy, renders her the more uncapable of obtaining it: For the Love, and Revenge of a Monarch, are so tender a part of his Prerogative, as he will only allow himself to be the Dispenser of their Effects. So that when Howard began to beg him to remember, She was not actually, but intentionally Criminal . Our Henry taking him up short, reply'd, She who has resolv'd to be False, is so . And when our young Norfolk added, That Izabella never lov'd any man, but her King . He answer'd, 'Tis more than she herself knows, and she believes the contrary . And lastly, when Howard desired him to consider, How Natural it was, for the Young to be Captivated by the Lovely . He briskly reply'd, 'Tis at least as Natural, and certainly more Just, for an injur'd King, to punish the Offender: To which he added, No, No, She that can Love any but her own Monarch after she has obtained his Heart, evidences nothing can fix hers . However, I will this Night, by a demonstration, convince my self, and her, of her Crime; Tear her from my Heart, and then--- There he stop'd, and commanded his Favorite so to order this business, as to put it past the reach of Fortune to miscarry. Howard assur'd him of his utmost care, and then said , Will you permit me, Sir, after you are convinced, of what you will make your own eyes, the Witnesses of, to beseech you to command me, before Izabella , to kill Horatio ; and I shall therein act my part so artificially, as she shall in an hour after, believe your Orders are obey'd. For since I find your Majesty has judged her offence merits to divorce her eternally from your thoughts; it will be no small addition, to her Grief, to believe, that in the same sin, which has lost her You, she has been the death of her Lover and herself. The King having approv'd of this Proposal, shut himself up in his Cabinet, so full of Fury, to have been deluded and betray'd by his first Mistriss, that he almost as impatiently long'd for the hour to revenge it, as she did to commit the Crime, which was to render that Revenge, a Justice. Howard also retired to Horatio , that with him, all the design, might be so cautiously laid, as it could not fail. A Design, in the execution whereof, depended both his Revenge, for losing his Mistresses Favor, and his security in possessing his Masters. While they two, were adjusting this important Plot, Leticia , who was confident of Izabella's ruine, by her continuing obstinate, in retaining Horatio , beg'd and obtain'd our Monarchs permission, to speak with him alone in a retired place, where usually she had Audience. She told him , That her endless Fidelity to his Service, had oblig'd her some dayes before to tell him her fears of Izabella's guilty inclinations, for the inchanting Horatio ; and having by his express Commands used all her Arts, Prayers and Tears, to procure her to expel him from her Service, but unsuccessfully, she too easily saw, for what end, he was still retain'd; she had therefore made a little Hole, through that part of her Chamber Wainscot, which separated it from her Ladies Closet; and had planted herself there with great secresie, from whence she had seen, more than once, the guilty looks she greedily cast on her new Lover; whereby she had concluded there wanted but a fit opportunity to act what they could not but have agreed upon: And having been told, by her own Woman, whom she had made her spy, and perfectly instructed in all the secrets of that Vocation, that this day Izabella and Horatio had been together in her Closet, she fully believ'd the Assignation was fixt to the ensuing night; since, Sir, she has employed me, to acquaint you, her Head is so indisposed, that should you design her then, the honour of your company, she must beg to be deprived of it, that by an uninterrupted Rest, she may be to morrow, the more fit to obey your pleasure. Our Monarch comparing this, with what Howard had newly told him, began to be but too certain of Izabella's Infidelity; and therefore having first exprest to Leticia his sense of her vigilance, and faithfulness, he contriv'd with her, how to surprize her Lady, in the crime. This Leticia undertook the conduct of, and was commanded to return to Izabella , with the Kings passionate Condolings, for her Indisposition, and full assurances, his Visits that Night, should not contribute to augment it, though by his not paying them, it would bring an accession to his own. Our Monarch being ready to be gone, Leticia , with all the insinuating Arts of a Woman of her Vocation, humbly besought him to vouchsafe her one moments Audience; which the King having granted, she told him, As my Fidelity has forced me to bring your Majesty unpleasing News of one Mistriss, so my Duty has made me sollicitous, to Present you with a Cure for that unhappiness. For, Sir, this morning I went to visit a Lady, whom I had the Honour to be acquainted with in the first bloomings of her Youth, and who then promis'd such Perfections, when she should come to her Seventeenth year, as I believed she onely would merit the Conquest of your Heart. What my Belief then suggested, my eyes this day, have had the blessing to behold. But, Sir, she is a Widow. But, Sir, she is also a Maid; for the very day she was married to Sir Gilbert Talboise , he was assaulted with a Fever, of which soon after he dyed. Fate reserving her Virginity, for him alone who is onely worthy of it. Her own Name was Blunt ; and as much as the Criminal Izabella , surpasses ordinary Beauties, so much my Lady Talboise , transcends hers. Were every Woman in the World, rob'd of that Grace, Feature, or Motion, which is most Captivating in her, and were all those borrowed Charms, by the Magick of Love, united, to make one Beauty accomplish'd and perfect, yet even that Mosaick-work Beauty would fall short of the Lovely Talboise . I have begun, Sir, to give her those impressions of your Majesty, which I think she will be as little able ever to part with, as you will be to part with her, when you have once had the felicity to see her. Leticia , without staying for the Kings further Inquiry, retir'd. But what she had spoke, was not unoperative on his mind; for it prepar'd him, with the less reluctance, to lose his first Mistriss, by the inchanting Idea's, she had given him of a second. While all these things were thus transacting against the amorous Izabella , she was entertaining herself with those Raptures which her Fancy promis'd, in the embraces of Horatio , and sometimes in exclaiming against the dull motion of the Sun, which added not wings to his course, when her Passion made her wish it. At last the long'd for hour of rest to others, and somewhat more valued than rest by Izabella , arrived; and because of her pretended indisposition, she went to Bed the earlier, appointing all her Attendants to retire, and make no noise. A thousand times by the light of a Flambeau which was not far from her Bed, she look'd on her Watch, to see when the lazy Hand would reach the figure of Twelve. While she was in that importune expectance, the King had convey'd himself into Leticia's Chamber, having first ordered Howard , neither to come into it, nor into Izabella's , but to keep within call, in case he needed his service. This our young Norfolk joyfully obey'd; for being now arrived near the moment of the Action, he began to tremble with the apprehension, that Izabella's fury and resentment, when she should be detected, if he appear'd an Agent in her shame, would urge her to discover his first Guilt, that she might involve him in her ruine. The King also having some reliques of respect for her he had so lately adored, esteemed it undecent, that any but Leticia should be the witness of her Ladies disgrace, and possibly in consequence of her own. Howard therefore stood in an obscure place, yet within hearing of his Princes voice, should he in the least raise it. And Leticia , who was intirely ignorant of Horatio's true Sex, had a faithful Centinel near his Chamber door, to advertise her, as soon as ever he opened it; that the King and she might arrive timely enough, to prevent the acting the evil, yet soon enough to discover the intended. In these several employments the time was consumed, till the great Clock of the Castle struck Twelve: immediately after, Horatio , in the dark, stole towards Izabella's Chamber, Leticia's Scout, ran with the News of it to her; and our Monarch and she went hastily the back-way to it, concluding the fore-way would be bar'd by Izabella's care, as soon as the supposed Gallant was gotten into it. Just as the King and Leticia , were got about the back-way to the Chamber door, Horatio was entred it, Izabella had bolted that passage, and in the last transports of her Passion, being only in an Aurora colour Sarcenet Night-gown, had almost stifled Horatio with her kisses and embraces; but as she was leading him to the Scene of all her fancied enjoyments, Leticia seized on Horatio , our Henry standing at the back- door, unseen by Izabella , but clearly seeing all she did. Horatio , who had been assured by his Lord, that onely the King and he would surprize them; for so it had been resolved, before Leticia was admitted into the Plot; neither did Howard know any thing to the contrary, till it was impossible for him to advertise his supposed Page of it: being therefore amazed and surprized to see himself thus taken by one, who was not of the design, and by seeing neither of those which he believed were onely privy to it, endeavoured to spring from Leticia ; who having gotten firm hold of his shirt, by his strugling to get loose, tore off that part of it which covered his breasts, whereby Izabella , who had alwayes her eyes on him, clearly discovered, he was not of that Sex, which till then she had believ'd. That surprizing sight struck her with more astonishment, than her being detected by Leticia , had filled her with fury and grief. But she had scarce time to make any reflections on that discovery, for Horatio being 'scaped at last, out of Leticia's hands, and retiring hastily by the backdoor, at which she had entered, was there seized by our Monarch; who leading him by the hand towards Izabella , with a face inflamed with anger and contempt, told her: I come, Madam, to bring you this Captive; and at the same time I Present you him, I declare I am no longer yours: What my eyes have seen, I must believe. No less an evidence I would allow, and no greater I could have. I know another Prince offended to the degree I am, would wash away your Crimes, in your Blood; and if I do it not, 'tis onely because I judge to let you live, will be a severer punishment. Yes, perfidious Izabella , you shall not only lose for ever the Love you are so unworthy of, but him also, for whose embraces, you have abandon'd mine. He shall suffer death for his offence, and you shall live confined, till Age or Melancholy presents you yours. Izabella , who had by the unexpected Accident which I have related, fortunately discovered Horatio's true Sex, (which while the King was thus speaking to her, she was fully confirm'd in, for he could not so cover his breasts with the hand that was free, but she saw a part of them) having her judgment clear and active, stepped suddenly back, and as one half amazed, replied: How, Sir, are these fit expressions for her to whom you first made the glorious Present of your Heart; and for whose sake she sacrificed all that ought to be most sacred in this World amongst Women. Ah, Sir, since you are now satiated with those enjoyments which a thousand times you vowed, were the highest you could aspire unto, perform on me, what you threaten against me; for after having lost the felicity which only made me relish Life, my best Cure will be to be deprived of it. You mean, said the King, interrupting her with indignation , the felicity of your Horatio's embraces, 'tis those alone, I find, makes you relish that Life, which because you shall be eternally deprived of them, you desire to lose. Then, Sir, said Izabella , I am miserable indeed, since you choose to think me capable of such guilt. But behold your Error, and my Innocence. At the end of these words, she forced with both her hands, Horatio from his breast, and then with a languishing, yet in a reproachful accent, she added, Judge, Sir, if for Her embraces, I would abandon those of my King . Our Monarch, at this, was strangely surprized; not at his seeing Horatio was a Woman, but at Izabella's knowing it. And Leticia was so confounded at the sight, that 'tis past my Art to describe it; so that she would not rest satisfied at the evidence thereof, which Izabella had exposed, but expeditiously tryed further experiments; which having intirely convinced her, she stood like a Statue. Her Lady, to improve this consternation, turning angerly to her late Confident, told her , Go, wretched Woman, and never dare again to Present your self before me; it was your idle jealousie of me, which made me resolve to divert my self, and perplex you, by seeming to be in Love with Horatio . I observed you had your Spies on me, and watched my very looks: But alas I little imagined this design for mirth, should discover your falshood to me, much less that you should by it, prevail with my King to suspect a Fidelity, which I had dedicated to his Love, and not to his Quality. But alas I find how much I was mistook; and that what I intended for an innocent delight, has eternally rendered me uncapable of any. And since, Sir, turning to the King , you have judged me Criminal, I shall punish my self, as if really I were so, by taking now my last leave of you; yet I shall pray, that who ever you next Honour with your Affection, may be but as sensible of it, as I have been; for more she cannot be: and may avoid a misery, like that, which you have loaden me with, and from whose Burthen I am resolved Death shall suddenly relieve me. Then with her accustomed grace she kneeled, kissed the Kings hand, which she bathed with her tears, and retired hastily into her Cabinet, bolting the door after her. He would be a better Drawer of Passions than I pretend to be, that could paint to the Life, those of our Monarch, of Izabella , of Leticia , and of Horatio ; for never any four persons at once were assaulted with such violent and various ones, as they were. The last of them finding himself at liberty, withdrew to his own Chamber, to put on those Cloaths which might continue to disguise his Sex, from the rest of the Family; and by the way was met by his Lord, who was impatiently watching the Result of this whole Adventure, on which his Revenge and Safety, so highly depended. He therefore followed Horatio , to learn it; which when he had done, his Amazement, Grief and Anger, equal'd those of all the rest. The King, in the mean while, having his heart pierced, with Izabella's last words and actions, and trembling with apprehension, lest she might be then performing, what she had menaced him with; started out of all his thoughts, and ran to her Cabinet door, where he heard her sigh with such excess, as set on fire again his breast, and with fiercer flames, than ever yet had invaded it. He both knocked at the door, and called, but she neither would open it, or answer him. This made him unite all his strength to force it. She knew well enough by the voice, and by the attempt, who it was; but having begun so fortunately to extricate herself, out of that ruine into which her mistaken Love, had so far precipitated her, she resolved to perfect what was so far advanced; and therefore just as our Monarch had torn open the door, she got into the Window which was over the Thames , and made as if she would have cast herself out of it. But the King, as she designed, catched her in his Arms; and then by all the humiliations of a penitent Lover, so movingly beg'd her Pardon, for his guilty suspicions, which had been seemingly, but too well grounded; and so passionately conjured her to cast off a despair, which at once had so frightned and pleased him, since it was the sublimest evidence of her Love and Grief; as by degrees she gave him some hopes, she might not be for ever inexorable. Who will not admire at the extravagancy of Love, and at the vicissitude of Humane things; when the greatest Monarch of the World, is reduced to beg Pardon, of his Subject, for her own fault; while she is more troubled she could not Act it, than she would have been had she committed it: And yet her sighs, and tears, that an imagined Page, is found to be a Woman, which aggravated her fault, she makes pass even in the judgment of her King, as the proofs of her Innocence. Thus the World delights to abuse us, and yet we delight to pursue those pleasures, by which we are abused; and to Court them, neglect our solid Happiness; every one flattering himself with a belief, that he is the happy person who shall fix the wheels of Love and Fortune, both which, will yet be as perpetual in their motions, as the Sun in his. But while the King and Izabella are peecing up all misunderstandings, while Leticia is contriving how to recover the favor of her Lady, or failing of it, to raise her Fortunes, by making the lovely Talboise , the Monarch, of our Monarchs heart; while our young Norfolk , is contriving by a second design, to repair the unsuccessfulness of the first; and while
