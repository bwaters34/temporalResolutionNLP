 fame and full of resolution, left the gouernment of his kingdome to his brother Iohn , then Duke of Ireland, and arriued in Austria, the meeting place of these Christian Potentates. The rest of this Campe royall, not then in a readinesse, according to the customes of Princes, caused King Richard to request entertainement for him and his Knights. Don Iohn then Duke of Austria, being a Prince so curteous and noble, that he could doe no lesse then grant it. Now Fame and Fortune in King Richards thoughts smiled, and the smooth brow of wished good speed, bad him and his hundred Knights welcome. A hundred he had as then for his guard, called Knights of the Bath, a title of dignity first giuen by this King: but now while the rest of his Army planted their standers vpon the downes adioining to the Court, these Knightly Gallants so reuelled in the Dukes Pallace, that well were they that could purchase their fauours, and highly graced were all such as had but the smallest imployment of an English Knight. So amiable, pleasing, and curteous, were the conditions of King Richard and his followers, so truely were their minds deuoted to honour, that they euen inforced loue from all estates, the haughty minded of their own accords became gentle, the stubborne nature pliable, and the frowne of euery English brow by desert challenged both cap and knee, Don Iohn himselfe began to grow disgracious, his Subiects wauering, alegiance waxed cold, and none but the name of English Richard merited Fortunes high graces: All Austria esteemed England a happy Nation, by nature the darling of vertue, and the only hopes of Christendome, so grealy are still the fauors of our English people in the eies of forren kingdoms. This detracted loue of his subiects did not a little displease Don Iohn , and his son Prince Phillip , and no little enuy by it were bred in their two fired breasts, that nothing could quench the increasing flame therof, but King Richards shame and confusion. Politicke and close were their purposes, deadly and diuellish their intents, and most vnhumane and vnchristian-like their proceedings, the law of Armes was quite laid aside, the honor of Princes forgotten, and the dignity of Knight-hood vilely abused, malice, and wrath, the champions of pale death hourely possessed their two hearts, with a secret imagination of vengeance, plotted against the life of royall Richard , to murther by violence, would but incurre displeasures of forren Nations, to kill innocents offendeth Heauen, and to betray Princes, hath rewards in hell, a thousand thousands of displeasing motions, disquieted their discontented mindes, dishonoured as they thought by the vertues of King Richard , disgrace boyling in her greatest heart, could no longer be suppressed, but needs the flames of fury must breake forth, and a flattering practise of reuengement mollifie their intollerable torments, and in this manner was it accomplished. Prince Phillip the onely sonne and heire apparant to Don Iohn , the pride and hopes of Austria, in whose life and good Fortune consisteth his countries honor, like a desperate and prodigall gallant, in a dissembling shape of friendship, challenged King Richard at a Princely turnament, and in the knightly games of tilting, personally to combat hand to hand, the English King in the Aprill of his man-hood, nothing inferior in prowesse to Prince Phillip , hauing the sparkes of Maiesty glowing in his bosome, in a most princely manner accepted his challenge, and against the day appointed, prouided al things fitting for so noble an enterprise. Time with his lazy wings, seemed to fly too slowly, and to crosse the forward attempts of these youthful combitants, each minute seemed an houre, each houre a day, and each day a moneth, till the appointed time came of this royall turnament, so bold, forward, and illustrious were these martialists, the one striuing for honor, the other for reuenge. I need not here speake of the sumptuous preparations, the exceeding charge, and costly habilliments prouided against that day, numberlesse were the eye witnesses of this Court-like pastime, ready prepared to bid them welcome with a gracious applause. To come to the fulnesse of this glory, the day approched, the morning Sunne cheerefully rose with a bright smile, the christall Skie put on her fairest robe, and the moderate aire seemed to further their proceedings, all things by nature were as furtherers to summon them to Armes, Don Iohn himselfe attended by his greatest Nobility, sate as Umpiers in the case, and each Lady with a prepared eye, was ready to censure of their deserts, the tilting place being rayled in quadrangle-wise, round about beset with lofty galleries, whereon people in degrees were placed in such multitudes, as memory it selfe could hardly number: the Sunne beames had not more motes by imagination, then this theater spectators, equally wishing good fortune to them both, bright honors sceane being ready to begin, the Drums and Trumpets gaue warning of the two combitants approch, in such a melodious manner, as both aire and earth resounded, the first that entered the listes, was Prince Phillip in a black caparison, his horse betrapt with sable, his beuer close, made of the fashion of a flying Griffon, his Launce and Scutchion borne before him by a naked Indian, all agreeable to his blacke desires: for the steeled point of his Launce, and the keen edge of his sword, were both impoisoned; his motto was, True honour hath no equall . Immediately after entered Richard of England, mounted vpon a Spanish Gennet, as milke white and spotles as were his thoughts, his Armor bright and glistering, his Helmet of the fashion of a sunne sparkeling fire, expressing both malice and mercy. Upon his breast he had the honorable red crosse of England, platted with Arabian silke, his Motto was; Honour tainted, in vaine repented . Thus all things in readines for this royall turnament, the cheerefull reports of relentlesse Drums and Trumpets, thundred a charge, whereupon the two couragious Princes, fired with resolution, so fiercely assailed each other, that a strange admiration of their man-hoods possessed all the beholders. The old Duke Don Iohn himselfe, sitting with a longing desire of his sonnes victory, was immediatly discontented wich the spight of Fortune, for after he had wounded the English Prince with his impoisoned weapons, to the great danger of life, couragious Richard expressing his Lion-like nature, closed Prince Phillip with such a manly power, that with his heauy courtelax, at one blow he broke his necke: Folly if were to resist destiny, for euen at that instant he yeelded vp the ghost, and in the sight of his old father imbraced death. This sudden accident aduanced not so much the honours of King Richard , as it setled fury in Don Iohns heart, for hauing lost the hopes of his Kingdome, his onely sonne and glory of his age, like a man desperate of all good fortune, ioy, and consolation, he raged both against heauen and earth, blaspheming his Creator, swearing both by God and the world, that the treasures of Europe should not redeeme King Richards life, nor the vnknowne treasures of the deepe Ocean (were they laid at his feet) preserue him from a dishonourable death: for (quoth he) in loosing my Sonne, the sight of the World displeaseth me, I will pine in griefe, I will famish with woe, I will liue foodlesse, feeding vpon nothing, but desires of vengeance. Assist me thou spirit of destruction, that in wrath I may confound the murtherer of my sonne, in whose life I more delighted, then in my royall crown: for in wanting him, I liue as a forlorne, wofull, and deposed King, exild and banisht from this worlds royalty: my second soule adores the smallest drop of thy deere harts blood, shal be quittanced with the purple goare of King Richards bosome. Hauing spoken these, or such like wordes, he commanded the Marshall of Austria , to take the English Prince vnto his charge, and to keepe him close prisoner in a square Tower of Marble stone, adioining to the vttermost part of his Court, and likewise to discharge all the followers of his Countrey, vpon paine of death not any one of them to bee seen in his territories after the date of seuen daies. All which according to the angry Dukes command, was by the Marshall speedily accomplished, the wofull King he to prison, and his sorrowfull followers to their natiue countrey, where his loyall Subiects made not a little moane for his hard misfortunes; Don Iohn with his Nobility mourned as grieuously for Prince Phillip , whom in most solemne manner they enterred in a Princely Tombe, where we will leaue him sleeping in peace, and perseuere in this our wofull History. King Richard hauing now neither Crowne, Kingdome, nor liberty, but (by his late receiued wounds, from Prince Phillips poisoned weapons,) lay bleeding in prison, to his liues greatest danger, and being destitute of friends, and all hopes of recouery, he dolefully breathed out this lamentation. Oh vniust Fortune (said hee) why in the prime of youth hast thou thus deceiued me, and by thy flattering promises of aduancement thus betraied my Knightly aduentures? Those blessed warres, where the standard of Christ by their incouraging flourishes, makes cowards inconquerable, must by mee bee forsaken, and my vnhappy daies by Don Iohns vnprincely doome, haue ending, sweat with teares. Oh you ingrateful wals, that with your pittilesse bounds claspes in a royall Prince; mercilesse woe like a cruell tyrant feedes vpon my heart, and the sunne shine of delightfull consolation is now for euer dimmed with the blacke cloudes of despaire, banisht be all hopes of liberty, and the freedome that attends on Kings, is curbed with the base pennance of captiuity: Farre more fortunate is the humble estate of the Plow-mans life, he suffers onely the crosse of priuate disgraces, when principalities indure the generall scandall of dishonour, wherein Kingdomes, and the glory of Diadems, lose their illustrious dignities. Where are now all my courtly traines of starre-bright Nobility, my attendant followers, my gardiants, and humble seruitors, my pompous state, roiall banquetings, and delightful musicke, all to my soules eternall griefe, now vanished, and conuerted into continuall lamentations; no fellowship haue I to comfort me, but discontent, sighes, and melancholy dispaire: Care is my food, and teares my drinke, nothing but the imaginations of woe, intercepts all hopes of freedome. Oh vnhappy England, thou nurse and mother of my life, dishonoured in thy Kings disgraces, and made most miserable by this iniurious and most vnprincely dealings, Heauen I hope with blacke vengeance, deadlier then the feare of hell, will in time spie out a most dreadfull quittance, written in the bloody brow of a cursed Austria , stained with inhumane murther of a King, whose death the child as yet vnborne shall rew, and after ages shall speake off: pitty my distresses thou reuenger of mankind, that my soule may sleepe in peace, and rest in that blessed mansion prepared for Monarches. These or such like heart-breaking complaints being breathed from his grieued bosome, the paine of his impoisoned wounds so inraged, and so furiously tormented his body yet bleeding that (poore King,) he fell into a swound, liuelesse, and breathles, sauing a little panting breath moued in his breast, a signe that the sparkes of life were not quite extinguished. But now, euer as this sudden trance assailed King Richard , there entered into the prison the Lord Marshall, vnder whose charge he was then kept, where when to his great amasement he beheld as he supposed, the King bereft of life, hauing a mind framed of a noble disposition, began to pitty his misfortunes, and to accuse his Lord and Master of iniustice, whereupon according to his gentle nature, hee dressed his wounds with a precious kind of balme, by nature so excellent, that it not onely recouered life, but also health, and in lesse then in three daies, made him as sound as he was before his combat with Prince Phillip , where we shall leaue King Richard , making his praiers to heauen for his deliuery from death, and speake of other accidents that followed hereafter. How the two English Earles of Arundell and Oxford , disguisedly comforted King Richard in prison, of the loue betwixt him, and Clarabella the Dukes daughter; how he how hee pulled out the Lyons heart, and thereby came to bee called Richard Cordelion , and of other accidents. According to the heauy and bitter command of the angry Duke, (in reuenge of his sonnes death,) the Nobility and Knights of England departed Don Iohns Kingdome, leauing the wofull King in prison, as ashamed of so haplesse a voiage, where being no sooner come, and the reports thereof bruted in the eares of the Earles of Arundell and Oxford , but like two English spirited gallants, not able to brooke this forraine disgrace, they resolutely departed England, protesting either to bring their Soueraigne Lord safely to his Kingdome, or to leaue their bodies buried in Austria : that blood (quoth they) spent in the honour of our King and Countrey, is the sweet sacrifice of Knight-hood, and the true vermillion colour, that beautifies the rich robes of honour. Thus nobly minded, they with all speed crossed the Seas, which they were ioyfull off; so with so glorious a burthen, and the whisling wind, proud of these Princely resolued Gentlemen, louing kind, and loyall, set open their gentle portals, and beyond the expectation of man, set them safely vpon the costs of Austria , where being no sooner come, but they attired themselues in the disguised habits of Fryers, the most secret, and fittest pollicy to attaine the wished presence of their imprisoned King, and by that meanes thought they to relieue him, if his extremity so much required; so comming to the prison gate in a professed zeale, as they said they had of King Richards soules health: they desired accesse, and that the Lord Marshall would admit them to the Kings presence, who being a man of a curteous nature, could doe no lesse then grant their request, being so honest and vertuous a demand. Frowning Fortune beganne now a little to smile, and a little to ease his languishing sorrowes: for no sooner had his gentle eies cast their dimme sights (almost blinded with teares) vpon his two deare friends, but a sudden reioycing hope assailed his heart, and like a royotous heire newly possessing his patrimony, surfetted in pleasure, all dispairing passions by the delightfull presence of these two English Earles, were immediatly conuerted into iollity, their imbraces were as the closes of new married Damsels, where the extremity of ioy so swelled in their bosomes, that euen their eyes distilled teares, (and their hearts as it were danced.) These two supposed Friers had no other Orisons, but comfortable reports from his loyall Subiects in England: their Bookes were their loues, and their Beades their fealties. Thus in this secret manner vnsuspected of any, repaired they daily to this distressed King, expecting hourely his liues metamorphoses, either of liberty or death: Freedome, or confusion, royalty, or captiuity: in which wauering doubt, while these three subiects of sorrow remained, the displeased Duke (still harbouring in his heart blacke malice, called a counsell of flattering sicophants, such as be still the attendants of Monarkes, where against both the law of Armes and Nations, it was decreed that King Richard should combate with a Lyon, which if he ouercame, his liberty thereby might be purchased; but being ouercome, he should endure the sharpe punishment of this mercilesse beast, whose greatest fauour were but death: vpon which pittilesse doome, this bloody counsell concluded, and thereupon appointed the time and houre, to the extreame griefe of many thousadns, whose whose gentle harts euen trembled at this remorslesse iudgement. But now marke the difference in nature of a cruel Father, and a kind Child; the Father mercilesse, the Child mild, the Father proud, the Child humble, the Father vnreasonable, the Child reasonable, the Father cruell, the Child louing, betwixt whom tyranny and remorse stroue for superiority: for Don Iohn bore not more extreame hate against the English King, then his daughter faire Clarabella extended loue: In her heart partiall Cupid builded his Bower, and pitty with his smooth countenance, sent dumbe messengers to the distressed King, which were modest sighes, bashfully sent from her maiden-like breast, fearing to offend in affecting her Fathers enemy: yet loue, which hath commanded euen the Gods themselues, and still blindly leades earthly Monarkes with vnequall affections, making no difference betwixt Kings and Beggars, so ruled the desires of diuine Clarabell , that shee wished no other consolation in this world, but the sacred loue of English Richard ; whose presence (if shee might possesse) were to her soule as the pleasures of Paradice: duty and obedience (by nature her Fathers right) were now exchanged into desire and loue; the Princely behauiour of King Richard guided her thoughts, and (though as yet vnknowne to him) intangled her loue-sicke heart in the toiles of Venus , wherein was no hope of recouery, but the vniting of them both in the equality of desire. These were faire Clarabels discontents, which as an vncurable wound, dismembred all the liuely wishes of virginity, offending onely in thought, and with the chilling feare of her second solues destruction, by the terrible censure of her angry Father, shee grew like madde Medea , lunaticke and distraught, expecting the sauage murther of royall Richard , shee railed both at Heauen and Earth, conspiring thus against all her good Fortunes: For in loosing him (quoth shee) the bloome of my maiden- head withereth, and I am like to pine in the languishing estate of misery: made onely miserable by the Eagle-like pitch of my lofty desires. In this manner spent shee away the day, till the sable Canopy of Heauen couered all the earth, a time of silence, a time of peace and rest, a time that the eyes of all things closeth vp: yet sleepe (the comforter of distressed minds, could not locke vp her eyes, for care had made them watchfull, griefe and distrust like two dreadful companions waited in her chamber, euery idle imagination buzzed in her eares, the misaduenture of her loue, fighting with all the misdoubts of desire, shee consumed away the slow night, where euery minute seemed a day till morning came, and then like a carefull bride, shee cloathed her selfe in her richest attire, and by the Sunnes rising came vnto the prison, where shee found royall Richard vpon his Princely knee, pleading for his soules saluation, preparing himselfe ready for his Lion-like combat, the night before brought to the Lord Marshall in a warrant from the Dukes counsel. Farewell vaine world (quoth he) thy flattering pompe hath beene to me, as water bubbles in a rainie day, or as Aprill showers, or the flourishes of Gardens, sudden and variable. Comfort me God, only in thy power is my deliuery, and without thy assistance, this day is like to be my doomes day, and the last day of all my liues fortunes. At these words faire Clarabel sunke into a swound, and so abounded in griefe, that her sences were hardly recouered, but being againe come to her selfe, shee fell at King Richards knee, and in a most milde nature, spake as followeth. Most imperious Potentate, in whose happines consisteth my liues ioy, and in whose welfare my glory shineth: In thee thou pride of manhood, haue I built my hopes, and in louing thee, doe I purchase my fathers frowne, the Diademe of Austria . Now my right and patrimony doe I vtterly forsake, changing all my natiue honours into forraine hopes, and for thy sake make my selfe a stranger to my countrey; euen in death springs my loue, and being dead, all earthly loues in me ends: Cast me not off in disgrace, but locke my true heart in thy Princely bosome, there keepe it as an inestimable Iewell, pure, vnspotted, and vnstained, and tender as the budding Rose, blasted with the least winde of thy dislike: As for thy liues danger (sweet Prince) feare not, heauen I see with a smiling countenance, promiseth comfort, and legions of Celestiall Angels stand ready armed to defend thee from that hunger-starued Lyon, prepared for thy liues destruction, a death dishonourable, and vnfit for so royall a person. In speaking these words, shee tooke a greene scarfe from about her iuory necke, and gaue it to King Richard , saying; Take this (sweet Prince) as the maiden-like promise of my loue and remembrance, weare it for my sake, it may proue thy liues preseruer, and the onely instrument to glut vp the Lyons greedy Iaw, euen at that deadly minute, when he seaseth vpon thy noble body. Pardon my immodest presumption, for desire and loue imboldens me, and all my maiden like bashfulnesse is abolished, by the delightfull presence of thy sweet selfe: For thee, and for thy loue, haue I sold all my royall promotions; Then equall it (great King) that my affection bee not blasted in the bloome, and I made the most wofull and dispised Lady aliue. More would shee haue spoken, but that the gentle King tooke her from the ground, (yet kneeling) and with the delightfull ioy of a curteous kisse, sealed their lippes together, and after gratified her kindenesse with this louing discourse. Thou faire of all faires, thou paragon of beauty, in whose countenance (I see) sits inthronised both vertue and modesty, what vndeserued fauour hath true iudging Heauen graced me with, in that thy inspiring loue hath eluminated my cloudy Fortunes, now scowling with a dismall countenance? Were the whole world mine, and I commander of Monarchies, yet should all my dignities inrich thee, and my powerfull regalties aduance thee to the imperiall estate of all earthly graces: This thy kindnesse hath inchanted me, rauisht my sences, eleuated my soule, and of an earthly substance, made my desires immortall. Now flie I with the wings of good chance, which nothing can clip, but the sharpe sickle of despitefull death: For death (I know) with his gastly visage, walkes here inuisibly, with his tirannous command, ready to seaze vpon me: now is the houre of my liues aduenture, and the minute of that fearefull iudgement to be put in practise, to the appeasing of Prince Phillips angry ghost. At this word speaking, came in the Lord Marshall with an armed guard, hauing a commission to conduct King Richard , to a square Court walled round: wherein was a Shee-Lionesse newly bereaued of her Whelps, to make her the more mankind: about which Court sat the Duke and his Barrons in a gallery, to behold this vnnaturall tradegy: vnto which place being come, attended on a farre off, by the Princesse Clarabell , who with teares and sighes did not a little solicet heauen for his strengthner: all which forced pitty from the hearts of his enemies, and might haue mollified euen Tygers to relent. The two English Earles of Arundell and Oxford, his approued friends in misery: High spirited, and full of resolution, attended as before in their Friers habits, feeding him (as the beholders supposed) with the food of diuine counsels: but indeed with the animation of courage imbouldening him to take his fortunes patiently, and to thinke of the honour of his Countrey, by whose death England was widdowed, and his subiects made Kinglesse. These motions of incouragement, bred in his manly heart an inconquerable strength, committing his life to the disposing of fate: He stripped himselfe from all Court-like habiliments, and in his cambricke shirt, with faire Clarabels scarfe wrapped about his arme, he stood prepared for the entertainement of the remorslesse Lyon, which at the sound of a Trumpet was let loose, whose roares were as thunder from the clouds, and in whose grim visage sat the fearefull president of destruction; heart-breaking afflictions possest all his well willers, and the quiuering feare of his confusion assailed euery gentle eye, excepting Don Iohn and his associats. To bee short, the Lyon like the gulfe of burning Acharon , gaped to receiue the royal body of King Richard , who neither fearing death, nor the threatnings of tyranny, with an vnknowne courage, he most valiantly thrust his arme (wrapped about with faire Clarabels silke scarfe) into the gaping iawes of the ouer-furious Lyonesse, and by the force of his manhood toare out his sauage heart, (yet leaping warme in his hand) and threw it at Don Iohns face, saying; Take that thou monster of humanity, thou vnprincely Potentate, heauen thou seest hath defended me, to the wonder of ages, and thy vile disgraces. Generall was the applause, the intollerable vexation of the wrathfull Duke, who like an vntamed Panthar, rose from his seat, and in great wrath departed. King Richard seeing the Lionesse heartlesse and liuelesse, lying on the ground, to the great amasement of all the beholders, yeelded the glory of this victory to the all-seeing praises of Heauen. No little ioy had the two English Earles at this lucky successe, but especially the heart of diuine Clarabell danced in delights. Neuer had Lady the like cause of content, nor neuer Lady more bound to thanke the Almighty powers of heauen. The relieued King, as the ignorant Lambe newly escaped from the bloody fury of the Wolfe, with a countenance of a crimson blush, declared the like gladnesse, and in most kinde manner cast the reflecting beames of his eyes toward Clarabell that shee well perceiued his curteous thoughts, and that gratefull thankes harboured in his Princely heart. After the Dukes departure, the whole company soone broke off, bearing a secret fauour to the English King, who by faire Clarabell , the Earles of Arundell and Oxford, with some few other attendants of England, conducted him to a priuate chamber, where after some refreshing repast, they prepared for England, but not meaning discourteously to leaue faire Clarabell behind, caused her to be attired in the habit of a Court Page, in a sute of watched coloured veluet, to signifie the trunesse of her loue, (for his sake) in refusing both Countrey, Parents, and Kindred, and in this sort to become estranged from al her acquaintance. Such an imperious God is loue, and so commanding. The next day, vnknowne of any of the Dukes Court, but the Lord Marshall, who assisted them in all their proceedings, they tooke leaue of Austria , and iournied toward England , where by the way King Richard and faire Clarabell , so secretly closed in affections, that her blooming bud of virginity was cropt, and the quittance of his loue-stroake sealed in her wombe, a condition of such content, as both pleasure and desires pleased each party. Clarabell in her Pages attire, seemed in decentnesse to exceed Ganemede, Ioues minion, or wanton Adonius the delights of Venus . Neuer had Paris the Troyan Prince, a greater conquest in the loue of faire Helena , then royall King Richard , of his admired Clarabell . Nature in her greatest pride, framed this beautifull Lady, as then the onely miracle of woman kind, the muses in her praises may write eternally, and those lasting reports which aduanced so many Grecian dames, may now tell, and for euer speake off the super-abounding graces of this faire Lady, that like vnto that Angell-faced Rosamond , wrought wonders in all eyes. No other comforts could possesse the Kings fancy, but this celestiall Lady, Europes admiration, and the worlds glory. In this rauishing content spent they the time away, till happy Fortune set them safely vpon the shores of England, whose sweet sight was as ioyfull to them all, as the returne of banisht exiles to their wished dwellings. This ioyfull day of their arriuall in England, was by the King and his Counsell canonized for a holy day, being the third of March, and to this time called Saint Richard , as our English Almanacks can yet testifie. King Richard hauing againe taken possession of his Kingdome, and imperiall dignity, first gracing his two deere friends of Arundell and Oxford, with commendable aduancement for their loues and loyalties, then preparing in his City of London a royall lodging for his faire loue, neere vnto Cheape- side, called his Tower Royall, Men royall (as he said) in harbouring so faire a Paramour, as was diuine Clarabell : In this place repaired he full often vnto her, and tasted of those delights in nature, spotting her name with the title of a Kings Concubine. Long was he lulled in the cradle of pleasures, carelesse of honours aduancement, neglecting his countries fame: knightly Chiualry was conuerted to courtly dances, the lullabies of idle pastimes rockt him asleepe, till the disgraces of England (receiued by his late imprisonment) awaked him, and called to armes: Then rowsing vp his Knightly courage, like Fames darling (being set amongst his Barrons) he said as followeth. Now Fire and Sword, the two instruments of consuming warre, shall forrage Austria, and by the Kingdomes ruine, worke me a sweet reuenge. My wrongs there receiued by the vniust decrees of Don Iohn , shall be quittanced with more then common spoiles, his Court shall swim in blood, his turrets flame in fire, heaps of mangled men, choake vp his streetes, woe vpon woe, shall beset him round. Troy in her ten yeeres warres did not endure more calamities then Austria shall shortly suffer. These and such like high spirited speeches, did King Richard speake amongst his Lords, to the great incouragement of them all, and so fired their lusty bloods, that well were they that could the most gallantliest set forth themselues, and be the most forwardest in his noble enterprise. So desirous were all estates, and so willing in this noble warre, that in lesse then twenty daies the King was the royall Generall of fifty thousand Souldiers, all prouided so manfully, as if they had gone to make a new conquest of Ierusalem. In which honourable iourney we will leaue him, and also the preparation that Don Iohn made to withstand him, and his army, and speake of the birth of Faukonbridge , borne and kept secretly in King Richards Tower royall, with many other strange euents that happened in the birth of this Princely babe. Of the birth of Faukonbridge , and how he came to be so named: and likewise how he was nursed by the Queene of Fairies. Faire Clarabels lamentation for the losse of her young sonne, and of other accidents. Time the conclusion of all euents, brought to the worlds eye, the springing wombe of Clarabell , and neerely tenne Moones had now wandred out their wained courses, when as therein King Richards royall fruit began to grow ripe and ready to fall, against which ioyfull houre, the carefull Lady spared for no cost, and with her deere relenting heart solicited heauen for a happy deliuerie, the onely desire of all weomen. I will not speake of the tender natured Nurses, the diligent Midwiues, nor the rich furniture prouided against that time: needlesse it were to report the sumptuousnesse of banqueting dishes, nor the variety of seruices belonging to so noble a businesse, most honourable and gracious were all the proceedings of this her Christian-like child-birth, not any displeasing obiect hindered her content, nor any way disquieted her mind, but onely the want of her beloued, whose presence in her eye had beene more delightsome then the pleasures of Elizeum : Little supposed shee that King Richard had taken armes against her Father, the successe whereof would haue but bred a strife betwixt loue and nature: For nature in reason tooke her Fathers part, when as loue leaned to her Lord, yet shrowded were all imaginations in the closet of secretnesse, and the least report thereof sounded in her eares. Unknowne were all these proceedings: For King Richard at his departue gaue commandement not to reueale them, till heauen had brought light to the fruit of her body. To be short, the minute approched of the Babes comming into the World, a sweet tender blossome, a most ioyfull wish for the pained Mother, who being borne, was to the beholders an excellent peece of natures worke-manship, vpon whose Infant brow sat the promises of good Fortune. After the Midwife (according to her manner) had trimmed vp the sweet Babe, and shewed him naked (to the other weomen her associats) being a man child, vpon his breast it had the picture of a golden Faulkon, soaring ouer a most dangerous bridge, the which being shewed as a wonder in nature, the honorable Ladies in the Kings Court, by whose meanes it was generally reported through the Land, and after called in Christendome, by the name of George Lord Faukonbridge : A title fitting for so noble an Impe of vertue, being descended from so royall a stocke (as was King Richard and faire Clarabell .) But to come to our purpose, before one moneth had run out thirty dayes, to the more then common griefe hf the mother, the tender Infant lying in his cradle, attended on by three carefull nurses, euen at the middle houre of the night, when the siluer Moone in her greatest glory danced on the christall Seas, euen at that silent houre when the God of Dreames gouerned the World, there was heard in the chamber such a melodious sound of Musicke, as if it had beene the harmony of Angels, or the singing Cherubins of Heauen, which in a bewitching manner so inchanted the wakefull Nurses, that their eyes closed, and their sences yeelded to sound sleepes. In this still time of silence, came in the Queene of Fairies, with a troupe of her inuisible attendants, being the pretty dancing Elues of an vnknowne Kingdome, and stoale away young Faukonbridge out of his Princely cradle: whose misse (at his Nurses waking) bred such an amasement amongst them, as almost procured lunasie, and forced them (like Bacchus froes) to runne madding vp and downe, not knowing in what manner to answere this their negligence: But yet this griefe of theirs, was but the induction to the true maze of calamity: the wofull mother (vnhappy Clarabell ) made haplesse, miserable, and most wofull, by the losse of this her sweet Babe: this deere collop of her own flesh, being so deerely fed with her owne blood, forty weekes cherisht in the Closet of her wombe, and euen now (contrary to all expectation) by the losse of it, to be bereaued of all worldly consolation. Oh thou vniust guider of mans life (quoth shee) what secret sinnes haue I committed against thy commanding deity? what blake offence hath now dimmed the cleere beames of mercy, that her eluminating glory is thus with-holden from me? Why had it not beene strangled in my wombe, and made Deaths sacrifice before it had saluted the Worlds eye? then for the want thereof had I not thus mourned, nor the title of a mother thus vnhappily wrought my hearts discontent. Weepe eternally (oh mine eyes) till you grow blind with lamentations; breake heart with swelling sobbes, split and burst asunder: Nothing but motions of crosse chances intercepts my imaginations, consuming sorrow (like a wasting tyrant) reuels in my distresses: Not any comfortable thought will in mercy seaze vpon my soule, pitty is fled, remorse banished, and gentle relenting passions, workes wonders in my griefe-tired heart. Now this sudden losse of her young sonne, gaue her an occasion to desire the presence of King Richard , that in his company shee might a little ease her sobbing bosome, and that an equall partition of griefe might be made betwixt them, considering halfe of mischances spight belonged to him, being the Father, and begetter of this blooming Faukonbridge : But when shee had intelligence of his departure for Austria, and of his reuenge pretended against her Fathers Country, and her natiue soile, and birthplace, a sorrow beyond humane imagination assailed her heart, and a griefe (beyond the misery of Hecuba Queene of Troy, hauing lost one and twenty sonnes) seazed vpon her soule: words were not sufficient, teares of no force, sighes sobbing in blood, could not reueale the least part of her bitter anguish: All the tongues that euer spake, all the pens that euer writ, nor all the bookes that euer was, could more tell, write, or containe, the true manner of the disquietnes of this sorrowfull Lady, the true patterne of griefe sat heauily vpon her cloudy brow, and her eyes sparkeled as it were streames of afflictions, day and night spent shee comfortlesse away, food was as poyson to her body, sleepe as strange company, loathsome: solitary silence wrought her the best ease: nothing but idle visions of discontent appeared before her: sometime shee supposed that grim-fast death with legions of wormes sat deuouring the tender body of her yong babe: Sometime againe, shee imagined that an army of Angels conducted the pretty Impe into the blessed kingdome of heauen: by and by againe, that wilde beasts and rauing Foules, banquetted with his tender limbes: one while shee thought it lay staruing in the fields frozen to death with cold, another while parched with the beames of the hot Sunne: A thousand doubts had shee of the misaduenture of this yong babe, beleeuing neuer to see it more, but that the doomes day of his liues ending had concluded all his Fortunes. Upon which resolution, shee exempted her selfe from the company of all people, excepting one ancient Gentlewoman, that daily attended in her Chamber, which brought her such necessaries as sufficed nature, where like the picture of woe, vnbrast, and disrobde of all Lady-like attires, with disheuelled haire hanging downe to the earth, we will leaue her in this her Tower-royall, so called by the reason of her royall beauty, to the bitternesse of lamentations, fitting so sorrowfull a Princesse, and speake of the fearefull Fortunes, that the three nurses had: After young Faukonbridge was in the possession of the faire Queene, the eldest of these vnhappy nurses, was a widdowed Lady of the Court, of a cleere complexion, faire and beautifull, whose face declared the lamentable shew of discontent. Poore sorrowfull soule, after the young Infant was thus taken away, not knowing by what meanes, nor by whom, considering this her negligent care prooued a scandall to her reputation, shee exempted her selfe wilfully from the society of people, and gaue her selfe to trauell, protesting by the sacred Maiesty of Heauen, to leaue no kingdome vnsearcht, nor no nation vnseene into, till shee had found out young Faukonbridge , and brought him againe safely vnto his carefull mother. The second of these wofull nurses, being a rich London Merchants wife, in like manner (in pennance for this her negligence) put her selfe vnto a heauy taske, which was, to refuse all the ioyes of marriage, not to take the fruition of her husbands loue, not to sleep vppon downy beds, but to rest her selfe vpon the hard ground, making the dusty earth her pillow, where sighes and sobbes were her only companions, care her chamberlaine, and griefe her gardian, not any motion of delight could any more seaze vpon her heart, but all her meditations were still made vppon the wished returne of young Faukonbridge . The third and last, but not the least woful of these grieued nurses, was a plaine, wholsome natured countrey-woman, of a complexion like vnto the Shepheards of Idea Mountaines, neuer more fairer were the tripping Nimphes of Diana , sporting vpon Cipresse bankes, nor neuer did nature frame woman more beautiful: vpon her cheekes the lilly and the rose stroue for supremacy, and the Uermillion blush of her beauty wrought desire in all eyes, euen loue himselfe danced in her countenance, yet all these rich gifts of nature, were quite blemisht by the sudden fright taken at the losse of this tender babe, whose absence was as the bitter doome of death, and transformed all her wonted graces into pale feare, her face by it was changed into the shape of an ashy visage, or the wan countenance of a long dead body, all earthly consolation ended, no hope had shee of her former ioy; dispaire, blacke melancholy, deadly houres, and vnlucky thoughts harboured in her pensiue bosome, and by the losse of that sweete Infant, (at whose birth euen the Muses danced,) all following good Fortune (was quite from this Nurse exiled:) and as a punishment therefore, for her negligence, shee promised by a solemne vow made secretly with her owne heart, neuer to tast other foode, but rootes, hearbes, and such things as grew in the desart woodes, nor neuer to drinke other liquour but cleere water, taken from running riuers, her companions were siluaine beasts, and foules of the aire, which in their natures seemed to assist her in this her languishing life: long liued shee, with the rest of her wofull partners, making their daily orazons for the sweet returne of this royall babe, for whom the whole land in great sorrow mourned, whom we will leaue till another time, and perseuer in these following euents that happened to King Richard , being wading in Austria through Seas of blood. A wofull report of King Richards death. Of faire Clarabels lamentation for the same. Of her grieuous punishment by famine, and of other accidents. After some little ease, like the sweet returne of some long absent friend, had mittigated the inward sorrowes of faire Clarabell , and that a little the remembrance of her Infants losse, some-what ceased her former laments, thinking to cheere her sad heart with infusing delights, that shee hoped to enioy by the sweet presence of King Richard , wishing hourely his company, little dreaming of his departure for Austria , but that he reuealed in his owne Court, to her great ioy, and his owne renowne, that at his first arriuall into her presence, they might like Mars and Venus surfet in delight, or like Paris with his Helena , seale vp the true quittances of desire, but all was not as shee wished; for her hearts beloued, King Richard , flourished in the royalties of Belonaes battels, wading in blood, and mounted vpon his vndaunted courser, treading vpon mangled men, and marching after the cheerefull melody of warre. Which when the poore distressed Lady hard off, like a condemned exile, banished from all solace, shee exclaimed against cruell desteny, reuiling the angry Queene of chance, accounting all her hopes ominous, and her selfe the onely patterne of misfortunes. Oh (quoth shee) what vnlucky planet predominated my birth? why was I borne to these miseries? I liue destitute of friends in an vnknowne kingdome, dishonoured with the title of a Curtizan, a pointing marke for vertuous Ladies, a staine of woman-hood. Oh why was I borne to commit so foule a sinne, that blemisheth the glory of all Princes? Oh vnkind King Richard , now I see thou heapest vpon my backe a second misery, as thou hast disrobed me of virginity, making me neither wife, widow, nor maide: so wilt thou orphane me, and intitle me by the name of a parentlesse child: Woe vpon woe I see pursues me, calamity, discontent, sorrow, despaire, yea, and all the miseries that euer haplesse woman indured, now like whirle-winds, or tempestuous gusts, tumbles my care-kild heart into the gulfe of vnpitied afflictions; be iust thou punisher of blacke trespasses, for my skarlet sinnes knocke at Heauen gates for reuenge, and my desert exceedeth Tarpies that sold Rome , or the daughter of Ninus that betraied her fathers kingdome: for euen as the Uiper I feed vpon my Parents woe, and as the curse of nature, haue gloried in disobedience, what good fortune can I challenge at the hand of destiny, in louing my fathers foe? yeelding that vnrecouered iem to his pleasure, as being well bestowed, might haue merited the worlds fame, but being lost to satisfie his lust, hath placed me (for a strumpet) in the blacke booke of infamy? who can pitty my extremities, or what gentle eye will vouchsafe thereat to shed one teare? Teares from a remorslesse bosome are most comfortable dewes, and the sweet waters of hearts ease. These, or such like passions breathed shee from her discontented bosome, which manner of lamentations once a day shee made to the sightlesse aire, till the time of sixe moneths ouerpassed, at the end whereof, there arriued at her lodging, the two Earles of Arundell and Oxford , newly returned from Austria , being the onely counsellors to King Richard in all his proceedings, which two Lords brought the heauiest newes that euer neerely touched England , such newes that might euen haue broke a sauage heart, newes of death and dolour, the signification thereof sate like characters in their foreheads, and as it were made dumbe shewes of discontent, being with heauy countenances both come into the presence of Lady Clarabell , the good Earle of Arundell said as followeth. Prepare (sweet Lady) with a gentle silence, to entertaine the wofullest tale that euer man at armes reported, for it tels of blood and death, and of the ruine of imperious soueraignety. Know faire Clarabell that in one day by the fury of relentlesse warre, thou hast lost both thy Father and thy Loue: First thy Father when the battels ioined, closed with high spirited Richard in such Princely resolution, as euen fired his whole army with the liuely sparkes of valour, and so proudly managed himselfe against the gun-shot of chance, as if Hector and Achilles combated each other. On the other side English Richard , vnder whose ensignes our selues marched so nobly, and so beyond expectation he behaued himselfe, as if Mars fought vpon the earth, both Heauen and Earth thundered forth their glories: Our two Armies were in number like the Campe of Scythian Tamberlaine , which (as it were) made the huge earth to grone. Neuer since the ten yeeres warres at Troy , did mans eye behold so numberlesse a multitude, all valiant, fearelesse, and aduenturous; we for the honour of England, they for the honour of Austria: Seas of blood couered the greene fields, and the feete of horses trampled out dead mens braines, the cries of dying souldiers seemed like thunder, and the christal Aire spread forth her sable Canopy, mourning at so wofull a massacre. After thousands lay breathlesse on the hungrie earth, glutted with the blood of so many thousand Christians, the victory grew so doubtfull, that Lady Fortune sate wauering, not resolued to what side to yeeld it: But woe is me, euen then the glory of both our Armies faded, and the eluminating light of two Princes was by consuming death extinguished: Austria lost royall Don Iohn , your Father, and wee imperious Richard our King. Two such losses, as Europe for them weepes blood, and may well consume in griefe: Upon whose deaths, both our Armies sounded retreate, a peace proclaimed, and both their bodies had such funerals as befitted the persons of such high dignities. Our Leaders and Captaines (hauing lost their Princely Generall, imbraced peace, and with the Swordes sheathed, Cullors rolled vp, and with heauy hanging countenances, are now arriued in England , where (with the generall consent of the whole Nobility) we haue crowned Iohn his brother, King of this Countrey, whom in all allegiance we will henceforth honour and obey. More would they haue spoken, but the griefe of Clarabella so abounded, that shee could keepe silence no longer: but in great extremity of passion burst out into these speeches. Heere (quoth shee) let the World end; for the terrible extremity of woe (like the raging Ocean ,) breakes in, and ouerflowes all my ioyes: I haue lost my Father, Friends, Countrey, Kinred, Acquaintance, yea, and my Child: and the dearest of all Iewels, Royall King Richard , by whose death I am made most vnfortunate. Descend some vnlucky starre, fall vpon me you fatall planets, and strike me blinde, that my sightlesse eyes may behold no further miseries. Where art thou mischance? afflict me with some fearefull confusion; that like the wife of Oedipus , the whole World may report my shame. Heauens blessings (I see) hath refused me, and like an out-cast loaden my blood-red heart with more then earthly sorrow, and with which it is rent, torne, and most lamentably tormented. At these wordes shee offered to teare forth her owne eyes, had not the gentle aduice of the two Earles perswaded her to patience, which shee willingly imbraced, and so for that time parted company: Shee to her sorrowfull closet, they to the new refined Court, where (after K. Iohn had intelligence of the successes of Clarabella , sent to her a commission of banishment, with a commandement that no English subiect vpon paine of death, should giue her any sustenance of food, whereby her wantonnesse might be scourged with pining famishment: a grieuous and seuere penance, deseruing the name of heathen tyranny. But such was the indignation of King Iohn , and so violent in wrath, that euen death quittanced her fauourites. (Poore mappe of misery!) shee was forced to forsake Courtly fashions, and to exchange her costly attires into beggers weeds: shee that had wont to feed vpon the variety of dainties, was now sufficed with course seruices, no otherwise then with those things that satisfied hunger-starued hounds: many a little dogge (in the laps of young wantons) had more abundance of food then this gallant Lady had. Day by day walked shee comfortlesse vp and downe the streetes, moning her owne misfortunes, yet vnpittied, and left to her complaint. Night by night wearied shee out the long houres with remembrances of her former life, where euery minutes thought begot new griefe, and euery thought of new griefe almost split her heart: sighes were as common obiects to satisfie her discontents, being displeased with all things shee cast her eye vpon. Not any comfortable motion could shee entertain, wearied shee grew of the wanton world, not knowing which way to turne her selfe: Misery followed her vp and downe; when shee remembred Austria her Fathers Kingdome, disobedience cut her heart, when shee called to mind her Uirginities wracke, a thousand woes (ioined with repentance) ouerwhelmed all insuing hopes, and almost cast her into desperation, shee supposed pitty to be deafe, and the tender remorse of humane gentlenes to bee shut vp against her. Shee that lately abounded in plentuousnesse, now liued in want of a beggars pittance, shee onely fed vpon sorrow: Sighes were her food, and teares her drinke, wo, misery, and penury, in most extreame manner, tormented her pining carkasse, till pouerties thinne countenance conuerted her rose-like cheekes into a pale complexion: her hollow eyes seemed like the empty cels of death, sorrowes badge (which is a wrinckled brow, declared to the world pitifull prospects, to the wringing handed griefe of the beholders, which were not a few in number.) See into this globe of misery (you blazing starres of Christendome) you flourishing Damsels, that sels your bodies pleasures to make your soules blacke: You that liue by the spoiles of youth, making a pastime of wantonnesse, gathering to your selues the hated names of common Curtizans, corrupted with most vile diseases, loathsome and full of leprosie. To ouerpasse many woes poore Clarabell indured in this pining penance, we will leaue her lying vpon the bare earth (by a spittle gate) onely for an example to all such carelesse liuers, being too simple a lodging for a Princes daughter, and returne to the succeeding euent of young Faukonbridge , and those three vnhappy Nurses, seeking for this Babe of honor. How young Faukonbridge was found by King Iohn in his hunting. How hee preserued his Mothers life (vnknowne to him: And likewise how he succoured the three Nurses; and of the three gifts giuen him by the Queene of Fayries . Now must we suppose Time (in his swiftest course to runne along) and some certaine yeares to passe ouer the head of Faukonbridge , where (taking leaue of the Fayry Queene ,) he had three of the richest gifts giuen him by her, as neuer worldly man was owner off. The first was a garment made him of the Lyons skinne, that his Father Richard Cordelyon slew in Austria , of vertue so precious, that the wearer thereof should neuer faint in courage, but euer continue Uictor in all atchieuements. The second a purse of gold, of such a plentifull treasure, that can neuer grow empty, but as it is taken forth, the vertue thereof replenisheth it againe, by which meanes it continues full. The third a ring of such inestimable price, that by the touch therof healeth all diseases (neuer so dangerous and vncurable.) These were the blessings of the Fayry Queene bestowed vppon this yong gallant, which he receiued as his patrimony, and kept them as the onely gifts of good Fortune. Thus being of the age of fifteene yeeres, he continued in the woods (like vnto a sauage satyre) vnacquainted with worldly people, rouing vp and downe, vntill such time as King Iohn of England, (his vnckle by the Fathers side) found him in his wild quality: but seeing him replenished with such lineaments of nature, strong, and sturdy, as promised ensuing honors: He tooke him to his keeping, and gaue him in charge to an ancient Noble man of his Court, to be trained vp, and taught perfectly his naturall English tong, which hee most speedily accomplished to his high renowne: whereupon the King soone aduanced his estate, and made him groome of his priuy chamber; but he hauing the lofty spirit of Knight-hood springing in his brest, aimed at nobler aduentures, and to winne credit by the strength of his body, desired the Kings leaue to depart his Court, and to trie forraigne atchieuements in the honour of God and his Countrey: which princely request did not a little content the King, whereupon he gaue him a horse well furnished with all the abilliments fitting so resolued a Gentleman, and with all graced him with the picture by nature set vpon his brest. Thus after leaue taken, like one of Fames darlings, this knightly Faukonbridge in the spring-time of his youth, committed himselfe to fortunes fickle fauours, where after he had trauelled some few daies iournies from the English Court, he arriued at the gate of an Hospitall, whereat lay Clarabell his vnknowne mother, begging for reliefe, with these lines grauen ouer her head vpon the wall in capitall letters, according to King Iohns commandement. A Princes daughter by the Kings decree, Here pines in care, stand still, and passe not by, Till this poore map of perfect misery, With wringing hands heau'd vp to heauen high, Tels how her wanton life in sinne was spent, And why shee thus makes wofull languishment. Pitty her not, her life is staind with shame, By her a Kingdomes ruine was begot: Lust and desire hath blotted her good name, And true repentance must make cleere that spot. To succour her is death, authority commands, Against which power, lift no presumptuous hands. Lord Faukonbridge hauing read this superscription, in pitty rued her estate, not knowing her to be his mother, for as yet his parents were vnknown to him, yet harbouring in his breast noble thoughts, he could not choose but extend charity vnto her, and being the first of his aduentures, and the maiden-head of his mercy, the first good deed that euer he did, therefore he willingly alighted from his palphrey, and in tender pitty tooke the halfe starued Lady by the hand, saying; If thou beest descended royally, as these letters witnes that thou art, I am bound in all knightly curtesies to defend thee, and in maugre of blacke Fortunes spight, succour thy distressed estate, as it seemes now the worlds out-cast. Tell me faire Lady thy name, thy birth, and abode, and as I am sworne true Knight, I will be thy champion, and conduct thee safely into thine owne countrey. These gentle promises made by Lord Faukonbridge , aspired new life into her fading body, who with a cheerefull countenance spake as followeth: Deare Knight thy desert I know not, but surely thou seemest to be gracious in all thy proceedings, and desires not I know to inforce a Lady, to speake of that which will breake her heart to remember: Yet because thou promisest me thy gentle aide, to deliuer me from this miserable vale of woe, and set me wishedly vpon the shore of my natiue kingdome, vilely dishonoured by my wilfull follies: Understand then I was borne in Austria , my name Clarabell , Princely my Father, from whom I disobediently fled for the loue of a Northerne Monarke, vnto whom I yeelded vp the pleasures of my virginity, the losse whereof made me, (though no wife) yet an vnhappy mother: for which blacke sinne I am now thus punished. Question no further sweet Gentleman, for the rest will bereaue me of life, but according to thy noble disposition, be my gardian, and conduct me to my natiue countrey, and the rewarder of all good deeds, will quittance your curtesies. Indeed faire Lady (quoth he) as our oathes in Knight-hood be so to doe, so in performance thereof I will aduenture my life, though it be to the Kings high displeasure. So taking her vp behind him vpon his horse, he carried her to the next towne, and there both cheered her pining body with comfortable victuals, and after cloathed her in such garments as befitted the degree of a Gentlewoman, and so set forwards towards Austria, spending the slow time away with pleasing discourses, little thinking of the neere alliance that was betwixt them two, the one the mother, the other the sonne: but heauen meaning to shew a wonder in their liues, would not as yet suffer their kindreds to be brought to light. So trauelling on as I said before, they were intercepted by a most strange obiect, which were three most distressed creatures, seeming by their attires to be weomen, and the three nurses (in former times) of young Faukonbridge , which Clarabell full well knew, but that shee feared to be discouered. The good Knight being stil pittifull, beholding their miseries, the one dumbe, the next blind, and the third lame. Three woefull companions, whom age and time had thus crossed with heauy calamity, hee like a true godly minded man, with that ring which the Fairy Queen had giuen him, cured all their maladies, the vertues of it being so excellent, that it no sooner touched their dismembred bodies, but immediately they were all made perfect, the lame could goe, the blinde see, and the dumbe speak: which miracle done by Lord Faukonbridge , according to the will of heauen, inforced teares through extreame ioy, to fall from the three recouered Nurses eyes, desiring the maker of all things to reward his curtesies. The good Knight, not onely cured their griefes, but gaue them great store of gold out of his most plentifull purse, another gift from the Fairy Queene by him receiued. Now these three new reuiued weomen being safe and sound, no sooner departed, but faire Clarabell greatly desired to be Mistresse of two such precious Iewels as this Ring and the Purse was, whereupon in most gentle manner shee intreated Lord Faukonbridge to bestow them vpon her, that for his sake shee might were them, a fauour to her heart (as shee said) more inualuable then was the Iewell that Marke Anthony , gaue Cleopatra Queene of Egypt, gifts in his imagination, prised aboue the worlds Monarchy, yet being loath to deny her request, he most willingly gaue her them, and with his owne hand putting the Ring vpon her pretty finger, and tying the rich purse by her comely side, he said, Neuer let Knightly prowesse aduance my reputation, nor record my liues fame in the booke of memorable time, but let me die blotted with cowardice, the foule staine of matchlesse Knighthood, when I refuse to accomplish the least motion of your Lady-ships desire: for in your countenance shines honourable graces, and promiseth dignified vertue. To whom Clarabell with a modest behauiour answered in this sort: And much were I too blame (Sir knight) if I should not seeke by desert to requite your kindnesse, and vile ingratitude as a disgrace to my calling, might be well allotted to my share: If time and good fortune euer aduance me to my former estate, I will make thy credit equall Grecian Achilles , and cause the worlds famous antiquaries to signifie thy martiall condition: thou hast bewitcht mee with thy vertues, and with the chaine of manly carriage my life to thy seruice: Reseruing my honour, I humble my selfe to thy noblenesse, which honour onely I once submitted to a King, the fruit thereof might I but liue to see, my earths content were then growne to a perfection. Liuing, or dead, great Ioue protect him: this is my orizon to heauen, and vppon this doe I daily meditate. These misticall speeches of hers, might haue lighted the fire of discouery, but that blind fate would not as yet haue them knowne. These and such like, were the pleasurable discourses betwixt these two trauellers, with the which they spent away many a long day and weary night, without any aduenture worth the noting. But as Fortune is not alwaies smiling, here shee beganne againe to frowne, and to crosse their desires with an vnlookt for chance: For vpon a hot summers day, when the bright Sunne in his greatest glory shined in the horizon, in a most intollerable heat, the poore Lady wearied with trauell, sat her downe to rest in a pleasant greene shade of trees (where dallying with the Ring vpon her lap) shee fell fast asleepe, during which sweet slumber, there came a huge blacke Rauen soaring by, and thinking the yellow Ring to be some prey, which lay vpon her lap, with her tallents catcht it vp, and therewithall flew quite away, to the great amasement of Lord Faukonbridge , standing by the sleeping Lady as her gardiant, and being loth to loose so rare a Iewell, mounted vpon his Steed, and in most swift manner followed the Rauen so farre, that he quite lost the presence of faire Clarabell , whom (for a while we will leaue sleeping) and speake what strange aduenture happened to this noble Knight. How Lord Faukonbridge was found by the Moores, and presented to the King of Morocco. Of his aduentures in that Kingdome. The lamentation of Clarabell for her passed life: and how in penance thereof, shee builded a Monastery for the receit of poore Pilgrims. Noble minded Faukonbridge , followed the flight of this rich prised Rauen, carrying in his beake the worth of a Kings ransome, not resting nor pitching vpon any tree or branch, till shee had let the Ring fall into the Sea, which struck such terrour to the heart of Faukonbridge , (then standing vpon the shore, seeing the euent) that he almost cast himselfe after it into the waues, but that better graces guided him, and hope of better Fortunes restrained his desperatenesse. Standing thus amased, and calling to mind the losse of Clarabella (whom he had left comfortlesse behind) sleeping in a greene shade of trees, not knowing how, nor which way to returne backe, belieuing neuer more to behold her Angelicall countenance: Therefore like a mournefull Traueller (loosing himselfe in some desart wildernesse) he breathed out this vnpittied lamentation: Many and vnlucky are my first aduentures (quoth he) attended on by crosse chances, and vntoward proceedings; no motion of reliefe can I premeditate vpon. For I am come by ill Fortune into a place of desolation, not frequented by the habitation of man: Here liues nothing but greene bellied Serpents, roaring Wolues, and beasts of fearefull shapes, such as may well terrifie the proudest courage: Here sounds no other Ecchoes but the croakes of Rauens, night-Owles, cries, and the bellowing of vntamed Tygers, such as thunders forth nothing but sounds of death and destruction: here is no other food to sustaine nature, but wild hemlocks, henbane, and such impoisoned weedes, the onely store-house of blacke inchanters, witches, and charmers, the aire seemes to be corrupted, and the earth casts vp putrifying sauours, worse then the smoaking lake where Sodome and Gomorra stood. In this manner complained he for the space of thrice twelue houres, looking euery houre to be deuoured by wild beasts, but that his Lyon-like garment which hee wore, made them thinke him to bee one of their number, which sauage creatures in tame manner lodged by his side. As he thus between feare and hope, expected present death, hee beheld a Turkish galley houering by the shore side, the Captaine whereof (being a noble minded Gentleman) at the first sight of young Faukonbridge , cast a Land, where (beholding his distresses) tooke him aboord, which unlookt for fauour, not a little reioiced him: but being so happily preserued from death, most willingly submitted to their mercies, they being Moores, he a Christian: they misbeleeuing, he true in faith, they blacke, he faire, two extreame contrarieties: yet when these Heathen people beheld his face stored with such maiesty, resembling the beauty of his Creator: they admired his Angelike countenance, neuer before that time seeing a man of his colour, but all blacke like themselues, therefore supposing to haue found some heauenly Angell, they presented him to their King, as then keeping his Court some foure miles distance from that place, on the other side of the Sea, (being but a creeke of the maine Ocean) in a most sumptuous Pallace, for brightnesse like to the Tower of the Sunne. The Morrocco King with his blacke countenance, aduancing himselfe in his royall throne, with great admiration receiued Lord Faukonbridge , not as a Captiue, or a chained Galley-slaue, but like the Darling of Maiesty, or as the Paragon of Fame, sent from Heauen to glorifie his Court. Legions of reports might wee make of his entertainement with the Morocco King and his Nobles, who esteemed him rather to be some God, then a worldly man, more dignified honours heaped they vpon his backe, then euer that country gaue vnto a stranger. The wealth of that Kingdome made they his treasury, and masses of Indian pearles lay still at his commandement, the time of his abode there passed on apace, and iollity of his life made seuen yeers but as a month. Which being ouerpassed, it was his chance vpon a solemne festiuall day, which was the birth day of their King, onely once in seauen yeeres solemnized, to behold the chiefest of the Kings Nobility in their richest ornaments, going as it were on procession in the honour of their Prophet Mahomet . Placing him (as it seemed in heauen) to the high dishonour of the Christians God, whose wrath and indignation is the whole Worlds confusion, and whose fauour the preseruation of man-kind. This God and liuing Power, was the Patrone of Lord Faukonbridge , by whose fauour he hoped to conquer Fate, and subdue Kingdomes: This God when he saw him thus highly dishonoured, fury possest him, and to the great disparagement of all that heathen Nation, he desperately tore downe the picture of Mahomet , and with his keene edged Semitary cut it in small pieces, to the great amasement of the Kings Nobility, who in greedy reuenge furiously set vppon him altogether (like a number of whelps vpon a princely Lyon) who so Lyon-like behaued himselfe, that in lesse then halfe an houre, hee left breathlesse vpon the blood-died earth, more then sixe and twenty of the Kings Nobles, approuing here his vnconquerable valour, proceeding from the vertue of his Lion like garment, which the Fairy Queene had giuen him. At this bold enterprise performed with his owne hand, he caused the Moores to ring forth their Alarum Bels, and to fire their Beakons, to raise vp their country forces, thinking that heauen had thither sent a confounder of mankind, and that by his onely meanes their kingdome should be subdued. This matchlesse enterprise performed by noble minded Faukonbridge , did not a little perplex the King, nor no idle feare assailed his mind, but such a fright as made his very soule to tremble: wherefore to rid his kingdom from present danger, in most kind manner he proclaimed truce, and dissemblingly applauded Lord Faukonbridg for this desperate attempt: (and though to his griefe of mind) with faire and princely promises, he perswaded this English Gallant to depart his Country: and the more to aduance his deserued honours, the King bestowed vpon him twelue barrels of good red gold, and withall a shippe well furnished, to conduct him home into his owne Country. Which kind fauour was most gratefully accepted off by noble Faukonbridge , who leauing the Morocco Kingdome, put himselfe to Sea, committing his fortunes againe to the merciles waues, but making the Pilot and Marriners beleeue, that the twelue barrels of gold, were but twelue barrels of red lead: a commodity most precious in his natiue Countrey. The Pylot supposing no otherwise, sailed amaine with prosperous wind towards the Northerne nations. In which successfull iourney, we will leaue now Lord Faukonbridge , and returne to his vnknown Mother (Lady Clarabell ) whom we left as you heard before, sleeping vnder a shade of trees, where Lord Faukonbridge beganne to follow the chace, after the vnlucky Rauen. Clarabell as we spake of before in her sweete sleepe, little dreaming of the absenee of Faukonbridge , at her awaking, both mist him, and the ring; two losses so precious, as euen caused sorrow to reuel in her bosome, that Ioy was a stranger, and content exiled; diuers were the doubts shee had of his misaduentures, one while shee supposed death like a tyrant had possest him, another while shee feared the breach of his promise, and that he had secretly fled from her, bearing away with him the inchanted Ring: Now one thing, then another, not knowing what to coniecture, but when shee saw her selfe quite bereft of his sweet presence, the onely preseruer of her life, exempted from al hope of his recouery, in great griefe of minde, shee betooke her selfe to trauell, and so with weary steps followed on the first path shee found, wherein shee wandred day and night, receiuing little rest, and lesse food, making this sorrowfull mone vnto her selfe. Oh thou iust doome (quoth shee) of all offences, will thy heauy wrath be neuer mittigated? shall this my pining punishment neuer end? shall woe vpon wo still pursue me? weep in teares oh mine eyes, be neuer dried faire lamentations: euen at that houre when I hoped all sorrowes to be finished, began new griefe, when in loosing my Sonne, I found a Friend, whom now wanting, I find eternall causes of discontent: It cannot be possible, but that some dismall mischance hath befallen him, or some vnlucky Lot deceiued me of him, there is no likely- hood of his selfe-wild departure, for in his breast he harboured thoughts of true humanity, honour guided him, and vertue was his friend: how can it then be that of his owne accord he is departed? Surely some vnlucky euent hath befalne him: therefore, oh my heart sob in griefe, and for his sake make thy life but a pilgrimage of woe, consume in care, waste with weeping, for I haue lost the Paragon of Knight-hood, whose countenance promised me to aduance my desired hope, and bring me safely vnto the shoare of my natiue Countrey: but seeing dole and discontent hath crossed all my good Fortunes, I will for his sake, with the treasure of my neuer emptied purse, receiued from him, built vp a Monastery, and in the same (like a Monasticke Nunne) spend out my daies in the seruice of that God that hath thus crossed me, and there be a continuall comforter of distressed Pilgrims, and warfaring trauellers, hoping that if life be in my deere friend, he will once againe arriue in that happy place, and once more satisfie my thirsting eye with his Princely person. Being thus resolued, shee trauelled some three moneths iourney from the place, where shee lost her deere friend the Lord Faukonbridge , and there close by the Sea side, shee builded a most stately Monastery, relieuing still the wants of such distressed trauellers as passed that way, yeelding as well lodging, as meat and drinke, to such as stood in need thereof: For the maintenance thereof, shee had her inchanted purse still ready furnished; thither resorted people of all degrees, thither came Princes, Monarkes, and maiesticke Kings, that trauelled in deuotion to the shrine of Christ in Ierusalem: Thither came worthy champions, Knights errant, and such as sought for knightly atchieuements: thither came religious Church-men, Prelates, and holy minded men, zealously seeking by Pilgrimages to wipe away worldly offences, thither came Plowmen, Shepheards, Fishermen, and such as were numbred amongst the common people, thinking thereby to obtaine absolution for their misdeeds, euery one offering in zeale vnto her great store of riches, whereof shee had little need, accounting it meritorious to giue towards the maintenance of so vertuous a custome. Amongst which number of Benefactors, there was one Peter a Fisherman, that in deuotion of minde, presented vnto her a most dainty Fish called a Dolphin, a present more fitter for a Prince, then such an humble minded woman as shee was, whose humility almost in that Countrey purchased her the name of a Goddesse: This gift from the fisherman was by her most curteously receiued, and most bountifully requited with great store of golde, which shee tooke from out her inchanted purse: Herewith was old Peter well pleased, and the Lady better contented, for in the Dolphins belly shee found the same Ring, which the Rauen let fall into the Sea, the same Ring after which Lord Faukonbridge so vnhappily followed, the same Ring that by the precious touch of it healed all diseases. In this accident fortune shewed the pride of her glory, and brought more strange admiration into the heart of Clarabell , then euer shee expected: but being possest thereof, shee verily beleeued that noble Faukonbridge lay intombed in the watery Kingdome, and that neuer more the consolation of his presence should in ioyfull manner delight her desirefull eye: pale death (as shee supposed by the finding of this Ring) had made prize of his life, too rich a Iewell, as shee said, for this vngratefull World, therefore in the true zeale of heart, and in remembrance of his worthinesse, shee caused a Faulken of Gold to be set vpon the top of the Monastery, wherein shee dwelled, the bright eluminating colour thereof shined into the Sea, and was euer after that made a marke, or a guide for Mariners to saile by. Also like a curteous Lady, to quittance old Peter the fishermans rich present, by good Fortune bestowed vpon her, shee canonised the Monastery, and called it after his name, Saint Peters Hermitage a place of charity, and a receit for all such as wanted maintenance. After this, thousands of oppressed people in this place found succour. Pilgrims and weary trauellers here freely found lodging: Widdowes and succourlesse Children, here tasted bounties liberality, maimed Souldiers, and such as lost their limbes in the seruice of their Countrey, here slept vpon downy beds, more softer then naples silke: Blind, deafe, and dumbe, in this place found helpe, not any diseased creature went from hence vncured, all which by this vertuous Lady, was onely done in charity for Gods sake, and to appease the torments of his soule, that in guiding her to her natiue Countrey, lost his deere life. Wherefore from this day, to her liues departure, shee desired the fellowship of vertue, abandoning all immodest behauiour, vowing her selfe to the seruice of Heauen, and good deeds, in which shee continually striued to exceed all others of her time: which good deuotions we for a while will ouerpasse; and report of other delightfull accidents, agreeing to the course of this our History. How Lord Faukonbridge lost himselfe in a barren Iland. His meanes of recouery. The finding againe of Clarabell . How these two were made knowne to each other. And of the great ioies betwixt the mother and her Sonne. Now is it time to report againe of Lord Faukonbridge , and his fortunes on the Sea, and how his ship loaden with his barrels of golde, lay houering on the billowes, many a day expecting a prosperous wind for England, but obtained none: For safe and good Fortune crossed their hopes, and want of victuals so oppressed them, that hunger almost surprised their liues, and like a pittilesse Tyrant would grant them no remorse: twise sixe moneths continued this their extremity, to the terror of all good men, a death bringing horror both to man and beast. At the last, after they had made many submissiue prayers to God for a good winde,  Æolus set open his brazen gates, and sent them such a gentle gale, that they in three houres sayling, arriued vpon an Iland so barren, that therein they found no other thing to succour their distresses, and preserue them from famishment, but onely fresh water, with the which they sufficiently stored their ship, giuing Heauen thankes for so blessed a fauour. But this suffised not the desires of noble Faukonbridge , hoping to find better reliefe for him and his men, resolutely aduentured further vp into the Iland, to discouer if he could wherewithall to vittaile his ship. But woe is me to report it, this aduenturous Gentleman trauelled so farre, that he lost his way, not being able to returne backe vnto his company, by which meanes he was constrained to stay all night vpon the top of a tree, for feare of wilde beasts, whereof the Iland was full. But now marke how vnlucky all things fell out, the same night the wind rose, and so violently droue the ship from the shore, that the Pilot was inforced to leaue Lord Faukonbridge a Land, and commit his Fortunes to the Sea, where before day light they were cast vpon the coast where Saint Peters charitable Hermitage was scituated, they being Infidels and Moorish natured people, neuer expected the safety of Lord Faukonbrdge , being a Christian, but left him comfortlesse in the barren Iland, and cast a shore where faire Clarabell abode, where comming a Land, desired her for his sake that created her, to affoord them some reliefe, whereby their liues might be saued, and their ship sufficiently replenished with food fitting their intended voyage. Pittifull Clarabell good Lady, shee greatly reioiced that it lay in her power to furnish their wants, most willingly gaue them entertainement, and yeelded them such refreshing comforts, as preserued both their ship and liues from perishing. Likewise they meaning to expresse no vngratefull thankes for so kinde a fauour, as an humble signe of good will, curteously bestowed vpon her, the twelue barrels of gold which Lord Faukonbridge reported to be red lead, all which according to her gentle nature, noble minded Clarabell receiued. So parting with thankes to each other, the Pilot returned to Morocco, very ioyfull for the riddance of Lord Faukonbridge , their Countries supposed enemy, and shee no lesse delighted in the performance of her bountifull charity extended to the preseruation of so many dying men. All this while Lord Faukonbridge remained in the barren Iland, almost hunger-starued for want of food, in which place was nothing found to satisfie his gentle nature, but the flesh of wilde beasts which hee killed with his owne hands, which (for want of fire) hee rosted in the sun, and with the same, (to his content) made more pleasinger banquets, then when he feasted in the Morocco Court, onely patience chiefly guided him, but being thus lost, and exiled from the society of humane creatures, he liued a long time in the woods, in such penurie and want, that his strength began to faile, sicknesse grew on, and danger of life tormented him for want of naturall sustenance, caused a grieuous kind of leprosie to grow quite ouer his body, in such sort, that his Princely countenance was suddenly changed into a most vgly visage, and pale death as it were sate perching vpon his heauie brow, betwixt life and death, hee sate him down vpon the root of a dead withered tree, making this complaint vnto himselfe. If euer pitty (quoth he) entred the celestiall gate of Heauen, or euer remorsfull mercy tenderly lookt into the poore estate of a miserable Gentleman, then by this my liues ruine, may be seene the true patterre of calamity: woe vpon me, crosse vpon crosse, and extremity vpon extremity, makes a vnity, and all conspires together to worke my good Fortunes confusion. Here am I now left in a wildernesse of desolation, friendlesse without comforter, not knowing which way to get forth, but committed to the vile tyranny of vntamed Tygers, euen ready to intombe my dying body within their blood-thirsting bowels, a graue most vnfit to close vp my new created life. In speaking these words, he heard from afarre, as it were out of a hollow vaute, a voice sounding forth these speeches: Faulkonbridge , rise vp and follow me: Fate and good chance will prosper thee. This seemed to be the voice of the Fairy Queene, his old Nurse, being still most carefull of his liues preseruation, as it was indeed; which no sooner ecchoed in the eares of Lord Faukonbridge , but he arose from vnder the tree where he lay, and being ready to goe forward all weake and sickely as he was, he espied before, one of the Fairy Instruments, which was an Ignis Fatuis , the fire of destiny, or a going fire, which by nature fully leadeth wandring trauellers out of the way. This as his guide went still before him, he with a slow pace followed after, not intercepted by any misaduenture, till hee came to the Sea side, where being ioyfully arriued, in good time he beheld a Barke sailing by, to which he made shew of entertainement, as one desirous to be taken into their ship, and to be conducted into some better resting place: both his motions and his intent the Mariners soone perceiued, whereupon they satisfied his desire, and within few daies set him safely vpon the next inhabited kingdome, which was the happy place where Clarabell affoorded such bountifull liberality. Being thither come, the Countrey people and such as beheld his perplexed estate, led him as diseased as he was vnto Clarabels Monastery, where being arriued, and standing shaking at the gate, he desired for his sake that pardoneth all sinnes, and requiteth all good deeds, that shee would with the oyle of her skill balme his grieued paines, and with the mercy that shee freely bestowes vpon distressed soules, cure his malady. Gentle Clarabell at this his humble request, called him in, leading him vp into a close chamber, prepared onely for the comfort
