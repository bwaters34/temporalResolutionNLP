 vertues innobling your blood, as much as your Nobility illustrates your vertues, was the first motiue which drew me hereunto: for whiles many others endeuour to be great, your Ho. (resembling your selfe) not onely endeuors, but striues to be good: as well knowing that Goodnesse is the glory and essence, yea the life, and as J may say, the soule of Greatnesse ; and that betwixt Greatnes and Goodnesse there is this difference and disparity; that, makes vs famous; this, immortall; that, beloued of men; this, of God ; that accompanyeth vs onely to our graues, and this, to Heauen . My second preuailing motiue in this my Dedication , proceeded from the respect of my particular duty, (as my first was solely deriued from the consideration of your owne generall and generous vertues:) for hauing the honour to retaine to your Noble Brother, Sir Edward Sackuile Knight, to whom, for many singular respects, and (immerited) fauours (whiles J am my selfe) J owe not onely my seruice, but my selfe; I therein hold me obliged and bound to proffer and impart this part of my labours to your Ho. (as the first publike testimony of my zeale and seruice, eternally deuoted and consecrated to the Illustrious name and family of the Sackuiles : whereof, Gods diuine prouidence hath made your Ho. chiefe heire and pillar. The drift and scope of these Histories are to informe the world, how Gods reuenge stil fights and triumphs against the crying and execrable sinne of (wilfull and premeditated) murther , which in these our (impure and profane) times, is so fatally and frequently coincident to vnregenerate Christians : which scarlet and bloody crime is infallibly met with, and rewarded by Gods sharpe and seuere punishments; hauing purposely published and divulged them to my deare Country of England , that they may serue (though not by the way of comparison, yet of application) as the sight of Iulius C aesars bloody Robe, (shewed by Marcus Antonius to the Romanes , in Campo Martio , when hee there pronounced his funerall Oration ,) thereby to make his murther, and murtherers in the greater horrour and execration with the people. The Histories of themselues are as different, as their effects and accidents: their Scenes being wilfully and sinfully laid in diuers parts of Christendome beyond the seas, and the Tragedies vnfortunately perpetrated and personated by those, who more adhering to impiety, then Grace , and to Satan, then God , made shipwracke, if not of their soules with their bodies, I am sure of their liues with their fortunes, and of their fortunes with their liues. They themselues, (or rather their sinnes) first brought the Materials, I, onely the Collection, illustration and pollishing of these their deplorable Histories , which are penned in so lowe a sphere of speech: and so inelegant a phrase, as they can no way merit the Honour of your perusall, much lesse of your iudgement, and least of all, of your noble protection and patronage. Howsoeuer, my hopes (led and marshalled by the premises) doe as it were flatter me, that your perfections will wink at my imperfections, and your curiosity at my ignorance and presumption, in daigning permit this my rude Pamphlet, to salute and pilgrimage the world, vnder the authenticall passe-port of your Honours fauour; who of her selfe is composed of so poore metall, (or rather drosse) as without the pure gold of your Honourable name, it would run a hazard, not to passe currant with the curious wits, and censures of this our (too curious, and too censorious) age: whereof could J rest assured, J should then not onely reioyce, but triumph in this my happinesse, as so richly exceeding the proportion of my poore labours and merits, that J could not aspire to a greater honour, nor desire a sweeter felicity: And so recommending this my imperfect Pamphlet to your fauour, my vnworthy selfe to your pardon; and your Ho. (your Noble Countesse , and the sweet young Lady your Daughter , to Gods best fauours and mercies: J will assume the confidence, and constancy to remaine Your Honours in all humility and seruice, Victoryna causeth Sypontus to stabbe and murther her first husband Souranza , and she her selfe poysoneth Fassino her second: so they both being miraculously detected, and conuicted of these their cruell murthers, he is beheaded, and she hang'd and burnt for the same. Catalina causeth her Wayting-maide Ansilua , two seuerall times attempt to poyson her owne Sister Berinthia: wherein fayling, she afterwards makes an Empericke, tearm'd Sarmiata , poyson her sayd Maide Ansilua: Catalina is kill'd with a Thunder-bolt, and Sarmiata hang'd for poysoning Ansilua. Antonio steales Berinthia away by her owne consent: whereupon her brother Sebastiano fights with Antonio , and kills him in a Duell: Berinthia , in reuenge hereof, afterwards murthereth her brother Sebastiano: she is adiudged to be immured 'twixt two walls, and there languisheth and dyes. Belluile treacherously murthereth Poligny in the street. Laurieta, Poligny's Mistris, betrayeth Belluile to her Chamber, and there, in reuenge shoots him thorow the body with a Pistoll, when assisted by her Wayting-mayd Lucilla , they likewise giue him many wounds with a Ponyard, and so murther him. Lucilla flying for this fact, is drowned in a Lake, and Laurieta is taken, and hang'd and burnt for the same. Iacomo de Castelnouo , lustfully falls in loue with his daughter in law Perina , his owne sonne Francisco de Castelnouo's wife: whom to enioy, hee causeth Ierantha first to poyson his owne Lady Fidelia , and then his sayd sonne Francisco de Castelnouo ; in reuenge whereof, Perina treacherously murthereth him in his bed. Ierantha ready to dye in trauell of child, confesseth her two murthers, for the which she is hang'd and burnt: Perina hath her right hand cut off, and is condemned to perpetuall imprisonment, where she sorrowfully dyes. Bertolini seekes Paulina in marriage, but shee loues Sturio , and not himselfe: he prayes her brother Brellati his deare friend, to sollicit her for him, which he doth, but cannot preuaile: whereupon Bertolini lets fall some disgracefull speeches, both against her honour and his reputation: for which Brellati challengeth the field of him, where Bertolini kills him, and he flies for the same. Sturio seekes to marry her, but his father will not consent thereunto, and conueyes him away secretly: for which two disasters, Paulina dyes for sorrow. Sturio findes out Bertolini , and sends him a challenge, and hauing him at his mercy, giues him his life at his request: he afterwards very treacherously kills Sturio with a Petronell in the street from a window: he is taken for this second murther, his two hands cut off, then beheaded, and his body throwne into the Riuer. l. 3. for eight daies, r. eight daies after. p. 36. l. l4. for more, r. morne. p. 54. l. 25. for thought, r. thoughts. p. 57. l. 32. for Alerezo , r.

THE TRIVMPHS OF GODS REVENGE AGAINST the crying and execrable sinne of Murther. History VI.  Victoryna causeth Sypontus to stab and murther her first Husband Souranza , and she her selfe poysoneth Fassino her second: so they both being miraculously detected and conuicted of these their cruell murthers, he is beheaded, and she hanged, and burnt for the same.  resolutions, it is the true way to make vs wretched in this life, and our soules miserable in that to come: for if Chastity and Charity (the two precious vertues and ornaments of a Christian) steere not our actions on Earth: how shall (nay how can) we hope to arriue to the harbour of Heauen? or if we abandon these celestiall vertues, to follow and imbrace those infernall vices: what doe wee but take our selues from felicity to misery, and consequently giue our selues from God to Satan? But did we seriously (and not triuially) consider that there is a Heauen to reward the righteous, and a hell to punish the vngodly, we would neither defile our hearts, nor pollute our soules, with the thought, much lesse with the action of such beastly and inhumane crimes: but in this sinfull age of ours, the number is but too great of lasciuious and impious Christians, who delight in the affection and practice thereof: among whom, I here represent the History of an execrable Gentlewoman, and her wretched and vnfortunate Louer, who were both borne to honour, and not to infamy: had they had as much grace to secure their liues, as vanity and impiety to ruine them. The History is bloody, and therefore mournfull: but if we detest their crimes, wee need not feare their punishments: for God is as gracious and propitious to protect the innocent, as iust and seuere to chastise the guilty. In Italy the beauty of Europe , and in the City of Venice , (the glory of Italy , the Nymph of the sea, and the Pearle and Diamond of the world) in the latter yeeres of the raigne of noble Leonardo Donato , who, as Duke, sate to the helme of that potent and powerfull Estate : (so famous for banishing the Iesuites , and for opposing himselfe against the intrusion and fulminations of Pope Paulus Quintus , in the iust defence and maintenance of the prerogatiues and priuiledges of the Seignory .) There was at that time a Gentleman , a younger brother, yet of well-neere fifty yeeres old, of the Noble family of the Beraldi , named, Seignor Iacomo Beraldi , who dwelt aboue the Rialto bridge, (that famous master-piece of Architecture ) vpon the Canalla Grando , who in the Aprill of his youth, tooke to wife the Dona Lucia , daughter to Seignior Lorenzo Bursso , a Gentleman of Padua ; by whom hee had seuen children, foure sonnes, and three daughters: so as his wife and hee esteeming themselues happy in their issue, past away their time in much content and felicity: but God (for some secret and sacred reasons to his diuine Maiesty best knowne) conuerting his smiles into frownes, within the space of seuen yeeres, takes away sixe of their children, so as their eldest daughter onely remained liuing, being a young Gentlewoman of some eighteene yeres old, named, Dona Victoryna . This young Gentlewoman , being noble, rich, and faire, (three powerful and attractive Adamants, to draw the affections of many Caualiers ) she, according to her desert, had diuers Gallants who sought her in marriage: but she was of nature proud, cholericke, disdainfull and malicious; vices enow to ruine both a beauty and a fortune: but of all her sutors and seruants, he whom she best loued and affected, was one Seignior Sypontus , a Gentleman of the City, who was more noble then rich, and yet more debosht and vicious, then noble; but otherwise a very proper young Gallant: but the perfections of the body, are nothing to bee compared to the excellent qualities and indowments of the minde, for those are but the varnishes and shadowes of a meere man; but these the perfections and excellencies of a wise man, and therein noble: sith indeed wisedome is one of the truest degrees, and most essentiall parts of Nobility. Now if Victoryna loue Sypontus ; with no lesse reciprocall flame and zeale doth Sypontus affect Victoryna: for as his eyes behold the delicacy of her personage, and the sweetnesse of her beauty: so his heart loues either, and adores both: yea, so deepe an impression hath shee ingrauen in his thoughts and contemplations, that he is neuer merry till he see her, nor pleased till he inioy the felicity of her company; which Victoryna much reioyceth to see, and obserues with infinite content and delectation. Sypontus thus intangled in the snares of Victoryna's beauty, and shee likewise in those of his perfections, he resolues to court her, and seeke her in marriage, which hee performes with much affection, zeale and constancy; leauing no industry, care, curiosity, or cost, vnattempted, to inrich and crowne his desires with the precious and inestimable treasures of her loue. I should make this short Discourse swell into an ample History, to particularize, or punctually relate the Letters, Sonnets, presents, meetings, dancings, musicke, and banquets which past twixt these two louers, and wherewith Sypontus entertained his deare Mistrisse Victoryna: I will therefore purposely omit it, and couer my selfe with this excuse, which may satisfie my Reader, to consider, that Sypontus (as before) was an Italian , whose custome and nature rather exceed, then come short in all amarous ceremonies and complements: and therefore againe to resume my History; I must briefly declare, that after the protraction and recesse of a yeeres time, Victoryna consenteth to Sypontus to be his wife, so far forth as he can obtaine those of her father and mother: a fit and vertuous answere of a daughter, wherein I know not whether she bewray more modesty and discretion in her selfe, or respect and obedience to her Parents. Sypontus infinitely pleased with this sweet newes and delightfull melody, is as it were rauished and rap't vp into heauen with ioy, when flattering himselfe with this poore hope, that as Victoryna was courteous, so he should finde her Parents kind to him: hee, with much respect and honour, repaires to Beraldi and Lucia , and in faire and discreet termes acquaints them with his long affection to their daughter Victoryna ; whom (with as much earnestness as humility) he prayes to bestow her on him for his wife: but this old couple are as much displeased at Sypontus his motion, as their daughter Victoryna reioyceth therat, and so they returne him their denial in stead of their consent: onely in generall tearmes they thanke him for his loue and honour, and certifie him that they haue otherwise disposed of their daughter. Sypontus bites the lip, and Victoryna hangs her head at this their bitter and distastfull answere: but he is too generous and amarous to bee put off with this first repulse. Whereupon he imployes his Parents and kinsfolkes, (whereof some were of the chiefest ranke of Senators and Magnificos ) to draw Beraldi and Lucia to consent to this match: but in vaine: for they are deafe to those requests, and resolute in their deniall, grounding their refusal vpon Sypontus his pouerty: for they see hee is become poore; because in the last trans-marine warres, the Turkes tooke from his father and himselfe, most of his lands and possessions neere Scuttari in Dalmatia , and therfore they resolute to prouide a richer husband for their daughter. The iniquity of our times are as strange as lamentable: for in matters of marriage, Parents , without due regard either to the natures or affections of their children, still preferre gold before Grace, and many times riches before Vertue and Nobility, which concurre and meete in one personage: but diuers of these marriages, in the end, finde either shame, misery, or repentance, and sometimes all. Sypontus stormes as much as Victoryna grieues at his refusall: but to frustrate that, and prouide for this: Beraldi deales with Seignior Iouan Battista Souranza to marry his daughter Victoryna: who is a Gentleman of a good house, but farre richer then Sypontus ; but withall farre different in age: for Sypontus is but twenty eight yeeres old, and Souranza neere threescore. So as gold playing the chiefest part in this contract, Souranza is sure of Victoryna for his wife ere hee know her, or hardly hath seene her. Beraldi aduertiseth his daughter of his will and pleasure herein: so Souranza sees her with affection and ioy, and she him with disdaine and griefe: and thus this old louer, the first time entertaines his young Mistrisse with kisses, and she him with teares. He is no sooner departed, but Victoryna very sorrowfully  & pensiuely throwes herselfe to her Parents feet, and with showres of teares, very earnestly and passionately beseech them, that they will not inforce her to marry Souranza , whom (she affirmes) shee cannot loue, much lesse obey, prayes them to consider what a misery, nay what a hell it will be to her thoughts and selfe, to haue him in her bed, and Sypontus in her heart. When she could no further proceed, because her sighes cut her words in pieces, and so griefe daunting her hart, and her feare to Souranza , and affection to Sypontus , casting a milke-white Vaile ouer her vermillion cheekes, shee sinkes to the earth in a fainting cold swoone. When her hard-hearted and cruell Parents (more with astonishment then commiseration and pitty) step to her assistance, and againe bring her to her sences: who not forgetting where her speeches ended, she remembers to begin, and continue them thus: O my deare Parents, name not Souranza for my husband, but if yee will needes giue me one, then by all that blood of yours, which streameth in all the veines of my body; of two let me enioy one, either Sypontus , or my Graue; he the beginner of my ioyes, or this the ender of all my miseries and sorrowes: neither is it disobedience in mee, but feare of cruelty in your selues, that throwes me on the exigent of this request and resolution; whereon I pray, consider by the bonds of nature, and not by the rules of auarice and inhumanity. But her Father and Mother (without any respect to her youth, and teares, or regard to her affection and prayers) loue Souranza's wealth so wel, as they wil hate Sypontus his pouerty, and in it himselfe: and therefore checking Victoryna for her folly, and taxing her of indiscretion, their command and authority giues a law to her obedience and desires: And to conclude, they are so bitter, and withall so cruell to her, that within few dayes, they violently enforce her to marrie Souranza: But this enforced match will produce repentance and misery of all sides. As it is a duty in children to honour and obey their Parents, so it is no lesse in Parents carefully to regard and tenderly to affect their children: but in matches that are concluded with wealth without affection, there Parents ought proceede with iudgement, not with passion, with perswasion, not with force: for can there be any hell vpon earth, comparable to that of a discontented bed, or is it not a griefe to Parents, through their cruelty, to see their children liue in despaire, in stead of hope; in affliction instead of ioy: and to die miserably, whereas they might haue liued pleasantly and prosperously? Tis true that young folkes affections are not still well grounded, but for want of aduice and counsell many times meete with misery for felicity: yet sith marriage is a contract not for a day, but for euer, not for an houre, but for the terme  & lease of our liues, therefore Parents, in matching their children, should be rather charitable then greedy for the world, and rather compassionate then ridged: but enough of this, and againe to our History . We haue seene Victoryna , with an vnwilling willingnesse, enforc'd to marrie Souranza: wee shall not goe farre, before wee see what sharpe calamities, and bitter afflictions  & miseries this match produceth: The argument and cause, briefly is thus: Victoryna lyes with her husband Souranza, but cannot loue him: from whence (as so many lines fro their centre) spring forth many mournfull  & disastrous accidents: the little Ring of matrimony incloseth many great and waighty considerations, & among others this is not one of the least: disparity in yeeres makes no true harmony in affections; for there is no affinity twixt Ianuary and May , and it is a matter, though not impossible, yet difficult for youth and age to sympathize: Souranza his best performance of the rites and duties of marriage, is but desire: yea, his age cannot sufficiently estimate, much lesse reward the dainties of Victoryna's youth, for hee is more superstitious then amorous, as delighting rather to kisse an Image in the Church, then his wife in his bed, and not to betray the truth. I must craue leaue of modesty, to auerre that shee findes little difference twixt a Mayd and a Wife, so as her lust out-brauing her chastity, and sensuality trampling her vertues and honour vnder foote: whereas her affection should looke from Sypontus to Souranza: both shee and it contrariwise, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80022001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC3B0E&area=prose&forward=textsFT) looke Souranza to Sypontus . Dissembling pleasures, which strangle when they seeme to embrace and kisse vs, bitter Pils candid in Sugar, Cordials to the sence, but corrosiues to the soule! Yea, Victoryna in forgetting her modesty, will not remember her vow in marriage, for had she beene as vertuous as young, or as chast as faire, it had not onely beene her vertue, but her duty, to haue smothered the defects, and concealed the imperfections and impotencie of her old husband: chastity would haue perswaded her to this, but incontinencie and lust draw her to a contrary resolution. Sypontus likewise stormes and grieues at this vnwished and vnequall match of old Souranza , with his young and faire Victoryna: yea, he hates him so much, and loues her so tenderly and dearely, as hee would, but cannot preuent it: for (as before) they are married: and he in stead of the Laurell , is enforced to weare the Willow: but his griefe findes this comfort, and her discontent this consolation, that sith Victoryna is not his wife, she is his Mistresse: and sith Sypontus is not her husband, hee is her seruant, or (to vse the Venetian phrase) she is his Courtizana , and hee her Enamorata: but such leagues and contracts of vicious affections, seldome make happy ends, for as they begin in lust, so commonly they terminate in infamy and misery. Sypontus often familiarizeth with Victoryna , yea their familiarity is such, as I in modesty will not report, sith in chastity I cannot, and although they beare their affections and pleasures secret, yet custome breeding a habite, and that a second nature, Souranza is now no sooner abroad, but Sypontus is at home, so as in effect Souranza is but the shadow, and Sypontus the substance of Victoryna's husband: but these lasciuious Louers shal pay deare for their affections, Sypontus for entertaining and keeping another mans wife, and Victoryna for breaking her vow in wedlocke to her husband, in defiling his bed, and contaminating her body with the foule sinne of adultery. It had beene good and safe for them, if they had not begun these their beastly pleasures, but to giue no end to them, must needes proue dangerous and ruinous: to commit this sinne of adultery, is odious, but to perseuere therein, is most abominable before God: the reason hereof is as true as pregnant, for if the reward of a single sinne bee death, the redoubling thereof must needes be double damnation: but as it is the nature of adultery to be accompanied and waited on by other sinnes: so Victoryna is not onely content to loue Sypontus , but she makes farther progression in impiety, and will needes hate her husband Souranza: who poore honest Gentleman, sicke with the Gowt, and a Cough of the lungs, is now distastfull, and which is worse, odious to her: so that shee which should be a cordiall to his age, his age is now a corrosiue to her youth, and shee so farre forgets both her selfe and her duty, as she rather contemnes then loues him, and as hee reioyceth in her sight, so shee delights in nothing so much as in his absence, and Sypontus presence: she makes her discontents and malice to her husband, knowne to Sypontus , who doth pitty, but will not remedy them: all her speeches tend to wish her selfe in another world, or her husband not in this. Sypontus is not ignorant whereat she aymes: but although he enjoy the wife, yet he cannot finde in his heart, but is too consciencious to murther the husband: had he remained in the constancy of this resolution, he had beene happy, and not so miserable and vnfortunate to end his dayes with shame and infamy. But now behold, an vnexpected accident drawes and throwes him on headlong to perpetrate this execrable murther, for (as the Gentry and Nobility of Venice are, for the most part Marchants) so Sypontus receiueth suddaine and sorrowfull newes of two great losses befalne him, in the Leuant seas, in two seuerall ships, the one comming from Allepo , taken by the Turkish Pyrates of Rhodes , the other from Alexandria , taken, as is supposed, by one of the Duke of Ossunas Neopolitan Gallies, scowring the Ilands of the Archipelagus , in which two vessels hee lost at least seuenty thousand Zeckynes , it being the two third parts of his whole estate: and now to maintaine his greatnesse, and beare vp his port and reputation, knowing Souranza to be infinitely rich, and his wife Victoryna young, amorous, and faire: he agrees with the diuell, and so resolues to murther him, and then to marrie her: which he knowes, she aboue any earthly matter chiefely desires. Loe here the foundation and proiect of a murther, as lamentable as execrable! Necessity in base spirits may be a powerfull; but in those more vertuous and noble, it should neuer be a pernicious and prodigious counsellor: for there is as much generosity and fortitude in supporting pouerty with patience, as there is couetousnesse in being ambitious to purchase wealth with infamy. At the next enteruiew and meeting of Sypontus & Victoryna , she like a bad woma, a wicked wife,  & a wretched creature, redoubleth him her complaints and discontents against her husband; and because Sypontus knowes it wisedome to strike whiles the iron is hote, as also that Time must be taken by the forelocke: he like a wretched Politician, layes hold of this occasion and opportunity, and so consenteth to the murther of her husband, when fro this bloody resolutio, they passe to the manner how to effect it: they consult on this lamentable businesse. Victoryna (industrious in her malice) proposeth to poyson him, and so to burie him in her little garden: but Sypontus dislikes this proiect, and proffers her to murther him in his Gondola , as he comes from Lucifizina : whereon they agree. So some tenne daies after, Victoryna aduertizeth him, that her husband is to goe to his house of pleasure in the Countrey, neere Padua , on the banke of the riuer Brenta , where he is onely to stay three dayes. Sypontus imbraceth this occasion, and continually wantonizing with his wife in his absence, promiseth her to meet her husband at his returne, and then to dispatch him: which newes with a longing desire this miserable Courtizan Victoryna attends with as much impatience as impudency. Sypontus in the meane time (in fauour of twice tenne Zeckynes ) is prepared of two wicked Gondoliers or watermen, who deeply vow, and sweare to conceale this murther. So the precize day of Souranza's departure from his Countrey house, being come, Sypontus , not to faile of his promise to his Mistrisse Victoryna , in the execution of this his bloody and damnable attempt, takes his Gondola , and houers in the direct passage betwixt Lucifizina , and Venice , for Souranza his arriuall: who, poore harmelesse Gentleman , loued his young wife so tenderly and dearly, as hee thought this short time long that he had wanted from her: but hee hath seene his last of her, and alas, alas , he shall see an end of himselfe: for about fiue of the clocke in the euening (it being Summer time) his vsuall hower of returne, he takes Gondola at Lucifizina , for Venice , and neere midway twixt both, Sypontus espies him, and the sooner, because it being hot weather, and no wind stirring, Souranza had caused his courtaines to bee withdrawne. Sypontus (inflamed with boyling malice and reuenge) with all possible celerity makes towards his Gondola , the which disguized and masked hee enters, and there with his Ponyard very diuellishly stabs him three seuerall times at the hart, when falling down dead to his feet, he most barbarously cut off his beard, and nose (that he might not be known) and so throwes him into the Sea; as also his Waterman after him, that they might tell no tales: when hauing finished these execrable murthers, he with his Gondala , with all possible speed hyes first to Murano , and so lands by the Patriarchy: from thence by the Arsenall , and so to his owne house behind Saint Serui's Church, thereby to cast a fairer varnish on his villany, by landing and comming into the City another way, when being arriued at his house, he that night, by a confident seruant of his, sends Victoryna this Letter.  infinity imports thy good, and my content: the party hath drunke his fill of White and Claret, and is now gone to his eternall rest: so a little time, I hope, will wipe off thy old teares, and confirme thy new ioyes: be but as affectionate, as I secret: and as secret, as till death I will bee affectionate, and thou needst neither feare my fortunes, nor doubt thine owne: iudge what I would doe to inioy thee, and for thy sake, sith I haue already vndertaken and acted a businesse of this nature: we must for a time refraine each others company, that wee may the sooner meet, and imbrace, with more content, and lesse danger. Sypontvs.  Victoryna infinitely reioyceth at this newes, and the better to cloke her malice, vnder the vaile of secresie, she laments and complaines to her father of her husbands long absence. Souranza's Parents are by Beraldi acquainted herewith, they begin to finde the time of his stay very long, and now resolue to send his nephew, Seignior Andrea Souranza vp the riuer Brenta , to know the cause thereof: hee passeth and repasseth the Sluce of Lucifizina , and brings word that he departed thence for Venice , in a Gondola , foure dayes since: Victoryna his wife grieues, and weepes at his absence, so doe his owne Parents and friends, who enquire of all sides, but finde comfort or newes from none, what is become of him. And here, Reader, before thy curiosity carry thee further, I coniure thee to stand astonished  & wonder, at the inscrutable and wonderfull iudgement of God, in the detection of this murther: For Fishermen some [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=80022001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC3B0E&area=prose&forward=textsFT) eight dayes casting out their nets betwixt the Ilands of la Lazareto and Saint George Maiore , bring vp this dead body of murthered Souranza , being well apparelled: but chiefly for their owne discharge, they bring the dead corps to Venice , and land him at Saint Markes stayres, where they extend and expose his body to bee knowne of passengers: now behold further Gods miraculous prouidence, in the discouery and finding out hereof: for amongst the numberlesse number of spectators and walkers, who daily, and almost hourely frequent and adorne that famous Burse and incomparable Palace, it happened that Andrea Souranza cast his eye on this dead and sea-withered body: on whom he lookes with as much stedfastnesse as curiosity, as if Nature had made his liuing body a part of that dead; or as if his hot blood had some sympathy and affinity with that of the dead personage, which long since the coldnesse of the Sea had congealed and frozen: but at last espying a red spot in his necke (vnder his right eare) that he brought into the world with him, and which all the influence and vertue of the water of the Sea had not power to deface and wash away: as also obseruing a wart ouer his left eye- lid, which Nature had giuen his birth, and his youth his age: hee passionately cryes out before the world, that it is the body of his Vnkle, Seignior Iouan Baptista Souranza: so it is visited by his Parents and friends, and knowne to bee the same: so they carry him to an adioyning house, and there deuesting it naked, finde that hee hath three seuerall wounds in his body, either of a Sword or Ponyard, which giues matter of talke, and administreth cause of admiration in all the City: so they bury him honourably, according to his ranke and degree, and all knowing him to be murthered, infinitely bewaile his vntimely, and lament his mournfull death: but especially his wife Victoryna , who hauing formerly plaid the strumpet, then the murtheresse, now takes on the Maske, and assumes the representation of an Hypocrite; outwardly seeming to dye for sorrow, when God, and her foule and vlcerated conscience knowes, that inwardly her heart leapes for ioy, thus to be depriu'd and freed of her old husband. Yea, and the more to bleare the eyes, and eclipse the iudgement of the world, for casting the least shadow of suspition on her, for this vnnaturall murther: she and her whole family take on blacke and mourning Attire, and for her selfe in two moneths after, neuer goes foorth her house, except to the Church where her husband was buried: where her hypocrisie is so infinitely feigned: and dissembling, that shee is often obserued to bedew and wash his Tombe with her teares: but these Crocadile teares of hers, and these her false and treacherous sorrowes shall not auaile her: for although Gods diuine and sacred Maiestie be mercifull in his iustice, yet he is so iust in his mercies, as neither the politique secrecie of Sypontus , nor the hypocriticall sorrowes of Victoryna , for this cruell murther, shall goe either vnmask'd, or vnpunished: but in their due appointed time, they shall be brought forth in their colours, and made publique examples, as well of infamy, as destruction for the same: the manner is thus: The deceased Signiour Iouan Souranza hath a younger brother, named Signiour Hieronymo Souranza: who hauing carefully and curiously obserued, that his sister in law Victoryna , neuer perfectly nor dearely loued his brother her husband, and that shee was neither so familiar, nor dutifull to him, as it behoou'd her, during the terme of her marriage: which partly he attributed to the disparity of their yeeres, in respect of the frozennesse of his age, and the heat and freshnesse of her youth. Hee began vehemently to suspect her of this murther, which hee often reuolu'd and ruminated in his minde, as if the suggestion and perswasion thereof, not onely bore probability but truth with it: to which end, as the affection of a true friend (much more of a brother) should passe beyond the Graue, and not remaine intomb'd, and buried in the dust thereof: he is resolu'd to put his best wits and inuention vpon the tenter-hookes, to discouer and reueale the same: to which end, hee breakes with Victoryna's Gentlewoman , who wayted on her in her Chamber, and who indeed was his owne Neece Felicia , to know what Gentlemen chiefely frequented her Lady. Felicia informes her Vnkle, that Sygnior Sypontus is many nights with her, that there is much affection and familiarity betweene them, and that he sends her many Letters. Her Vnkle glad of this glimmering light, which hee hopes will produce a greater and perfecter, coniures her to intercept some of his Letters, for the more effectuall discouerie of his Brother  & her Vnkles death. So Felicia promiseth her best care  & fidelity herein, and shortly effecteth it: for in few dayes after being sent by her Lady Victoryna to a Casket of hers, to fetch her a new payre of Romish Gloues, shee opening an Iuory Box, therein findes a Letter; which she reades, and seeing it signed by Sypontus , shee thinks it no sinne to be false to her Lady, and true to her Vnkle, and so very secretly and safely sends it him; which indeede was the very Letter we haue formerly seene and read: and now is his iealousie and suspition confirm'd. So vowing and sacrificing reuenge to his dead and murthered brother, away he goes to three chiefe Iudges of the forty, who sit on criminall causes, and very passionately accuseth Sypontus and Victoryna for the murther, committed on the person of his brother Signiour Iouan Baptista Souranza , at sea: whereupon they are both committed prisoners, but sequestred in seuerall Chambers, Sypontus is first examined, then Victoryna: they both very constantly deny the murther, and with many sugred words, and subtill euasions, intimate and insinuate their innocencies therein: so the next day the Iudges produce Sypontus his owne Letter; the sight whereof extremely afflicteth and vexeth him: but he is constant in his deniall, and resolute in that constancie, and so takes on a brazen face; and with many asseuerations and imprecations, againe and againe denies it, auerring it is not his hand, but a meere imposture and inuention of his enemies, who haue counterfaited it, purposely to procure his ruine and destruction: yet inwardly to himselfe he feareth all is discouered, and that there is no meanes left him to escape death, whose image and forme hee now too apparantly and fatally sees before his eyes. So he is sent backe to his prison, and his Iudges in the interim consult on his fact; where he is no sooner arriued, but bolting his Chamber priuately to himselfe, he considering that either Victoryna , or some for her, had betrayed him by his owne Letter, he in the bitter fury of choller and passion throwes away his Hat, now crosseth his armes, and then beates his brest, and stamping with his feet, at last very low to himselfe bandeth forth these speeches: And is it possible, that I must now lose my life through Victoryna her folly and treachery, into whose hands I repos'd both my secrets and it? Haue I done what I haue done for her sake, and is this the requitall she giues me? And sith there is no other witnesse, must mine owne Letter be produced in iustice against me? What will I not doe? what haue I not done for her sake? Woe is mee, that I should liue to be rewarded with this monstrous and inhumane ingratitude; when for sorrow and indignation, not able to containe himselfe, he takes Pen and Paper, and writes Victoryna this ensuing Letter.  feigned, and that thou, whom I trusted with all my secrets, art now become the onely woman of the world to betray me? I haue hazarded my life for thy sake, and must I now be so vnfortunate and wretched, to lose it through thy treacherie? When I bore matters with such care and secrecie, that no witnesse whatsoeuer could be produced against me, must mine owne Letter, which was safely deliuered thee, be brought forth to conuict me of my crime, and so to incurre death, which otherwise I had auoyded? Is this thy reward of my loue? Is this thy recompence of my affection? O Victoryna, Victoryna! Such is my tender esteeme of thy sweet youth and beauty, that had I enioyed a thousand liues, I would haue reputed my selfe happy, to haue lost them all for thy sake and seruice: and hauing but one, wilt thou be so cruell to depriue me thereof? But that my loyaltie and my affection may shine in thy malice; take this for thy comfort, that as I haue euer liu'd, so I will now dye thy true Seruant and faithfull Louer. Sypontvs.  But obserue here the errour of Sypontus his iudgement: for whiles he imputes it to Victoryna's treacherie, that this his Letter will occasion his death; hee is so irreligious and impious, as hee lookes not vp to heauen, to consider that the detection thereof proceedes from Gods immediate finger and prouidence. No: No. For the diuell yet holdes his thoughts so fast captiuated & intangled in the snares of Victoryna's beauty, as he hath not yet the grace to looke from his crime, to his repentance; nor consequently from Earth to Heauen: but like a prophane Libertine and vnregenerate person, being within a small point of time neere his end, he yet thinks not of his soule nor of God , but onely dallies away the remainder of his houres, in the miserable contemplation of his fond affection and beastly sensuality. By this time Victoryna hath receiu'd his Letter; at the newes and reading whereof, such is the passion of her frenzie, which she (though vniustly) termes loue: that she is all in teares, sighes, and lamentable exclamations: she knowes it impossible for any other of the world to be the reuealer of Sypontus his Letter, but onely her Mayd Felicia , whom in her vncharitable reuenge, she curseth to the pit of hell: but that which addes a greater torment to her torments, and a more sensible degree of affliction to her miserable sorrowes, is, to see that her Sypontus (whom by many degrees she loues farre dearer then her life) sinisterly suspecteth her fidelity towards him: yea so farre, as he not onely calls her affection, but her trechery in question: and this indeed seemes to drowne her in her teares. But yet notwithstanding so feruent is her loue towards him, as the feare of his death drawes her to a resolution of her owne: so if Sypontus dye, she vowes she will be her owne accuser, and so not liue, but dye with him. Strange effects of loue, or rather of folly, sith loue being irregular, and taking false obiects, (in its true character) is not loue, but folly: to which end, calling for inke and paper, she bitterly weeping, indites and sends him these few lines, in answere of his.  Lady who should not then deserue either to see or liue in the world, if Victoryna should any way proue trecherous to Sypontus , who hath still beene so true and kind to her. But beleeue me, Deare Sypontus , and I speake it in presence of God , vpon perill of my soule, I am as innocent as that witch, that diuell, my maid Felicia is guilty of the producing of thy Letter; which I feare will prooue thy death, and reioyce that in it, it shall likewise prooue mine. For to cleere my selfe of ingratitude and trechery, as I haue liued, so I will dye with thee: that as we mutually participated the ioyes of life, so we may the torments of death: for although thy letter accuse me not of my Husband Souranza's murther, yet that my affection may shine in my loyalty, and that in my affection, I will not suruiue, but dye with thee: for I will accuse my selfe to my Iudges, not onely as accessary, but as author of that murther: and this resolution of mine I write thee with teares, and will shortly seale it with my blood. Victoryna.  Sypontus , in the middest of his perplexities and sorrowes, receiues this Letter from Victoryna , the sweetnesse of whose affection and constancy, much reuiues his ioy, and comforteth him. For now her innocency defaceth his suspition of her ingratitude and trechery: and withall, he plainly sees, and truly beleeues, that it was Felicia , not Victoryna , who brought this letter to light. But when hee descends to the latter part of her Letter, and findes her resolution to dye with him, then he condemnes his former errour in taxing her, and in requitall, loues her so tenderly and dearely, that hee vowes he will be so farre from accusing her, as accessary of her husbands murther, as both the Racke, and his death shall cleare and proclaime her innocency. Had the grounds of these feruent and reciprocall affections of Victoryna and Sypontus , been laid in vertue, as they were in vice; or in chastity, and not in lust and adultery, they would haue giuen cause to the whole world, as iustly to praise, as now to dispraise them, and then to haue been as ambitious of their imitation, as now of their contempt and detestation. So Sypontus (as before) hauing fully and definitiuely resolued not to accuse, but to cleare Victoryna of this murther, as also that he would dye alone, and leaue her youth and beauty to the inioying of many more earthly pleasures: he expecting hourely to be sent for before his Iudges, to sit vpon his torment or death, thinking himselfe bound both in affection and honour, to signifie Victoryna his pleasure herein, hee craues his Iaylors absence, and with much affection and passion, writes her this his last Letter:  repent me of my rash credulity, conceiued against thy affection and constancy, and now lay the fault of the discouery of my Letter, where it is, and ought to bee, on Felicia , not on thy selfe. It is with a sorrowfull, but true presage, that I foresee, my life hastens to her period: the Racke is already prepared for my torments,  & I hourely expect when I shall be fetch't to receiue them, which for thy sake I will imbrace and suffer, with as much constancy as patience: I will deny mine owne guiltinesse the first time, but not the second: but in my torments and death I will acquit thee of thine, with as true a resolution, as Earth expects to lose me, and I hope to finde Heauen . Therefore by all the bonds of loue and affection that euer haue been betweene vs, I first pray, then coniure thee to change thy resolution, and to stand on thine innocency. For if thou wilt, or desirest to gratifie me with thy last affection and courtesie at my death; let mee beare this one content and ioy to my graue, that Victoryna will liue for Sypontus his sake, though Sypontus dye for hers. Sypontvs.  He had no sooner sent away this his Letter to Victoryna , but he himselfe is sent for to appeare before his Iudges, who vpon his second examination and denyall, adiudge him to the Racke; which hee indures with admirable patience and constancy. Yea, he cannot be drawne to confesse, but stands firme in his deniall, and not onely cleeres himselfe, but also acquits Victoryna: Hieronymo Souranza doth notwithstanding earnestly follow and sollicite the Iudges, and God , out of his immense mercy and profound prouidence so ordaineth, that their consciences suggest and prompt them, that Sypontus is the actor of this execrable murther. Wherfore the next day they administer him double torment: when lo, his resolution and strength failing him, he acknowledgeth the Letter his,  & confesseth it was himself that had murthered Seignior Iouan Battista Souranza: but withall protesteth constantly that Victoryna is innocent, and no way accessary hereunto. The Iudges reioyce at Sypontus his confession, as much as they grieue at the foulenesse of his fact: and so, although they were also desirous to hang him, yet considering hee was a Venecian Gentleman , (and consequently had a voyce in the great Councell of the Seignory, ) they adiudge him the next day to lose his head, betwixt the two Columnes at Saint Markes Place , and so for that night send him backe to his prison, to prepare himselfe to dye. Sypontus is no sooner departed from them, but they consult on Victoryna , whether she were guilty, or innocent of her husband Souranza's murther, but they differ in opinion: some would likewise haue her racked: but others of them more aduised and modest, reply, that Sypontus his Letter intimated onely his affection to Victoryna , but no way her malice to her dead husband Souranza , nor that she was any way guilty or accessary to his murther: so they resolue to forbeare her, and not to put her to the torment, except Sypontus accuse her at his execution. Now the very night that he was to dye the next morne, hee infinitely desires his Iaylor to permit him to conferre with Victoryna , and to take his last leaue of her, which is denyed him, as hauing receiued command from authority to the contrary; whereat extremely grieuing, hee is called away by some Diuines, whom the charity of that graue Senate send him, to prepare and direct his soule, in her passage and transmigration to Heauen . So passing the night in teares and prayers for the foulenesse of his crime, the morne being come, and nine of the clocke strucken, hee is brought to the scaffold, where a world of people concurre and flocke from all parts of the City, to see this wretched and vnfortunate Gentleman act the last Scene and part of his life vpon this infamous Theater . Heere Sypontus freely confesseth his foule murther of Souranza , but is yet so vaine and wretched, as he takes it to his death, that Victoryna is absolutely innocent heereof: hee seemes to bee very repentant and sorrowfull for all his sinnes in generall, and for this murther in particular. For expiation and reward hereof, his head is seuered from his body: a iust recompence and punishment for so vicious and bloody a Gentleman, who adhering to adultery more then chastity, to reuenge, then charity, and to the diuell, then God , forgot himselfe so farre, as to commit this execrable and lamentable murther. Now, the order and Decorum of our History , leades vs from dead Sypontus , to liuing Victoryna , who, I know not whether more grieue at his death, or reioyce, that on the Racke and scaffold he hath acquitted her of her husbands murther. In a word, it is remarkable to behold the vanity  & inconstancy of this female Monster: for contrary to her vowes, and repugnant to her Letters and teares, Sypontus is no sooner dead, but her affection towards him dyes with him: yea, his blood is scarce so soone cold, as her zeale and friendship: for she now holds it a pure folly to cast away her youth, and life, if she may preserue the one, and saue the other; and therefore resolues to try her best art and wit, to make her innocency passe currant with her Iudges: yea, so desirous and ambitious is shee to liue, as her female heart hath drawne on this masculine fortitude and generosity, that if occasion present, shee will constantly both out-dare, and out-braue the torments of the Racke, thereby to preuent her death. Some three dayes after Sypontus was executed, the Iudges againe sit and consult on Victoryna but finding no euidence nor witnesse to accuse her, they at first are of opinion to discharge and free her: onely they deeme it requisite to terrifie, but not to torment her with the Racke, before they giue her her liberty: whereunto they all agree. So they send for her, and threaten her with the Racke: but she vowes, that all the torments of the world shall neuer inforce her to confesse an vntruth, and that shee neuer had the least suspition that Sypontus was guilty of the execrable murther of her husband: her Iudges will not yet beleeue her; so they cause her to be carried to the Racke: whereunto shee very cheerfully and patiently permits her selfe to bee fastened, bidding the Executioner doe his worst: which constancy of hers, her Iudges seeing and hearing, they, in pitty and commiseration, as well of her youth and beauty, as to her descent, and the teares and prayers of venerable old Beraldi her father, cause her to be loosed, and so in open Court acquite and discharge her. Here we see this wretched Courtisana Victoryna acquitted of her Iudges for her husbands murther, so as triumphing more in her good fortune, then her innocency, she now thinkes the storme of her punishment past and ore-blowne, and that no future can possibly be reserued for her, or she for it: but her hopes will deceiue her: for although shee haue made her peace with Earth , yet she hath not with Heauen ; and although she haue deluded the eyes of her Iudges , yet shee shall not those of God ; but when his appoynted houre, and her due time is come, then her crimes and sinnes, her adultery and murther shall draw downe vengeance from heauen to her confusion. In the meane time wee shall see this Monster and disgrace of her sexe, make such bad vse of her former danger, as shee will againe adde blood to blood, and murther to murther: but God will reserue not onely the rod of his wrath for her correction, but the full viols of his indignation for her confusion; as the sequell will shew thee. Sixe moneths are scarce past, since the murther of her husband Souranza , and the execution of her Enamorata Sypontus , but shee hath already quite forgotten these two mournfull and tragicall accidents: and which is more, she is so frollicke and youthfull, as shee hath throwne off her mourning attire, and drawne on her rich apparell, and glittering iewels, whereof the curiosity of the nobler sort of Gentlemen and Ladies of the City take exact obseruation: and although Beraldi and Lucia , her father and mother herein taxe her of indiscretion and immodesty, yet shee thinks her selfe exempt of their commands, and therefore will doe it, out of the ambitious priuiledge of her owne vncontrollable authority and wilfulnesse. Besides, her thoughts are so youthfull, and her carriage so light, as notwithstanding she came (as it were) but now from burying of her first husband, yet she is resolued without delay, to haue a second: her father and mother checke her of leuity and inciuility in imbracing this resolution: but in vaine: for her impudency returnes them this immodest answere, that shee will not trifle away her time, but marry. They aduize her to be cautious, and to doe nothing rashly in this her second match, that the misfortune and scandall of her first, may no more reflect on her. But she will make choyce for her selfe by the eyes of her youth, and not by those of their age; by those of her owne fancy, and not by these of their election. Her Husband Souranza dyed rich, both in lands and moneyes, and his Widdow Victoryna , without any opposition, inioyeth all: so she needs not looke out for Suters, for there are Gallants enow who sue and seeke her: but of them all, he whom she best and chiefly affecteth, is one Seignior Loudouicus Fassino , a very neat and proper young Gentleman of the City, rich, and well descended; his parents and kinsmen for the most part being Clarissimo's and Senators , and all of them Gentlemen of Venice ; and him Victoryna desires, and resolues to make her husband, grounding her chiefest reason and affection on this resolution and foundation, that as Souranza was too old for her, so Fassino was young enough, and therefore fit to be her husband, and she his wife; measuring him wholly by his exterior personage, and not so much as once prying either into his vices or vertues. Fassino , who carried a vicious and pernicious heart vnder a pleasing gesture and tongue, and louing Victoryna's wealth more then her beauty, obseruing her affection and respect to him, seekes, courts, and wins her. Her Parents vnderstanding hereof, as also that Fassino is a vicious and debosh't Gentleman , with all their possible power and authority, they seeke to diuert their daughter from him. But she is deafe to their requests, and resolued, that as shee followed the streame of their commands in her first match, so shee will now the current of her owne pleasures and affections in this her second: and so, to the wonder of Venice , and the griefe of all her parents and friends, before shee had aboue ten dayes conferred with Fassino , shee marries him. But this match shall not succeed according to their desires: for Victoryna shall shortly repent it, and Fassino as soone rue and smart for it; sith it is a maxime , that sudden affections prooue seldome prosperous: for if they haue not time to settle and take roote, they are incident as soone to fade as flourish, especially if they are contracted and grounded more for lust then loue, and more for wealth then Vertue. The first moneth of this marriage, Fassino keepes good correspondence and obseruance with his wife, but thence forth hee breakes Pale, and rangeth: for the truth is, although hee were but a young Gentleman; yet (which is lamentable) he was an old whoremaster: which lasciuious profession of his, threatens the ruine, not onely of his health, but of his fortune and reputation: so now, when he should be at home, he is abroad: yea, not onely by day, but by night, that vpon the whole, Victoryna is more a Widdow then a Wife: at which vnlook'd and vnwish'd for newes, she not onely bites the lip, but very often puts finger in her eye and weepes: for it gripes and grieues her at heart, to see her selfe thus slighted, neglected, and abus'd by Fassino: whom, of all the Gallants of the Citie, she had elected and chosen for her husband: shee is infinitely grieu'd hereat, and yet her griefe and sorrow infinitely exceedes her iealousie: and now as gracelesse as she is, she thinks God hath purposely sent her this lasciuious Fassino for her second Husband, as a iust plague and punishment, to reuenge her adultery committed against Souranza her first: so, had she had more grace, and lesse vanity and impiety, shee would haue made better vse of this consideration, and not so soone forgotten it, and in it, her selfe. Now as it is the nature of iealousie, to haue more eyes then Argus , and so to pry and see euery where: Victoryna , her curiosity, or rather her malice herein, findes out, that her Husband Fassino familiarly frequenteth and vseth the company of many Curtezans , especially of the Lady Paleriana , one of the most famous and reputed beauties of Venice: and this newes indeed strikes her at the very gall with sorrow and vexation; faine shee would reforme and remedy this vice of her Husband: but how she knowes not, for she sees little or no hope to reclaime him, sith hee not onely tenderly loues Paleriana , but which is worse, she apparantly sees, that for her sake, he contemnes her selfe and her company: for when he comes home, hee hath no delight in her, but only in his Lute or Books, which is but to passe his melancholly, for his Lady Paleriana's absence, till hee againe reuisit her: so as wholly neglected, and as I may truly say, almost forsaken of her Husband, she knowes not what to doe, nor how to beare her selfe in those furious stormes of her griefe, and miserable tempest of her iealousie. But of two different courses to reclaime him from this his sinne of Whoredome, shee takes the worst: for in stead of counselling and disswading her Husband, shee torments him with a thousand scandalous and iniurious speeches: but this, in stead of quenching, doth but only bring oyle to the flame of his lust: for if he repaired home to her seldome before, now hee scarce at all comes neere her: so as shee is a Wife; yet no Wife: and hath a Husband, yet no Husband: but this is not the way to reclaime him, for faire speeches and sweet exhortations may preuaile, when choller cannot. And now it is, that this wretched  & execrable Lady againe assumes bloody resolutions against her second Husband, as she had formerly done against her first, vowing that he shall dye, ere she will liue to bee thus contemned and abused of him: yea, her hot loue to him is so soone growne cold, and her feruent affection already so frozen, that now she thinkes on nothing else but how to be reuenged, and to be rid of him; and is so impious and gracelesse, as she cares not how, nor in what manner soeuer she send him from this world to another: for the diuell hath drawne a resolution from her, or rather she from the diuell, that heere he shall not much longer liue. Good God ! what an impious and wretched fury of hell will Victoryna proue her selfe heere on Earth? for the blood and life of one husband cannot quench the thirst of her lust and reuenge, but shee must and will imbrue her hands in that of two: as if it were not enough for her to trot, but that she will needs gallop and ride poast to hell. O what pitty is it to see a Lady so wretched, and execrable! O what an execrable wretchednesse is it, to see a Lady so inhumane, and so deuoyd of pitty! But the diuell is strong with her, because her faith is weake with God: therefore she will aduance, she will not retire, in this her bloody designe and resolution. Wherfore we shall shortly see Fassino his adultery punished with death, by his wife Victoryna's reuenge; and this murther of hers iustly rewarded and reuenged with the punishment of her owne: the bloodier our actions are, the seuerer Gods iudgements, and the sharper his reuenge will be. Of all sorts and degrees of inhumane and violent deaths, this wretched Lady Victoryna thinkes poyson the surest, and yet the most secret to dispatch her husband. This inuention came immediately from the diuell, and is onely practised by his members: of which number she will desperately and damnably make her selfe one: her lust and reuenge, like miserable aduocates and fatall Orators, perswade her to this execrable attempt, wherein by cutting off her husbands life, shee shall finde that she likewise casts away her owne. So neither Grace nor Nature preuailing, she sends for an Apothecary , named Augustino ; and when shee hath coniured, and he promised his secresie, shee acquaints him, that her new husband Fassino keepes Courtisans to her nose, and daily and hourely offereth her many other insupportable abuses and disgraces; in requitall and reuenge whereof shee is resolued to poyson him, and prayes him to vndertake and performe it, and that shee will reward him with three hundred Zekynes for his labour. Of all professions aud faculties, there are good and bad: Augustino loues God too well, heerein to obey the diuell: he hath too much grace, to bee so impious and gracelesse, and vowes that hee will not buy gold at so deare a rate, as the price of blood; so as a good Christian , and true child of God , he not onely refuseth Victoryna's motion and proffer, but in religious termes seekes to diuert and perswade her from this her bloody attempt. But she is resolute in her malice, and wilfull in her reuenge, and therefore will performe it her selfe, sith this Augustino will not: so (by a second hand) she procures poyson from a strange Emperike , whereof the City of Venice , more then other of Italy , aboundeth: so shee onely waits for an opportunity, which very shortly, though, alas , too too soone, presents it selfe, the manner thus: It is impossible that Fassino his dissolute life and extreme deboshing can keepe him long from sicknesse; for this punishment is alwayes incident and hereditary to that sinne. Hee complaines thereof to his wife Victoryna , who receiues this newes rather with gladnesse then commiseration and pitty: and so taking his bed, he prayes her to make him some comfortable hot broth for his stomacke: which newes shee heares, and imbraceth inwardly with ioy, outwardly with disdaine. For albeit she layes hold of this opportunity to poyson him, yet she dissembles her malice; and the better to colour her villany, because shee knowes it the smoother and shorter way to bee reuenged in poysoning him, she wil not make the broth her selfe, but commands her maid Felicia to doe it, (of whom we haue formerly spoken, in the discouery of Sypontus his Letter to her Vnkle Hieronymo Souranza: ) which trecherous office of hers, our malicious and diuellish Victoryna her Lady and Mistrisse, hath now a plot in her head, to requite with an execrable and hellish recompence: for whiles Felicia is boyling of the broth, her Lady Victoryna trips to her chamber and closet, and fethceth out the poyson, inueloped in a paper, wherof she takes two parts and brings downe with her, and whiles she had purposely sent Felicia from the fire, she runnes and throwes it into the broth, which for the present no whit altered the colour thereof: so Fassino calling for it, this poore innocent Gentlewoman Felicia , (not suspecting or dreaming of poyson) giues it him, which (as ignorant thereof) hee suppes vp; and this was about nine or ten of the clocke in the morning. Now whiles Felicia is acting this mournfull Tragedy in Fassino his chamber, her Lady Victoryna is acting another in hers; for shee takes the other third part of the poyson, and secretly opening Felicia's trunke, puts it into a painted boxe which shee found therein, and so lockes it againe, hoping (though indeed with a wretched and hellish hope) that her husband being dead, his body opened, and the poyson found in her trunke, she would giue out that Felicia had poysoned him with broth that morne, and this found in her chest, would make her guilty of the murther; for the which she knew shee must needs dye. See, see, the diuellish double malice of this wretched Lady Victoryna , as well to her husband Fassino , as her maid Felicia ! But as finely as the diuell hath taught her to spinne the thred of this her malice and reuenge; yet though her plot haue taken effect and hold of her husband, neuerthelesse she shall in the end faile of hers to innocent Felicia : in the interim , though to the eyes of the world it seeme at first to succeed according to her desires by the bye, yet it shall not in the maine: but that murther, and this treason of Victoryna shall not goe long either vndetected, or vnpunished. This poyson working in Fassino his stomacke and body, begins by degrees to cut off his vitall spirits, so as his strength failes him, his red cheekes already look pale and earthly, and his body infinitely swels: he calls for his wife Victoryna , who with all hast and expedition tells her secretly, that he feares, Felicia hath poysoned him with the broth shee gaue him in the morning; and so requesteth her to send for his parents and friends to bee present at his death, for liue hee could not. Victoryna like a dissembling she-diuell, teares her haire for anger, and for meere sorrow seemes to drowne her selfe in her teares at this newes, kisseth and fawnes on her husband, and in all possible haste sends away of all sides for his kinsfolkes and friends, who hastily repaire thither, and finde Fassino almost dead: so they, with teares, inquire his sicknesse, when with open voyce his wife Victoryna cries out, that her wretched maid Felicia had with broth, that morne, poysoned him; which Fassino his memory and tongue yet serue him to confesse and auerre, word for word, as his wife Victoryna had related them: whereat they are all sorrowfull, and weepe, and then, and there cause Felicia to be apprehended and shut fast in a chamber; who (poore harmelesse young Gentlewoman ) is amazed at the terrour and strangenesse of this newes, and cries out and weepes so bitterly, as she seemes to melt her selfe into teares, onely shee knowes her selfe innocent, and yet feares that this malice and reuenge proceeds to her from her Lady Victoryna . Whiles Felicia is thus vnder sure keeping, her Master Fassino dyes: which newes is soone dispersed and divulged abroad, to the griefe and admiration of the whole City. The next morne the criminall Iudges are aduertised hereof, who repaire to Fassino his house, who by this time is dead, and there see his breathlesse carkasse, which they ordaine to be opened: the poyson is apparantly found on his stomacke, in its naturall and pristine colour, when examining first Fassino , then Victoryna's parents, they report Fassino his owne words vttered a little before his death, that Felicia had that [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=88022001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC3B0E&area=prose&forward=textsFT) more poisoned him with broth: which is auerred by Victorina , who saith, she saw her giue it him. So they send away poore Felicia to prison, but yet with a vehement suspition, that this poysoned arrow came out of Victoryna her owne quiuer, which they the sooner beleeue, in respect of her former troubles, and suspition for the murther of her first husband Souranza: so the Iudges returne and betake themselues, that very instant, to their Tribunall of Iustice , in the Dukes Palace of Saint Markes: where they send for Felicia , who is brought them, vnacompanied of any: for as misfortune would, both her Vnkle Hieronymo , and her Cousin Andrea Souranza , were then at Corfu , imployed in some publike affaires for the Seignory . The Iudges examine Felicia , concerning the broth and poyson she gaue her Master. Shee bitterly sighing and weeping, confesseth the broth, but denyes the poyson; vowing by her part and hope of Heauen , she neuer touched nor knew what poyson was, and desired no fauor of the, if it were found or proued against her; withall, she acquaints the, yt she feares it is a tricke of malice  & reuenge, clapt on her by her Lady Victoryna , for the discouery of Sypontus his letter. And to speak truth, the Iudges in their hearts partly adhere  & concur with her in this opinion: they demand her whether her Lady Victoryna touched this broth, either by the fire or the bed? She, according to the truth, answeres, that to her knowledge or sight, she touched it not, nor no other but her selfe. So they send her againe to prison, and returne speedily to Fassino his house; where committing Victoryna to a sure guard, they ascend her chamber and closet, search all her trunkes, caskets and boxes, for poyson, but finde none: and the like they doe to Felicia's trunkes, which they breake open, shee hauing the key; and in a boxe finde a quantity of the same poyson, whereby it was apparant she absolutely poysoned her Master Fassino . The Iudges hauing thus found out and reuealed, as they thought, the true author of this murther, they descend, againe examine Victoryna , and so acquit her. Poore Felicia is aduertised hereof; wherat she is amazed  & astonished, and thinks that some witch or diuel cast it there for her destructio. She is again sent for before her Iudges , who produce the poyson found in her trunk: she denyes both the poyson and the murther, with many sighes  & teares: so they adiudge her to the racke, which tormet she suffereth with much patience and constancy; notwithstanding, her Iudges considering that she made and gaue Fassino the broth, that none touched it but her self, that he dyed of it, and that they found the remainder of the poyson in her trunke, they thinke her the murtherer; so they pronounce sentence, that the next morne shee shall bee hanged at S. Markes place. She poore soule is returned to her prison; she bewailes her misfortune thus to die, and be cast away innocently, taxing her Iudges of iniustice, as her soule is ready to answere it to God. All Venice prattleth of this cruell murther committed by this yong Gentlewoman ; but for her Lady Victoryna , she triumphs and laughs like a Gypsey, to see how with one stone she hath giuen two strokes, and how one poore drug hath freed her this day of her husband Fassino , and will to morrow of Felicia , of whom she reioyceth in her selfe, that now shee hath cryed quittance for the discouery of Sypontus his Letter, which procured his death: but her hopes may deceiue her, or rather, the diuell will deceiue both her and her hopes too. How true or false, righteous or sinfull our actions be, God in his due time will make them appeare in their naked colours, and reward those with glory, and these with shame. The next morne, according to the laudable custome of Venice , the mourners of the Seignory accompany our sorrowfull Felicia to the place of execution, where she modestly ascendeth the ladder, with much silence, pensiuenesse and affliction: at the sight of whose youth and beauty, most of that great infinity of spectators cannot refraine from teares, and commiserating and pitying, that so sweet a young Gentlewoman should come to so infamous and vntimely a death: when Felicia lifting vp her hands, and erecting her eyes and heart towards Heauen , she briefly speakes to this effect: she takes Heauen and Earth to witnesse that she is innocent of the poysoning of her Master Fassino , and ignorant how that poyson should be brought into her trunke, that as her knowledge cannot accuse, so her conscience will not acquite her Lady Victoryna of that fact, onely shee leaues the detection and iudgement thereof to God, that being ready to forsake the world, sith the world is resolued to forsake her, shee as much triumphs in her innocency, as grieues at her misfortune: and that she may not onely appeare in Earth , but be found in Heauen a true Christian , shee first forgiues her Lady Victoryna , and her Iudges , and then beseecheth God to forgiue her all her sinnes; whereunto shee humbly and heartily prayes all that are present, to adde their prayers to hers: and so she begins to take off her band, and to prepare her selfe to dye. Now, Christian Reader , what humane wisedome, or earthly capacity would here conceiue or thinke, that there were any sublunary meanes left for this comfortlesse Gentlewoman Felicia , either to hope for life, or to flatter her selfe that she could auoyd death? But lo, as the children of God cannot fall, because he is the defender of the innocent, and the protector of the righteous, therefore we shall see to our comforts, and finde to Gods glory, that this innocent young Gentlewoman shall be miraculously freed of her dangers and punishment, and her inueterate Arch-enemie Victoryna brought in her stead, to receiue this shamefull death, in expiation of the horrible murthers of her two husbands, which God will now discouer, and make apparent to the eyes of the world: for as the Fryers and Nunnes prepare Felicia , to take her last farewell of this world, and so to shut vp her life in the direfull and mournfull Catastrophe of her death; Behold, by the prouidence and mercy of God , the Apothecarie Augustino (of whom this our History hath formerly made an honest and religious mention) arriues from Cape I'stria: and hauing left his ship at Malmocco , lands in a Gondola at Saint Markes stayres; when knowing and seeing an execution towards, hee thrusts himselfe in amongst the crowd of people: where beholding so young and so faire a Gentlewoman, ready to die: hee demands of those next by him, what shee was, and her crime: when being answered, that her name was Felicia , a wayting Gentlewoman to the Lady Victoryna , who had poysoned her Master Fassino: at the very first report of the names of Victoryna , and her husband Fassino, Augustino his blood flasheth vp in his face, and his heart began to beat within him, when demanding if no other were accessary to this murther: he was informed, that her Lady Victoryna was vehemently suspected thereof: but shee was cleared, and onely Felicia , this young Gentlewoman , found guilty therof: which words were no sooner deliuered him, but God putting into his heart and remembrance, that this Lady Victoryna would haue formerly seduced him for three hundred Zeckynes , to haue poysoned her husband Fassino , hee confidently beleeuing this young Gentlewoman innocent hereof, with all possible speed, as fast as his legges could driue, he runnes vp to the Southeast part of the corner of the Gallery of the Dukes Palace , where the Officers sit to see Execution done; the which hee requesteth for that time to stop, because he hath something to say concerning the murther of Signiour Fassino . Whereupon they call out to the Executioner to forbeare: which bred infinite admiration in all the Spectators, as wondering at the cause and reason therof, when in constant and discreet termes, Augustino informes the Iudges , that he thinkes Felicia innocent, and her Lady Victoryna guilty of this murther, and so relates them the manner, time, and place, where Victoryna her selfe seduced him to poyson her Husband Fassino , how she proffered him three hundred Zeckynes to performe it, which he refused, and to the vtmost of his power, sought to disswade her from this bloody and execrable businesse. The Iudges are astonished at the strangenesse of this newes, which they begin confidently to beleeue, and so blesse the houre of Augustino's arriuall, that hath withheld them from spilling the innocent blood of Felicia , when commanding her from the place of execution, to her prison, they instantly giue order for the Lady Victoryna's apprehension, who already had built trophees and triumphes of ioy in her heart, to see that all her bloody designes so well succeeded. But now is the Lords appoynted time come, wherein all her cruell murthers, whoredome, trechery, and hypocrisie, shall be brought to light and punished: yea now it shall no longer be in her power, or in that of the diuell, her Schoole-master and Seducer, either to diminish the least part of her punishment, or to adde the least moment or poynt of time to her life. She is all in teares at her apprehension, but they rather ingender enuie, then pitty in her Iudges: And so from the delights and pleasures of her house, she is hastily conueyed to prison. Her Iudges , in honour to the sacred dignity of Iustice (the Queene of Earth , and the daughter of Heauen ) confront her with Augustino , who auerres his former deposition, as constantly in her face, as she denies it impudently in his. But this will not preuaile her: for now God hath made the probabilities, or rather the sight of her crime too apparant. So without any regard to her prayers, teares, or exclamations, they adiudge her to the Racke, where the tendernesse of her limbes, the sharpenesse of her torments, but especially the griefes and pinches of her conscience, make her acquit Felicia , acknowledge Augustino his euidence, and condemne her selfe to bee the author both of her first husbands stabbing, as also her seconds poysoning: her Iudges as much praise God for her confession, as they detest and are astonished at the falsenesse of these her horrible crimes. So with much ioy they first free innocent Felicia of her vniust imprisonment; and then knowing it pitty that so wretched a Lady as Victoryna should liue any longer, they, for her abominable cruelties and inhumanities, condemne her the next morne to be hanged and burnt on Saint Markes Place . At the knowledge and divulging of which newes, as her father, mother, and kinsfolkes extremely grieue, so all Venice blesse and glorifie God, first, that innocent Felicia is saued, and guilty Victoryna detected and condemned to the shame and punishment of a deserued death. The same night the Priests and Friers deale with her about the state of her soule, and its pilgrimage and transmigration to heauen: they finde that her youth, lust, and reuenge hath taken a strange possession of the diuell, and he in them: for she still loues the memory of Sypontus , and enuies and detests that of her two husbands, Souranza and Fassino: but they deale effectually with her, and in their speeches depainting her forth the ioyes of heauen, and the torments of hell, they at last happily preuaile,  & so make her forsake the vanity and impiety of these her passions, by rellishing the sweet showres of Gods mercies: so the next morne she is brought to her execution; where the world expecting to heare much matter from her, shee is very pensiue and contemplatiue, and sayes little, onely she prayes Felicia to forgiue her; as also all the Parents of her two Husbands, Souranza and Fassino , and likewise of Sypontus ; but chiefly she inuokes God her Sauiour and Redeemer , to pardon these her horrible sins of adultery and murther, and beseecheth all that are present to pray for her soule; and so according to her sentence, she is first hanged, then burnt: whereat all that great affluence and concourse of people praise the prouidence and iustice of God , in cutting off this female monster and shame of her sexe Victoryna: whose tragicall and mournfull History may we all reade and remeber, with detestation, that the example hereof be our forewarning and caueat, not to trust in the deceiueable lusts of the flesh, and the trecherous tentations of the diuell, but to rely on the mercies and promises of God, which wil neuer faile his elect, but will assuredly make them happy in their liues, blessed in their deathes, and consequently glorious in their resurrections. THE TRIVMPHS OF GODS REVENGE AGAINST the crying and execrable sinne of Murther. History VII.  Catalina causeth her wayting Mayd Ansilua , two seuerall times attempt to poyson her owne sister Berinthia , wherein failing, she afterwards makes an Emperike termed Sarmiata , poyson her said Mayd Ansilua: Catalina is killed with a thunderbolt, and Sarmiata hanged for poysoning Ansilua: Antonio steales Berinthia away by her owne consent; whereupon her brother Sebastiano fights with Antonio , and kills him in a Duell: Berinthia , in reuenge hereof, afterwards murthereth her brother Sebastiano: she is adiudged to be immur'd 'twixt two walles, and there dies.  diuell our soules, when we maliciously think to betray others! for wee are as farre from Grace as wisedome , when we permit either irregular affection, or vnlawfull passion, to hale vs on to choller, choller to reuenge, and reuenge to murther: Nay, how exempt are we of Religion , and deuoyd of all Christian piety and charity , when our thoughts are so eclipsed, and our iudgements darkned, when our consciences are so defiled, and our soules polluted with reuenge, that the eldest sister seekes to poyson her younger, and this younger afterwards murthereth her owne and onely brother, because in a Duell hee had formerly killed her Louer! Alasse, alasse: these are bloody accidents, which not onely fight against Grace , but Nature , not onely against Earth , but Heauen , and not onely against our soules, but against God: neither are these the onely Tragedies that this our ensuing Historie reporteth, or relateth: for wee shall therein farther see a wretched wayting Gentlewoman, poysoned by her more wretched Lady and Mistresse, together with her execrable Agent, a bloody and gracelesse Emperike: and all iustly reuenged, and seuerely punished by the sword of Gods wrath and indignation: wherein the Christian Reader may obserue, as well to Gods glory, as his owne consolation, that neuer pretended, or actuall murthers were either contriued more secretly, perpetrated more closely, detected more miraculously, or punished more strangely or seuerely: so as if the diuell haue not fully possessed our hearts and soules; or if our thoughts and resolutions doe yet retaine but the least sparke of Grace and Christianity: we shall flie their crimes by the feare and sight of their punishments; refetch our wandering and erroneous senses, from hell to earth, purposely to erraise them from Earth to Heauen ; and so religiously to giue and consecrate, both them, and our selues, and soules, from sinne to righteousnesse, and consequently (with as much felicity as glory) from Satan to God . There dwelt in the Citie of Auero in Portugall , an ancient Nobleman, termed Don Gaspar de Vilarezo , rich in either quality of earthly greatnesse, as well of blood as reuenewes, who was neerely allyed to the Marquesse of Denia (in Spaine ) as marrying a Neece of his named Dona Alphanta , a Lady exquisitely endued with the Ornaments of Nature , and the perfections of Grace: for she was both faire and vertuous, that adding lustre to these, and these returning and reflecting embelishment to that, which made her infinitely beloued of her husband Vilarezo , and exceedingly honoured of all those who had the honour to know her; and to crowne the felicity of their affections and marriage, they had three hopefull children, one son, and two daughters: he termed Don Sebastiano , and they the Donas Catalina , and Berinthia: he hauing attained his fifteenth yeere, was by his Father made Page to Count Manriques de Lopez , and continually followed him at Court , and they from their tenth to their thirteenth yeeres, liued sometimes at Coimbra: otherwhiles at Lisbone , but commonly at Auero with their Parents, who so carefully trayned them vp in those qualities and perfections, requisite for Ladies of their ranke, as they were no sooner seene, but admired of all who saw them. But before wee make a farther progression in this History; (thereby the better to vnfold and anatomize it) I hold it rather necessary then impertinent, that we take a cursory, though not a curious suruey of both these young Ladyes perfections and imperfections, of their vices and vertues, their beauty and deformity: that as obiects are best knowne by the opposition of their contraries: so by the way of comparison wee may distinguish how to know, and know how to distinguish of the disparity of these two sisters, in their inclinations, affections, and delineations. Catalina was somewhat short of stature, but corpulent of body: Berinthia tall, but slender: Catalina was of taint and complexion, more browne then faire: Berinthia not browne, but sweetly faire, or fairly sweet: Catalina had a disdainfull, Berinthia a gracious eye: Catalina was proud, Berinthia humble. In a word, Catalina was of humour extremely imperious, ambitious, and reuengefull, and Berinthia modestly courteous, gracious and religious. So these two young Ladies growing now to bee capable of marriage, many gallant Caualiers of Auero become Seruants and Suters to them, as well in respect of their fathers Nobility and wealth, as for their owne beauties and vertues: yea their fame is generally so spred, that from Lisbone , and most of the chiefest Cities of Portugall , diuers Nobles and Knights resort to their father Don Alerezo's house, to proffer vp their affections to the dignity and merits of his daughters. But his age finding their youth too young to bee acquainted with the secrets and mysteries of marriage, puts them all off, either in generall termes, or honourable excuses, as holding the matching of his daughters of so eminent and important consideration, as he thinkes it fit he should aduisedly consult, and not rashly conclude them: which affection and care of Parents to their children, is still as honourable as commendable. Don Sebastiano their brother, being often both at Madrid, Vallidolyd and Lisbone , becomes very intimately and singularly acquainted with Don Antonio de Riuere , a noble and rich young Caualier , by birth likewise a Portugall , of the City of Eluas , who was first and chiefe Gentleman to the Duke of Bragansa ; and the better to vnite and perpetuate their familiarity, hee proffers him his eldest sister in marriage, and prayes him at his first conueniency to ride ouer to Auero to see her, offering himselfe to accompany him in this iourney, and to second him in that enterprize, as well towards his father as sister. Don Antonio very kindly and thankfully listeneth to Don Sebastiano's courteous and affectionate proffer, and knowing it so farre from the least disparagement, as it was a great happinesse and honour for him to match himselfe in so noble a Family: they assigne a day for that iourney, 'gainst when, Don Antonio makes ready his preparatiues and traine in all respects answerable to his ranke and generosity. They arriue at Auero , where Don Gaspar de Vilarezo , for his owne worth, and his sonnes report, receiues Don Antonio honourably, and entertaines him courteously: he visiteth and saluteth, first the mother, then the two young Ladies her daughters:  & although he cannot dislike Catalina , yet so precious and amiable is sweet Berinthia in his eye; as he no sooner sees, but loues her: yea her piercing eye, her vermillion cheeke, and delicate stature, act such wonders in his heart, as he secretly proclaimes himselfe her seruant, and publikely she his Mistrisse: to which end he takes time and opportunity at aduantage, and so reueales her so much in termes, that intimate the feruency of his zeale, and endeere the zeale of his affection and constancy. Berinthia entertaines his motion and speeches with many blushes, which now and then cast a roseat vaile o're the milke-white Lillies of her complection; and to speake truth, if Antonio bee inamoured of Berinthia , no lesse is she of him: so as not onely their eyes, but their contemplations and hearts seeme already to sympathize, and burne in the flame of an equall affection. In a word, by stealth he courts her often. And not to detaine my Reader in the intricate Labyrinth of the whole passages of their loues: Antonio for this time findes Berinthia in this resolution, that as she hath not the will to grant, so shee hath not the power to deny his suit: the rest, time will produce. But so powerfully doe the beauty and vertues of sweet Berinthia worke in Antonio his affections, that impatient of delayes, he findes out her father and mother, and in due termes (requisite for him to giue, and they receiue) demands their daughter Berinthia in marriage. Vilarezo thanking Antonio for this honour, replies, that of his two daughters, he thinkes Berinthia his younger as vnworthy of him, as Catalina his eldest worthily bestowed on him. Antonio answeres, that as he cannot deny but Catalina is faire, yet hee must confesse that Berinthia is more beautifull to his eye, and more pleasing to his thoughts. Vilarezo lastly replies, that he will first match Catalina , ere Berinthia , and that he is as content to giue him the first, as not as yet resolued to dispose of the second: and so for this time, they on these termes depart, Vilarezo taking Antonio and his sonne Sebastiano with him to hunt a Stag, whereof his adiacent Forrest hath plenty. But whiles Antonio his body pursues the Stag, his thoughts are flying after the beauty of his deare and faire Berinthia ; who as the Paragon of Beauty and Nature , sits Empresse and Queene-Regent in the Court of his contemplations and affections: hee is wounded at the heart with Vilarezo his answere, and Berinthia to the gall, when he certified her of her fathers resolution, onely modesty (that sweet companion and precious ornament of Virgins) to the extremity of her power endeuored to keepe Antonio from perceiuing or suspecting so much. Antonio prayes his deare friend Sebastiano to perswade his father to giue him his sister Berinthia to wife: he performes the true part of a true friend and a Gentleman ; but in vaine: for his father Vilarezo is resolute, first, to marry Catalina , when Antonio , not of power so soone to leaue the sight and presence of his sweet Berinthia , must inuent some matter for his stay. And indeed as loue is the whetstone of wit to giue an edge to inuention; so Antonio , to inioy the presence of his faire Berinthia , is inforced to make shew that hee neglects her, and affecteth Catalina: and so conuerseth often with her; but still in generall termes, whereat shee builds many castles of hope and content, in the ayre of her thoughts. For if Berinthia loued Antonio , no lesse doth Catalina strange effects of affection, where two sisters deeply and dearely loue one Gentleman, and when but one, and peraduenture neither of them shall inioy him. But as Catalina is the pretext, so Berinthia is both the sole obiect and cause of Antonio's stay, whom he courts and layeth close siege to, as often as opportunity makes him happy in the desired happinesse and felicity of her company: Shee giues him blushes for his sighes, and sometimes (although a man) the feruency of his affection was such, as hee cannot refraine from returning her teares for her blushes: when albeit loue perswades him to stay longer in Auero , yet discretion calls and commands him away to Lisbone: and all the fruit of his iourney that he shall carry thither with him is this, that for inioying of faire Berinthia to his wife, he conceiues farre more reason to hope, then to despaire. Next death, there is no second affliction so grieuous or bitter to Louers, as separation and parting: this Berinthia feeles, but will not acknowledge, and this Antonio acknowledgeth, because feeles. After supper, taking her to a window, hee secretly prayes her to honour him with the acceptance of a poore Scarfe, and plaine paire of gloues (which notwithstanding were infinitely rich, and wonderfully faire) in token of his affection; and she, the morne of his departure, by Diego his Page, sends him a handkerchiefe, curiously wrought with hearts and flames of silke and gold, in signe of her thankfulnesse: hee promiseth Berinthia to write, and see her shortly; and Catalina intreates him to be no stranger to Auero . To Catalina he giues many words, but few kisses; to Berinthia many kisses, but more teares: His departure makes Berinthia sad, as grieuing at his absence; and Catalina ioyfull, as hoping of his returne: Catalina triumphs for ioy, hoping that Antonio shall be her husband; and Berinthia now begins to looke pale with sorrow, fearing shee shall not be so happy to be his wife. By this time breakfast is serued in, when Sebastiano comes, takes Antonio and his two sisters, and carries them to the Parlour, where Vilarezo and his wife Alphanta attend Antonio's comming. They all sit downe; and although their fare be curious, yet Antonio's eyes feed and feast vpon more curious dainties; as the sparkling eyes, flaxen haire, and vermillion cheekes of Berinthia's incomparable beauty, which is obserued of all parts, except of Berinthia , who is so secret and cautious in her carriage, as although her affection, yet her discretion will not permit her modesty either to obserue or see it. Breakfast ended, Antonio taking Vilarezo and his wife Alphanta apart, first giues them infinite thankes for his honourable and courteous entertainment, and then very earnestly againe prayes them not to reiect his suit for their daughter Berinthia. Vilarezo and his wife pray Antonio to excuse his bad reception, which they know comes many wayes short of his deserts and merits, and also request him to imbrace their motion for their daughter Catalina . Thus after many other complements, he takes his conge of Vilarezo , kisseth his wife and two daughters, first Catalina , then Berinthia , who though last in yeeres, yet is the first Lady in his desires and thoughts, and the onely Queene of his affections. So they are as it were inforced to make a vertue of necessity, and to take a short farewel, in stead of a more solemne, which either of them wished, and both desired; but their eyes dictate to their hearts, what their tongues cannot expresse: and so Antonio and Sebastiano take Coach, and away for Lisbone, Antonio as much triumphing in the beauty of his faire Berinthia , as his friend Sebastiano greeues, that of his two Sisters, Antonio would not accept of Catalina , nor his Father consent to giue him Berinthia for his wife: notwithstanding, they confirme their familiaritie and friendship with many interchangeable and reciprocall protestations; that sith they cannot be brothers, they will liue and dye deare and intimate friends: but I feare the contrary. Being arriued at Lisbone, Antonio feeles strange alterations in his thoughts and passions. For now he is so intangled in the fetters of Berinthia's beautie and vertues, that he will see no other obiect but her Idea , nor (almost) speake of any Lady , but of her selfe, and in these his amorous contemplations he both reioyceth and triumpheth; but againe remembring the assurance of Vilarezo his refusall, and the incertainty of Berinthia's affection and consent, his hopes are nipt in their blossomes, and his ioyes as soone fade as flourish; he wisheth that Auero were Lisbone , and either himselfe in Auero with Berinthia , or she in Lisbone with him. To attempt the one, he holds it as great a folly, as a vanitie to wish the other: but he bethinkes himselfe of a remedy for this his perplexity, and reputes himselfe obliged in the bonds as well of respect, as loue, to write to his faire Berinthia: and then againe he feares, that it will finde a difficult passage and accesse to her, because of her Fathers distaste, and Sisters iealousie: but the Sunne of his affection doth soone dispell and dissipate these doubts, or rather disperse them as clouds before the winde: and now to preuent those who might attempt to intercept his letters, he bethinkes himselfe of an inuention, as worthy, as commendable in a Louer: he writes Berinthia a letter, and accompanying it with a rich Diamond, sends it her by Diego his owne Page to Auero , whom purposely  & feignedly he causeth to arme himselfe with this pretext and colour, that he is in loue with Ansilua the Lady Catalina's wayting Gentlewoman, and hath now gotten leaue of his Master to come to Auero to seeke her in marriage: where after some fifteene daies he arriues, and verie secretly deliuers his Masters ring and letter to Berinthia , who (sweet Lady) was then tost with the winde of feare, and the waues of sorrow, that in all this time she heard not from Antonio , doubting indeed lest the change of aire, places, and obiects might haue power to change his affection, when now blushing for ioy, as much as before she looked pale for sorrow, she takes the ring and letter, and kissing both secretly, flies to her Chamber, when bolting the doore, she with as much affection as impatience breaking vp the seales, therein findes these lines:  confident of my affections, as I doe of thy beautie, and then as much reioyce in that, as I triumph in this: but as my tongue lately wanted power, so now doth my pen art, to informe thee, how dearely I loue thy beautie, and honour thy vertues, so as could thy thought [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=88022001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC3B0E&area=prose&forward=textsFT) thought prie into mine, or my heart be so happy to dictate to thine, those should know, and this see, that Antonio is ambitious of no other earthly felicitie, then either to liue thy husband, or die thy Martyr. Thinke with thy selfe, how farre thou vndervaluest, and vnrequitest my zeale, when I will despaire of louing Catalina , and yet cannot hope that Berinthia will affect me: only therefore in thee (sweet Lady ) it remaines, either to crowne my ioyes by thy consent, or to immortalize my torments by thy refusall: be pleased therfore, faire Berinthia , to signifie me thy resolution, that I may know my doome, and prepare my selfe, either to wed thee or my graue. Antonio.  Berinthia hauing againe and againe perused and o're-read this letter, giues it a thousand kisses for his sake who wrote and sent it her, and so verie secretly locks it vp in her Casket, as also the Diamond, and now attends an opportunity to confer priuately with Diego , when he will resolue to returne to his Master at Lisbone , that she may returne him an answer, though not so sweet as he expects, yet not so bitter as he feares: in the meane time Diego deliuereth her Father Vilarezo his Masters letter, in fauour of his (pretended) sute to Ansilua , as also in thankefulnesse of his entertainment, without naming either Catalina , or Berinthia his daughters, or once mentioning his returne to Auero: whereat Vilarezo greeues, and Catalina bites the lip. But Berinthia cannot but smile to see Antonio his inuention, for the safe deliuery of his letters, nor yet refraine from laughing in her selfe, to see how cunningly his Page Diego courts Ansilua: for he makes such demonstration of loue to her, and she is so enamoured of him, that Catalina thinkes a short time will finish this match, but he and her sister Berinthia know the contrary. Diego at the end of three daies is desirous to depart, and Berinthia extremely glad of his resolution to stay no longer: so she takes her selfe to her Chamber, and writes this letter to her Antonio in answer of his.  thou hadst not tasted so much of my affection, nor I so many of my fathers frownes: and although thy tongue and penne haue acquainted me with thy rich zeale intended and deuoted to my poore merits, yet iudge with thy selfe, whether it be fit for me to requite thee with obseruance; or him that gaue me my being, with disobedience. As I desire not to haue thee die my Martyr, so my father will not permit thee to liue my husband: and yet, as it is out of my power to remedy the first, so it is not impossible for time to effect and compasse the last; not that I resolue to giue thee too much hope; rather that I aime to take away some of thy despaire, to the end that I may finde thee as constant in thy affection, as thou me syncere in my constancie. My Sisters iealousie of me, and my Fathers distaste of thee, inuite thee to manage this fauour of mine with as much secrecie as circumspection. Berinthia.  Hauing folded vp and sealed her letter, she findes out Diego , and beckens him to follow her to the garden; where, in one of the bowers she deliuers him this letter, together with a Rose of Opales, the which in token of her loue, she coniures him with safetie and speed to deliuer his Master Don Antonio. Diego hauing his dispatch of Berinthia , soone giues Ansilua hers, promising to returne some three weekes after; at which time he praies her to expect him: when thanking Vilarezo for his kinde entertainment, and he bidding him tell his Master he would be glad to see him in Auero , he leapes to horse, and so poasts away for Lisbone . I cannot relate with what incredible and infinite ioy Antonio receiues this Letter and Ring from Berinthia: and to write the truth, I thinke the letter scarce contained so many sillables, as he often read it ouer and kissed it: he sees Berinthia's modesty resplend and shine in her affection, and her affection in her modesty towards him, wherein he glories in that, reioyceth in this, and triumphs in both: but although he be sure of her affection, yet he is not of himselfe; for he sees her letter containeth many verball complements, but all of them not one reall promise: and therefore hee cannot repute his tranquillity and felicity compleate, ere he be crowned with this happinesse: besides, he feares that his absence and her Fathers presence, may in tract of time by degrees coole the feruency of Berinthia's affection, and yet then, he as soone checkes his owne timidity in conceauing the least suspition of her constancy: now he thinkes to aquaint his intimate friend and her deare brother Sebastiano with their affections, but then he condemnes that opinion, and reuokes it as erroneous and dangerous; and contrary to the rules of loue, in sayling without the compasse of Berinthia's aduice and commands, by the which he holds it both safety and discretion to steere his course and actions, againe, he so infinitly and earnestly longs to re-see his deare and sweet Mistrisse, as he resolues to ride ouer againe to Auero ; but the obstinacy of Alerezo , [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=88022001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC3B0E&area=prose&forward=textsFT) and the iealousie of Catalina , make him end that iourney ere he began it. In this perplexity and contestation of reasons, he is irresolute what, or what not to do, but in fine, considering that delaies are dangerous in matters of this nature, he packs vp his baggage, and taking his farewell of Sebastiano , vnder pretext of his health, leaues Lisbone and the Duke his Lord and Master, and retires to his owne home at Eluas (where his father dying some three yeeres before, had left him sole heire to many rich Mannors and Possessions) purposely hereby to be neere to Auero , that he might giue order for all things, and let slip no occasion in the processe and prosecution of his affection. The second day after his arriuall to Eluas , it being welneere a month since he sent his first, and till then his last letter to Berinthia , he now againe dispatcheth his Page Diego with his second letter to her, by whom he sends her a chaine of rich pearle, and a paire of gold bracelets richly enammeled. Diego's arriuall is pleasing to Ansilua , but extremely ioyfull to Berinthia: only it nipt Catalina's hopes, because she could not vnderstand by him any certaine resolution or assurance of his Masters comming thither. Diego hath no sooner saluted his Ansilua , but (as his more important businesse) he seekes meanes to speake with Berinthia , which she her selfe proffereth him: he deliuers her his Masters tokens and letter, which she verie ioyfully receiueth, and so trips away to her Chamber; where opening the seales, she therein findes these words:  the reading of thy letter: and as I dispraise not thy obedience to thy Father, so I infinitly both praise and prize thy affection to me: a thousand times I kissed thy lines, and as often blest the hand that wrote them, and although they haue giuen me hope, for despaire; yet, not to dissemble, these hopes haue brought me doubt, and that doubt, feare; not thou louest me, for that were to disparage my iudgement, in seeking to prophane thy affectio, but that thou wilt not please to accept of my promise, nor to returne me thine: wherein if thou weigh the feruency of my loue, I hope thou wilt not taxe the incredulitie of my feare; for till I am so happie, not onely to hope, but to assure my selfe that Berinthia will be Antonio's, as Antonio is alreadie Berinthia's , I must needs feare, and therefore cannot truely reioyce. I haue left Lisbone , to reside at Eluas ; therefore faire and deare Lady, I beseech thee destinate me, dispose my seruice, and command both. I long to enioy the felicity of thy presence: for I take heauen to witnesse, thy absence is my hell vpon earth. Antonio.  Berinthia hauing read this letter, she approues of Antonio's feare, and attributes it to the feruency and syncerity of his affection: she esteemes her selfe infinitly happy in her good fortune, and choyce of so braue a Caualeer for her seruant, whom she hopes a little time will make her husband, to which end she will no longer feed him with delaies, but now resolues, by his Page Diego at his returne to signifie him so much: and in a word, to send him her heart, as shee hath already receiued his. But shee knowes not what the Interim of this time will bring foorth. Passe we from Berinthia , to her Sister Catalina , whose affection is likewise such to Antonio , as by this time she hath perswaded and induced her Father Vilarezo to write him a Letter in her behalfe by Diego , thereby to draw his resolution, whether he intend to seeke her for his wife or no; or at least to inuite him to Auero . And although his affection to her Sister Berinthia be kept from her, yet she not only suspects, but feares it. Glad she is of the opportunity of Diego his being there, to conuey his Fathers Letter to his Master: and yet that ioy of hers is soone dissolued into griefe, because all this time he neuer vouchsafed to write to her: her affectio to him flattreth her still with hope, and yet her iudgement in her selfe. Still suggesteth her despaire; for she hath alwaies the image of this conceit in her imagination, that Antonio loues her Sister Berinthia ,  & not her selfe: her suspition makes her subtill, and so she deales with Ansilua , to draw the truth hereof from Diego , who hauing learned his lesson, acteth his part well, and I know not, whether with more fidelity or discretion flatly denies it: but loe, here betides an accident, which bewraies the whole mystery and History of their affections. On a Sunday morning, when Berinthia was descended to the garden to gather flowers, against her going to Church with her Father and Mother; her Sister Catalina rusheth into her Chamber, to seeke the Historie of Cervantez , which the day before shee had lent her, and not finding it either on the Table or the Window, seekes in the pocket of her gowne, that she wore the day before; and there vnwittingly and vnexpectedly findes the last Letter that Antonio had sent her; whereby she perceiued, it was in vaine for her to hope to inioy Antonio , sith shee now apparantly saw that hee was her sister Berinthia's , and she his. Catalina is heereat both sorrowfull, and glad; sorrowfull, that shee should lose Antonio , and glad that she had found his Letter. And now to shew her affection to him, and her malice to her sister, shee will try her wits, to see whether she can frustrate Berinthia , and so obtaine Antonio for her selfe. The passions of men may easily be found out and detected, but the secrets and malice of women difficultly. To which end Catalina shewes this Letter to her father, who exceedingly stormes hereat, and with many checkes and frownes curbes Berinthia of her liberty, and resolues in his first Letter to Antonio , to forbid him his house, and her company, except hee will leaue Berinthia , and take Catalina: and suspecting that his Page Diego's courting of Ansilua , was but onely a policy and colour, thereby to conuey Letters betwixt his daughter Berinthia and his Master; hee once thought to giue him his Conge, and prohibit him his house, had not Catalina prayed the contrary, who would no way displease her waiting Gentlewoman Ansilua , because shee was to vse her aide and assistance in a matter of great importance: the vnlocking and dilating whereof is thus: Catalina her affection to Antonio , and consequently her malice to her sister Berinthia is so violent, that as her father hath bereaued her of a great part of her liberty, so she is so bloody and cruell, as she vowes to depriue her of her life: a hellish resolution in any woman, but a most vnnaturall and damnable attempt of one sister to another: but wanting faith, which is the foundation and bulwarke; and Religion, which is the [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=88022001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC3B0E&area=prose&forward=textsFT) preparatiue and Antidote of our soules, she runnes so wilfully hoodwink't from God to the diuell, as shee will aduance, and disdaines to retire, till her malicious and iealous thirst be quenched with her sisters blood: to which end she perswades and bribes Ansilua with a hundred duckets, to poyson her sister Berinthia ,  & promiseth her so much more, whe she hath effected it: wherunto this wretched & execrable yong waiting Gentlewoman consenteth,  & in briefe, promiseth to performe it. But God hath otherwise decreed and ordained: To which end shee sends into the City for some strong poyson by an vnknowne messenger, which is instantly brought her in a small galley pot. But let vs here both admire and wonder at Gods miraculous discouery and preuention thereof: For that very night, when Ansilua had determinately resolued to haue poysoned the Lady Berinthia, Diego seekes out his Mistrisse Ansilua , and findes her solitarily alone in one of the close-o'reshadowed bowers of the garden, whom he salutes and entertaines with many amorous discourses, and more kisses; in the middest whereof his nose fell suddenly on bleeding, whereat hee admired, and she grieued; till at last hauing bloodyed all his owne handkerchiefe, Ansilua rusheth hastily to her pocket for hers for him, which suddenly drawing forth, her affection to Diego hauing made her quite forget her poyson, she with her handkerchiefe drawes out the galley pot, which falling on the floore of the bower (that was paued with square stones) it immediately burst in pieces; when Diego's Spaniell licking vp the poyson, instantly sweld and dyed before them. Whereat Diego grew amazed, but farre more Ansilua , who blushing with shame, and then growing pale for feare, could not inuent either what to say or doe, at the strangenesse and suddennesse of this accident. Diego presseth her to know for whom this poyson was prouided, and of whom shee had it. Her answeres are variable, and are so farre from agreeing, as they contradict each other, which breeds in her the more feare, and in him astonishment. Hee coniures her by all the bonds of their affection, to discouer it, with many millions of protestations professeth it shall dye with him; he addes vowes to his requests, oathes to his vowes, and kisses to his oathes; so as maids can difficultly conceale any thing from their Louers: but especially fearing that hee might peraduenture suspect that this poyson was meant and intended him: shee at last vanquished with his importunacy and this consideration, discouereth (as wee haue formerly vnderstood) that her Lady Catalina had wonne her, therewith to poyson her sister Berinthia , because she suspected she was better beloued of his Master Don Antonio then her selfe. Diego is infinitely astonished at the strangenesse of this newes, and like a true and faithfull Page to his Master, hauing drawne this worme from Ansilua's nose, and this newes from her tongue; vnder colour to seeke a remedy to stop his blood, giuing her many kisses, and promising her his speedy returne, he leaues her in the garden, and so very speedily findes out Berinthia ; to whom (with as much truth as curiosity) he from poynt to poynt reueales it, praying her to be carefull not to receiue any thing, either from Catalina , or Ansilua , and withall to write, for the next morne he will hye to Eluas , to reueale it to his Master. Berinthia trembles at the report of this strange and vnexpected newes: so hauing first thanked God for the discouery of this poyson, and her sisters malice, she promiseth him a letter to his Master, and heartily thankes him for his fidelity and affection towards her, the which she voweth to requite; and for a pledge and earnest therof, drawes off a Diamond from her finger, and giues it him for this good office. No sooner hath Aurora leapt from the watry bed of Thetis , and Phoebus discouered his golden beames in the azured firmament of Heauen, but Diego causeth his horse to be made ready, and tels Ansilua that his father hath sent for him to meet him at la Secco , and that he will not faile to be backe with her within three dayes, being ready to depart. Hee, vnder colour of giuing order for his horse, leaues her, and steales into Berinthia's chamber, whom (poore Lady ) feare would not permit to take any rest or sleepe that night, the which shee had partly worne out and imployed in writing her mind to her deare Antonio ; and knowing her selfe not safe in Auero with her father and sister, she resolued to commit her honour and her life into his protection: yea, shee had no sooner finished and sealed her Letter to that effect, but Diego comes and knockes softly at her chamber doore. Berinthia in her night-gowne and attire is ready for him: shee admits him, commends his care, giues him her Letter to his Master, and praies him to vse all possible diligence in his returne: and so hauing receiued all her commands, hee secretly descends the stayres; and taking leaue of Vilarezo , and lastly, kissing his Mistrisse Ansilua , he leapes to horse, rides the first stage, there leaues his Gennet, and takes Poast. Leaue we Diego poasting towards Eluas , and come we to Catalina , whose malice finding no rest, nor her reuenge remedy, she that very morne, as soone as Ansilua came into her chamber, demands whether she be prepared to performe her owne promise, and her hopes? She answereth her Lady , that lesse then three dayes shall effect it, and giue a period to all her sister Berinthia's . Whereat she is exceedingly glad, but is all this while ignorant what Diego hath seene, and Berinthia knowes to this effect. Ansilua presuming on Diego his fidelity, and building on his secresie; and therefore lesse suspecting his iourney to Eluas , remaines still so gracelesse and impious in her bloody resolution, as she now not onely presumes, but assures her selfe that Berinthia is neere the ebbe of her dayes, and the setting of her life: and therefore like an execrable Agent of the diuell, she hath now made ready and prouided her selfe of a second poysoned potion, which shee no way doubts but shall send her to her last sleepe. But this female Monster , this bloody shee-Empericke may be deceiued in her art. In the interim of which time, Diego arriues at Eluas , and findes out his Master, to whom he very hastily deliuers Berinthia's Letter; the which Antonio hauing kissed, breakes off the seales, and there, contrary to his hopes, but not to his desires, reades these lines:  such to thee, as she degenerates not only from Grace , but Nature , and seekes to bereaue me of my life. This bearer, thy Page , who I pray' loue for my sake, sith he, vnder God, hath now preserued me for thine, will more fully and particularly acquaint thee with the manner thereof. So, sith there is no safety for me in my fathers house, into whose armes and protection shall I throw my selfe, but onely into thine, of whose true and sincere affection I am so constant and confident, as I rest assured, thou wilt shew thy selfe thy selfe, in preseruing my life with mine honour, and mine honour with my life? It is no poynt of disobedience in me to my father, but of deare respect to mine owne life; and therefore to thee, for, and by whom I liue, that makes me so earnestly desire both thy assistance and sight, sith the first will leade me from despaire, the second to hope and ioy, and both to content; till when, feare and loue, with much impatiency, make me thinke houres yeeres, and minutes moneths. Berinthia.  Antonio is amazed at this strange and vnexpected newes, and curiously gathers all the circumstances thereof from his Page , when loue, feare, hope, sorrow, and ioy act their seuerall parts, as well in his heart as countenance; when prizing Berinthia's life and safety a thousand times before his owne, he with great expedition dispatcheth away Diego the same night to Auero , with this ensuing Letter, which hee commands him deliuer his Mistrisse Berinthia , with all possible speed and secrecie.  doth thy true affection to mee, in that damnable malice of thy sister Catalina to thy selfe for my sake, in such sort, as I know not whether I more reioyce at the one, then detest the other. Hauing therefore first thanked God for thy happy and miraculous preseruation, I next commend my Page, as the second cause of the discouery thereof: and this fidelity of his shall neither be forgotten or vnrequited. Thinke how tedious time is to me, sith I blame and enuie this short Letter of mine, for taking vp and vsurping any part thereof, till I enioy the honour to see thee, and the felicity to assist thee. I returne it thee Poast by Diego , who brought me thine; and my Coach-man tells mee, I shall rather fly then runne towards thee. Let the precise houre, I beseech thee, be on Munday night at twelue of the clocke, when I will await thy selfe, and expect thy commands at the Posterne of thy fathers Arbour: where, let the light of the candle be my signet, and the report of my Pistoll shall bee [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=88022001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFDC3B0E&area=prose&forward=textsFT) thine. I am throwing away my pen, were it not to signifie thee, that my sword shall protect thy life, and mine honour preserue thine: as also that Antonio thinkes himselfe the most vnfortunate man of the world, till Berinthia bee impaled in his armes, or he incloystered in hers. Antonio.  Whiles Diego is poasting to Auero, Antonio his Master is preparing to follow him, taking (the next morn) his Coach with sixe horses, and three resolute Gentlemen his friends to assist him, with each his Rapier and case of Pistols. Diego first arriues at Auero , yea a day and two nights before him. Ansilua checkes him for his long stay; and Berinthia a thousand times thankes him for his speedy returne. Hee deliuers her his Masters Letter, and prayes her to prepare her selfe against the prefixed houre. She reades her Antonio's Letter with much ioy and comfort, which her lookes testifie, and her heart proclaimeth to her thoughts: shee will not be slacke or backwards in a matter which so deeply imports her well-fare and content; and so with all possible secresie packes vp the chiefest of her apparell and iewels in a small trunke, or casket, and wisheth the houre come, that shee were either in Antonio's armes, or he in hers: and for Diego , hee casteth so subtill a mist and vaile before Ansilua's eyes, as it is impossible either for her, or her Lady Catalina to perceiue any thing. But lo, a second trechery is prouided, to effect that which the first could not: and indeed, which went neere to haue performed it, had not God miraculously and indulgently reached forth his hand to preuent it: for Catalina still perseuers in her inueterate and deadly malice towards her sister Berinthia , as if God had not yet taught her, or rather, that she would not learne the way from Satan; or Grace instructed and directed her from the impiety of so foule a sinne, as the murthering of her owne and onely sister. For the very night that Antonio had promised and assigned to fetch Berinthia , as shee had by times retired her selfe to her chamber, vnder colour to goe to bed, and ready to put on her night abiliments, in comes Ansilua , sent by her good and kinde (or rather wicked and cruell) sister, with a sweet Posset, (or rather a deadly poyson in her hand, in a siluer couered cup) telling her, that her Lady had dranke the one halfe, and sent her the other, it being (as she affirmed) very cold and refreshing for the liuer, against the hotnesse of the weather. But Berinthia being forewarned, is armed by her former danger, yet she seemes ioyfull thereof, and so accepts it, returning her sister Catalina thankes, saying, she will drinke it ere she goe to bed; onely she prayes Ansilua first to fetch her prayer booke and gloues, which in the morne shee had left in her sisters chamber. So whiles she wanted, she priuately powres it into a siluer bason in her study, and washing the cup three or foure seuerall times, she fills some Almond milke therein; and Ansilua being returned, takes the said cup, and prayes her to tell her sister, that she drinkes it to her health, and withall, giues her the good night: and so likewise doth Ansilua to her. But what a good night thought shee in her heart and conscience, when she knew Berinthia should neuer see day more? So away shee trips to her Lady Catalina , who demands her if the businesse bee dispatched, and her sister gone to her rest? Who replies, she hath dranke her last, and is gone to her eternall rest. But they are both deceiued in their malicious Arithmaticke: For although Catalina extremely reioyce in the confident and assured death of her sister, yet God ordaineth, that their bloody hopes shall deceiue them: as marke the sequell, and you shall see how. About an houre after Ansilua's departure, by Berinthia's order and appointment, in wonderfull secret sort in comes Diego to her Chamber, to await the houre of his Masters arriuall, and to assist her in her escape and departure. Berinthia acquaints him with the potion her Sister Catalina had right now sent her by Ansilua: he is astonished at this newes, as being assured it was poyson, and humbly prayes her to make proofe hereof on Catalina's Parrot, which that afternoone she had brought with her into her Chamber: and so by her consent Diego takes the Parrot, and with a spoone forceth some downe its throat: who poore harmelesse bird, immediatly swells and dyes before them. They both woonder hereat, and Berinthia at one instant both greeues  & reioyceth, greeues at her Sister Catalina's malice and cruelty, and reioyceth for her happy deliuerance: first praysing God as the Author, then thanking Diego as the instrument thereof: and so they throw the remainder of the poyson out at the window, and lay the dead Parrot on the table. And now Berinthia attending and awayting the houre of her happinesse, which is that of her Antonio's arriuall, and of her owne departure, with as much desire as impatiency; Diego often looking on the houre-glasse, and Berinthia a thousand times on her watch. So at last with a longing, longing desire, the ioyfull houre of twelue is come, wherein Antonio arriues: he sees the happy light of her candle, and she heares the sweet musique of his Pistoll, which reuiueth and rauisheth these two Louers, in the heauen of vnexpressable ioy and content, when all things being hush'd vp in silence, and euery person of the house soundly sleeping, Diego softly takes vp the small trunke, and Berinthia as secretly followes him: and so they wonderfull priuately slip into the first Court, and from thence to the posterne doore of the garden, where Antonio with a thousand kisses receiues her in his armes, hauing no other light but the lustre of her eyes to light them: for the Moone, that Bright Cynthia , had conspired and consented to Berinthia's escape, and therefore purposely withdrawne her brightnesse by hiding, and inuelloping her selfe in the darkenesse of an obscure cloud. Antonio locking this sweet prize, this his deare and sweet Berinthia in his armes, he with the three Gentlemen his friends, conduct her to the end of the street; and Diego followes them with the Casket, where they all priuatly and silently take Coach, and hauing opened the Citie gate with a siluer key, away they speed for Eluas with all possible celerity; but I write with griefe, that as these affections of Antonio and Berinthia begin in ioy, so (I feare) they will end in as much sorrow and misery. Leaue we them now in their iourney for Eluas: and returne we to Auero to bloudy Catalina , and wretched Ansilua , who lying remote from Berinthia's Chamber, could not possibly heare so much as the least steppe of her descent and departure: although their malice were so extreme as to write the truth, they all that night could not sleepe for ioy, that Berinthia dispatched: so they prepare themselues against the morne, to heare some pittifull outcries in the house for Berinthia's death; but seeing it neere ten of the clocke, and no rumour nor stirre heard, they both (as they were accustomed) went into her Chamber, thinking to feast their eies vpon the lamentable obiect of this breathlesse Gentlewoman: but contrary to their bloudy hopes, they finde the nest, I meane the bed, empty, and Berinthia not dead, but escaped and flowne away: Onely Catalina , in stead of her Sister, findes her owne Parrot dead on the table: they are astonished at this newes, and looke fearefully and desperately each on other. Ansilua for her part protests and vowes that she saw Berinthia drinke the poyson. But finding Berinthia's small trunke wanting, and hearing Diego gone, then Catalina knowes for certaine, that shee was escaped, and her poysoning plot detected and preuented. So they giue the alarum in the house, and she goes directly and acquaints her Father, Mother and Brother of her Sister Berinthia's flight, but speakes not a word of the poyson, or the Parrots death. Vilarezo greeues to see himselfe robbed of his daughter, and Sebastiano of his sister: but when they vnderstand that Diego was gone with her, then they are confidently assured, that Antonio hath carried her away, which is confirmed them by the Porter of the City, who told them, that 'twixt twelue and one, a Coach with a Lady and foure Caualeers and a Page (drawne by sixe horses) past the gate very speedily. Vilarezo and his sonne Sebastiano storme at this affront and disgrace: they consult what to doe herein: so first they resolue to send one to Eluas , to know yea or no, whether Berinthia be there with Antonio? The messenger sent, returnes, and assures them thereof, as also, that Antonio is retired from Eluas , to a castle of his without the walls of the Citie, where it is reported hee keepes the Lady Berinthia with much honour and respect. Had old Vilarezo had his health and strength, he would himselfe in person haue vndertaken this iourney, but being sicke of the gowt, he sends his sonne Sebastiano to Eluas , accompanied with sixe resolute Gentlemen, his neere allies and friends, to draw reason of Antonio for this affront and disgrace; and so either by law, force, policy, or perswasion, to bring backe Berinthia. Sebastiano knowing Berinthia to be his Sister; and Antonio his former ancient and intimate friend; with a kinde of vnwilling willingnesse accepts of this iourney: he comes to Eluas , and findes his former intelligence true, he repaires to Antonio's Castle, accompanied with his sixe associats. Antonio admits them all into the first Court, and onely two more of them into the second; where he salutes them kindly, and bids them all welcome to his Castle. Sebastiano layes before him the foulnesse of his fact, in stealing away his Sister in that clandestine and base manner, the scandall which he hath layd vpon her, and consequently on all their familly and bloud, tells him that his Father and himselfe are resolued to haue her againe at what price soeuer, and therefore coniures him, by the respect of his owne honour, and by the consideration and remembrance of all their former friendship, to deliuer him his Sister Berinthia. Antonio answereth Sebastiano , that it was an honourable affection, and no base respect which led him to assist his Sister Berinthia in her flight and escape: that he neuer was nor would be a iust scandall either to her, her family, or bloud; that his malicious Sister Catalina was the author and cause thereof, who by her wayting Gentlewoman Ansilua had twice sought to poyson her: and therefore, sith hee could not deliuer her with her owne safety, and his honour and conscience, he was resolued to protect her in his Castle, against any whosoeuer, that should seeke either to enforce or offend her. Sebastiano is perplexed at this strange newes, and wondereth at Antonio's resolution: so doe the two Gentlemen with him: he desires Antonio that he may see and speake with his Sister Berinthia ; the which he freely and honorably grants: and so taking him by the hand, they enter the Hall: where Berinthia hauing notice hereof (accompanied with two of Antonio his Sisters) as soone comes, and with a cheerefull countenance aduanceth towards her brother: he salutes her, and she first him, then the other two Gentlemen her cousins. Sebastiano prayes Antonio , that hee may conferre apart with her Sister. Antonio replies, that his Sister Berinthia's pleasure shall euer be his. She willingly consents hereunto, when he taking her by the hand, conducts her to the farthest window, and there shewes her, her disobedience to her Father, her dishonour to her selfe, and griefe to her friends, for this her vnaduised and rash flight, and so perswades her to returne: and that if she intend to marry Antonio , this is not the way, but rather a course as irregular as shamefull. His Sister Berinthia deliuers him at full the cause of her departure; and very constantly confirmes what Antonio had formerly told him of her Sister Catalina's two seuerall attempts, to poyson her by her wayting Gentlewoman Ansilua , though with more ample circumstance and dilation: and to testifie the truth, Diego is produced, who vowes and protests the same. Sebastiano checks her of folly and cruelty, shewes her, that in seeking to wrong others, she only wrongs her selfe; that in inuenting and casting a feigned crime on her Sister Catalina , shee makes her owne conspicuous and true, that she hath no safety but in her returne: whereunto with many reasons he seekes to perswade and induce her. His Sister Berinthia againe answereth him, that there is no safety for her in Auero , and that she cannot expect greater then she findes in Eluas: she praies him to thinke charitably and honourably of her departure: and if euer her Father will loue her, she requests him not to hate, but to loue Antonio , whose Castle she findes a Sanctuary , both for her honour and life; taking God and his Angels, her conscience and soule to witnesse, that her Sister Catalina's crime is true and not feigned. Sebastiano seeing Antonio resolute, and his Sister will-full and obstinate, begins to take leaue, telling her, that he will leaue her to her folly, that to her shame, and her shame to her repentance, and so concludes to goe into the City, to resolue on what hee hath to doe, for her good and his owne honour. Antonio prayes him to dine in his Castle with his Sister: but he refuseth it, saith he hath giuen the first breach to their friendship, and his own honour, which hee shall repent, if not repaire, and so departs. Being come into the Citie, he consults this businesse with the Gentlemen his associats, and both himselfe and they are of opinion to send one poast to acquaint his father herewith, and so to craue his pleasure and resolution, how hee shall beare himselfe herein. It is euer an excellent point both of wisdome and discretion, for a sonne to steere his actions by the compasse of his Fathers commands. His cousin Villandras vndertakes this iourney to Auero . Old Vilarezo is perplexed and greeued at this report, and in stead of comfort, receiues more affliction, his care, curiositie, passion and griefe: seuerally examineth first Catalina , then Ansilua , who (like theeues in a Faire, or mutherers in a Forest) he findes equally constant in their deniall, being so deuoid of grace, and repleat of impiety, as they confirme and maintaine their innocencies with many bitter oathes and asseuerations: so he returnes Villandras to Eluas , with this Letter to his sonne Sebastiano .  greeue at thy Sister Berinthia's folly and disobedience: I haue carefully and curiously examined the two parties, whom I finde as innocent as constant in the true deniall of their falsly obiected crimes: I haue consulted with Nature and Honour, how herein I might be directed by them, and consequently, thou by me; so they suggest me this aduice, and I aduise thee this resolution, either by the law of the kingdom, or by that of thy sword, with expedition to returne mee my Daughter thy Sister Berinthia , and let not the Oratory either of Antonio's tongue, or her teares perswade thee to the contrary: for then as she is guilty of our dishonours, so wee shall be accessary to hers: let me vnderstand the proceeding herein, and according as occasion shall present, if my sicknesse and weakenesse will not leaue me, I notwithstanding will leaue Auero, to see Eluas . Vilarezo.  Whiles Sebastiano is consulting how to free his sister Berinthia , from the power of Antonio , speake we a little of Catalina , who (as skilfull in subtilty as malice) seeing her treachery  & bloudy intents reuealed, thinks it now high time to make away & poyson Ansilua ; grounding her resolution on this maxime, both of policy and estate, That dead folkes doe neither harme nor tell tales. Behold heere the iustice and prouidence of God! she, who laid snares for others, must now be taken in them her selfe: a punishment which the sinne of this wretched Gentlewoman findes, because deserueth: there is no vice nor malice, but haue their pretexts and colours. Catalina findes fault with two or three red pimples that Ansilua hath in her face, which she will haue taken away. She sends for an Empericke, one Pedro Sarmiata , and proffereth him one hundred duckets to poyson her, which like a limbe of the diuell, he vndertakes; and infusing poyson in some potions, he administreth it her: she the very next day dyes: a fit reward  & punishment for so gracelesse and bloody a Gentlewoman , who (as we haue formerly seene) made no religion nor conscience, to attempt two seuerall times to poyson the faire and vertuous Berinthia . Whiles this Tragedy is acting at Auero, Sebastiano begins to act another in Eluas , but a thousand times lesse impious, and more honourable: For hauing receiued his fathers order by Villandras , hee now sends him into the Castle, to take Antonio's , and Berinthia's last resolution, he is admitted to them: Villandras directs his speech first to Berinthia , then to Antonio , to whom hee relateth his message, and Sebastiano's pleasure. Berinthia returnes him this answere: Cousin Villandras , recommend me courteously to my brother Sebastiano , and tell him, my first answere and resolution is, and shall be my last. And (quoth Antonio ) I pray likewise informe him from me, that Berinthia's will is my law, and her resolution mine, and that I will bee as carefull, as willing and ready, to lose my life in defence and preseruation of hers. Villandras returnes, and acquaints Sebastiano with this their last resolutions; from which, he alleageth it is impossible for them to bee disswaded or diuerted. Sebastiano is beaten with two contrary and irresolute windes, what to doe in a businesse of this nature, either to recouer his sister by law or by armes: by law, he holds it a course both cowardly and preiudiciall: by armes, he sees he must kill himselfe or his friend: to vndertake the first, would be the laughter of Antonio ; and not to attempt the second, the shame of all Portugall and Spaine: hee therefore preferres generosity before reason, and passion aboue iudgement, and so resolues to fight with Antonio: to which end he makes choyce of his cousin Villandras for his second, and the next morne sends him to the Castle with this challenge:  here at Eluas ; for I had rather dye, then liue to see her dishonour, sith hers is mine: neither doe I first infringe or violate the bonds of our familiarity, rather thy selfe, sith thou art both the authour and cause thereof: wherefore of two things resolue on one: Either before to morrow morning sixe of the clocke render me my sister Berinthia , or else at that houre meete me on foot, with thy second, in the square greene Medow vnder thine owne Castle, where the choyce of two single Rapiers shall await or attend thee. If thou art honourable, thou wilt grant my first; if generous, not deny my second request. Sebastiano.  Antonio receiues this challenge, beares it priuately from all the world, especially from his sweet Berinthia , who (poore Lady) little imagines or suspects, her brother and louer are rushing foorth for her sake: He returnes this answere by Villandras , that he cannot grant Sebastiano his first request, nor will not deny him his second. So he chuseth a cousin-germane of his, a valiant young Gentleman , tearmed Don Balasco , who willingly and freely ingageth himselfe in this quarrell. So hee and Villandras that night (with as much friendship as secresie) meet in the City, and resolue on the Rapiers, and other ceremonies requisite in Duels . The morne appeares, when our Combatants leape from their beds to the field; where, a little before sixe (being the appoynted houre) all parties appeare: the Seconds performe their office in visiting the Principals, who cast off their doublets and draw, and so trauersing their ground, they, with iudgement and generosity, fall to their businesse; at the first cloze, Antonio is wounded in the right arme, and Sebastiano in the left side, which glanced on a rib: at the second, Sebastiano wounds Antonio 'twixt the brest and shoulder, a little aboue his right pap; and he him cleane thorow the body, of a large  & dangerous wound, whence issued forth abundance of blood: so they diuide themselues and take breath: They againe fall to it, and at this third cloze Sebastiano repaies Antonio with a mournfull and fatall interest: for he runnes him thorow the body on the left side, a little below the heart; whereof staggering, he falles, and so Sebastiano dispatcheth him, and nailes him to the ground starke dead. Villandras congratulates with him for his victory, which Sebastiano with much modesty, ascribes to the power and prouidence of God , and not to the weakenesse of his owne arme. Ballasco is no way daunted with the misfortune and death of his Principall, but rather like a generous Gentleman and valiant Second, resolues to sell it dearly to Villandras . They are not long vnsheathing of their Rapiers: for as soone as Ballasco hath couered vp Antonio with his cloke, they approch at their very first meeting. Ballasco slightly hurts Villandras in the right shoulder, and Villandras him thorow the body and reines, with a fatall wound, wherewith his sword fell from him, and he to the ground; when fearing and presaging his death, he with a faint language begs his life of Villandras , who at the sight and hearing hereof, throwes away his owne Rapier, and stoopes to assist him. But in vaine; for it is not in his power to giue him his life: for by this time he is dead, and his soule departed to another world. This tragicall newes is soone knowne and bruted in Eluas , whereof the criminall Iudges of that City remit Sebastiano with as much ease, as Villandras with difficulty (in fauour of money and friends) and obtaine their pardons. And now the newes hereof likewise flies to Antonio's Castle, where his dead body, and that of Ballasco , are speedily conueyed and brought, to the griefe and sorrow of all those of the Castle, who bitterly weepe for the disaster of their Lord and Master. But all these teares are nothing to those of Antonio's two sisters; nor theirs any thing, in comparison of these of our sweet Berinthia: who is no sooner aduertised hereof, but shee falls to the ground with sorrow, and there wrings her hands, beats her brest, and teares off her haire, in such mournfull and pitifull sort, that Cruelty her selfe could not refraine from teares, to see the numberlesse infinity of hers: counsell, aduice, perswasion cannot perswade her to giue a moderation to her mourning, or limits to her sorrowes: for they are so violent, as their extremity exceeds all excesse. She will see the dead body of her deare Antonio ; all those of the Castle are not capable to diuert her eyes from this wofull and pitifull obiect; at the sight whereof she falles to the ground on her knees, and giues his breathlesse body a thousand kisses: yea she washeth his sweet cheekes with a whole deluge and inundation of her salt teares: shee cannot speake for sighing, nor vtter a word for weeping; onely wringing her hands, she at last breathed forth these mournfull and passionate speeches: O my deare Antonio , my sweet and deare Antonio, Antonio , would God my death had ransomed and preuented thine, O my Antonio , my Antonio . Leaue we Berinthia to her passionate sorrowes, and sorrowfull passions, from which her brother Sebastiano will soone awake her; who by this time, as Victor and Conqueror, is come to the Castle gate and demands her, where he sees himselfe refused,  & the draw-bridges and approches drawne vp, and rampired vp with Barricadoes: he craues aide of the criminall Iudges , who send the Prouost with an armed company of souldiers: so they force the Castle gate with a Petard ; where sorrowfull Berinthia is deliuered into the hands of her ioyfull and reioycing brother Sebastiano , who with sweet perswasions and aduice seekes to exhale and dry vp her teares: but her affection is so great, as shee is not capable of consolation. In a word, shee cannot looke on her brother with the eye of affection, but of reuenge and indignation: yea, shee wisheth her selfe metamorphosed from a Virgin to a man, that shee might be reuenged of her brother for the death of her deare Louer Antonio. Sebastiano leauing the dead bodies of Antonio and Balasco to their graues, takes Coach with his incensed and sorrowfull sister Berinthia ; and so leaues Eluas , and returnes towards Auero , where his father Vilarezo , and his mother Alphanta welcome him home with praise, and their daughter Berinthia with checkes and frownes, who (the best she may) smothers her discontents; but yet vowes to be reuenged of her brother, for killing the life of her ioy, and the ioy of her life, Antonio . But all vowes of this bloody nature and quality are better broken then kept; which if Berinthia had had the grace to haue considered, and made good vse of: doubtlesse her end had proued more ioyfull, and not so fatall and miserable. Come we now to Catalina , who seeing the obiect of her affection, Antonio , dead, and her sister Berinthia returned, who for his sake was that of her liuing malice: she secretly confesseth her fault to her sister, in seeking formerly twice to haue poysoned her by Ansilua , craues pardon of her, vowing henceforth to conuert her malice to affection, and so reconciles her selfe to her: whereunto her sister Berinthia willingly condescendeth. Catalina hath made her peace with her sister, but shee hath not contracted and concluded it with God for Ansilua's death. Earth may forget this murther, but Heauen will not: Gods iudgements are as iust as secret, and as true as wonderfull; for he hath a thousand meanes to punish vs, when wee thinke our selues safe and furthest from punishment: which our wretched Catalina , and her execrable Empericke Salmiata shall see verified in themselues: For the smoke of this their bloody crime of murther, hath pierced the vaults and windowes of heauen, and is ascended to the nostrels of the Lord, who hath now bent his bow, and made ready his arrowes to reuenge and punish them. The manner is thus: A Sister of Ansilua's , named Isabella , is to be married in Auero , who inuites the Ladies Catalina and Berinthia to her wedding. Berinthia is too sorrowfull to be so merrie, as desirous rather to goe to her owne graue, then to any others nuptials: so she staies at home, onely her Sister Catalina takes Coach, with an intent to accompany the bride-woman to Church: but see the prouidence  & iustice of God, how it surprizeth & ouertakes this wretched Gentlewoman Catalina! for as shee was in her way, the Sunne is instantly eclipsed, and the skies ouer-cast, and so a terrible and fearefull thunder-bolt pierceth her thorow the brest, and layes her neere dead in her Coach: her Wayting-maids and Coach-man hauing no hurt, are yet amazed at this strange and dismall accident, so they thinke it fit to returne: Catalina is for a time speechlesse, her Parents are as it were dead with griefe and sorrow hereat, shee is committed to her bed and searched, and all her body aboue her waste is found coale-black: the best Physicians & Chirurgians are sent for: they see her death-strooken with that Plannet, and therefore adiudge their skill but vaine: her strength and sences fall from her, which Catalina hauing the happinesse to perceiue, and grace to feele, will no longer bee seduced with the diuels temptations. The Diuines prepare her soule for heauen, and now she will no longer dissemble with man or God; shee will not charge her conscience with so foule a crime as murther, the which shee knowes will proue a stop to the fruition of her felicity. She confesseth, she twice procured her Wayting-Gentlewoman Ansilua to poyson her Sister Berinthia ; and since that, she hath giuen Sarmiata one hundred Duckets to poyson the said Ansilua , which he performed, and whereof she humbly begs pardon of all the world, and religiously of God; whom shee beseecheth to be mercifull to her soule. And so though she liued prophanely and impiously, yet she died repentantly and religiously. Vilarezo and Alphanta her old Parents greeue and storme at her death; but more extremely at the manner thereof, and especially at the confession of her bloudy crimes, as well towards liuing Berinthia , as dead Ansilua ; onely their daughter Berinthia is silent hereat: glad, that she is freed of an enemy; sorrowfull, to haue lost a Sister: they are infinitly vexed to publish their daughter Catalina's crimes, yet they are inforced to it, that thereby this Sarmiata , this Agent of Hell, may receiue condigne punishment for his bloudy offence on earth. So they acquaint the criminall Iudges hereof, who decree order and power for his apprehension. Sarmiata is reuelling and feasting at Isabella's wedding: to which he is appointed and requested to furnish the sweet meats for the bankets, but hee little thinkes what sowre sawce there is prouiding for him. We are neuer neerest danger, then when we thinke our selues furthest from it: and although his sinnefull securitie was such, as the diuell had made him forget his murther of Ansilua , yet God will, and doth remember it; and lo, here comes his storme, here his apprehension, and presently his punishment. By this time the newes of Catalina's suddaine death (but not of her secret confession) is published in Auero , and arriued at the Bride-house, which giues both astonishment and griefe to all the world: but especially to Sarmiata , whose heart and conscience now rings him many thundering peales of feare, terrour and despaire: his bloudy thoughts pursue him like so many bloud-hounds, and because he hath forsaken God , therefore the diuell will not forsake him; he counselleth him to flie, and to prouide for his safetie: but what safety so vnsecure, dangerous, or miserable for a Christian, as to throw himselfe into the diuels protection? Sarmiata hereon fearing that Catalina had reuealed his poysoning of Ansilua , very secretly steales away his cloake, and so slippes downe to a Posterne doore of the little Court, hoping to escape; but hee is deceiued of his hopes, for the eie of Gods prouidence findes him out. The house is beleagred for him by the Officers, who apprehend him as he is issuing foorth, and so commit him close prisoner. In the after-noone the Iudges examine him vpon the poysoning of Ansilua , and the receit of one hundred Duckets to effect it, from Catalina: which she at her death confessed. He addes sin to sinne, and denies it with many impious oathes and fearefull imprecations: but they auaile him nothing: his Iudges censure him to the Rack, where, vpon the first torment he confesseth it, but with so gracelesse an impudencie, as he rather reioyceth then greeues hereat: where we may obserue how strongly the diuell sticks to him, and how closely he is bewitched to the diuell: so for reparation of this foule crime of his, hee is condemned to be hanged, which the next morne is performed, right against Vilarezo his house, at a Gallowes purposely erected; and which is worse then all the rest, as this lewd villaine Sarmiata liu'd prophanely, so he died as desperately, without repenting his bloudy fact; or imploring pardon or mercy of God for the same. O miserable example! O fearefull end! O bloudy and damnable miscreant! We haue seene the Theatre of this History , gored with great variety of bloud, the mournfull and lamentable spectacle whereof, is capeable to make any Christian heart relent into pitty, compassion and teares: but this is not all, we shall yet see more, not that it any way increaseth our terrour, but rather our consolation, sith thereby we may obserue, that murther comes from Satan, and its punishment from God . Catalina's confession and death, is not capeable to deface or wash away Berinthia's malice and reuenge to her brother Sebastiano , for killing of her deare and sweet Loue Antonio . Other Tragedies are past, but this as yet not acted, but to come: Loe now at last (though indeed too too soone) it comes on the stage: the remembrance of Antonio and his affection is still fresh in her youthfull thoughts and contemplations, yea his dead Idea is alwaies present  & liuing in her heart and brest: 'tis true, Sebastiano is her brother: 'tis as true she saith, that if he had not kill'd Antonio , Antonio had beene her husband. Againe shee considereth, that as Antonio's life preserued hers from death: so her life hath beene the cause of his: and as he lost his life for her sake, why should not she likewise leaue hers for his? or rather, why should she permit him to liue; who hath bereaued her of him? But her liuing affection to her dead friend is so violent, and withall so preiudicate and reuengefull; as she neither can nor will see her Brother who kill'd him, but with malice and indignation. In stead of consulting with Nature and Grace , shee onely conuerseth with choller and passion: yea she is so miserably transported in her rage, and so outragiously wilfull in her resolution, as she shuts the doore of her heart, to the two former vertues to whom shee should open it, and openeth it to the two latter vices, 'gainst whom she should shut it. A misery equally ominous and fatall, where Reason is not the mistris of our Passions, and Religion the Queene of our Reason. She sees, this bloudy attempt of hers, whereinto shee is entering, is sinnefull and impious, and yet her faith is so weake towards God , and the diuell so strong with her, as she is constant to aduance, and resolute not to retire therein. Oh that Berinthia's former Vertues should be disgraced with so foule a Vice! And oh that a face so sweetly faire, should be accompanied and linked with a heart so cruelly barbarous, so bloudily inhumane! for what can she hope from this attempt in killing her brother, but likewise to ruine her selfe? Nay, had she had any sparke of wit or grace left her, shee should consider, that for this foule offence, her body shall receiue punishment in this world, and her soule, without repentance, in that to come: but she cannot erect her eies to heauen, shee is all set on reuenge; so the diuell hath plotted the murther of her brother Sebastiano , and she, like a most wretched and inhumane sister, will speedily act it: The manner is thus, (the which I cannot remember without griefe, nor pen without teares:) she prouides her selfe of a long and sharpe knife, the which, some ten daies after the death of her Sister Catalina , 'twixt foure and fiue of the clocke in the morning, she hides in one of her sleeues; and the better to couer, and ouer-vaile her villanie, she in the same hand takes her Lute, and so enters her brothers Chamber, and findes him sleeping, being a pretty way distant from hers, and his Page Philippo in a lower Chamber vnder him: resoluing that if she had found him waking, she would play on her Lute, and affirme, she came to giue him the good morrow. But Sebastiano his fortune, or rather his misfortune was such, that he was then soundly sleeping, without dreaming, or once thinking what should befall him: when his wretched and execrable Sister Berinthia stalkes close to him; and laying her Lute softly on the window, drawes out her diuellish knife foorth her sleeeu, and as a she-diuell incarnate, cuts his throat, to the end hee might neither crie nor speake; and so, though with a femall hand, yet with a masculine courage, shee (with as much malice as haste) giues him seuen seuerall wounds thorow the body, and as neere the heart as shee could; whereof hee twice turning himselfe in his bed, neuer sprawled more: and then taking vp her Lute, and leauing him reeking in his bloud, shee after this her hellish fact, hies her selfe to her Chamber. This cruell murther is not so closely perpetrated and acted, but Philippo Sebastiano's Page, heares some extraordinary stirring and struggling in his Masters Chamber, and so leapes out of his bed; and taking his cloake on his shoulders, and his Rapier in his hand, he ascends the staires, where Berinthia hath not made so great speed; but hee sees her entring her Chamber, and throwing her doore after her. Whence running to his Masters Chamber, he findes the doore open, and his Master most cruelly murthered in his bed, of eight seuerall wounds; at which bloudy and lamentable spectacle, he makes many bitter and pittifull out-cries: whereat all the house is in allarum, and the folkes and seruants repaire thither of all sides. By this time Berinthia hath shifted her out-ward taffeta gowne sprinkled all with bloud, and wrapt her bloudy knife close in it; and for the more secresie throwes it into her close-stoole: and so awaits the comming vp of her Father and Mother, whom the mournefull eccho and sorrowfull newes of their son Sebastiano's cruell murther, had with an Ocean of teares wasted to his Chamber, with whom Berinthia likewise all blubbered with teares enters. They are all amazed at the sight of this bloudy and breathlesse corps, and wringing their hands, father, mother, daughter, and seruants, looke one on another in this calamity, and at this sorrowfull disaster. They search euery Chamber, Vault and doore of the House, and find no body, nor print of drops of bloud whatsoeuer: when Philippo the Page cries out, that hee feares, it is the Lady Berinthia , who hath murthered her brother and his master Sebastiano , for that hee saw her flying to her Chamber as he ascended the staires. Vilarezo and Alphanta his wife are doubly amazed at this report, but gracelesse Berinthia is no way daunted or astonished hereat, but affirmes, shee likewise heard some stirring in her brothers Chamber, which made her arise and come to the Staire head, where seeing Philippo , she being in her night attire, modesty made her retire to her Chamber. They all beleeue the suger of her words, and the circumstance of her excuse; yet they will not proclaime her innocency, till they haue searched her Chamber, and all her trunkes, where they finde no knife, stilleto, dagger, or any other offensiue weapon, and so her father and mother acquite her, but God will not: Notwithstanding they must aduertise the criminall Iudges of this lamentable and bloudy murther of their sonne, which they do. So they arriue, visit the dead body, and cause all the house to be searched: but as soone as they heard Philippo's speeches and suspition of Berinthia , then, considering her affection to Antonio , and her brother Sebastiano's killing of him at Eluas , they attribute this to be her fact, as proceeding from passionate reuenge; when the sequell and circumstances thereof being apparent in themselues; they not regarding her fathers prayers, her mothers requests, and her owne teares, seize on her, and so send and commit her close prisoner: where wretched Gentlewoman , shee hath a whole night left and giuen her, to see and consider the foulenesse of her fact, and to prepare her to her answer: which whether it will breed in her confession or deniall, obstinacy or repentance, as yet I know not. So from her imprisonment, come we to her answere. Auero rings with the newes of this foule and bloody murther; all bewaile, all lament the death of Sebastiano , as a Gentleman who was truly noble, truly generous: but his father Vilarezo , and mother Alphanta , seeme to drowne themselues in their teares, at these mournfull accidents, strange crosses, and vnheard of afflictions of theirs. For though they wil not beleeue, yet they deepely feare, that their daughter Berinthia was the murtherer of her brother Sebastiano . And as affection seemes to diuert them from this opinion: so reason endeuoureth to perswade and confirme them in the contrary. The next morne the Iudges sit and send for Berinthia , who comes accompanied with her parents, and many of her kinsfolkes: they againe examine her, and confront her with Philippo: shee is firme in her denyall: and her Iudges finde circumstances, but no probability nor witnesse against her, sufficient to conuict her of this crime: yet directed by the finger of God, they condemne her to the Racke. One of her Iudges pitying her descent, youth and beauty, as much as he detests this murther, intreates that her chamber may be first curiously searched, ere shee exposed to the Racke. This aduice and request is heard and followed with approbation: He, and two other Officers, accompanyed with some of her friends, repaire to Vilarezo his house, and Berinthia her chamber: They leaue no place, trunke, chest, nor boxe vnsearched: yea their curiosity, or to say truer, their zeale and fidelity to iustice, descends so low, as to visit her close-stoole, which for want of the key, they breake open; and behold the prouidence and iustice of God! heere they finde Berinthia's bloody gowne, and therin very closely wrapt vp that hellish knife, wherewith she perpetrated this inhumane murther on her onely brother. They praise and glorifie God for the discouery hereof, and so returne to their tribunall of iustice, bringing these bloody euidences with them, which Berinthia mought all this while haue remoued, if God , to his glory, and her shame, had not all this time purposely blinded the eyes of her iudgement to the contrary. At the sight hereof, she, without any torment, confesseth the murther, and with many teares repents her selfe of it: adding withall, that her affection to Antonio led her to this reuenge on her brother; and therefore beseecheth her Iudges to haue compassion of her youth. But the foulenesse of her fact, in those graue and iust personages, wipe off the fairenesse of her request. So they consult and pronounce sentence against her, that for expiation of this her cruell murther on the person of her brother; she the next morne shall be hanged in the publike market place. So all praise God for the detection of this lamentable murther, and for the condemnation of this execrable murtheresse: and those, who before looked on her youth and beauty with pity, now behold her foule crime with hatred and detestation: and as they applaud the sincerity of her former affection to Antonio: so they farre more detest and condemne this her inhumane cruelty to her owne brother Sebastiano . But what griefe is there comparable to that of her father and mother, whose age, content, and patience, is not onely battered, but razed downe with the seuerall assaults of affliction, so as they wish themselues buryed, or that their children had been vnborne? for it is rather a torment then a griefe to them, that they whom they hoped would haue bin props and comforts to their age, should now prooue instruments and subiects to shorten their dayes, and consequently to draw their age to the miseries of an vntimely and sorrowfull graue. But although they haue tasted a world of griefe and anxiety; first for the death of their daughter Catalina , and then of their onely sonne Sebastiano: yet it pierceth them to the heart and gall, that this their last daughter and child Berinthia , should passe by the passage of a halter, and end her dayes vpon so ignominious and shamefull a stage as a gallowes: which would adde a blemish to the lustre of their blood and posterity, that time could neuer haue power either to wipe off, or wash away: which to preuent, Vilarezo and his wife Alphanta vse all their friends and mortal powers, towards the Iudges , to conuert their daughters sentence into a lesse shamefull and more honourable death. So although the gallowes bee erected, Berinthia prepared to dye, and a world of people; yea, in a manner, the whole people of Auero concurd and seated to see her now take her last farewell of the world: yet the importunacy and misery of her parents; her owne descent, youth and beauty, as also her endeered affection and feruent loue to her Louer Antonio , at last obtaine compassion and fauour of her Iudges: so they reuoke and change their former decree, and sweeten the rigour thereof with one more honourable and milde, and lesse sharpe, bitter, and shamefull, and definitiuely adiudge her to be immured vp betwixt two walls, and there, with a slender diet to end the remainder of her dayes. And this sentence is speedily put in execution; whereat her parents, friends and acquaintance, yea, all that knew her, very bitterly grieue and lament; and farre the more, in respect they cannot be permitted to see or visit her, or she them: onely the Physicians and Diuines haue admittance and accesse to her; those, to prouide earthly physicke for her body, and these, spirituall for her soule: and in this lamentable estate she is very penitent and repentant for all her sinnes in generall, and for this her vile murther of her brother in particular: yea, a little imprisonment, or rather the Spirit of God hath opened the eyes of her faith, who now defying the diuell, which had seduced and drawne her heereunto, she makes her peace with God, and assures her selfe, that her true repetance hath made hers with him. So, vnaccustomed to be pent vp in so strait and darke a mew, the yellow Iaundize, and a burning Feauer surprize her: and so she ends her miserable dayes. Lo, these are the bitter fruits of reuenge and murther, which the vndertakers (by the iust iudgement of God ) are inforced to taste and swallow downe; when in the heate of their youth, and height of their impiety, they least dreame or thinke thereof: by the sight of which great effusion of blood, yea by all these variety of mournfull and fatall accidents, if wee will diuorce our thoughts from Hell to Earth, and wed our contemplations and affections from Earth to Heauen , wee shall then, as true Christians and sonnes of the eternall God, run the race of our mortality in peace in this world, and consequently bee rewarded with a glorious Crowne of immortall felicity in that to come. THE TRIVMPHS OF GODS REVENGE AGAINST the crying and execrable sinne of Murther. History VIII.  Belluile treacherously murthereth Poligny in the street; Laurieta, Poligny's Mistrisse, betrayeth Belluile to her chamber, and there, in reuenge, shoots him thorow the body with a Pistoll, when assisted by her Waiting-maid Lucilla , they likewise giue him many wounds with a Ponyard, and so murther him: Lucilla flying for this fact, is drowned in a Lake, and Laurieta is taken, hanged and burnt for the same.  shut them to godlinesse; for as soone as we follow Satan, God flies from vs, because wee first fled from him: but that his mercy may shine in our ingratitude, hee by his seruants, his holy Spirit, and himselfe, seekes all meanes to reclaime vs, as well from the vanity of our thoughts, as from the prophanesse and impurity of our actions: but if we become obstinate and obdurate in our transgressions,  & so like Heathens, fall fro vice to vice; wheras we should as Christians, grow vp from vertue to vertue: then it is not he, but our selues that make shipwracke both of our selues and soules; of our selues in this life, of our soules in that to come; then which no misery can bee so great, none so vnfortunate and miserable. It is true, the best of Gods children are subiect to sinne; but to delight and perseuere therein, is the true way as well to hell as death: all haue not the gift of pure and chast thoughts, neither can we so conserue or sanctifie our bodies, but that concupiscence may, and will sometimes assaile vs (or rather the diuell in it) but to pollute them with fornication, and to transforme them from the temples of the holy Ghost, to the members of a harlot: this, though corrupt Nature seeme to allow or tolerate; yet Grace doth not onely defend, but detest: but as one sinne is seldome without another, either at her heeles or elbow: so too too often it falles out, that murther accompanyeth fornication and adultery: as if one of these foule crimes were not enough to make vs miserable, but that in stead of going, wee will needs ride post to hell. A wofull president, and lamentable and mournful example, whereof I here produce to the view of the world, in three vnfortunate personages, in a lasciuious Lady, and two lewd and debosht young Gentlewomen , who all very lamentably cast themselues away vpon the Sylla of fornication, and the Charybdis of murther: for they found the fruits and end of their beastly pleasures far more bitter, then their beginning was sweet: yea and because at first they would not looke on repentance, at last shame lookes on them, and they, when it is too late, both on a miserable shame, and a shamefull misery. May wee all reade it to Gods glory, and consequently to the reformation of our liues, and the consolation and saluation of our owne soules. In the beautifull City of Auignion , (seated in the Kingdome of France , and in the prouince of Prouence ) being the Capitall of the Dutchy of Venissa , belonging to the Pope ,  & wherein for the tearme of welneere eighty yeeres, they held their Pontificall See; there dwelt a young Gentlewoman of some twenty yeeres of age, tearmed Madamoyselle Laurieta , whose father and mother being dead, was left alone to her selfe, their onely child and heire, being richer in beauty then lands, and indued with many excellent qualities and perfections, which gaue grace and lustre to her beauty, as her beauty did to them: For she spake the Latine and Italian tongue perfect, was very expert and excellent in singing, dancing, musicke, painting, and the like, which made her famous in that City. But as there needs but one vice to eclipse and drowne many vertues: so this faire Laurieta was more beautifull then chaste, and not halfe so modest as lasciuious. It is as great a happinesse for children to inioy their parents, as a misery to want them: For Laurieta's father and mother had been infinitely carefull and curious to traine her vp in the schoole of Vertue and Piety , and wherein her youth had (during the tearme of their liues) made a happy entrance, and as I may say, a fortunate and glorious progression: but when God , the great Moderator, and soueraigne Iudge of the world, had in his eternall Decree and sacred Prouidence taken them out of this world. Then Laurieta was left to the wide world, and to the vanity thereof, without guide or gouernour, exposed to the variety of the fortunes, or rather the misfortunes of the times, as a Ship without Pilot or Helme, subiect to the mercy of euery mercilesse winde and waue of the Sea: yea, and then it was that shee forgot her former modesty and chastity, and now began to adore the shrines of Venus and Cupid , by polluting and prostituting her body to the beastly pleasures of lust and fornication, wherein (it grieues me to relate) shee tooke a great delight and felicity. But she shall pay deare for this bitter-sweet vice of hers: yea and though it seeme to begin in content and pleasure, yet wee shall assuredly see it end in shame, repentance and misery: for this sinne of whoredome betrayes, when it seemes to delight vs, and strangleth, when it makes greatest shew to imbrace vs: so sweet and pure vertues, are modesty and chastity; so foule and fatall vices, are concupiscence and lust. But he with whom she was most familiar, and to whom she imparted the greatest part of her fauours, was to one Monsieur de Belluile , a proper young Gentleman , dwelling neere the City of Arles ; by birth and extraction, noble, but otherwise more rich then wise: who comming to Auignion , no sooner saw Laurieta , but hee both gloryed in the sight of her singular, and triumphed in the contemplation of her exquisite and incomparable beauty: making that, his best content; and this, his sweetest felicity; that, his soueraigne good; and this, his heauen vpon earth: so as losing himselfe in the Labyrinth of her beauty, and as it were drowning his thoughts in the sea of his concupiscence and sensuality, hee spends not onely his whole time, but a great part of his wealth, in wantonizing and entertaining her: a vicious and foule fault, not onely peculiar to Belluile , but incident and fatall to too many Gallants, as well of most parts of Christendome in generall, as of France in particular; it being indeed a disasterous and dangerous rocke, wheron many inconsiderate and wretched Gentlemen haue suffered shipwracke, not onely of their reputations, healths and estates, but many times of their liues. In the meane time, Laurieta (more iealous of her fame, then carefull to preserue her chastity) is aduertized that Belluile is not content to cull the dainties of her beauty and youth: but he forgets himselfe and his discretion so farre, as to vaunt thereof, by letting fall some speeches, tending to the blemish and disparagement of her honour: so as vaine and lasciuious as shee is, yet the touching of this string affoords her harsh and distastfull melody: For she will seeke to couer her shame by her hypocrisie, and so resolues to make him know the foulenesse of his offence, in that of his basenesse and ingratitude. To which end, at her first interuiew and meeting of him, shee not onely checkes him for it, but forbids and banisheth him her company: which indeed had been a iust cause and opportunity for him to haue conuerted his lust into chastity, and his folly into repentance. But hee is too dissolute and vicious, to be so happily reclaimed from Laurieta ; and therefore he is resolued, not onely to iustifie his innocency; but thereby also to perseuere in his sinne: hee is acquainted with many Gentlemen , who forgetting themselues, conceiue a felicity and glory, to erect the trophees of their vanities vpon the disparagement of Ladies honours: yea he seemes to be so farre from being guilty of this errour, as hee taxeth and condemnes others, in being guilty or accessary thereunto. So, although his Mistris Laurieta remaine still coy, strange and haggard to him: yet he perseuereth in his affection to her, who at last iudging of his innocency, by his constancy; and of that, by his many letters and presents which he still sent her, as also obseruing that shee had no firme grounds, nor could produce any pregnant or valable witnesses of this report; she againe exchangeth her frownes into smiles, and so receiues and entertaines him into her fauour, onely with this premonition and caution, that if euer hereafter she heard of his folly or ingratitude in this kinde, she would neuer looke him in the face, except with contempt and detestation. So these their disioynted affections, as well by oathes as protestations, are againe confirmed and cimented: but such lustfull contracts, and lasciuious familiarities and sympathies, seldome or neuer make prosperous ends. Now to giue forme and life to this History: Not long after, a braue young Gentleman of Mompillier , named Monsieur de Poligny , hauing some occasion, comes to Auignion , who frequenting their publike Balles or dancings, no sooner saw our faire and beautifull Laurieta , but he falls in loue with her, and salutes and courts her: and from thencefoorth deemes her so faire, as he vseth all meanes to become her seruant, but not in the way of honour and marriage, rather with a purpose to make her his Courtisan then his wife. But he sees himselfe deceiued in the irregular passion of his affection: for Laurieta is auerse, & will not be either tractable or flexible to his desires: so as his suite is vaine, and shee so deafe to his requests, as neither his prayers, sighs, letters nor presents are capeable to purchase her fauour. Poligny infinitely greeues hereat, which notwithstanding makes the flame of his lust rather increase then diminish: so as after much pensiuenesse, he begins to beat his wits,  & to awaken his inuention, how he may crowne his desires by enioying Laurieta , when lo, an occasion presenteth it selfe to him vnexpected. Madamoyselle la Palaisiere , a rich young Gentlewoman neere Pont Saint Esprit , liuing in Auignion , and seeing Poligny at the dancing, doth exceedingly fall in loue with him, yea she so admires the sweetnesse of his fauour, and the excellency of his personage, as she reioyceth in nothing so much; and to write the truth, in nothing else but in his company: so as, had not modesty with-held her, she would haue proued her owne aduocate, and haue informed him thereof her selfe. Poligny receiues so many secret signes and testimonies of her affection, by priuate glances and the like, as he cannot be ignorant thereof: but his loue, or rather his lust to Laurieta , hath so absolutely taken vp his heart and thoughts, as it hath left no place nor corner for la Palaisiere: so as here we may obserue and remarke a different commixture and disparity of affections. Poligny loues Laurieta , and not she him: la Palaisiere affects Poligny ,  & not he her: what these passions & occurrences will produce, we shall shortly see. La Palaisiere , hauing her heart pierced thorow with the loue of Poligny , knowing him to be Laurieta's seruant, and she the Mistris of Belluile , either out of her affection, or iealousie, or both, resolues at next meeting to acquaint Poligny with it, thereby purposely to withdraw his affection from her to herselfe: the occasion is proffered, and oppertunity seemes to fauour and second her desires. Some three daies after, the Iesuites (who as the Mountebanks and Panders of Kingdomes and Estates, leaue no inuention, nor cerimony vnattempted, to seduce and betwitch the affections of the world) cause their Schollers to act a Comedy in their Colledge in this Citie, whereat all the Nobility and Gentry of the Citie and adiacent Countrie assemble and meet. Thither comes Poligny , hoping to see Laurieta , and La Palaisiere to see Poligny: but Laurieta that day is sicke, and Belluile stayes with her to comfort her. So first comes Poligny , and seeing hee could not see his Laurieta , sits downe pensiuely: then comes La Palaisiere , and seeing Poligny a farre off, prayes her brother, who conducted her, to place her neere him. Poligny can doe no lesse then salute her, and she triumphing in her good fortune, takes the aduantage of this occasion, and in sweet and sugered tearmes (after many pawses; sighs and blushes) giues him to vnderstand that she knew his affection to Laurieta , and withall, that Belluile and no other was her seruant and fauorit. This speech of hers strikes Poligny to the quick: so as thereat hee not onely bites the lippe, but hangs his head; yea, this vnexpected newes, as also Belluile and Laurieta's absence, so nettle him, and frame such a Chymera of extrauagant passions in his heart and thoughts, as he could not haue the patience to sit out the Comedy, but feigning himselfe sicke, departs to his Chamber: where a thousand iealousies ingendered of his affection, perplexe and torment him; when remembring La Palaisieres speeches, and being infinitly desirous to know the truth of Belluile his affection to Laurieta , and of hers to him, he sees no meanes nor person so fit to reueale the same, as Lucilla, Laurieta's Wayting-maid. This Lucilla, Poligny wins with gold; in consideration whereof, she reueales him all, how Belluile was her chiefest Minion and Fauourite: and yet, for some words hee the other day in ignorance or wine, let fall to the preiudice of her honour, she was like to casheere and discard him. Lucilla hauing thus forgotten her owne fidelity, in bewraying the dishonour of her Mistris Poligny , vnderstanding Belluile to be a coward of his hands, though not of his tongue; and in a word, not to be so compleate a gallant as he supposed him, he of a subtill and malicious inuention resolues to worke on him; and so conceiues a plot, which we shall see presently put in execution and acted: he very politikely puts a good face on all his discontents and passions: and although Laurieta would not see him, yet hee fairely intrudes himselfe into Belluile's company, and of purpose becomes familiar with him. So they very often meet: for they fence, dance, ride, vault and hunt together: so as at last none are so great consorts & Cammarades as they. But Poligny thinking euery houre a yeere, before he had played his prize, makes a party at Tennis with Belluile for a collation, and beates him; and so taking two Gentlemen, La Fontaine , and Borelles his friends with them, away they goe all foure to a Tauerne. Poligny as secret as malicious in this his plot, in the middest of their mirth speakes thus to Belluile , Sir, quoth he, I am sorry for your losse of this Collatio: but if it please you to honour me with your company to morrow to Orenge , a City which I much desire to see, I will pay you the dinner in requitall thereof. Belluile very readily and willingly consents hereunto, and La Fontaine and Borelles vow they will likewise haue their share, both of the iourney  & dinner. So the next morne they all take horse for Orenge , but first Belluile giues his Mistris Laurieta the good morow, and acquaints her with his iourney: they view this old City, the ancient patrimony and principality of the Illustrious Princes of Orenge , from whence they deriue their name: where Poligny hauing giuen order for the dinner, away they goe, visite the Castle, and salute the deputed Gouernour thereof Monsieur Vosberghe: they see the part of the Amphitheatre yet standing, the Cathedrall Church , the double wall of the Citie, and the old Roman Arch not farre off, with all other remarkable obiects and monuments; and by this time the Cooke and their stomacks taxe them of their long stay. So they returne to their Inne, fall to their Viands, and like frollike Gentlemen , wash them downe with store of Claret: and now Poligny , as malicious in heart, as pleasant in countenance and conuersation, here, casts foorth his lure and snare to surprize and intangle Belluile . O quoth he, how happy the Gentlemen of Italy are to vs of France , sith after dinner euery one goes freely to his Courtisan without controulment. I know not, quoth la Fontaine , what Orenge is, but I thinke Auignion not destitute of good fellow wenches, who make Venus their Queene, and Cupid their god. Surely no, replies Belluile , for I am confident that for Iewes and Curtisans , for the greatnesse of it, it may compare with the best Citie of Italy: for from the Lady to the Kitchin-maid I dare say they'le all proue tractable. Nay, quoth Borelles , except still our holy Sisters the Nunnes . Not I faith, quoth he, nor my Mistris neither. Indeed, replies Poligny , if I knew you had a Mistris of that complection, I would aduenture a glasse of Claret to her health. When Belluile (out of a phantastick French humour) affirmed he had a Mistris, whose beauty was so excellent, as hee knew he could not receiue shame to name her, and if you please to honour her selfe and me with her health, I proclaime that Madamoyselle Laurieta is my Mistris , and my selfe her seruant. Of wise and Christian Gentlemen , what prophane speeches and deboshed table- talke are these they vse here, as if their glory consisted in their shame, or their best Vertues were to be discouered in the worst of Vices? for howsoeuer the Viands they did eat, may preserue the health of their bodies, yet this dissolute communication of theirs must needs poyson and destroy that of their soules: for as they should praise God in the receit of the one: so contrariwise they incense and displease his sacred Maiesty in giuing him the other: yea, this is so farre from Christianity and heauen, as it is the high and true way to Athiesme and hell: for whores and healths, in stead of prayer and thankesgiuing, are the prodigious and certaine forerunners of a seared conscience, and the dangerous and execrable symptomes of a leprous soule. Birds are taken by their feet, and men by their tongues: Belluile hauing so basely and sottishly abused himselfe in the disparaging of his Mistris Laurieta, Poligny hath his errand, for which he purposely came to Orenge . So dinner ended, they very pleasantly returne for Auignion: that night Poligny cannot sleepe for ioy, or rather for reuenge. For now hee presumes to know how to worke himselfe into Laurieta's fauour by vnhorsing Belluile: it is a dishonest and a base part to betray our friend, and vnder the cloake of friendship and familiarity, to harbour and retaine malice against them: but this irregular and violent passion of loue in young and vnstayed iudgements, many times beares downe all other respects and considerations. For if Religion and conscience be contemned, what hope is there that either honesty be regarded, or friendship obserued, sith it is the onely ciment and sinewes thereof? But Poligny is as resolute as malicious in his purpose; and therefore the next morne by his Lackey, sends the Lady Laurieta this Letter:  malice to Belluile , that I presume to signifie thee, how lately in my presence at Orenge his tongue let fall some words that tended to the preiudice and disparagement of thine honour: whereof I know it is not onely the part, but the dutie of a true Gentleman , to be rather curious in preseruing, then any way ingratefull in reuealing therof. Neither doe I attempt to send thee this newes, therby to insinuate, or drawe thee to affect me the more, or him the lesse: onely sith it is contrary to my complection and nature, to permit any Lady to be wronged in my presence; how much lesse thy selfe, to whom I not onely owe my seruice, but my life. If thou wilt not approue my zeale, yet thou hast all the reason of the world to pardon my presumption: and to make my Letter reall, what my pen affirmes to Laurieta , my sword is ready to confirme to Belluile . Poligny.  In the extremity and excesse of those three different passions; griefe, choller and astonishment, Laurieta receiues and reads this Letter, and like a dissolute Gentlewoman , being more carefull of her reputation to the world, then of her soule towards God, she knowes not whether she haue more cause and reason either to approue Poligny's affection, or to condemne Belluiles folly: it greeues her to the heart to haue bestowed her fauours on so base and ingrateful a Gentleman as Belluile ; vowes she will make him repent it, and is resolute that this vanity and folly of his shall cost him deare: yea, she is so impatient in these her fumes of griefe and reuenge, that shee thought once with all expedition to haue sent for Belluile , to make him as well see the fruits of his owne ingratitude, as to taste the effects of her reuenge and indignation, but she holds it requisite and fit, and her selfe in a manner bound first to thinke Poligny for his courtesie, by returning him a Letter in answer of his, which she speedily dispatcheth him by his owne Lackey to this effect:  discretion and affection, then Belluile of his enuie and folly. But as I rest infinitely obliged to thee for thy care of my reputation; so I resolue shortly to make him know what he deserues in attempting to eclipse and disparage it. Now as I grieue not, so I must confesse I cannot refraine from sorrowing at this his vndeserued slander: for as mine innocency defends me from the first, so my sexe cannot exempt me from the second: and looke what disparity there is betwixt thy generosity, and his basenesse; so much there is betwixt the whitenesse of my chastity, and the foulenesse of his aspersion. I rest so confident of the truth of thy pen, as I desire no confirmation by thy sword; and I flatter not, rather assure my selfe, that sith Belluile was so indiscreet to wrong me, he will neither haue the wit or courage to right himselfe. I returne thee many hearty thankes for this kind office and courtesie of thine: the which though I cannot requite, yet I will not onely indeuour, but striue to deserue. Lavrieta.  Whiles Poligny receiues Laurieta's Letter with much content, and many kisses, as triumphing to see how he hath baffled Belluile by working him out, and consequently himselfe into her fauour: wee will for a while leaue him, to consider whether the end of his trechery to Belluile will proue as fortunate and pleasing to him, as the beginning promiseth. And in the meane time we will a little speake of Laurieta , to see what course and resolution shee meanes to hold and obserue with Belluile . It is not enough that shee hath written Poligny a letter, but her enuy and contempt towards Belluile is so implacable, as she with much hast and secresie sends for him: her requests to him are commands; yea, he needs no other spurres but those of his lust, and of her beauty, to make him rather fly, then poast to her presence, when not so much as once dreaming of his former foolish speeches deliuered against his Mistrisse Laurieta , much lesse of Poligny's treason conspired and acted against him, hee thinkes to kisse her, whom so often hee hath formerly kissed: but his hopes, and her disdaine deceiue him: for shee peremptorily slights him; when hauing fire in her lookes, and thunder in her speeches, she chargeth him with this scandall deliuered by him at Orenge , in presence of Poligny , against her honour and chastity. And is this (quoth she) the reward a Lady shall deserue and receiue, by imparting her fauours to a Gentleman? and is this the part of a Gentleman , to erect the trophees of his glory vpon his Mistrisse disgrace? or are these the fruits of thy sighs and teares, or the effects of thy requests, oathes and letters? Yea, such was then her furious rage, and diuellish reuenge, as shee was prouided of a Stilletto, to haue there stab'd him to the hart, in her chamber, had not her Waiting-maid Lucilla , with her best oratory and perswasion powerfully diuerted her to the contrary, by alleaging her the imminency of the danger, which the foulenesse and hainousnesse of that fact brought her into. Belluile is amazed at this newes, when now prouing as prophane to God , as before he was base and ingratefull to Laurieta , he, with many oathes and imprecations denies these speeches, and this slander; and with much passion protesteth of his innocency. But this will not satisfie Laurieta: for to make his shame the more notorious in his guiltinesse, shee produceth him Poligny's Letter; whereat Belluile hangs his head, and seemes to let fall the plumes, not onely of his pride, but of his courage and iustification; yet he bitterly and vehemently perseuereth in his deniall: but all this is not capable to appease or content Laurieta ; and which is worst of all, nothing can possibly doe it, except hee make good her honour, and his owne innocency, by a combate or Duell , against Poligny . So Belluile sees himself driuen to a narrow and a shrewd push: He hath wronged Laurieta , and knowes not how to right her: Poligny hath wronged him, and there is no way left for him to right himselfe, but by challenging and fighting with Poligny . But he loues Laurieta dearely, and therefore must resolue to fight, or lose her: as for his owne part, to giue him his true character and description, hee is rather a City swaggerer, then a field souldier, loues rather to haue a faire sword, then a good one, and to weare it onely for shew, not for vse: he is ambitious of nothing more, then to be reputed, rather then found valiant. In a word, for a Tauerne quarrell, or a Stewes brawle he is excellent; but to meet his enemy in the field with a naked sword, that doth not onely daunt but terrifie him. The greatest comfort and consolation he findes in this his perplexity, is, that hee knowes hee hath many fellows and companions, who are as white-liuer'd, and as very cowards as himselfe: of which numbers hee flattereth himselfe with this poore base hope, that it is not impossible for Poligny to be one. But what is this to giue satisfaction to Laurieta , except it may shew himselfe to be Belluile , but not a Gentleman? But all these considerations notwithstanding, he loues Laurieta so tenderly and dearely, as not daring see her till he had met Poligny ; he pluckes vp his spirits, and infusing more metall and courage into his resolutions then accustomed, resolues to fight with him: to which end, hauing at length fitted himselfe of an excellent Rapier, whose temper (with as much truth as laughter) I confesse, was farre better then that of his heart: he, by his Lackey some three dayes after, sends Poligny this challenge:  sought to cherish thy friendship, it hath purposely been thy delight and ambition to betray mine, in throwing the apple of discord betwixt the Lady thou wotest of, and my selfe, vpon the poynt of her honour; for whose defence and preseruation, I owe not onely my seruice, but my life: which errour, or rather crime of thine, though thy affection to her may seeme to allow, yet my reputation to the world cannot, and my Rapier will not; therfore sith I haue been the vndeserued obiect of thy malice, finde it not strange that I iustly repute and hold thee the cause of my enuie; which can receiue no other satisfaction or reconcilement, but that to morrow at fiue in the morne, thou meet me without Seconds, on the bridge by the iron stumpe, (the limits 'twixt the King and the Pope ) with thy single Rapier, where I will attend thee with another; of which two take thou the choyce, and giue me the refusall. Sleepe not too much this night, for in the morne I doubt not but to send thee to thine eternall rest. Bellvile.  Poligny receiues this challenge, and admires to see Belluiles resolution, from which all former reports could neuer draw assurance; it is not feare that casts his head into these doubts, or these doubts into his head; for he is too generous to be a dastard, and too Eagle -bred to turne crauen: for reioycing in hauing made Belluile swallow a Gudgin, and triumphing in presuming himselfe seated in the throne of Laurieta's fauor, makes him as resolute to receiue this challenge, as willing and ready to performe it; onely the remembrance that Belluile sent it him by a Lackey, and not by a Gentleman , throwes him into as much disdaine as choller; but he resembling himselfe, passeth ouer this respect without respect, and so bids the Lackey tell his Master, that he will not faile to meet him, at the place and houre appoynted. The night doth, or should bring counsell: Belluile wisheth his challenge vnsent; but it being out of his hands, it is out of his power to reuoke or recall it. Poligny is of a contrary temper, and glad in his acceptance thereof, desires that his sword were in action, as well as his courage in contemplation. So out-passing the night, which Belluile passeth ouer with as much feare, as Poligny with generosity, the Courtaines of the night being withdrawne, and the day appearing, ere fiue haue strucken, Belluile notwithstanding is first on the bridge, and Poligny immediately after him: they are without Seconds, and therefore they briefly vnbrace, but not vncase their doublets. Belluile will bee valorous in words; and so according to his challenge, and the right of Duels , offereth Poligny the sight and choyce of his Rapier. Poligny is too braue to dye in his debt, vpon the poynt of honour and magnanimity, and therefore giues him his, as contented with the refusall: so (courtesie for a while contending with valour) they both assume and accept of their owne Rapiers, when diuiding themselues, they ioyne with resolution and fury. At first comming vp, Poligny giues Belluile the first wound in his right shoulder, without receiuing any, whereat hee is more affrighted then Poligny reioyced; at the second, hee receiues another wound in the left side, but is not yet so happy to see or assure himselfe, that his Rapier hath once touched Poligny's body, or which is lesse, his clothes: wherevpon considering Poligny's generosity, and comparing the bad grounds of his quarrell, with the faintnesse and basenesse of his courage, he throwes off his sword, prayes Poligny to desist, for he holds himselfe satisfied: when Poligny disdaining to taint his honour with the least shadow of dishonour, in receiuing Belluiles shame, giues him the happinesse and fruition of his life, and so they part. Lo here the first fruits of their foolish and lasciuious affections to Laurieta: but I feare, the second will proue more bitter and bloody. Belluile going home with his shame and repentance, and Poligny with his honour and glory, they hush themselues vp in silence, Poligny at his chamber, and Belluile at his Chirurgions house to dresse his wounds, hoping that as they in their fight saw no body, so, that none had seene them. But they are deceiued; for two souldiers from the Castle walls not onely espy them fighting, but know them. So they divulge it in the City, whereof Laurieta being aduertised, shee sends a confident Gentleman , a Cousin germane of hers, to finde out Belluile , and to know the truth and issue of his combate: but indeed his cowardize hath purchased him so much shame, as he will not be seene, much lesse spoken withall, which Laurieta vnderstanding, begins conceiue that the two souldiers report was true, and that vndoubtedly he and Poligny had met and fought in her behalfe: whereupon ghessing at the truth, that Poligny had giuen Belluile the foyle; she was once of opinion to haue written Poligny to be informed of the particulars and successe of their combate, which so much imported as well her honour as her content. But Poligny's affection preuents her curiosity: for as shee was calling for pen and paper, hee in person ascends the staires to her chamber, where, after a complementall and courteous salute, he informes her (as we haue formerly vnderstood) that hee hath giuen Belluile two wounds for her sake, and now his life for his own. She demands if he himselfe were not hurt? He answeres, No. At both which good newes shee infinitely reioyceth, and in token of her thankfulnesse, permits him to gather many kisses, as well from the roses of her cheekes, as the cherries of her lips: and so from thenceforth he vowes to be her professed seruant; and shee promiseth him to be, though not his Mistrisse, yet at least his friend. And here they vnite and combine their affections: but that contract, and this familiarity, written onely in vice, and sealed in lust, we shall shortly see cancelled and annihilated, with as much pitty, as infamy and misery, as the sequell of this History will shew and demonstrate. Whiles thus Laurieta and Poligny are triumphing in Belluiles foyle, and their own familiarity and affection, how is it possible but he must infinitely grieue for his losse of Laurieta , and la Palaisiere as much sorrow to see her selfe depriued and out of hope of her Poligny? But they brooke their afflictions and passions with variable resolutions: for whiles la Palaisiere is imbathing her selfe in her teares and discontents, Belluile is resolute to quench his reuenge in Poligny's blood. For forgetting as well his God, as his soule, his honour as himselfe, he intends to doe it by the bye, and not by the maine; by execrable trechery, not by magnanimous generosity: yea the diuell is so strong with his faith, because that is so weake with his Sauiour and Redeemer; as shutting the doores of his humanity and charity, he opens them to choller, reuenge, and murther: yea and henceforth he is so inraged, and his lookes are so ghastly and distracted, as if his thoughts were conducting and incouraging his hands to perpetrate some bloody stratageme and designe; which is obserued and doubted by his chiefest familiars and intimate friends, as also by la Palaisiere , whose company he sometimes frequents, not so much out of affection to her, as for consolation from her to himselfe; sith we are subiect both to hope and beleeue, that our afflictions are partly eased and diminished by the sight and relation of that of others, as sympathizing and participating with them, first, in their flames of loue; then, of griefe and sorrow, in being disdained of those we loue. Neither could Belluile so cunningly or closely rake vp the fiery sparkes of his malice and reuenge, vnder the embers of secresie and silence: but her affection to Poligny , and iealousie of his good, made her so tender-ear'd, and sharpe-sighted, as she ouer-heard some words that either in iest or earnest fell from Belluile's tongue, whereby it was apparent to her, that he intended no good, but portended a secret fatall malice to him, which a little time might too too soone and vnexpectedly discouer: whereupon her loue to Poligny was so deare and honourable, although hee were so firmely intangled in the beauty of Laurieta , as hee would not vouchsafe, rather disdained to loue her selfe: that she thought the discouery of Belluile's malice to Poligny , so much imported Poligny's good, as she held her selfe bound as well in duty as affection, to reueale and relate it him; which she doth in this Letter:  formerly done the feruency thereof with teares, know, thou hast some cause to feare, and I to doubt, that Belluile hath some dangerous proiect, or bloudy designe to put in execution, against his honour and thy life:  & as I reueale it thee out of my care, so looke thou preuent it out of thine owne discretion: lest be bereaue thee of thy life, as thou hast done him of his Laurieta , if thou slight this my aduice, as thou hast already my affection: yet as I remaine witnesse of the purity of the last, so will these lines beare testimony to the world, of the candeur and syncerity of the first: Neither doe I presume to send them thee out of any irregular ambition, to purchase the honour of thy fauour, but onely to let thee know, that my affection is both powerfull and capeable to shine thorow the clowds of thy disdaine, and that the obscurity of that neither hath defaced the lustre, nor can eclipse the resplendency of this: Regard therefore thine owne safety, albeit thou wilt not respect my content, and although thou please not, giue me the honour to be thy Mistris, yet I will take the ambition and resolution, to liue and dye thine hand-maid. La Palaisiere.  Poligny breaking vp the seales of this letter, laughs to see la Palaisiere's affection, and to vnderstand Belluile's malice: and being besotted with Laurieta , he lost both his wit and iudgement in the sight and contemplation of her beauty: yea, he is growne so fond in his affection, and respect towards her, as he is arriued to the meridian of this simplicity, to deeme it a kinde of treason, to conceale any secret from her: to which end hee shewes her la Palaisiere's Letter, which hee makes his pastime, and she her May-game: yea, so vaine is her folly, and so foolish her vanitie, to see the passages and euents of these their passions, as she not only exceeds the Decorum of discretio, but of modesty in her laughter: and which is more, when she againe considereth how Belluile loues her selfe, and not she him, la Palaisiere Poligny , and not he her, it makes her redouble her mirth and exhilaration in such fort, as she seemes to burst with the violence and excesse thereof: but this mirth of hers shall be shortly wayted and attended on with misery and mourning. But Poligny notwithstanding, sees himselfe doubly obliged to la Palaisiere , as well for her affection to him, as her care of him: and so holds himselfe obliged in either of these respects and considerations, to requite her with a Letter: the which now vnknowne to Laurieta , he writes, and sends her to this effect:  malice as thou doest affection. 'Tis true, I haue not deserued thy loue: 'tis more true, I haue not merited his hatred: for that proceeds from heauen, as a diuine influence, this from hell, as an infernall frenzie. I will not feed thee with hope, neither can he giue me despaire: for (not to dissemble) it is as likely I may loue thee, as impossible I shall feare him: he may haue the will to doe me hurt, I wish it were in my power to doe thee good; neither can he be more malicious to performe mee that, then I will be ambitious to confirme thee this: his malice I entertaine with much contempt, thy kinde aduice and syncere affection with infinite thankes: for when I consider thy Letter, I cannot rightly expresse or define, whether he beginne to hate mee, or I to loue thee more: I doubt not but to make his deeds proue words to mee, and I beseech thee feare not, but my words shall proue deeds to thee: for I am as confident shortly to salute faire la Palaisiere , as carelesse when I meet foolish Belluile . Polygny.  Hauing thus dispeeded her his Letter, the vanity of his thoughts, and the beastlinesse of his concupiscence, and sensuality, not onely surprizeth his reason, but captiuates his iudgement; so as Laurieta's sight defacing Belluile's memory, he thinkes so much on her affection, as he respects not her malice: but this Vice and that errour shall cost him deare; for whiles he is feasting his eyes on the dainties and rarities of Laurieta's beauty, Belluile's heart hath agreed with the deuill to prepare him a bloudy banquet: Grace cannot containe him within her limits; therefore impiety dallies so long with him, and he with impiety, that at last this bloudy sentence is past in the court of his hellish resolutions, that Poligny must die. The deuils assistance is neuer wanting in such infernall stratagems: for this is an infallible maxime, as remarkable as ruinous, that hee alwaies makes vs fertill, not barren to doe euill, neuer to doe good. At first Belluile thinkes on Poyson or Pistoll to dispatch Poligny: but he findes the first too difficult to attempt; the second, too publique to performe. Some-times he is of opinion to ascend his Chamber, and murther him in his bed, then to shoot him out at window as he passeth the streete: but to conclude, vnderstanding that he often comes very late in the night from Laurieta , he thinkes it best to run him thorow with his Rapier, as hee issueth foorth her house: and to make short, hereon hee resolues. Now to put the better colour on his villany, hee retires himselfe from Auignion , and liues priuately some sixe daies in Orenge: giuing it out, that he was gone to the City of Aix in Prouence , where, at that famous Court of Parliamet he had a Processe for a title of Land, shortly to be adiudged;  & so in a darkenight, taking none but his Lackey with him, he being disguized, in fauour of money passeth the gate of Auignion , and giuing his horse to his Lackey, being secretly informed that Poligny was with Laurieta , he goes directly to her doore; and there at the corner of a little street stands with his Rapier drawne vnder his cloake, with a reuenging and greedy desire of bloud to await Poligny's comming foorth. The clock striking one, the doore is opened, and Poligny secretly issueth foorth without candle, hauing purposely sent away his Lackey, who had then vnwittingly carried away his Masters Rapier with him. He is no sooner in the street, but Belluile as a murtherous villaine rusheth foorth, and so like a limbe of the deuill, sheathes his Rapier in his brest, when Poligny more hurted then amazed, and wanting his sword, but not courage, endeuoureth by struggling to cloze with his assassinate, and so cries out for assistance: but the dead of the night fauoureth his butcherly attempt, when withdrawing his sword, he redoubleth his cruelty, and so againe runnes him in at the small of the belly thorow the reines, whereat he presently falls downe dead to his feet, hauing the power to groane and cry, but not to vtter a word: which Belluile espying, and knowing him dispatcht, runs to his horse, which his Lackey held ready at the corner of the next street, and so rides to the same gate hee entered, which was kept ready for him, which passing, he with all expedition driues away for Orenge: from whence, the next morne before day, hee takes poast for Aix , the better to conceale and o're-vaile this damnable murther of his. But this policy of his shall deceiue his hopes, and returne him a fatall reward and interest. For although he can bleare the eyes of men; yet he neither can nor shall those of God: who in his due time will out of his sacred iustice repay and punish him with confusion. By this time the street and neighbours haue taken the Allarum of this Tragicall accident: so candles and torches come from euery where; onely Laurieta hauing played the whore before, will seeme now (though falsely) to play the honest; woman for she, to couer her shame, will not discouer that her selfe or any of her house are stirring: and so although she vnderstood this newes, and priuately and bitterly wept thereat; yet, she keepes fast her doores, and like an ingratefull strumpet, will permit none of her seruants for a long time to descend. The Criminal Iudge & President of the City, is aduertised of this murther. The dead Gentleman is knowne to be Monsieur Poligny , and being beloued, he is exceedingly bewailed of all who knew him, and enquiry and search is made of all sides,  & the Lieutenant Criminall shewes himself wise, because honest and curious, because wise in the perquisition of this bloudy murther: but as yet time will not, or rather God, who is the Creator and giuer of time, is not as yet pleased to bring it to light; onely Laurieta knew, and la Palaisiere suspected, and all those who were of the counsell of the one, or the acquaintance of the other, doe likewise both feare and suspect, that onely Belluile was the bloudy and execrable Authour thereof; but to report or divulge so much, although they dare, they will not. As for la Palaisiere , her thoughts are taken vp, and preoccupated with two seuerall passions: for as she grieues at Poligny's death, so she reioyceth that she hath no hand, nor was any way accessary to his murther; rather, that if he had sayled by the compasse of her aduice, hee had vndoubtedly auoided the shipwrack of his life, and preuented the misfortune of his death; what to thinke of Belluile , she knowes not, but if he were her friend before, he hath now made  & proclaimed himselfe her enemy, by killing her deare and onely friend Poligny , and therefore is resolued that as shee could neuer perfectly brooke his company, so now this his bloudy fact shall make her detest both it and him. But let vs a little leaue her, and descend to speake of Laurieta , to see how she brookes the murther of her intimate friend Poligny: for sith she assuredly knowes and beleeues, that this cruell murther was performed by no other, but by her professed enemy Belluile , or by some of his bloudy agents; loue and reuenge conspire to act two different Scenes vpon the Theatre of her heart: for in memory and deepe affection to her Poligny , her pearled teares, and mournfull sighes infinitely deplore and bewaile his disasterous end, so as sorrow withering the roses of her cheekes, and griefe making her cast off her glittering, to take on mournfull attire, she could not refraine from giuing all Auignion notice how pleasing Poligny's life was to her, by the excesse of her lamentations and afflictions demonstrated for his death; or if her sighes found any consolation, or her teares recesse or truce, it was administred her by her reuege, which she conceiued and intended towards Belluile for this his bloudy fact. So as consulting with Choller, not with Reason; with Nature, not with Grace, with Satan, not with God; she vowes to be sharply reuenged of him, and to make him pay deare for this his base and treacherous murther: yea, the fumes and fury of her reuenge are so implacable, and transport her resolutions to so bloudy an impetuosity, that resembling her sex and selfe, or not her selfe, but rather a monster of her sex, she inhumanely and sacrilegiously darts foorth an oath, which her heart sends to her soule, and her soule from earth to hell, that if the meanes finde not her, she will infallibly finde out the meanes to quench and dry vp her teares for Poligny's death, in the bloud of Belluile : which sith shee is so deuoyd of Reason, Religion and Grace, I feare, wee shall shortly see her attempt and performe. But leauing her in Auignion , let vs finde out Belluile in Aix: who is a Gentleman so prophane in his life, and deboshed in his actions and conuersations, as in stead of repenting, he triumphs at this his murther; yea, he is become so impious and impudent, as he grieues not thereat, but onely that hee had not sooner dispatched his Riuall Poligny: but the better to delude the world, that neither his hand, or sword were guilty in sending Poligny from this world in a bloudy winding sheete; his thoughts, like so many hounds pursuing his conscience, and his conscience his soule; he thinkes himselfe not safe in Aix , where the sharpe-sighted Presidents , and Councellors of that Illustrious Senat of Parliament might at last accuse and finde him out for the Authour of this bloudy murther; and therefore leaues both it and Prouence , and so rides to the City of Lyons , accompanied with none but his two Lackeyes: who, to write the truth, acted no part in Poligny's mournefull Tragedy, neither doth he yet thinke himselfe safe there; but within a moneth after the murther, thinking directly and securely to flie from the eyes and hands of iustice, thereby to auoyde the storme of his punishment; he againe takes horse for that great City  & Forest Paris , where hee hoped the infinit number of People, Streets, Coaches, and Horses would not onely secure his feare, but preuent his danger, and that here, as in a secure Sanctuary and safe harbour, hee might quietly ride at anchor in all peace and tranquillity: but (as before) the time is not yet come of his punishment, for it may be, God , out of his inscrutable will and diuine prouidence, will, when he best pleaseth, returne him from whence he came,  & by some extraordinary accident, make him there feele the foulenesse of his fact, in the sharpenesse and suddennesse of his punishment: which as a fierce gust and bitter storm, shall then surprize him, when he least suspects or dreames therof: but in this Interim of his residence, he forgets his new fact of murther, to remember his old sins of concupiscence  & whoredom, and so rather like a lasciuious Courtier, then a ciuill morall Christian , he cannot see the Church for the stewes, nor the Preachers, or Priests, for panders  & strumpets. But this vanity of his shall cost him deare, and he shalbe so miserable to feele the punishmet, sith he will not be so happy to seeke the meanes to auoyde it. For now sixe months hauing exhausted and dissipated the greatest part of his gold, and his credit comming short of his hopes, it seemes, the aire of Paris is displeasing to him, sith he cannot be agreeable to it;  & therfore (necessity giuing a law to the vanity of his desires) he begins to loath the Ile of France , to loue the Prouince of Prouece ,  & to loue Paris , to see Auignion . And now it is that the deuil, that subtill and fatall seducer, steps in, and at one time, bewitching both his reason and iudgement, presents him afresh with the freshnes  & delicacy of Laurieta's beauty, which so inkindleth  & reuiues the sparks of his affectio, that lay raked vp in the ashes of silence, as he vowes there is no beauty to hers; & if he chance espy any faire Ladies, either at Court, or in the City , he presently affirmeth, and infinitely protesteth, they come farre short of his Laurieta's delicacy, perfection, and grace; so as his purse tyrannizing o're his ambition, and his concupiscence o're his iudgement, he not so much as once dreaming of the implacable hatred shee formerly bore him, and thinking it impossible for her to conceiue, much lesse to know that hee murthered Poligny ; he is constant and resolute to reseeke the felicity to liue in her fauour and affection, or to dye in the pursuite thereof; but that will proue as impossible, as this apparant and feasable. So as absence adding fire to his lust, and excellency to her beauty, he is resolute to send one of his Lackies to Auignion: partly to returne with money, and so to meet him at Lyons, Moulins or Neuers: but more especially, in great secresie to deliuer a Letter to his faire and sweet Laurieta , and to bring him backe her answere; as if hee were still at Paris , and not in his iourney downewards: when meaning as yet to conceale his murther of Poligny , he calling for pen and paper, traceth her thereon these lines:  loued thee, thou hadst not so soone cast me out of thy fauor, nor God so suddenly him out of this world: but I know not whether more to bewaile my vnfortunacy occasioned by thy cruelty, or his misery ingendred through his owne trechery. And indeed as I grieue at that, so I sorrow at this: for although hee dyed mine enemy, yet in despight of his malice and death, I will liue his friend: and if thou louedst him as I thinke thou didst, I wish I might fight with his murtherer for his owne sake, and kill him for thine. I may say, thy affection and beauty deserued his better, though dare not affirme, I am reserued to bee made happy in inioying of either, much lesse of both, and least of all, of thy selfe; and yet I must confesse, that if our births and qualities were knowne, I should goe as neere to be thy equall, as he infinitely came short of being mine. What or what I haue performed for thy sake, is best knowne to my selfe, sith thou disdainest to know it: but if thou wilt please to abandon thy disdaine, then my affection and the truth will informe thee, that I haue euer constantly resolued to dye thy seruant, though thou haue sworne neuer to liue my Mistrisse; so that could I but as happily regaine thy affection and fauour, as I haue vniustly and vnfortunately lost it, Belluile would quickly forsake Paris , to see Auignion , and abandon all the beauties of the world, to continue his homage and seruice to that of his onely faire and sweet Laurieta . Bellvile.  With this his Letter he sends a Diamond Ring from his finger, and so dispatcheth his Lackey, who is not long before he arriue at Auignion , where very secretly he deliuers Laurieta his Masters token and Letter, and, trecherous fury as shee is, shee kisseth both, and breaking off the seales, reades the contents, whereat she infinitely seemes to reioyce, and so questioneth with the Lackey about his Masters returne: who being taught his lesson, told her, that that depended of her pleasure, sith hers was his; and withall prayes her for an answere, for that two dayes hence he was againe to returne to his Master for Paris: the which shee promiseth. The Lackey gone, shee cannot refraine from laughing; yea, she leapes for ioy, to see how Belluile is againe so besotted, to throw himselfe into her fauour and mercy, and to obserue how willing and forward he was to run hoodwink't to his vntimely death and destruction: for the diuell hath fortified her in her former bloody resolution; so that hap what will, shee vowes she will not faile to kill Belluile , because he had slaine her Poligny ; and already she wisheth him in Auignion , that she might see an end to this her wished and desired Tragedy. In the meane time shee prepares her hypocriticall and trecherous Letter, and a rich watchet Scarfe imbroydered with flames of siluer. So his Lackey repaireth to her, to whom shee deliuereth both, with remembrance of her best loue to his Master, and that she hoped shortly to see him in Auignion . The Lackey being prouided of his Masters gold, and this Scarfe and Letter, trips away speedily for Lions , where he findes his Master priuately hush't vp in a friends house, expecting his returne; he is glad of his owne gold, but more of Laurieta's Letter, when thinking euery minute a yeere before hee had read it, hee hastily breaking off the seales, findes these lines therein contained:  if his trecherous insinuation were too preualent with my credulity, I beseech thee attribute it to my indiscretion, as being a woman, and not to my inconstancy, as being thy friend: for if he dyed thy enemy, let it suffice, that I liue thine handmaid, and, that as he was not reserued for me, so I hope I am wholly for thy selfe. How farre he was my inferiour, I will not enquire; onely it is both my content and honour, that thou please vouchsafe to repute me thy equall: I am so farre from disdaining, as I infinitely desire to know what thou hast done for my sake, that I may requite thy loue with kisses, and make my thankes wipe off the conceit of my ingratitude. As for my affection, it was neuer lost to thee; nor shall euer be found but of thee. To conclude, I wish that our little Auignion were the great Paris , and if thy loue be as vnfained as mine is firme, let my Belluile make haste to see his Laurieta , who hath vowed to reioyce a thousand times more at his returne, then euer shee grieued at Poligny's death. Lavrieta.  At the reading of this her Letter, he is beyond himselfe, yea beyond the Moone for ioy; so as hee wisheth nothing so much, as himselfe in her armes, or shee in his. So he fits himselfe with a couple of good horses, puts his Lackeyes into new sutes, and knowing that time and his absence had washed away the remembrance of Poligny's murther, he speeds away for Auignion ; where the very first night of his arriuall, hee priuately visiteth Laurieta , 'twixt whom there is nothing but kisses and imbracings; yea she so trecherously and sweetly lulles him asleepe with the Syren melody of her deceitfull speeches, as she prayes him to visit her often, and that a little time shall crowne him with the fruits of his desire. So for that night they part: the next day he repaires to her againe, when amidst the confluence of many millions of kisses, shee prayes and coniures him to discouer her what hee hath done for her sake: when he tying her by oath, to secresie, and shee swearing it, he relates her, that it was himselfe, that in affection to her, had slaine Poligny , as he issued foorth her lodging: when hauing wrested and extorted this mystery from him, it confirmes her malice, and hasteneth on her resolution of his death, which his lasciuious thoughts haue neither the grace to foresee, nor the reason to preuent: she espies he hath still a Pistoll with him, and desires to know why he beares it; Who answereth her, it is to defend himselfe from his enemies, and that he will neuer go without it. So againe they fal to their kisses, and he to his requests of a further and sweeter fauour of her; which she for that time againe denies him; adding withall, that if he will come to her after dinner to morrow, she will so dispose of matters, as his pleasure shall be hers, and shee will not bee her owne, but his. So being surprized and rauished with the extasie of a thousand sweet approching pleasures, he returnes to his chamber, and shee to her malice: where whiles he gluts himselfe with his hope of delight; she doth no lesse with her desire of reuenge. And now ruminating on the manner of his death, she thinkes nothing so fit or easie to dispatch him, as his owne Pistoll: and so thinking she should need her waiting-maid Lucillas assistance, (of whom this our History hath formerly made mention) she acquaints her with her purpose, ye next day to murther Belluile in her chamber. And so with the lure of gold and many faire promises, drawes her to consent heereunto, and inioynes her to be prouided of a good Ponyard vnder her gowne for the same purpose, if need should require; which Lucilla promiseth. Now this night, as Belluile could not sleepe for ioy, so could not Laurieta for reuenge, who is so weighed downe to malice and murther, as she wisheth the houre come for her to reduce her diuellish contemplation into bloody action. But this houre shall come too soone for them both: for as Louers are impatient of delayes, so Belluile hath no sooner dined, but taking his horse and two Lackeyes, he sayes hee will take the ayre of the fields, that afternoone, but will first call in and see his Mistrisse, Laurieta . So he alights at her doore, and without the least feare of danger or apprehension of death, very ioyfully ascends Laurieta's chamber: who dissembling wretch as she is, very kindly meets and receiues him. And the better to smother and dissemble her murtherous intent, is not onely prodigall in taking, but in giuing him kisses. Belluile , like a dissolute and lasciuious Gentleman, whispers Laurieta in her eare, that he is come to receiue the fruits of his hopes, and of her promise and courtesie: when considering that his horse and two Lackeyes were at doore, shee returnes him this in his eare, that shee is wholly his, and that it is out of her power to deny or refuse him any thing; onely she prayes him to send away his Lackeyes, because their familiarity needed no witnesses. Thus whiles he calls them vp, to bid them carry away his horse to the gate that leades to Marseilles , and there to await his comming; Laurieta steps to her Waiting-maid Lucilla , and bids her make ready her Ponyard, and stand close to her; for now (quoth shee) the houre is come that I will be reuenged of Belluile , for my Poligny's death: the which shee had no sooner spoken, but Belluile returnes to her; whe redoubling his kisses, he little, or rather not at all learing hee was so neere death, or death him, being ready to retire himselfe to a withdrawing chamber, which Laurieta trecherously informed him she had purposely prouided for him; he takes his Pistoll, and layes it on the table of the outer chamber wherin they then were: which she espying, as the instrument she infinitely desired to finger, takes it in her hand,  & praies him to shew her how to shoot it off. So taking it from her, he told her, if she pleased, he would discharge it before her, for her sake. Why (quoth she) is it charg'd? Yea, replies Belluile , with a single bullet. Nay then (quoth Laurieta ) put in one bullet more; and if you can espy any Crow out of window, either on the house or Church top, if it please you, I will play the man, and shoot at it for your sake: When, poore Belluile , desirous to please her in any thing, lookes out the window, and espyes two Crowes on the crosse of the Augustine Friers Church, which he very ioyfully relates Laurieta ; and so at her request claps in a second bullet more; for (quoth shee) if I strike not both, I will be sure to pay one; and so prayes him to leane out at window, to see how neere shee could feather them: which (miserable Gentleman) he performing, the Pistoll being bent, shee behind him dischargeth it directly in his owne reines. Whereat he amazedly staggering, Lucilla seconding her bloody Mistrisse , steps to him, and with her Ponyard giues him fiue or fixe wounds thorow the body; so as without speaking or groning, hee falles dead at their feet. Whereat Laurieta triumphing and leaping for ioy, vttereth these bloody and prophane speeches: O Poligny , whiles thou art in heauen, thus haue I done in earth for thy sake, and in reuenge of thy cruell death! Which hauing performed, they more cruell then cruelty her selfe, drag his breathlesse carkasse reeking in his blood, downe the staires, into a low obscure Celler, where making a shallow graue, they there bury him in his clothes, and so pile vp a great quantity of Billets on him; as if that woodden monument had power to conceale their murther, and his body from the eyes and suspition of all the world. Good God! what diuels incarnate, and infernall furies are these, thus to imbrue their hands in the blood of this Gentleman? But as close as they act and contriue this their bloody and inhumane murther on earth; yet heauen will both detect and reuenge it: for when they least dreame thereof, Gods wrath and vengeance will surprize them to their vtter confusion and destruction; and it may be sooner then they are aware of. For the two Lackeyes hauing stayed at the City gate with their Masters horse till night, they returne and seeke him at Laurieta's house where they left him. Laurieta informes them hee stayed not an houre after them, and since, she saw him not: which newes doth infinitely afflict and vexe them. But they returne to his lodging, and like dutifull and faithfull seruants, betwixt hope and feare, await his returne that night, and all the next day; but in vaine. And now they begin to be amazed at his long and vnaccustomed absence, and so consult this important busines to some Gentlemen , their Masters confident & intimate friends: who together with them, repaire to Laurieta's house, and againe and again demand her for Monsieur de Belluile: but they find her constant in her first answere, and yet guided by the finger  & prouidence of God, they bewray a kind of perturbation in her looks, & discouer some distraction and extrauagancy in her speeches: wherupon calling to their minds her former discourtisie to him for Poligny's sake,  & his fighting with him on the bridge for hers, as also this sudden & violent suspected murther of him; they suspect and feare, there is more in the winde then as yet they know: and so acquaint the Criminall Iudges herewith, who as wise Senators , hauing seuerally examined both her and her maide Lucilla , and Poligny's Lackies, they conclude to imprison Lurieta ; which is instantly performed: whereat she is extremely amazed and terrified: but howsoeuer, she is resolute to deny all, and constant to stand vpon her iustification and innocency. So her Iudges adiudge her to the torments of the Rack, which (with a masculine, yea with a hellish fortitude) she endureth, without reuealing the least shaddow, either of feare, or guiltinesse: but they detaine her still prisoner, and hope that God will make time discouer the murther of Belluile: for eight daies being now past, they are become confident that he is not in this world, but in another. In the meane time, her bloudy Wayting-maid Lucilla hath continuall recourse to her Lady Laurieta in prison, where, like impious  & prophane wretches, they interchangeably sweare secresie ech to other, sith on eithers discouery, depends no lesse then both their deaths. Whiles this newes is generally divulged in Auignion, Prouence, Daulphine and Languedock , and no newes at all to be had or gathered of Belluile; La Palaisiere , who shined with as many Vertues, as Laurieta was obscured with Vices; out of compassion and Christian chrity, some three weekes after visiteth Laurieta in prison, although shee partly beleeued and knew, that shee neuer affected or loued her; when ayming to adde consolation to her afflictions, as God would haue it, Laurieta , out of her ignorance or folly, returnes la Palaisiere this vnlooked for answer: That her selfe was as innocent of Belluile's death, as she was of Poligny's . Which words being ouer-heard by some curious head of the company, were instantly carried and reported to the Criminall Iudges , who instantly cause la Palaisiere to be apprehended and brought before them, whom they examine vpon Poligny's death; which doth no way affright or afflict her, because her conscience was vntainted, and her selfe as innocent as innocency her selfe thereof. They deale further with her, to vnderstand the passages of former businesses betwixt her selfe, Poligny , and Belluile . She giues them a true and faithfull account thereof, yea, and relates them as much and no more, then this History hath formerly related vs: and to verifie and confirme her speeches, like a discreet young Gentlewoman , she giues them the keyes of a trunke of hers, wherein she sayeth is her copy of a Letter she wrote to Poligny , and his answere againe to her; which shee prayes them to send for, for her better cleering and discharge. The Iudges send speedily away for these Letters; which are found, produced and read, directly concurring with the true circumstance of her former deposition: whereupon with much applause and commendation, they acquit and discharge her. But if la Palaisiere's Vertues haue cleered her, Laurieta's Vices (which the Iudges beginne to smell out by Poligny's letter) doe the more narrowly and streightly imprison her; and yet knowing that la Palaisiere neither had, nor could any way accuse her, for either of these two murthers; she sets a good face on her bad heart, and so very brauely frolliks it in prison; and to speake truth, with far more ioy,  & lesse feare then heretofore: but to check and ouer-throw these vaine triumphs of hers in their birth, and to nip them in their buds, newes is now brought her, that her Wayting-maid Lucilla is secretly fled: which her Iudges vnderstanding, they now more vehemently then euer heretofore suspect, that (without doubt) Laurieta was the authour, and her maide Lucilla the accessary of Belluile's murther: and so they set all the City and Country for her apprehension: and this newes indeed makes Laurieta feare that she will infallibly be taken, which doth afflict and amaze her, and indeed hereat she cannot refraine from biting her lippe, and hanging downe her head. But see the miraculous and iust iudgement of the Lord, vpon this wretched and bloudie Lucilla! for shee, for feare flying, as it is supposed, that night from Auignion to Orenge , to her Parents, was there drowned, and the next morne found and taken vp dead in one of the Fenny Lakes betwixt the two Cities. Which newes being reported to Laurieta , she againe conuerts her feare into hope, and sorrowes into ioyes, as knowing well, that dead bodies can tell no tales. But the wisdom and integrity of the Iudges, by the apparancy of Laurieta's crime, in that of her Wayting-maids flight, againe command her to be racked: but the deuill is yet so strong with her, and she with the deuill, that she againe endures the cruelty of these torments with a wonderfull patience, with an admirable constancy and resolution; and so couragiously, and stoutly denying her crime, and peremptorily maintaining her innocency and iustification, her Iudges, led by the consideration of the sharpenesse and bitternesse of her torments, as also that they could finde no direct proofe, or substantiall euidence against her, begin to conceiue and imagine, that it might be the Wayting-maide, and not the Mistris, that had sent Belluile into another world; and so resolue the weeke following, if they heard nothing in the meane time, to accuse Laurieta , to release and acquite her; which Laurieta vnderstanding, the torments which her limbs  & body feele, are nothing in respect of those contentments and ioyes her hart & thoughts conceiue: and already building Castles and triumphs in her heart and contemplations, for the hope and ioy of her speedy inlargement, shee, in her apparell and behauiour, flants it out farre brauer then before. But she hath not yet made her peace with her Iudges, neither haue they pronounced her Quieta est . And alas, how foolishly and ignorantly doe the vanity of her hopes deceiue and betray her, when as the foulenesse of her soule, and contamination of her conscience, euery houre and minute prompt her, that God , the Iudge of Iudges , who hath seene, will in his good time and pleasure both detect and punish as well her whoredome as her murther, in her death! And lo, here comes both the cause, and the manner thereof, wherein Gods prouidence and iustice doe miraculously resplend and shine. For Laurieta being indebted to her Land-lord Monsieur de Richcourt , as well for a whole yeeres rent, as for three hundred Livres in money, which hee had lent her being impatient of her delaies, but more of her disgrace, lets out that part of his house which she held of him, to the Deane of Carpentras , who for his healths sake came to soiourne that Winter in Auignion: and despayring of her inlargement, and to satisfie himselfe, begins to sell away her houshold-stuffe, yea, to the very billets which she had in her Celler: which hee retaines for himselfe, whereof when his seruants came to cleere the Celler, they remouing the last billets, finde the earth newly remoued and opened, in the length and proportion of a graue, wherof wondering, they presently informe their Master; who viewing the same, as God would haue it, he instantly apprehended and beleeued, that Laurieta had vndoubtedly killed Belluile , and there buried him: when not permitting his seruants to remoue the least iot of earth, he as a discreet and honest Citizen, with all possible celerity trips away to the Criminall Iudges, and acquaints them herewith: who concurring with Richcourt in his opinion and beliefe, they dispeed themselues to his house and Celler, where causing the new opened earth to be remoued, behold, they finde the miserable dead body of Belluile there inhumanely throwne in and buried in his cloathes; which causing to be taken off, thereby to search his body, they finde him shot into the reines with two Pistoll bullets, and his body stabbed and pierced with sixe seuerall wounds of a Rapier or Ponyard: they are amazed at this pittifull and lamentable spectacle; and so resting confident it could be no other but Laurieta and her maide Lucilla , that had committed this cruell murther, they very priuately and secretly cause Belluile's dead body to bee conueyed to the prison, and there when Laurieta least dreamt thereof, expose it to her sight, and in rough tearmes charge and crie out vpon her for this murther; but this monster of Nature, and shee-deuill of her sexe, hath yet her heart so obdurated with reuenge, and her soule so o're clouded and benumm'd with impiety, as she is nothing daunted, or terrified with the sight hereof; but with many fearefull imprecations and asseuerations stands peremptorily in her innocency, and out of the heate of her malice and choller, tearmes them deuils or witches that are her accusers: but her Iudges , who can no longer be deluded with her vowes, nor will no more giue eare to her perfidious oaths, command to haue her Paps seared off with hot burning Pincers, thereby to vindicate the truth of her cruell murther, from the falshood of her impious, and impudent deniall thereof: whereat amazed and astonished, and seeing this cruell torment ready to be inflicted and presented her, God was so indulgent to her sinnes, and so mercifull to her soule; as the deuill flying from her, and she from his temptations, she rayning downe many riuolets and showres of teares from her eyes, and euaporating many volleyes of sighes from her heart, throwing her selfe downe on her knees to the earth, and lifting vp her eyes and hands vnto Heauen , with much bewayling and bitternesse, she at last confesseth to her Iudges, that she and her Wayting-maide Lucilla were the murtherers of Belluile , and for the which shee sayd, that through her humble contrition and hearty repentance, shee hoped that God would pardon her soule in the life to come; though shee knew they would not her body in this. Whereupon the Iudges , in horrour and execration of her inhumane and bloudy crime, pronounce sentence of death vpon her, and condemne her the next day after dinner, first to be hanged, then burnt in the same street, right against her lodging, Monsieur de Richcourts house: and likewise, sith Lucilla was both an accessary, and actor in this bloudy Tragedy, that her body should be taken vp out of her graue,  & likewise burnt with hers in the same fire: which accordingly was executed in the presence of an infinite number of people both of the Citizens, and adiacent neighbours of Auignion, Laurieta vttering on the ladder a short, but a most Christian and penitent speech to the people, tending first to disswade them all by her example, from those foule  & crying sinnes of whoredome, reuenge and murther, and then to request and perswade them, that they would assist her with their religious and deuout prayers, in her soules passage and flight towards heauen: yet adding withall, that as her crime, so her griefe was redoubled, because as she had killed Belluile for Poligny's sake, so she was sure that Belluile had killed Poligny for hers. And thus, Christian Reader , were the dissolute liues and mournefull deaths of these two vnfortunate Gentlemen, Poligny and Belluile , and of this lasciuious and bloudy Courtisan Laurieta , and her Wayting-maide Lucilla . A Tragicall History , worthy both of our obseruation and detestation; and indeed these are the bitter fruits of Lust, Whoredome and Reuenge, and the inseparable companions, which infallibly awayte and attend them, the very sight and consideration whereof, are capeable, not onely to administer consolation to the righteous, but to strike terrour to the vngodly. O therefore, that we may all beware by these their fatall and dangerous sinnes: for this is the onely perfect and true way to preuent and auoyde their punishments. THE TRIVMPHS OF GODS REVENGE AGAINST the crying and execrable sinne of Murther. History IX.  Iacomo de Castelnouo lustfully falles in loue with his daughter in law Perina , his owne sonne Francisco de Castelnouo's wife; whom to inioy, he causeth Ierantha first to poyson his owne Lady Fidelia , and then his said sonne Francisco de Castelnouo : in reuenge whereof, Perina trecherously murthereth him in his bed: Ierantha ready to dye in trauell of child, confesseth her two murthers; for the which she is hanged and burnt. Perina hath her right hand cut off, and is condemned to perpetuall imprisonment, where she sorrowfully languisheth, and dyes.  monsters in Africa: for Europe hath but too many, who are so cruell and inhumane, not onely to imbrue, but to imbathe themselues in the innocent blood of their Christian brethren. And as Religion prohibits vs to kill, and commands vs to loue our enemies: with what audacious and prophane impiety dare wee then murther our friends, nay those of our owne blood, and who are the greatest part of our selues? And although Italy haue lately affoorded many tragicall presidents, and fearefull examples of this nature, (whereof I haue giuen some to my former, and reserued others to my future bookes) yet in my conceit it hath produced none more bloody and inhumane then this, whether wee respect the murthers, or the persons. For here we shall see a wretched and execrable old man so besotted in lust, and flaming in malice and reuenge, as being both a husband and a father, he by a hellish young Gentlewoman (his strumpet) poysoneth both his owne wife, and his owne sonne: it was his vanity which first enkindled the fire of his lust: it is then his impiety which giues way for the diuell to blow the coales thereto, and so to conuert it into murther. O that sinne should so miserably triumph o're grace, and not grace o're sinne! O that age and nature should not teach vs to bee lesse bloody, and more compassionate, and charitable! And Alas, alas, by poyson, that drug of the diuell, who first brought the damnable inuention thereof from hell, to be practised heere on earth onely by his agents and members! We shall likewise see him killed by his daughter in law, for formerly poysoning her husband: lust seduced him to perpetrate those; affection, or rather bloody reuenge, drew her on to performe this, and consequently to her punishment due for the same. Had they had more Grace , and Religion , they would not haue been so inhumane: but falling from that, no maruell if they fell to be so wretched and miserable: for if we dye well, we seldome liue ill; if liue ill, wee vsually neuer dye well: for it is the end that crownes the beginning, not the beginning the end: therefore if wee will be happy in our liues, and blessed in our deaths, we must follow vertue, and flie from vice: loue chastity and charity , and hate lust and enuie; preferre Heauen aboue Earth; our soules before our bodies; and defie Satan, with a holy resolution both to feare and loue God. Sauoy is the Countrey, and Nice the City , (seated vpon the Mediterraneum sea, being the strongest Bulwarke against France , and the best fortresse and key of Italy ) where the Scene of this insuing tragicall History is laid: the which to refetch from the head-spring and fountaine of its Originall , it must carry our curiosity and vnderstanding ouer (those famous Mountaines) the Alpes , and from thence to the City of Saint Iohn de Mauriena , where of late and fresh memory dwelt an aged Gentleman , of rich reuenues and great wealth, named Seignior Antonio de Arconetto , who had newly by his deceased wife, the Lady Eleanora de Bibanti , two children, to wit, a sonne, and a daughter; that, named Seignior Alexandro , and this, the Lady Perina , a little different in yeeres, for he was eighteene, and shee but fifteene; but more in qualities and conditions: for hee was by Nature peruerse and cholericke, but she, milde, courteous and gracious. Againe, they differed much in the lineaments and proportion of their bodies: for Alexandro , like his father, was short, crook-backt, and hard-fauoured; and Perina resembling her mother, tall, straight-wasted, and faire: so as it being a principle and Maxime in Nature , that parents (for the most part) loue those children best, who best resemble them; as the mother Eleanora preferd Perina in her affection, before Alexandro: so contrariwise their father Arconeto did Alexandro , before Perina . But as God had called Eleanora out of this life, and left her husband to suruiue her: so Alexandro's ioy prou'd his sister Perina's misery  & affliction: for he was so happy to see himselfe tenderly cherished & affected, & she so vnfortunate to perceiue her selfe slighted & disrespected of her father: wherin as I praise Arconeto's intimate loue to his son, so I cannot but discommend, and withal pity his immerited and vnnaturall neglect to his daughter: wherein as Alexandro triumphed in the one; iudge, iudicious Reader , if Perina had not cause enough to grieue and lament at the other. But as the drift and scope of this History lookes another way; so for my part, who haue vndertaken to pen it, it is the least of my intent or purpose to giue instructions and directions, how parents should beare themselues in their affections towards their children: onely because I may not here too palpably bewray mine ignorance in my silence, I hope, nay, I am confident, that with as much truth as safety I may conclude, it is a happinesse both for parents and children, where parents beare their affections equally to their children: for louing one, and hating another, the ioy of the one, proues oftentimes the others sorrow; and in giuing that too much hope, we many times administer this too much cause of despaire: or if the inclinations and affections of parents bee more narrowly tyed, and strictly linked to preferre and loue one child aboue the other: yet sith they are the equall issue of our loynes, and we the onely parents of their youth, we should be as well cautious in the distribution of our fauours, as in the demonstration of our dis-respects towards them. But enough of this digression: and now againe to our History. As Alexandro grows vp in yeres, so he doth in ambitio  & ostentation: for if he play the Brauasho abroad among Gentleme  & Ladies , so authorized by his fathers hatred of his sister, he at home becomes a petty tyrant to her: yea, his carriage is so sterne and impious towards her, as if she were rather his slaue then his sister; or his laundres  & hand-maid, then any part of himself: which notwithstanding it was both a daily griefe to her hart, and a continual torment to her thoughts: yet Perina's sweet perfections,  & gracious vertues & behauior, make her digest and brooke all with a wonderfull constancy, and an admirable patience: for well she knowes, that if she should complaine to her father of her brothers vnkindnesse towards her, shee should thereby reape no other remedy or redresse but this, that the one would laugh, and the other triumph thereat; and that the issue thereof would prooue her complaints to bee the May-game of the one, and mocking-stocke of the other. But God hath ordained briefly to ease her of a great part of her vndeserued discontents and afflictions: For lo, her brother Alexandro , debauching and surfetting at a banquet at Susa , returnes home, surprized of a hot pestilent Feuer, which notwithstanding the care of his father, or the art of his expertest Physicians, he in three dayes is taken out of this life. And now guided by the light of Nature , and the instinct of common sence and reason, who would not surmize or thinke, but that Arconeto hauing buryed his sonne Alexandro , should now loue his onely daughter and child Perina , farre dearer and tenderer then before. But alas, nothing lesse: for he is not so kinde, and therefore she cannot bee so happy: yea which is worse, although his words be her commands, and his pleasure her law, yet he contemnes both her and her obedience, and neuer lookes on her with loue and affection, but still with difdaine and enuie. Yea, in a word, his distaste is so extreme  & bitter against her, as he is neuer best pleased, then when she is furthest from him; so as her absence may delight and content him, but her presence cannot. Which vnnatural disrespect, and vniust cruelty of her father towards her, doth so nip the ioyes of her youth, and the blossomes of her health and beauty; as, poore young Gentlewoman, she becomes infinite melancholy, and extreme weake and sickly: which being obserued and pityed of all her kinsfolkes and friends, as being her fathers onely child and heire to all his lands and riches, an Aunt of hers, being her mothers sister, and likewise her God-mother, tearmed the Lady Dominica , a widow woman of the same City, workes so with her brother in law Arconeto , that he is content to permit his daughter Perina to reside and dwell with her: Whereat, as the Aunt is not a little glad, so the Neece beyond measure infinitely reioyceth, and triumphes thereat; both hoping that her absence may, and will procure her fathers affection, which her presence could not; and that hauing more liberty and lesse bondage, she might again in a short time recouer her former health and content; or else that God, out of his diuine prouidence and pleasure in heauen, might call and allot her out some gallant husband heere on earth, with whom, in the contents and pleasures of marriage, she might end her future dayes in as much tranquillity and felicity, as she had formerly liued in discontent and affliction: and indeed the euent, though not in the first, yet in the two last poynts, answereth their expectations. The Lady Dominica hath formerly contracted a daughter of hers, named Dona Bertha , to a Cauallier of the City of Nice , tearmed Seignior Bartolomeo Spelassi , by descent noble, and of good reuenues and wealth. And now the appoynted time is come for their marriage: to which end, vp comes Spelassi from Nice to Saint Iohn de Mauriene , assisted and followed by many gallant young Gentlemen of his kinsfolkes and friends: and in a word, with a traine well befitting his ranke and quality, where these nuptials are solemnized with great variety of pompe and pleasure; as feasting, dancing, Maskes, running at the Ring, and the like: for in these amorous and Courtlike Reuels, the Sauoyards (as participating both of the French and Italian humours) take a singular delight and felicity. But as many times one wedding occasioneth and produceth another, so Fortune, or to speake more properly and truly, God ordained, that the Lady Dominica appoynted her Neece Perina , to conduct the Bridegroome her sonne in law Spelassi , to the Church; and he had allotted one of the noblest and eminent Caualliers that came with him, named Seignior Francisco de Castelnouo , to performe the same ceremony to his Bride the Dona Bertha , being a Knight of Malta , natiue of the City of Nice , and sonne and heire to Seignior Iacomo de Castelnouo , a very ancient and rich Baron of Sauoy . Now as Perina was a most beautifull and faire young Lady, so was our young Castelnouo a very proper and gallant Cauallier: and sith the occasion of this marriage, and the fortunacy and opportunity of their vnited office, by a kinde of destinated  & happy priuiledge, authorized each to be familiar in the others company and presence: so as Louers begin to court first in iest, then in earnest: the hearts and brests of this sweet young couple, are in the end equally surprized with the flame of affection: yea, his personage and dancing, and her beauty and singing, mutually inkindle this fire of loue in their thoughts and contemplations, which either imagineth, and both perceiue and vnderstand, by the dumbe Oratory and silent Rhetoricke of their eyes: which Castelnouo knowing her descent and quality answerable to his, hee intends to seeke her in marriage: when not any longer to surpresse or conceale their affections, they after dinner dancing in company of diuers others in the garden, he singleth the Lady Perina his new Mistris apart in a Bower closely ouer-vaild with Vines, Cycamours, & Cypres trees, and there 'twixt sighes and words, reueales her his deepe and feruent affection to her. But to auoid the prolixious relation of this their garden enteruiew and conference: although at first, Perina's modesty (the sweetest ornament and vertue of a Lady) was such, as she not onely kept her selfe, but likewise her affections to her selfe: yet her courteous and thankfull answeres, waited and seconded by many delicious blushes, and amorous sighes, although not publikely, yet priuately inform'd her Louer Castelnouo , that shee likewise loued him: so as during the tearme of fifteene daies which Spelassi and he remained in Saint Iohn de Mauriene , he neuer left courting her, till he had obtained her affection, and consent to be his wife: drawne thereunto by these two attractiue and seducing reasons: first, that Castelnouo was a gallant and proper Cauallier , as also her equall in descent and meanes, and then that she should liue in Nice with a husband that dearely loued her, and no longer in Saint Iohn de Mauriene with a father, who extremely hated her; neither can these our young louers beare their affections so secret, but the whole company, especially the Lady Dominica her Aunt perceiues it, and deeming it an equall and fit match for her Neece, reioyceth thereat. Castelnouo secretly acquaints her therewith, and intreates her best assistance therein towards her brother Arconeto: which she promiseth,  & forthwith attempteth, when Castelnouo taking time at aduantage, seconds her in his suite for the daughter, to her old father. Now her father Arconeto (degenerating from the naturall affection of a father towards his daughter) is so willing to depart with her to any husband, that he may no more see her, nor be troubled with her presence, as thinking a farre worse match good enough, he thinkes this infinitly too good for her, and so at the least shaddow of the very first motion, consents thereunto, which not onely banisheth Perina's old griefe, but confirmeth Castelnouo's new ioyes: yea, they, like two sweet and vertuous Louers, so extremely reioyce and triumph thereat, as he riding home poast to Nice , to acquaint his owne father Seignior Iacomo de Castelnouo therewith, and swiftly returning againe to Saint Iohn de Mauriene with his consent and approbation, this marriage of Castelnouo and Perina , is there almost as soone solemnized, as that of Spelassi and Bertha , though indeed more obscure, and with farre lesse pompe and brauery, in respect of the peruersnesse and distaste of her froward old father Arconeto . So fifteene dayes being expired since Spelassi and Castelnouo their first departure from Nice , they leaue Saint Iohn de Mauriene , to returne and conduct their brides home to Nice , robbing that, to inrich this City, with two such beautifull and gallant Ladies, as were Bertha and Perina . Now the better to adde life and forme to this History; or rather to approach the more materiall and essentiall parts thereof: we must here leaue to speake of Spelassi and Bertha , and wholly tie our thoughts and curiositie to Castelnouo and Perina , two principall and vnfortunate Personators, who both haue mournefull parts to act vpon the stage and Theatre of Nice: for this marriage of theirs is not begun with the tenth part of so many ioyes, as we shall shortly see it wayted and attended on, yea dissolued and finished both with teares and bloud. Castelnouo , hauing brought home his faire and deare Perina to Nice , she is very honourably welcomed, and courteously receiued and entertained of his old father Seignior Iacomo de Castelnouo , and of the Lady Fidelia his mother, and so are all her kinsfolkes and friends, who accompany her: yea, there wants no feasting nor reuelling in Nice , to testifie how much they congratulate and reioyce at this their sons good fortune  & happines. And for Castelnouo and Perina themselues, why they are so rauished in the content, and drowned in the ioyes and delights of marriage, as though they haue two bodies, yet they haue but one heart, desire and affection: yea, they are so extremely in loue each with other, as they beleeue there is no Heauen vpon Earth , to that of each others presence: but they shall be deceiued herein: for there are Tragicall stormes arising, to trouble the serenity of this marriage, and the felicity and tranquillity of these affections. For it is both with griefe and shame, that I must be so immodest; and therefore vnfortunate to relate, that the old Baron Iacomo de Castelnouo , aged of some three-score and eight yeeres, hath so farre forgotten his God and himselfe, his conscience and his soule, grace and nature, religion and humanity, as gazing on the fresh and delicious beauty of our sweet Lady Perina , his owne sonnes wife, he giues the reines, both of his obscene desires, and inordinate affections to lust after her. O how my heart trembles to thinke, how he that is white with the snow of a venerable age, should now lasciuiously idolatrize to beauty! how he that hath (as it were) one foote in his graue, should lustfully desire to haue the other in his sonnes bed! how he that hath his veines dried vp and withered, and nothing liuing in him but desire, should yet, of all the beauties of the world, desire onely to enioy that of his sonnes wife! how he that hath scarce any time left him to be repentant and sorrowfull for his old sinnes, will now anew make himselfe guilty of these foule sins of adultery, and I may in a maner say, of Incest! how he that hath not giuen the flower of his youth, will yet, still lasciuiously and wilfully refuse to bestow the branne of his age on his God! Alas miserable Castelnouo , wretched old man, or rather lubritious and beastly Leacher, thus to drowne thy thoughts in the hell of concupiscence and adultery, when it were far fitter thou shouldest lift them vp to heauen, in the sacrifice of prayer,  & other pious and religious contemplations! But all this will not preuaile to stop the current of his voluptuousnesse, and the progression of his sensuality: for without respect of his God, or regard of his soule, he is resolute in his desires to make a strumpet of his daughter in law, and to make his sonnes wife his whore: but God will deceiue his hopes and preuent his villany. Now the better, and sooner to draw her to his lasciuious desires, he is wonderfull courteous and affable to her, still walking and talking with her, yea, and many times kissing her, whereof both her husband and selfe are infinitely ioyfull, but especially Perina , because she findes a great alteration in her fortune, in that her father in law Castelnouo proues as courteous to her, as her owne father Arconeto is cruell. But, poore innocent soule, and sweet and chaste Lady, little doest thou either dreame, or thinke on his lasciuious intent against thine honour and chastity. Old Castelnouo wallowing in the filthinesse, and burning in the fire of his new lust, and losing himselfe and his thoughts in the Labyrinth of his daughter in law Perina's beauty, he thinkes on nothing so much, nay, on nothing else, but how to obtaine her to his lasciuious will: but not daring, or rather fearing to acquaint her with his inordinate and beastly purpose, whiles his sonne her husband is at home present with her: Hee forgeth and frames a plot, both vnnaturall and treacherous, to make him imbrace and follow the warres, in wayting on the Duke Charles Emanuel , or the Prince Amadee Victor his sonne and heire, who with their warlike troopes, were resolute to expell the Duke of Feria, Viceroy of Millan , with his Spanish regiments out of Verceille Cassall , and the other townes of Piedmont , to which end his lustfull affection to Perina made him eloquent in perswading, and powerfull in drawing her husband to this Martiall action, so full of honour and glory, adding that his honour, and the seruice of his Prince and Country , called him to the field, and that hee should not wholly drowne himselfe in the beauty of his young wife, and the pleasures of marriage. His sonne Castelnouo not at all suspecting, or dreaming what a dangerous Snake lay lurking vnder the greene leaues of his fathers sugered speeches and perswasions, like a noble and generous Knight as he was, needs no other aduocate but his owne honour  & Martiall disposition to imbarke him in these wars: and although the beautie, requests, and teares of his young Lady were vehement sollicitors to diuert him, yet he is resolute to leaue her for three or foure moneths: and so making ready his armes, traine, horses and preparatiues, he giuing her many kisses, and shee returning him a world of sighes and teares, leaues Nice , and so findes out the Duke and his Army in Piedmont , where for a little time we will leaue him. It is a question very disputable, and which my weake capacity and iudgement cannot decide, whether this departure of young Castelnouo to the warres, made his father more glad, or his wife sorrowfull: for as she was all in teares, so was he in mirth and iollity, being so vaine in his lust, and so lustfull in his vanity, as he trimmes vp his beard, and goes neater, and withall more youthfull in his apparell then accustomed, yea his lust had so metamorphosed him, as if it had a prophane influence, and secret power to renew old age in him. But alas, alas, what perfection of chastity can wee expect or hope for in youth, when we see no better signes and fruits in one of threescore and eight yeeres? But I will follow the streame of our History, though indeed the relation of this old lasciuious Lechers Lust and Vanity to his daughter in law Perina , equally afflict me with griefe and pitty to publish it. I am then constrained to write and auerre, that although meere shame and vnnaturalnesse doe as yet with-hold this wretched fathers tongue, from vomiting foorth his adulterated lust to his faire and chaste daughter in law Perina ; yet his lust is so immodestly lasciuious, as he cannot keepe himselfe out of her company, nor being in it, refraine from kissing her: but to see the innocency, and obserue the purity of her thoughts, she neuerthelesse not so much as any way suspects or dreames of his lasciuious intent, although indeed, she thinkes this courtisie of his somewhat exceed the priuiledge of a father, and the dutie of a daughter: but measuring this by the cruelty of her owne father, she, poore silly soule, thinkes her selfe in this respect now as happy, as heretofore she was miserable. Onely the absence of her deare husband Castelnouo doth both torture and torment her, and the more, for that he is in the field at warres, when God knoweth she desireth and wisheth he should bee at home with her in peace. But whiles Perina lookes from Sauoy to Piedmont ; from Nice , to Vercelli ; and from her selfe to her lord and husband, her other selfe: we must not forget, because our History will remember her mother in law Fidelia , which now wee must admit and re-conduct to act her part vpon the Theatre hereof, who obseruing her husbands immodest and vnwise familiarity demonstrated to the young Lady Perina her sonnes wife, as also his alteration in humours and apparell; but chiefly his vnaccustomed distraction and sighes in his rest and repose. Shee, more out of vertuous wisdome, then foolish iealousie, aimes at his vaine lust towards this young Lady her daughter in law, whereat she both admires with griefe, and wonders with the anxiety of affliction and sorrow, to see her old husband in the winter of his age, so sottish and beastly to lust after his owne sonnes young wife, to see that no respect of Heauen , no regard of conscience, nor apprehension of damnation and hell, had the grace or power either to kil these lasciuious thoughts in their coception, or to strangle them in their birth, to see that hee who was ready to goe to his bed of death, should now (like the Salamander in the fire) bee burning with desire, to goe to that of Lust and Adultery, and to see him so deuoyde of pitty, as hee must needs ioyne Incest with Adultery, as if one of these beastly sinnes alone were not enough enormous and prodigious to make his life miserable, and his death wretched: and although shee haue cause enough of sorrow in her selfe, yet, when she thinkes of her husbands age, and daughters youth; of his lust, and her chastity; and which is more, of the most degenerate and vnnaturall part of a father, to seeke to pollute and defile his owne sonnes bed, and consequently his honour: this indeed goes neere her, and this and onely this makes her looke on him, both with enuie and pittie: but her age hauing taught her to loue discretion, and to hate and disdaine iealously, she beares this as patiently as she may: till at last seeking and finding out a fit opportunity, she both with teares in her eyes, and griefe in her speeches, very secretly checks him for these his inordinate and lasciuious desires towards the young Lady Perina their daughter in law. But as it is the nature of sinne so to betray and inueigle our iudgements, that we flatter our selues with a false conceit none can perceiue it in vs: so this old Lecher her husband, thinking that he had danced in a net, from the iealousie and suspition of all the world, in thus affecting his sonnes wife; hee like a lewd and wretched old varlet, is so farre from rellishing these his old wiues speeches and exhortations, or from being reclaimed therby, as he disdaineth both them and her, and from henceforth is so imperious, and withall bitter to her, as he neuer lookes on her with affection, but enuie: which neuerthelesse she (as a modest wife, and graue matrone) holds it a part not onely of her loue, but of her duty, by sweet speeches, and soft means of perswasion, to diuert him from this fond and lasciuious humour of his. But obserue the vanity of his lasciuiousnesse, and the impiety of his thoughts and resolutions: for all her prayers and perswasions serue onely rather to set, then rebate the edge of his lust, and rather bring oyle to increase, then water to quench the flame of his immodest and irregular affection, so as seeing that shee stood in the way of obtaining his beastly pleasures; he, like a prophane and barbarous husband, tearmes her no more his wife, but his Medea ; and which is worse, hee out of the heat both of his lust and choller, vowes he will soone remoue her from this world to another. And here the diuell, ambitious and desirous of nothing so much, as to fill vp the empty roomes of his vast and infernall kingdome, by miserable and execrable degrees, takes possession first of his thoughts, then of his heart, and lastly of his soule: so as being constant in his indignation and choller, and resolute in this his impious and bloody reuenge, hee meanes to dispatch and murther her, who for the tearme of forty two yeeres, had been his most louing wife, and faithfull bed-fellow: but withall he will act it so priuately, as not hauing as yet discouered his affection to his daughter Perina , hee will therefore conceale both from her and all the world, the murther of this his wife Fidelia , except onely to those gracelesse and execrable Agents he meant imploy in this mournfull and bloody businesse. To which end (with a hellish ratiocination) ruminating and reuoluing on the manner thereof, hee hauing run ouer the circumstances of many violent and tragicall deaths, at last resolues to poyson her; and deemes none so fit to vndertake it, as her owne wayting Gentlewoman Ierantha: the which authorized by his former lasciuious dalliance with her, as also in fauour of fiue hundred Ducats, that hee will giue her, he is confident she will vndertake and finish: neither doth he faile in his bloody hopes. For what with the honey of his flattering speeches, and the sugar of his gold, shee, like an infernall fury, and a very monster of her sexe, most ingratefully and inhumanely consents therunto: so as putting poyson into white-broth, which some mornings shee was accustomed to make and giue her Lady , it spreading into her veines, and exhaling the radicall humour of her life and strength, within eight dayes carries this aged and vertuous Matron to her graue, and her soule to heauen. But her murtherers shall pay deare for this her vntimely end. The Lady Perina , and all the Lady Fidelia's kinsfolks and friends infinitely lament and bewaile her death: and indeed so doth the whole City of Nice , where for her descent and vertues shee is infinitely beloued and affected: but all these teares of theirs are nothing in comparison of those of her wicked and execrable husband Castelnouo: who, although he inwardly reioyce, yet he outwardly seemes to bee exceedingly afflicted and deiected. But as he hath heretofore acted the part of a murtherer, and now of an hypocrite; yet, haue we but a little patience, and we shall see that detected, this vnmasked, and both punished. Whiles this mournfull Tragedy is acted in Nice , the mediation of the French King and Pope reconcile the differences, giue end to the warres, and conclude peace betwixt Spaine and Sauoy . So home returnes the Duke of Feria , to Millan ; the noble Duke of Sauoy , and the generous Princes his sonnes, to Turin ; the Marshall de Desdiguieres , and the Baron of Termes into France ; and consequently home comes our Knight Castelnouo to Nice ; where thinking to reioyce with his young wife, he is so vnfortunate, to mourne for the death of his old mother: but God knowes, that neither of them know the least sparke or shadow of her cruell and vntimely murther, and lesse, the cause therof. Now for his lasciuious and bloody father: albeit, to cast a vaile before his thoughts, and his intents and actions, he publikely mournes for his wiues death, and reioyceth for his sonnes returne; yet contrariwise hee priuately mournes for this, and reioyceth for that. But to leaue the remembrance of Fidelia , to assume that of our Perina , I know not whether shee grieued more at her husbands absence, or reioyce at his presence, sith her affection to him was so tender and feruent, as in her heart and soule, she esteemed that as much her hell, as this her Heauen vpon Earth: but these ioyes of hers are but fires of straw, or flattering Sun-shines, which are suddenly either washed away with a shower, or eclipsed and banished by a tempest: for whiles her hopes flatter her beliefe of her husbands continuall stay and residence with her, her father in lawes lust to her, fore-seeing and considering, that it was impossible to thinke to obtaine her at home, e're her husband his sonne were againe imployed and sent abroad, makes all his thoughts aime, and care and industry tend that way, as if time had no power to make him repent the former murther of his wife, or Grace influence to renounce the future defiling and dishonouring of his daughter in law. But he is as constant in his lust to her, as resolute in his dispatching and sending away of him; onely hee must finde out some pregnant, vertuous and honourable pretext and colour, for the effecting of his designe and resolution: because he well knowes, his son Castelnouo is as wise and generous in himselfe, as amorous of his beautifull young Lady Perina: but his lust, which is the cause of his resolution, or rather his vanity, which is the authour of his lust, at one time suggests him these two seueral imployments for his sonne; either to send him into France with the Prince Maior , who was lately contracted, and shortly to espouse Madame Christiene the Kings second sister, or else vnder the insinuation of some great pensions and offices that were shortly to be disposed of in Malta , againe to send him backe thither: and his harping on these two strings, was the onely musicke and melody which he now gaue his sonne; who after he had a moneth or two at most, recreated himselfe in the sweet company of his deare and sweet wife Perina , hee least of all aiming whereat his father aimed, by his absence againe giues way, and consents to his desires of his departure: onely the choyce of these two different imployments is yet questionable  & vnresolued of 'twixt the father and the sonne. For as the sonnes curiosity desireth to see the Court of France , which as yet hee hath not seen: so his fathers lust and malice is to haue him returne honourably to Malta , from whence hee hath formerly receiued his honour of Knighthood, and there to obtaine a Pension during the terme of his life. The sonne imbraceth the pleasures of the iourney of France , before the profit and, honour of the voyage of Malta . But the father aiming at other ends, preferres this of Malta , before that of France ; so as time working an impression in his thoughts, and his fathers desire a kind of naturall command in his will, and of filiall obedience in his resolution, hee at last resolues on Malta . But as neither of these two enterprizes of young Castelnouo is pleasing, but distastfull to his young and faire Lady Perina: So if her affliction and misery be such, as of the two her husband must needs attempt and prosecute one: then sith hee may goe into France by land, and cannot to Malta , but by sea: she at last, with an inforced willingnesse (sympathizing with his first inclination) likewise desireth that the obiect of his iourney, and the period of his voyage be France , and not Malta ; as relying rather in hearing from him to stand at the speed and fidelity of a Poast, then at the inconstancy of the winds, and the mercy of the seas. So all things prepared and ready for his voyage, Perina importunately begging, and her husband Castelnouo confidently promising his speedy returne; she conducting him ouer the Hill to Villafranca in her Coach, they there, with many reciprocall kisses, sighes and teares, take leaue each of other; hee imbarking himselfe vpon a French Galley, bound from Marseilles to Malta , (which stopt there accidentally:) and she committing him to the auspicious fauour of the winde and sea, very sorrowfully returnes for Nice . Thus leauing the sonne floting and wafting on the seas, let vs againe returne to his vnnaturall and beastly father, who seeing his wife gone to Heauen , and his sonne to Malta , and all things hitherto to succeed according to his lasciuious desires, doth now assure himselfe, that either by faire or foule meanes hee will reape his pleasure of his beautifull daughter in law Perina . To which end hee giues her the sole gouernment and superintendance of his house, with intent and hope the sooner to gouerne, and surer to command her: and so forgetting modesty, and his lust giuing a law to his conscience; fifteene dayes are scarce past, till finding her alone in her chamber playing on her Lute, he, after some pauses, coughes, and kisses, bewrayes and vomiteth her foorth his feruent affection and desire. But for mine owne part, I highly disdaine to pollute and vilifie this History , with the obscene and lasciuious speeches, wherewith this old Lecher Castelnouo courts this young Lady Perina his daughter in law, as holding them as vnworthy of my relation, as of my Readers knowledge; of my modest pen, as of their chaste eares, onely iudging of their nature and quality, by their effects. The beastlinesse and vnexpectednesse thereof, first made Perina extremely blush for shame and choller, and then immediately againe looke pale with griefe and disdaine; when not able to brooke, or hearken to his lewd speeches, much lesse his hatefull presence; she, in the defence and preseruation of her chastity, which shee preferred before her life, giuing him a sharpe answere, and a bitter denial, and grieuing to see a father so gracelesse and impious, to seeke to defile his owne sonnes bed in her dishonour, she throwes away her Lute; and so very hastily and chollerickly abandoneth his presence, and her owne chamber. At which he bites his lip for rage, and hangs downe his head for indignation. But at last, sinne and the diuell raigning in him, makes that he will not take this her first repulse for his last answere and deniall: but resolute to perseuere in his lubricity, hee in euery walke, garden and roome, frequents and haunts her as her ghost, as thinking to obtaine that from her through his importunity, which hee could not by his perswasion: but this his impudency shall not preuaile. Now as his sinfull motion infinitely grieued her, so his perseuerance and importunacy therein doth doubly afflict and torment her: how to appease this storme, to quench the fire of his lust, and deface the remembrance and feeling of her griefe, she knowes not. For alas, alas, she is so vnhappy, as her owne father Arconeto , and her Aunt Dominica are at S. Iohn de Mauriene , her sweet and deare husband in Malta , and her mother in law, the Lady Fidelia in heauen; so as shee hath no intimate nor secret familiars, nor any bosome friend to reueale these her sorrowes and afflictions. Once she thought to steale away from Nice , so to passe the Mountaines, and to flie backe to S. Iohn de Mauriene: but againe considering the dishonour, and withall, the danger to vndertake this iourney, as also the cold reception and entertainment shee should there finde of her owne hard hearted father, who would rather deride then pitty her afflictions: she altereth this her resolution, and so resolues a little longer to stay in Nice , hoping  & praying, that God would rectifie her father in law Castelnouo's iudgement, and reforme the errours of his lasciuious thoughts and desires. And so for her part, hating the father as much as she loued the sonne her husband, hee could not bee more prodigall of his lewd speeches and tentations to her, then shee was of her sighes  & teares to vnderstand and repell them. A thousand times shee wisheth her selfe in Malta , with the Knight her husband, or hee in Nice with her: and could her body so soone haue flown or sailed thither as her thoughts, he had long since inioyed the happinesse of her presence, and she the felicity of his fathers absence. But sith shee is too miserable to be so fortunate, she hath yet this consolation left her to sweeten the bitternesse of her afflictions, and this hope to reuiue and comfort her against her despaire, that her Letter may procure his speedy returne from Malta to Nice . Whereon resoluing, although the occasion and grounds thereof were as strange as shamefull, shee secretly steales to her chamber, and locking her doore to her, takes her pen and paper, and rather with teares then Ink, writes him these few lines:  afflictions, then my pen depaint them, yet I should infinitely wrong thee in my selfe, and my selfe in thee, if I informe thee not by this my Letter (the secret Ambassadour of my heart) that my affection deserues, and mine honour requires thy speedy returne to me, I would vnlocke thee this mystery, and make it more obuious and apparant to the eye of thine vnderstanding, but that mine owne modesty, and anothers shame commands my pen to silence herein. And againe, my teares so confusedly  & mournfully interrupt my sighes, they my teares, & both my pen, as although I haue the will, yet I want the power to inlarge thee. Only my deare Castelnouo , if euer thy Perina were dear to thee, make her happy with thy sight, who deems her selfe not only miserable, but accursed in thy absence. For till Nice be thy Malta, Heaue may, Earth cannot reioyce me. Perina.  Hauing written this her letter, she findes a confident and intimate friend of her husbands a Gentleman , named Seignior Benedetto Sabia , who vndertakes the safe conueyance, and secret deliuery thereof in Malta to Castelnouo: so giuing it him with store of gold, to defray the charge of his iourney, as also a paire of gold bracelets for a token to her Knight and husband, he imbarques for Genoua , so to Naples ,  & from thence in a Neopolitan Galley, arriues in short time, to the renowned and famous Ile of Malta , the inexpugnable Bulwarke of Christendome , and the curbe and bridle of audacious insulting Turky , where finding out the Knight, Seignior Francisco de Castelnouo , he effectually and fairely deliuers him his Ladies letter, bracelets and message, who withdrawing himselfe to a window, hath no sooner broken vp the seales, and read the letter, but he is at first much perplexed at the vnexpected newes thereof: he reads it o're againe and againe, and findes it so obscure, as hee cannot gather or conceiue her meaning therein: but at last construing it onely to be a wile and fetch of her affection, to re-fetch and call him home to Nice to her: he loth as yet to lose and abandon his hopes of preferment in that Iland , which now the Great Master hath promised him, dispatcheth Sabia backe for Nice , and plucking off a rich Emerauld from his finger, deliuers it him for his Lady Perina , as a token of his deare and feruent affection, and with it a Letter in answere of hers. In the Interim of Sabia his absence to Malta , our old lasciuious Baron Castelnouo is not idle in Nice , in still seeking to draw our Lady Perina to his adulterous desire, and will, yea, he is become so obscene in his requests and speeches, as they not onely exceed chastity, but ciuility: so as she (poore Lady) can finde no truce, nor obtaine any intermission from these his beastly sollicitations, but resoluing still to preserue her honour with her life; her pure chastity shines cleerer in the middest of these his impure temptations, then the Sunne doth, being enuironed and incompassed with many obscure clouds: but shee thinkes euery houre, a yeere, before shee see her Knight Castelnouo safely returned from Malta , when lo, Sabia arriuing at Villafranca , trips ouer to Nice , and vnderstanding Perina priuately bolted vp in her Chamber, he repaires to her, and there deliuers her, her Knight Castelnouo's Ring and Letter, although not himselfe; when tearing off the Seales, she therein findes these words:  more afflict and grieue me, in respect I am ignorant whence they proceed, or what occasioneth them: 'tis true, thy affection deserues my returne, and the preseruation of thine honour, not onely to request, but to require and command it: but I am so assured of that, and so confident of this, as I know thou wils carry the first to thy graue, and the second to heauen: So, if any one since my departure haue falne in loue with thy beauty, thou must not finde it strange, much lesse grieue hereat, sith the excellency thereof hath power, not onely to captiuate one, but many: yea, the consideration thereof should rather reioyce, then afflict thee, sith whatsoeuer hee be, the shame in the end will remaine his, and the glory thine. But Deare and Sweet Lady , I thinke thine honour is onely the pretext, and thy affection the cause, so earnestly to desire my returne: whereunto I would willingly consent, but that the daily expectance of my preferment, must a little longer detaine mee heere: onely this is my resolution, and I pray' let it be thy assurance, I will dispatch my affaires here with all possible expedition, and shall neuer thinke my selfe happy, till I reimbarke from Malta , and land at Nice . Castelnovo.  Hauing o're-read her Letter, she, the better to dissemble her secret passions and griefes, very courteously conferres with Sabia : of whom hauing for that time thankefully taken her leaue, she for meere sorrow and affliction, throwes her selfe on her bed, from thence on the floore, to see her hopes deceiued of her husbands returne; and now shee knowes neither what to say or doe in this her misery and perplexity: for she sees that her father in lawes obstinacy, and consequently her sorrowes, grow from bad to worse, that he is so farre from reclayming, as he is resolute in his lasciuious and beastly sollicitations: So that seeing his faire speeches and entreaties cannot preuaile with her, hee exchangeth his resolution and former language, and so addes threats to his requests, and frownes to his smiles, as if force should extort and obtaine that, which faire meanes could not, yea, and sometimes hee entermingleth and administreth her such heart-killing menaces, as she hath now reason, not onely to doubt of his lust, but also to feare his reuenge: which considering, she, as well to preserue her honour, as to prouide for the safety of her life, will once againe proue the kindnesse of her owne vnkinde father Arconeto , and so determineth to leaue Nice , and to flie vnto Saint Iohn de Mauriene: now to assist and accompany her in this her secret escape, shee thinkes none so fit as Sabia , who for her husbands affection, and her owne vertues, willingly consenteth to her: so she preparing her apparell, and he her traine, they in a darke night (when pale faced Cynthia inueloped herselfe in a multitude of blacke and obscure clouds, purposely to assist and fauour her in this her laudable and honourable flight) take horse, and so with great expedition passe the mountaines, and recouer Saint Iohn de Mauriene ; where though she be not truely welcome to her owne father Arconeto: yet her honour and her life are truly secured from the lust and reuenge of her lasciuious father in law Castelnouo: neuerthelesse the cause and manner of her escape, but chiefly the consideration of her husbands absence in the passage of this businesse, doth still so bitterly afflict her, as she is become pale and sickly: whereupon she is resolute, once againe to send backe Sabia to Malta to her Knight and husband, with a second Letter, in hope it may effect and procure his returne, which her first could not: and so calling for pen and paper, she traceth thereon these few lines:  Nice , to liue, or rather to die in Saint Iohn de Mauriene for thine: 'tis true, my affection hath desired thy returne, which thou hast not graunted me: 'tis as true, that one, to whom Nature hath giuen a prime and singular interest in thee, and thee in him, hath sought the defloration of mine honour, which my heart and dutie haue denied him: thou art confident of my affection to thee: if thine had beene so faithfull and feruent to my selfe, neither sea nor land had had power to separate vs: if any preferment be dearer to thee then my life, stay in Malta : or if my life be dearer then it, then returne to Saint Iohn de Mauriene , where thou mayest finde me, for in Nice I will not be found of thee: hadst thou not purposely mistaken the cause for the pretext in my importunity of thy returne, I would haue digested it with farre more content, and lesse affliction: but sith neither my affection, or honour hath power to effect it, at least let the regard of my life, sith that will not accompany me, if thou any longer absent thy selfe from mee: make therefore haste to see thy Perina , if euer thou thinke to see her againe; and let her beare this one content to her graue, that shee may disclose thee a secret, which, but to thy selfe, shee will conceale from all the world. Perina.  Whiles Sabia is againe speeding toward Malta , with Perina's second Letter to her husband Castelnouo , we will a little speake of old Castelnouo the father, who seeing his daughter in law Perina fled, and consequently his hopes with her, he is extremely perplexed and afflicted hereat: All the house and City is sought for her, and hee himselfe breakes off the locks of her Chamber-doore, where he findes the nest, but the bird flowne away, her bed, but not her selfe: so as his thoughts doubly torment  & astonish him, first to be frustrated of his hopes & desires to enioy her, then, because shee will bewray his lasciuious suite and affection to her husband his sonne, which of all sides will procure him not onely shame, but infamy: yea, now it is, although before he would not, that he sees his errour, and vanity, in attempting to make shipwrack of her honour and chastity, which is the Glory , and should be the Palladium of Ladies: but it is too late to recouer her againe: and therefore although he know how to repent, yet, he is ignorant how to remedy or redeeme it, sith his attempt and enterprize was not onely odious to God , but infamous to men; opposite to Grace , and repugnant and contradictory to Nature: besides, this his lustfull folly proceeding from himselfe, lookes two waies, and hath a double reflection, first, on Perina the wife, then on Castelnouo her husband and his owne sonne, who, he is assured will be all fire hereat; yea, this crime of his is of so high and so beastly a nature, as he knowes not what to say to him, or how to looke him in the face when he shall arriue from Malta , which his guilty conscience tels him will be shortly, neither doth the Calculation or Arithmetike of his feare deceiue him: for by this time is Sabia againe arriued at Malta , where he deliuers Castelnouo his wifes second letter: the which doth so nettle and sting his heart to the quick, at the bitter and vnexpected newes it relates, as he esteemes himselfe no longer himselfe, because he is not with his deare wife, who is the one halfe, yea, the greatest part of himselfe: wherefore, admiring who in Nice , yea, in his fathers house should bee so impudently lasciuious, to seeke to blemish his honour, in that of his Ladies; he, making her sighes and teares his, with all expedition and haste, prouides for his departure from Malta , and yet his loue, his feare, or both conducing and concurring in one, makes him instantly resolue to dispatch and returne Sabia , as the harbinger to proclaime his comming: the which he doth, and chargeth him with this letter to his faire wife, and deare Lady Perina .  equally afflict and amaze me: I burne with desire, to know as well the Author, as the cause thereof, that I may likewise know how to right thee in reuenging my selfe of him. I haue thought it fit to returne Signior Sabia againe to thee, as soone as he arriued to me, being ready within two daies to imbarke as timely as himselfe: so that if winde and sea hate me not too much, in more louing and fauouring him, I am confident to bring and deliuer thee my selfe, as soone as he shall thee, this my Letter: and iudge whether I speake it from my heart and soule, sith the estimation of thy loue, and the preseruation of thine honour make me already deeme minutes, moneths; and houres, yeeres; till my presence be made happy with thine. I come, faire Perina , sweet wife and deare Lady , I come: and if Heauen proue propitious to my most religious prayers, and desires here on earth, our meeting shall be shortly as sweet and happy, as our parting was bitter and sorrowfull. Castelnovo.  So according to this his Letter, as first Sabia imbarkes from Malta to Nice , before him, so he likewise arriues at Genoua , the day after hee did at Nice , from whence poasting o're the mountaines, hee arriues at Saint Iohn de Mauriene , where, at his father in law Arconeto's house, he findes his deare  & sweet Lady Perina , who euery minute of time, with much impatient longing  & desire, expected his arriuall (as hauing the night before receiued his second and last letter by Sabia which aduertised her thereof) so like true and faithfull Turtle doues, esteeming each others presence their most soueraigne felicity, they fall to their billing and kisses, to informe themselues, how sweet this their happie meeting was each to other. And here our Knight Castelnouo cannot be so curious or hastie to enquire, as his Lady Perina was to relate the cause of her sudden departure from Nice to Saint Iohn de Mauriene , occasioned by the vnnaturall lust  & lasciuiousnesse of his father (as we haue formerly vnderstood) the which with many sighs and teares, she depaints forth to him in all its circumstances and colours. He is amazed at this strange and vnexpected newes, and farre the more to thinke, that his own father should (in the winter of his age) attempt or seeke to defile his honor & bed, in the person of this his faire and chast Lady Perina: he wondereth to see so little Grace in so many yeeres,  & that if Nature had not, yet Religion should haue had power to banish these lasciuious thoughts from his heart and memory: so without-spred arms, he tederly embraceth  & kisseth her, highly extolling her chastity, & applauding the discreet carriage of her escape: being himselfe resolute to stay in S t . Iohn de Mauriene  , with her father Arconeto ,  & not to returne to Nice , to his owne father Castelnouo: but he shall as soone infringe, as make this his resolution: for by this time, his father vnderstading of his sons returne from Malta , to S t . Iohn de Mauriene  , and knowing that his Lady Perina had not fail'd to bewray him his lasciuious suit  & desire attepted against her honour, as also grieuing at the remembrance of his former folly and future shame, in knowing what a foule scandall both it and his sonnes absence would procure and ingender him, he resolues to confesse his crime, and so by the mediation of a perswasiue and satisfying Letter, to indeuour to reclaime them againe from S t . Iohn de Mauriene to Nice , when calling for pen and paper, he writes these few insuing lines, and sends them his sonne by a Gentleman of his:  from Nice: and sith to deny, is to redouble our errours and imperfections, I will not go further then my selfe to find the cause thereof, sith I know, that my lasciuious and gracelesse attempt against the honour of thy chaste Lady , hath drawne thee to this resolution: but now I write it to my future comfort, as much as I conceiued it to my former shame; that Grace hath vanquished Nature ; and Religion , lust in me: so as I am at present not only sorrowfull, but repentant for that crime of mine, which I will no more remember but with horrour, nor thinke of, but with detestation. My soule hath made my peace with God, and my heart desires to recontract it both with thy selfe and her: and as I hope he will forget it, so I beseech you both to forgiue it me, being ready to confirme this my reconciliation, as well with my tongue, as pen. Wherfore sith thou art the sole prop of my age, and comfort of my life; make me not so vnfortunate or miserable, to be tax't with the scandall of my shame, and thy absence; but bring backe thy Lady with thee: For heere I professe before heauen and earth, that I will henceforth as much honor her for her chastity, as heretofore I lasciuiously sought to betray and violate it. Castelnovo.  This vertuous and religious Letter of the father preuailes with the sonne, and his faire and chast Lady ; so as their secresies and discretion hush vp this busines in silence, and within eight dayes they both returne from Saint Iohn de Mauriene , to Nice: where they are courteously welcomed, and respectiuely receiued and entertained of their father, whose contrition for his former folly is outwardly so great, as he hath teares in his eyes at the remembrance thereof: so as making good the promise of his Letter, he very penitently and sorrowfully implores their pardon and remission; which they instantly grant him, with as much willingnesse as alacrity. So the report and thought hereof is obscured, and vanished, as if it had neuer been; and all things and parties so reconciled, as to common sense nothing in the world is capable to trouble the tranquillity of this reconciliation and atonement. But alas, alas, we shall very briefly see the contrary: For old Castelnouo ye father, notwithstanding all these religious promises, and sincere shewes of repentance and teares, is so farre from being the man he seemes to bee, as although he haue made his peace with his sonne and daughter, yet ay me, I write it with griefe, he hath not with his conscience, nor his conscience with God: for although he haue a chaste and religious tongue, yet he still retaineth a lasciuious and adulterate heart: yea, he is so farre from conuersion and reformation, as the new sight and reuiew of the Lady Perina's fresh and delicate beauty doth reuiue those sparkes, and refresh those flames of his lust, which seemed to bee raked vp in the embers of her absence. And what is this, but to be a Christian in shew, and a miscreant in effect? to hide a foule soule vnder a faire face? and to make Religion and hypocrisie, a fatall and miserable cloke for his villany? But though he dissemble with God , yet wee shall see, and hee finde, that God will not dissemble with him; and in thinking to betray God , Satan in the end will betray him. The manner is thus: As he resumes his old suit, and newly burnes in loue and lustful desire, to erect the trophees of his lasciuious  & incestuous pleasures, vpon the ruines of his daughter in Iawes chastity and honour; so hee likewise sees it impossible, to thinke to performe, or hope to accomplish it, as long as his sonne her husband liues; and therefore losing his iudgement either in the Labyrinth of her beauty, or in the turbulent Ocean of his owne concupiscence and lust; hee, contrary to the rules of Grace , and the lawes and principles of Nature , swappes a bargaine with the diuell to poyson him. To which end, to shew himselfe the monster of men, and the bloodyest president of a most degenerate father, which this, or many precedent ages euer produced or affoorded; he hath againe recourse to his hellish Agent Ierantha , in fauour of fiue hundred Ducats, to send the sonne into Heauen after the mother, and to make him equall with her, as in nature, so in (the dissolution therof) death: a bloody designe, and mournfull proiect, which we shall presently be inforced to see acted vpon the Theater of this History . But Ierantha is at first so repentant for the death of the mother, as she will not consent to that of the sonne. And had she continued in this religious resolution, she had liued more fortunately, and not dyed so miserably and shamefully, as we shall briefly see. For our old Lecher Castelnouo , her Master, seeing his gold could not this second time preuaile with Ierantha , being equally inflamed as well with lust to Perina , as with malice and reuenge to his sonne Castelnouo her husband: hee is so implacable therein, as hee promiseth to marry her, if shee will attempt and performe it. So although his first battery failed, yet his second doth not. For the diuell had made her so ambitious of Greatnesse and honour, that of a simple waiting Gentlewoman , to become a great Lady , shee consents heereunto: and which is a thousand pities to report, within lesse then six dayes performes it; when ( God knowes) the innocency of of this harmelesse young Gentleman his sonne neuer dreamt or suspected it. At the sight of this his sudden death, his Lady Perina is ready to dye for griefe; yea to drowne her selfe in the Ocean and deluge of her teares; tearing her haire, and striuing to deface the excellency of her beauty, with a kind of carelesse neglect, as if she were resolute not to suruiue him. And if the Lady Perina bewrayed many deplorable demonstrations of sorrow for the death of her husband, no lesse doth his father Castelnouo for that of his sonne; only their griefes (conformable to their passions) are diametrically different and opposite: for hers were feruent and true, as proceeding from the sincerity of her affection; and his hypocritical and faigned, as deriued from the profundity of his malice and reuenge towards him. And not to transgresse from the Decorum and truth of our History , old Castelnouo could not so artificially beare and ouer-vaile his sorrowes for his sonnes death, but (the premises considered) our young afflicted widow and Lady vehemently suspecteth hee hath a hand therein; and likewise partly beleeues that Ierantha is likewise accessary and ingaged therein, in respect shee lookes more aloft, and is growne more familiar with her Lord and Master then before. And indeed as her sorrowes increase her ielousie, so her ielousie throwes her into a passionate and violent resolution of reuenge, both against him and her, if shee can bee futurely assured that they had murthered and poysoned the Knight her husband. Now to be assured hereof, she thus reasoneth with her selfe, that if her father-in-law were the murtherer of his sonne her husband, his malice and hatred to him proceeded from his beastly lust to her selfe; and that he now dispatched, hee would againe shortly reuiue and renew his old lasciuious suit to her: which if he did, she vowes to take a sharpe and cruell reuenge of him, which she will limit with no lesse then his death. And indeed wee shall not goe farre to see the euent and truth answere her suspition. For within a moneth or two after her husband was laid in his vntimely graue, his old lustfull and lasciuious father doth againe burst and vomit forth his beastly sollicitations against her chastity and honour: which obseruing, she somewhat disdainfully and coyly puts him off, but yet not so passionately nor chollerickly as before, only of purpose to make him the more eager in his pursuit, thereby the better to draw him to her lure, that shee might perpetrate her malice, and act her reuenge on him, and so make his death the obiect of her rage and indignation, as his lust and malice were the cause of the sorrowes of her life. But vnfortunate and miserable Lady , what a bloody and hellish enterprize dost thou ingage thy selfe in, and why hath thy affection so blinded thy conscience and soule, to make thy selfe the author and actor of so mournfull and bloody a Tragedy? For alas, alas , sweet Perina , I know not whether more to commend thy affection to thy husband, or condemne thy cruell malice intended to his father. For O griefe, O pity! where are thy vertues, where is thy Religion, where thy conscience, thy soule, thy God, thus to giue thy selfe ouer to the hellish tentations of Satan? Thou which heretofore fled'st from adultery, wilt thou now follow murther? or because thy heart would not bee accessary to that, shall thy soule be now so irreligious and impious, to bee guilty of this? But as her father in law is resolute in his lust towards her, so is she likewise in her reuenge towards him, and farre the more, in that she perceiues Terantha's great belly sufficiently proclaimes, that she hath plaid the strumpet; and which is worse, she feares, with her execrable and wretched father in law: so as now no longer able to stop the furious and impetuous current of her reuenge, she is so gracelesse and bloody, as she vowes, first, to dispatch the Lord and Master, then, the waiting Gentlewoman: as her thoughts and soule suggest her they had done first the mother, then, the sonne: so impious are her thoughts, so inhumane, and bloody her resolutions. Now in the Interim of this time, the old Lecher her father is again become impudent and importunate in his suite. So our wretched Lady Perina degenerating fro her former vertues,  & indeed fro her selfe; she, after many requests and sollicitations, very faignedly seems to yeeld and strike saile to his desire, but indeed with a bloody intent to dispatch him out of this world. So hauing concluded this sinfull fatall match, there wants nothing but the finishing and accomplishing thereof; onely they differ in the manner and circumstances: the father is desirous to goe to the daughter in lawes bed, the daughter to the father in lawes; but both conclude that the night, and not the day, shall giue end to this lasciuious and beastly businesse: his reason is, to auoyd the ielousie and rage of Ierantha , whom now, although she be neere her time of deliuerance, hee refuseth to marry her; but the Lady Perina's is, that shee may pollute and staine his owne bed with his blood, and not hers: but especially because shee may haue the fitter meanes to stabbe and murther him; and heereon they conclude. To which end, not onely the night, but the houre is appoynted betwixt them: which being come, and Castelnouo in bed, burning with desire and impatiency for her arriuall, he thinking on nothing but his beastly pleasures; nor shee, but on her cruell malice and reuenge: she softly enters his chamber, but not in her night, but her day attire, hauing a Pisa Ponyard close in her sleeue; when, hauing bolted his chamber dore, because none should preuent or diuert her from this her bloody designe; shee approching his bed, and he lifting himselfe vp purposely to welcome and kisse her; she seeing his brest open and naked, like an incensed fury, drawes out her Ponyard, and vttering these words: Thou wretched whoremaster and murtherer, this life of thine I sacrifice to mine owne honour, and the death of my deare Knight and husband, thy sonne . And so stabbing him at the heart with many blowes, she kils him starke dead, and leaues him recking in his hot blood, without giuing him time to speake a word; onely hee fetch't a screeke and groane or two, as his soule tooke her diuorce and last farewell of his body. Which being ouer-heard of the seruants of the house, they ascend his chamber, and finde our inhumane Lady Perina issuing foorth, all gored with the effusion of his blood, hauing the bloody Ponyard, which was the fatall instrument of this cruell murther, in her hand. They are amazed at this bloody and mournfull spectacle: so they seyze on her: and the report heereof flying thorow the City, the criminall Iudges that night cause her to be imprisoned for the fact: which she is resolu'd no way to deny, but to acknowledge, as rather glorying then grieuing thereat. Ierantha at the very first vnderstanding hereof, vehemently suspects that her two poysoning murthers will now come to light: and so as great as her belly is, she, to prouide for her safety, very secretly steales away to a deare friends house of hers in the City, which now from all parts rattleth and resoundeth of this cruell and vnnaturall murther: yea it likewise passeth the Alpes , and is speedily bruited and knowne in Saint Iohn de Mauriene , where although her father Arconeto would neuer heretofore affect her, yet hee now exceedingly grieues at this her bloody attempt and imminent danger; but her irregular affection, and inhumane reuenge, will not as yet permit her conscience to informe and shew her the hainousnesse of her cruell and bloody fact. But God will be more mercifull to her and her soule. Some two dayes after, she is arraign'd for the same, where she freely confesseth it, hauing nothing to alleage for her excuse, but that shee perfectly knew, that her father in law Castelnouo and his strumpet Ierantha , had at least poysoned the Knight her husband, if not likewise the Lady Fidelia his mother: the which although they had some reason and ground to suspect, because of Ierantha's sudden flight, yet sith this could no way diminish, or extenuate her murther of her father in law, they condemne our vnfortunate Lady Perina to be hanged, and so re-send her to prison, to prepare her selfe to dye. But the aduice of some, and the friendship and compassion of others, as pittying her youth and beauty, and commending her chastity and affection to her Knight and husband, counsell and perswade her to appeale from this sentence of the Court of Nice , to the Senate of Chambery (which is the soueraigne and capitall of Sauoy ) whither wee shall shortly see her conducted and brought. In which meane time, let vs obserue the wonderfull iustice and prouidence of God , shewed likewise vpon this execrable wayting Gentlewoman Ierantha , for so cruelly poysoning the Lady Fidelia , and the Knight Castelnouo her sonne, who, although search were euery where made for her, yet she hauing hush'd her selfe vp priuately, albeit her bloudy thoughts and guilty conscience for the same, continually torture and torment her: yet shee is so impious and gracelesse, as she no way feares the danger of the law, and much lesse the seuere tempest of Gods indignation and reuenge: which now notwithstanding in the middest of her security, will according to her bloudy deserts and crimes) suddenly surprize and ouertake her: for now this accident of her Lord Castelnouo's murther, and of the Lady Perina's imprisonment, or to speake more properly and truly, of Gods sacred decree and diuine Iudgement, throwes her into the sharpe and bitter paines of trauell for childe: with whose heart-killing gripes, and convulsions, she is so miserably tortured and tormented, as she her selfe, her Mid-wife and all the women neere her, iudge and thinke it impossible for her to escape death: when seeing no hope of life, and that already her pangs and torments had made her, but as it were the very image and anatomy of death, she begins to looke from sinne to repentance, from Earth to Heauen , and from Satan to God: and so taking on, and assuming a Christian resolution, she will not charge her soule with the concealing of this single adultery, much lesse of her double murthers; but very penitently confesseth all, as well it, as them; and so commits her selfe to the vnparalelled, and mercilesse mercies of her paines and torments: hoping they will speedily send her from this world, to a better. But her adultery and murthers are such odious and execrable crimes in Gods sight, as he will free her from these dangers of child-birth, and because worthy, will reserue her for a shamefull and infamous death. So she is safely deliuered of a young son (who is more faire then happy) as being the off-spring of lasciuious parents, and the issue of a most adulterous bed, and by Gods prouidence, and her owne confession, she, for these her beastly and bloudy crimes, is the second day committed to prison, and the third hang'd and burnt in Nice , and her ashes throwne into the ayre. A iust reward and punishment, for so hellish and inhumane a Gentlewoman: who, though otherwaies shee shewed many testimonies and signes of repentance at her end, yet her crimes were so foule and odious to the world, as at her death shee was so miserable, as shee found not one spectator, either to weepe for her, or to lament, or condole with her. And now to shut vp this History, let vs carry our curiosities and expectations from Nice , to Chambery , and from dead Ierantha , to our liuing Perina: where that graue and illustrious Senate , in consideration of her famous chastity, and singular affection to the Knight her husband, as also her Noble parentage and tender yeeres; they moderate the sentence of Nice , for murthering her father in law Castelnouo , and so in stead of hanging, adiudge her there to haue her right hand cut off, and her selfe to perpetuall imprisonment in Nice: where Gods sacred iustice for this her bloudy murther, and the remembrance of her dead husband, and liuing sorrowes, so sharpely torment and afflict her, as she liued not long in prison, but exceedingly pined away of a languishing consumption; and so very sorrowfully and repentantly ended her daies; being exceedingly lamented of her kins- folkes, and pittied of all her acquaintance: and, had not her affection beene blinded, and her rage and reuenge too much triumphed o're her thoughts and resolutions, she had liued as happy, as she died miserable; and haue serued for as great a Grace and ornament to her countrey, as Ierantha and old Castelnouo , her father in law were a scandall and shame. Thus wee see, how Gods reuenging Iustice still meetes with murther. O that we may read this History with feare, and profit thereby in reformation, that dying to sinne, and liuing to righteousnesse, we may peaceably dye in this world, and gloriously liue and raigne in that to come. THE TRIVMPHS OF GODS REVENGE AGAINST the crying and execrable sinne of Murther. History X.  Bertolini seekes Paulina in marriage, but she loues Sturio and not himselfe: he prayes her brother Brellati his deare friend to sollicit her for him, which he doth, but cannot preuaile; whereupon Bertolini lets fall some disgracefull speeches, both against her honour, and his reputation, for which Brellati challengeth the field of him: where Bertolini kills him, and he flies for the same. Sturio seekes to marry her, but his father will not consent thereto, and so conueyes him away secretly, for which two disasters Paulina dyes for sorrow. Sturio findes out Bertolini , and sends him a challenge, and hauing him at his mercie, giues him his life at his request: he afterwards very treacherously kills Sturio , with a Petronell in the streete from a window: He is taken for this second murther, his two hands cut off, then beheaded, and his body throwne into the Riuer.  most essentiall Vertues and proper ornaments) yet sith Charity is the true marke and character of a Christian , we should not rashly resolue to hazard the losse of our liues for the preseruation of the meere title, and vaine point of our honour: but rather religiously endeuour to suite our soules in that of our owne liues, as also of those of our Christian brethren: for in Duells and single Combats, (which though the heat of youth and reuenge seeme to allow, yet, reason will not, and Religion cannot) did we only hazzard our bodies, and not our soules, then our warrant to fight, were in earth as iust, as now the hazzarding of our soules and bodies is odious and distastefull to Heauen , sith in seeking to deface man the creature, we assuredly attempt to strike, and stabbe at the Maiestie of God the Creator: but if there be any colour or shaddow of honour to kill our aduersary, for the preseruation of the vaine point of our honour: what an ignoble ingratitude, and damnable impiety is it, for a Gentleman likewise treacherously to kill another, of whom hee hath formerly receiued his life? yea, as Grace fights against this former sort of fighting, so both Grace and Nature impugne and detest this second sort of murther: A wofull and mournfull president whereof, I here represent in the person of a base and wretched Gentleman, whose irregular affection to a Lady, first slue her brother in the field; and execrable reuenge to her louer, next drew him treacherously to murther him in the street; and consequently, to his owne condigne punishment, and shamefull death for the same. May all such bloudy murtherers still meet with such ends: and may his miserable and infamous death premonish all other Gentlemen, to liue and become more charitable, and lesse bloudy by his example. The friendship and familiarity betwixt Seignior Iohn Battista Bertolini , and Seignior Leonardo Brellati , two Noble young Gentlemen , natiue and resident of the City of Rome , was (without intermission) so intire and intimate, for the space of sixe whole yeeres, which led them from their yeeres of foureteene to twenty, as it seemed they had but one heart in two bodies, and that it was impossible for either of them to be truly merry, if the other were absent: and surely, many were the reasons which layd the foundation of this friendship; for as they were equall in yeeres, so their statures and complexions resembled, and their humors and inclinations sympathized: likewise they were ancient schoole-fellowes, and neere neighbours: for their parents both dwelt betwixt the Palaces of the two Cardinals, Farnesi and Caponius: or if there were any disparity in their dignities and worths, it consisted onely in this, Bertolini's parents were richer then Brellati's, but Brellati was more Nobly discended then Bertolini: which notwithstanding could no way impeach or hinder the progresse of their friendship, but rather it flourished with the time: so as they increasing in yeeres, they likewise did in affection, as if they were ambitious of nothing so much in this world, as not onely to imitate, but to surpasse the friendship of Orestes and Pillades , and of Damon and Pithias: whereof, all who knew them and their parents, yea, all that part and diuision of Rome , tooke deepe and singular notice: but to shew that they were men, and not Angels, and consequently subiect to frailty not inherent to perfection, that earth was not Heauen , nor Rome the shaddow thereof; haue we but a little patience, we shall shortly see, the thred of this friendship cut off, the props and fortifications thereof razed, battered, and layd leuell with the ground, yea, we shall see time, change with time, friendship turned into enmitie, fellowes to foes, loue to loathing, courtesie to crueltie, and in a word, life to death: as obserue the sequell of this History, and it will briefly informe yee how. Bertolini sees that Brellati hath a faire and delicate sister, named Dona Paulina , somewhat younger then himselfe, and yet not so young, but that the clock of her age hath strucken eighteene, and therefore proclaimed her at least capeable, if not desirous of marriage, and although hee be a nouice in the Art of loue, yet Nature hath made him so good a scholler in the principles and rudiments thereof, as hee sees her faire, and therefore must loue her; rich in the excellency and delicacy of beautie, and therefore is resolute to loue her, and onely her: for gazing on the influence and splendor of her piercing eyes, hee cannot behold them without wonder, and then prying and contemplating on the roseat and lilly tincture of her cheekes, he cannot see these without admiration, nor refraine from admiring them without affection: but againe, remarking the slendernesse of her bodie, and the sweetnesse of her Vertues, and seeing her as gracious as faire, and that her inward perfections added as much lustre to her exteriour beautie, as this reflected ornament and decoration to these; he, as young as he was, vowes himselfe her seruant, and withall swore, that either she, or his graue, must be his wife and Mistris. Bertolini thus surprized and nettled with the beauty of his dearely sweet, and sweetly faire, Paulina ; hee is inforced to neglect a great part of his accompanying the brother, thereby to court the sister: so hee many times purposely forsakes Brellati, to follow Paulina , and delights in nothing so much as in her presence: and (in that regard) in his absence, not that it was possible, in his conceit and imagination, for him any way to hate him, in louing her; rather, that in generall termes hee must loue Brellati for Paulina's sake; and in particular, onely affect her for his owne. And as his wealth and ambition made him confident he should obtaine her for his wife: so he in faire, amorous, and honourable tearmes, as well by his owne sollicitations, Letters, promises and presents, as by those of his parents, seeks her in marriage: yea and when these would not suffice, he, to shew himselfe as true as feruent a Louer, addes sighes, teares, prayers, and oathes. But all these sollicitors serue onely to betray and deceiue his hopes: for if Bertolini were extremely desirous to marry Paulina , she is as resolute not to match him: which discords in affection, seldome or neuer make any true harmony in mindes. His wealth deceiuing him, hee hath recourse to her onely brother, and his best and dearest friend Brellati , to whom he relates the profundity and feruency of his affection to his sister Paulina , acquaints him with his suite, and her deniall; his attempt, and her repulse therein; and by the power and bonds of all their former friendship and familiarity, intreats and coniures him to become his oratour and aduocate towards her, in his behalfe; whose smiles, he alleageth, are his life, and frownes, his death. Brellati hauing his generosity and iudgement blinded with the respect of Bertolini his wealth, as also of the affection he bore him; all other considerations laid apart, like a better friend to him, then a brother to his sister Paulina , promiseth him his best furtherance and assistance in the processe of this his affection: and so, with his truest Oratory , best Eloquence, and sweetest Perswasion, begins to deale effectually with her herein. But as our hopes are subiect  & incident to deceiue vs, so Bertolini and Brellati come farre too short of theirs: for Paulina in absolute and downe-right tearmes prayes her brother to informe and resolue Bertolini , that she hath otherwayes settled and ingaged her affection: and therefore prayes him to seeke another Mistris , sith she hath found another Louer and Seruant, with whom shee meanes to liue and dye. Her brother (for his friends sake) is extremely sorrowfull hereat, and prayes his sister to name him her seruant: she bindes him by oath to secresie. So he swearing, she informes him it is Seignior Paulus Sturio , a very ancient Noble man of the City. He tels her, he is a Gentleman more noble then rich: and she replies, that Bertolini is more rich then noble; and therefore she will refuse him, and marry Sturio . He is as obstinate in his requests, as shee resolute in her denyall. So hauing performed the part of a friend for his friend, and commending the nobility and vertues of Sturio , as much as he pittyed the weakenesse of his estate and wealth, hee leaues his sister to her affection and designes: and so with an vnwilling willingnesse (without any extenuation) deliuers his friend Bartolini her definitiue answere; yet performes his promise to his sister, in concealing Sturio his name. Bertolini is all in fire and choller at this newes, and begins no longer to look on his friend Brellati with the eyes of affection, but of contempt and indignation: and so consulting with his passion, not with his iudgement; with rage, and not with reason: as immoderate anger seldome lookes right, commonly squint-eyed; he in the heat of his wrath, and height of his reuenge, very much neglects and slights him, yea and most vnciuilly and abruptly departs from him, as if he were no longer worthy of the bare complement of farewell. Which Brellati wel obserues, and in obseruing, remembers, and in remembring, grieues at, sith Bertolini was his most intimate and dearest friend; and in whose behalfe, did occasion present, he was ready, not onely to sacrifice his best seruice, but his best life. Lo here the first breach and violation which Bertolini giues to their friendship: but the second is not farre behinde: For in the next company hee meets, which was some two dayes after, walking in Cardinall Farnesi his Galleries, in presence of some foure or fiue other Gentlemen , both of his, and of Brellati's acquaintance, he forgot himselfe so much, as some demanding for his consort Brellati , he chollerickly replyed, that he was a base and beggerly Gentleman ; and therefore henceforth disdained his company, and that his sister Paulina was a lasciuious and dissembling strumpet. But although the fire of his choller had foolishly banded forth these speeches in the ayre, yet they fell not to the ground; but some of the company then present, that very night report them to Brellati . It is impossible for my pen to relate how passionately and tenderly hee takes it: yea his affliction and griefe heerein is farre the more redoubled, in that (contrary to his desires and wishes) hee is assured his sister Paulina is likewise acquainted with the vanity and iniustice of these speeches: the conceit and remembrance whereof, make her inraged and sorrowfull eyes powre foorth many riuolets and riuers of teares, vpon the Roses and Lillies of her beauty. But as she is too impatient to rellish this scandalous affront and disparagement: so her brother Brellati is too generous and noble to digest it: whereof burning to know the truth; and resoluing, if he found it true, sharpely to reuenge it on Bertolini , hee passeth away the night in restlesse and distracted slumbers: And so the very next morne taking his sword and Lackey with him, he goes to Bertolini his fathers house, and meeting first with him, demands of him for his sonne Seignior Iohn Battista Bertolini . His father informes him he is in the Garden very solitarily walking, and prayes Brellati to goe to him; who needing not many requests, entreth, and with his hat in his hand approcheth him. Bertolini doth the like, and meets him halfe way: when he being pale for anger, and Bertolini blushing for shame, hee prayes him to exempt the Garden of his seruants, because he hath some thing to reueale and impart him in secret, which needeth no witnesses: when Bertolini commanding his seruants to depart, Brellati chargeth him with these disgracefull speeches, vomited forth two dayes since, against his honour; as also that of his onely deare sister Paulina , in Cardinall Farnesi his Palace , in presence of Seignior Alessandro Fontani, Seignior Rhanutio Pluvinio , and Seignior Antonio Voltomari (which words wee haue formerly vnderstood.) Bertolini is no way dismayed or daunted hereat, either in courage or complection: and so losing his honour in his indiscretion, or rather burying his discretion in his dishonour; he with fire in his lookes, and thunder in his speeches, tells Brellati that he confesseth these speeches his; adding withal, that what his tongue hath affirmed, his sword shall be ready to make good and iustifie; whereon they couer: When Brellati demanding him if this were his last resolution, hee told him yea. Then (quoth he) I pray' expect mine shortly: and so without giuing each other the good morrow, they part; Brellati still leauing Bertolini in his fathers Garden. His sister Paulina hauing notice of her brothers speaking with Bertolini , very curiously and carefully awaits his returne; when rushing into his chamber, she, with teares, and sighes, demands him of the issue of his conference with Bertolini , and whether hee were so impudent to deliuer these dishonourable and base speeches both of her selfe and him. But her brother, like a true noble Romane , is too generous and braue to acquaint her with his designe and resolution: and so in generall tearmes prayes her, not to afflict her selfe at these speeches; and that this difference will be very shortly decided and ended, to her honour, and his owne content. Brother (quoth shee) if you will not right mine honour, and vindicate the vnspotted purity of my reputation, I am sure that my true Louer Seignior Paulus Sturio will, though with the hazard and losse of his owne life, had he but the least notice thereof. He shall not need, sister (quoth he:) for a day or two will reconcile and finish this businesse: and so for that time he leaues his sister Paulina , and shuts himselfe vp in his chamber; where, not long able to containe himselfe against the insolency and basenesse of Bertolini , he calls for pen and paper, and more respecting his honour then his life, writes him this challenge; the which immediately after dinner he sends him, by Seignior Valerio , a confident Gentleman his follower.  so honourably descended and bred, as I doubt not, but the disgrace and disparagement which thou hast vniustly offered vs, will as iustly retort and fall on thy selfe. And to the end thou maist finde, that my Sword is purposely reserued to correct and chastise thy tongue; as thou art a Romane , and a Gentleman , meet me single to morrow at fiue in the morne, without Port Popoli , in the next field behind Cardinal Borromeo's Palace; and there I will giue thee the choyce of two good Rapiers and Ponyards, and gladly accept of the refusall, to draw reason of thee for those wrongs wherewith thou hast iniuriously and maliciously traduced vs: and to write thee the truth, as I desire, so I can receiue no other satisfaction but this, whereunto thy malice inuites, and my honour obligeth me. Brellati.  Valerio performes his part well, and fairely working and shrewing himselfe into Bertolini's presence, very secretly deliuers him his Masters challenge. Bertolini not ignorant, but coniecturing what it meanes, breaks off the seales: and at the perusall thereof, though his cause be vniust and dishonourable, yet in his countenance and speeches, he shewes much constancy, fortitude and resolution; when considering they were to fight single, and that therefore Valerio could bee no second, he deeming his Master had concealed this secret businesse from him, contents himselfe to giue him onely this answere: Tell your Master Seignior Brellati from me, that I will not faile to meet him, according to his desire and appoyntment. And so Valerio takes his leaue, and departs: when finding out his Master, he reports him Bertolini's answere: whereat hee is so farre from being any way appald or daunted, as hee infinitely reioyceth thereat. In the meane time, he is curious in preparing two singular good Rapiers and Ponyards of equall length, hilts, and temper. And thus with much impatient patience (as reuenge is an enemy to sleepe) they not out-sleepe, but, out-watch the night. So the morne and day stealing and breaking into their windowes, they are no sooner out of their beds, but into the field; their Chirurgians awaiting their arriuals by the Pyramides , in the place of Port Popoli , by which of necessity they were to passe: when, tying vp their horses to the hedges, like resolute Gentlemen , they throw off their doublets, commanding their Chirurgians not to stir from their stations, when, disdaining words, they both draw, and fall to deedes thus: Brellati presenteth the first thrust, and Bertolini giues him the first wound in his left shoulder; whereat he is inflamed; and so returnes Bertolini the interest of a more dangerous one, on his right side; but it touch't neither his bowels nor quayse. They try againe: so Brellati againe wounds Bertolini in his left hand, when his Rapier running thorow his sinewes and Arteries, he is no longer able to hold his Ponyard; but despight his resolution and courage, it falles out of his hand: which vnlook't for disaster doth much perplexe and afflict him. But Brellati is too generous and noble, to blemish or taint his honour, by taking any aduantage of this his aduersaries misfortune: and so, to cleere his doubts and scruples, very valiantly and brauely throws away his owne Ponyard to the hedge, that they might be as equall in weapons, as courage. But Bertolini will basely requite this courtesie: they retire and take breath; and so trauersing their grounds, thereby to take the benefit of the Sunne, they againe ioyne: at the first cloze of this second meeting, Brellati runnes Bertolini into the right flanke, when withdrawing his Rapier, and leaping backe to put himselfe vpon his defensiue guard and posture, his foot slipping, hee could not preuent falling to the ground: when Bertolini following him close, and beeing eager in his pursuit, and blood-thirsty in his reuenge, he forgetting Brellati his former courtesie, and working vpon the fortune of his mis-fortune, right then and there nailed him to the ground,  & so redoubling his thrust, acted a perpetuall diuorce betwixt his body & soule: when Brellati's Chirurgian shedding teares on his dead Master, and beginning to take order for his decent conueyance into the City, Bertolini takes vp his Chirurgian behinde him, and so with all possible speed and celerity (the better to auoyd the danger of the law) poasts o're ye fields, and comes into Mount Cauallo gate,  & so husheth himself vp priuatly in a frieds house of his, neer his fathers. All Rome beginnes to eccho forth and resound this murther; and farre the more, because Bertolini and Brellati were so deare and intimate friends: but as good newes comes alwaies lame, and bad rides poast: so within one houre of Brellati his murther, the newes thereof is brought first to his father, then to his Sister Paulina: whereat hee grieues, and shee stormes; hee sorroweth, and shee weepes and laments; and in a word, the father would, but cannot, and the daughter can, but will not be comforted, at this sad and mournfull tragedy. Neither must we forget, but remember Seignior Paulus Sturio , who louing Paulina a thousand times dearer then his owne life, is no sooner acquainted, but afflicted with this newes of Brellati his death, as being his deare friend, and which is more, the onely brother of his dearest and onely Mistris, Paulina: so, as Louers and friends being best knowne and discerned in calamities and afflictions, hee repaires to her, condoles with her, and vseth his chiefest Art and zeale, not onely to participate, but wholly to depriue her of her sorrowes: yea, to proue himselfe a constant friend, and a faithfull Louer to her, he proffereth her, not onely his seruice, but his life, as well to right her honour, as to reuenge her brothers death on Bertolini: but this affection and perswasion of Sturio , is not capeable to wipe off, or exhale his Lady Paulina's teares. But againe to Bertolini , who is so farre from contrition and repentance of this his bloudy fact, as like a prophane miscreant, and debaush'd and dissolute Gentleman, he triumphs and glories therein: yea, his impudency is become so ignorant, and his ignorance so sottish, as he beganne to enter into a resolution againe to court and seeke Paulina for his wife, without respecting or regarding either the publique danger of the law, or that of Paulina's priuate reuenge: for sure, her Brothers death had throwne her into such violent passions of griefe, and extremities of sorrow, as if his solly had made her so happy: doubtlesse his reuenge would haue made him more miserable, but God had taught her rage more reason, and her malice and cruelty not so much impiety: yea, it pleased his Diuine Maiesty, not so soone to call him to an accompt, and punish him for this his bloudy fact; but reseruing him for a future shame and punishment, being affrighted with a tumultuous rumor and allarum of a generall search to be made that night for his apprehension, he very subtilly, in a Capuchins habit, passeth Saint Iohn de Latterans gate; and there hauing poast-horses layd for him, hee as swift as the winde gallops away for Naples , and imbarking himselfe for Gicily , passeth the Pharre of Messina , lands at that Citie, and so rides vp for Palermo , where he thinkes himselfe safe. But hauing not made his peace with God, where euer he flie, God will in due time finde him out, when he least dreames thereof: but although the power and influence of time be so predominate to deface the actions and accidents of time; yet Paulina can giue no truce to her teares, nor will she administer any consolation to her sorrowes for her brothers death: And if euer, now it is that Sturio resembling himselfe, beginnes to make her sorrowes his: for hauing deepely rooted and settled his affection on Paulina , and naturally ingrauen her beauty and picture in the very centre of his heart and thoughts, he begins to make his priuate affection to her publique, and so hauing already wonne her heart from her selfe, he now endeuoureth to winne her from her friends, and then to marry her. But old Seignior Sturio his father, is no sooner aduertised of Brellati his death, of Bertolini's flight, and of his sonnes affection and intent to take Paulina to wife, but disdayning he should match so low, and withall so poore, as also searing that this might likewise ingage his sonne in some quarrell betwixt him and Bertolini , he resolues priuately to conuey him away out of Rome , in some retired or obscure place, from whence he should not returne, till his absence had cooled and extenuated the heat of his affection to Paulina , and of his malice and reuenge to Bertolini: to which end, three weekes are scarce past, but taking his sonne with him in his Coach, vnder colour to take the ayre in the fields of Rome , beyond Saint Pauls Church, he hauing giuen the Coach-man his lesson, commands him to driue away,  & hauing two Braues or Ruffians with him, they dispose, or rather inforce the humour of his sonne Sturio to patience, as despight himselfe, they carry him to Naples , where a Brigantine being purposely prepared, he shippeth ouer his sonne for the Iland of Capri , or Caprea (where long since, Scianus his ambition caused Tiberius to soiourne, whiles hee played the pettie King, and domineered as Emperour at Rome in his absence) and giues him to the keeping and guard of Seignior Alphonsus Drissa , Captaine of that Iland ; with request  & charge not to permit him to returne, for the maine, for the tearme of one whole yeere, without his expresse order to the contrary. It is for none but for Louers to iudge, how tenderly Sturio and his sweet Lady Paulina grieue at the newes of this their sudden  & vnexpected separation: yea, their sighes and teares are so infinit for this their disaster, as all the words of the world are not capeable to expresse them. As for Paulina , she had so long and so bitterly wept for her bothers death, as it was a meere cruelty of sorrow, to inforce her to play any farther part in sorrow, for the departure and captiuity of her Louer Sturio: but her afflictions falling in, each on the necke of other (in imitation of the waues of the sea, occasioned by the breath and blast of Boreas ) threaten her not onely with present sicknesse, but with approaching death. Againe she vnderstands of Bertolini's safety, and prosperity in Cicilia , where he triumphs in his victory, for killing her brother Brellati ; and like a base Gentleman, continually erects his trophees of detraction vpon the ruines and tombe of her honour: and these considerations (like reserued afflictions) againe newly afflict and torment her: so as hauing lost her Iewell and her ioy, her brother and her Louer, Brellati and Sturio , she beginnes to be extreme sicke, weake, and saint: yea, the Roses of her cheekes are transformed to Lillies; the relucent lustre of her eyes, to dimnesse and obscurity: and to vse but a word, not onely her heart, but her tongue begins to faile, and to strike saile to immoderate sorrow and disconsolation. Her parents and friends grieue hereat, and farre the more, in respect they know not how to remedy it; and for herselfe, if she enioy any comfort in this life, it is onely in hope that she shall shortly leaue it, to enioy that of a better. Thus whiles sorrow, vexation and sicknesse make haste to spin out the thred and webbe of her life, if her griefes are extreme and insupportable in Rome , no lesse are those of her Louer Sturio in Caprea: for it frets him to the heart and gall, to see how his father hath bereaued and betraied him of his Mistris Paulina's presence, the onely content; and felicity, which this life and earth could affoord him a thousand times he wisheth himselfe with her, and as often kisseth her remembrance and Idea: and then as their affections, so their malice concurring and sympathizing, hee againe wisheth that he may bee so happy, to fight with Bertolini for his disgrace of his Lady Paulina , and she for the death of her brother Brellati , and in that affection and this reuenge, hee with much affliction and no comfort, passeth away many bitter daies and torments, in the misery of this his inforced exile and banishment: and although his curiosity, affection, or subtilty could neuer crowne him with the happinesse or felicity, to free himselfe of his gardes and captiuity, and so to steale away from that Iland in some Foist, or Galley for the maine: yet, vnderstanding that two daies after, there was bound for the Port of Ciuita Vetcha , he, to testifie his affection, constancy, and torments to his deare and faire Paulina , takes occasion to write her a Letter to Rome ; the which, that it might come the safer to her owne hands, hee incloseth in another, to an intimate deare friend of his. The tenor of his Letter was thus:  manner thereof: yet sure I am, that hath conioyn'd, make me in this Iland of Caprea feele the torments, not of a feigned Purgatory , but of a true Hell : it was my purpose to condole with thee, for the vntimely death of thy brother: it is now not onely my resolution, but my practice, to mourne with my selfe for thy banishment, or rather with thee for mine, and when my sorrowes haue most need of consolation, then againe that consolation findes most cause of sorrow: for thinking of Bertolini , me thinkes I see thy false disparagement on his malicious tongue; and thy brother Brellati his true death, on his bloudy sword: and yet haue neither the honour or happinesse to reuenge either; and which is worse, not be permitted to know where he is, that I may reuenge them: but I wish I were onely incident and oblig'd to support this affliction, conditionally thou wert exempt thereof, or that I might know the limits and period of our absence, thereby to hope for an end and remedy thereof, which now I can finde no motiues to know, nor cause to hope. O that I haue often enuied Leanders happinesse! And if loue could make impossibilities possible, the Mediterranean sea should long since haue beene my Hellespont , my body, my barke, and my armes, my eares, to haue wafted mee from my Abidos , to thy Sestos , from my Caprea , to thy Rome , to thee, sweet Paulina , my onely faire and deare Hero : and although the constancy and feruency of my loue to thee, suggest me many inuentions to escape the misery of my exile: yet, the Argus eyes of my fathers malice, in that of my Gardians iealousie, cannot be inchanted or lulled asleepe with the melody of so vnfortunate a Mercury as my selfe: but time shall shortly act and finish that which impatience cannot, till when, Deare and Sweet Paulina , retaine me in thy thoughts, as I doe thee in my heart and memory: and doubt not but a few weekes will make vs as happy, as we are now miserable. Stvrio.  Paulina , in the middest of her sorrowes and sicknesse, receiues this Letter from her best and dearest friend Sturio , and although she reioyce to heare of his health and wel-fare in Caprea , yet she is more glad, that the extremity of her sicknesse and weakenesse informe her, she shall shortly dye in Rome: for vanquished with afflictions, and ouer-come with variety of griefe and discontents, she in conceit hath already left this world, and is by this time, halfe way in her progresse and pilgrimage towards Heauen , yet in loue to her deare Sturio , who wrote her this kinde Letter, she will not be so vnkinde, but will kisse it for his sake that sent it her: and peraduenture, if she had beene so happy, that hee might haue beene the bearer and deliuerer thereof himselfe; or that he had borne and deliuered himselfe to her in stead of his Letter, hee might then haue giuen some comfort to her sorrowes, and some consolation to her discontents and afflictions, whereas now seeing him exiled, and mewed vp in Caprea , without any apparance of returne; she sees she hath more reason to flie to her old despaire, then to any new hope, and so wisheth the desired houre were at last come, wherin she might giue her last farewell to this world: but againe perusing and ouer-reading his Letter, she findes it full fraught with loue and affection towards her: and therefore disdayning to proue ingratefull to any, especially to Sturio , who is so kinde and courteous to her, calls for penne and paper, and by his owne conueyance returnes him this answere:  glad, or the contents sorrowfull: for as I infinitely reioyced to vnderstand thou wert liuing, so I extremely grieued to heare there was no certainty of thy releasement and returne: whether or no Caprea bee thy Purgatory , I know not, but sure I am, Rome is my Hell , sith I cannot be there with thee, nor thou here with mee: and as I lamented with sighes, I could not dye with my brother, so I grieue with teares, that I cannot liue with thee: but why write I of liuing, when his mournefull Tragedy , and thy disasterous exile hath made mee more ready to dye then liue, or rather not fit to liue, but dye? for despayring of thy returne, how can I hope for comfort, sith it onely liued in thy presence; as my heart and ioy did in thee? As for Bertolini's folly to mee, and crime to my brother: if thy sword punish him not, Gods iust reuenge will, and wishing this as a woman, as a Christian , I pardon and forgiue him, and so I pray doe thou for my sake, if thou wilt not for that of my dead brothers. Could prayers, or wishes haue effected thy returne to mee, my teares had long since beene thy Hellespont , and Mediterranean sea, and my sighes had fill'd the sayles of my desires and resolutions to haue past Ostia , floated vp Tiber , and landed at Rippa to mee: but alas, alas! heere in remembring Hero's felicitie and ioy, I cannot forget my sorrowes and afflictions: for as Leander liu'd in her armes, so I cannot be so fortunate, either to liue or dye in my Sturio's : and if now, as a skilfull Mercury , thou couldest inueigle the eyes both of thy father's malice, and Gardians ielousie; yet that happinesse would come too late and out of season for mee: for before thou shalt haue plotted thy flight and escape from Caprea to Rome , I shall haue acted and finished mine from Rome to Heauen . I would send thee more lines, but that my weake hand, and feeble fingers haue not the power, though the will, any longer to retaine my pen. Heauen will make vs happy, though Earth cannot: therefore my deare Sturio , let this be our last and best consolation; as these ioyes are temporary, and transitory, so those will bee permanent and eternall. Pavlina.  This Letter of Paulina to Sturio , meets with a speedy passage from Rome to Caprea ; who receiuing it, and thinking to haue found her in her true and perfect health, with much ioy and affection breakes vp the seales thereof, when, contrary to his hope and expectation, vnderstanding of her sicknesse and approch to death, he tenderly and bitterly weepes at his owne mis-fortune in her discontent and disaster: yea he passionately and sorrowfully bewailes his fathers cruelty, in thus banishing him from her sight and presence, from the contemplation of whose beauty, and from his innate affection to her, the fates and destinies cannot banish him. But alas, vnfortunate Sturio! the newes of thy Paulina's sicknesse, is but the Prologue to the ensuing sorrowes and afflictions, that are ready to befall and surprize thee: for the newes of her death shall shortly follow her Letter; and if that drew teares from thine eyes, this shall drowne thine eyes in the Ocean of thy teares: neither shall hee stay long to feele the miserable impetuosity of this mournfull storme: For scarce twenty dayes are past, after the writing of her Letter to Sturio , but Paulina languishing with griefe, despaire, sorrow and sicknesse, as a female loue- Martyr , takes her last leaue and farewell of this world in Rome ; it being not in the power or affection of her parents, any longer to diuert her from paying this her last due and tribute vnto Nature, sith wee all haue our liues lent, not giuen vs; and therefore as we receiue, so we must repay them to our Creator and Redeemer , of whom we haue first receiued them. Old Sturio is as glad in Rome for the death of Paulina , as her parents grieue thereat; and now it is that he intends to be as happy and ioyfull in his sonnes presence, as he hath formerly made himselfe sorrowfull in occasioning his absence. Whereupon, with all expedition, he dispatcheth a seruant of his to Caprea with a Letter, to signifie his sonne thereof, and consequently to recall him. This newes of Paulina's death infinitely afflicts and torments our Sturio : for shee being the Queene of his affections, and the soueraigne Goddesse of his delights and desires, hee resembleth himselfe, and so like a true Louer as hee is, acteth a wonderfull mournful part of sorrow for her vnwished and vnexpected death, he is no longer himselfe: nay, such was his liuing affection to Paulina , and such is his immoderate sorrow for her death, as he will not be himselfe, because she is gone, who was the greatest and chiefest part of himselfe. But as wounds cannot be cured, ere searched; so passion trasporting his thoughts beyond reason, and reuenge beyond passion; he, for the time present, forsakes the effect, to follow the cause, and so hath no other obiect before his eyes and thoughts, but that of Bertolini his killing of her brother Brellati ; and this of his fathers vnkind banishing of him from Rome to Caprea: wherefore, that hee may outliue his sorrowes, and apply a lenitiue to his corrosiue, he vowes to reuenge both. The manner is thus: That as his father deceiued his hopes, in carrying him from Rome to Caprea : so he will deceiue those of his said father, in carrying himselfe from Caprea to Cicily , there to finde out Bertolini , and to fight with him: it is not the poynt of honour, much lesse, iudgement, and least of all, Religion, that precipitateth and throwes him on this bloody, and therefore vncharitable resolution. But it is the vanity of his thoughts, and his liuing affection to his dead Mistris Paulina , which giues life and birth to it: for he (trampling on all disswasion and opposition) finding a Galley of Naples , bound from Caprea to Cicily , very secretly imbarkes himselfe on her, and contemning the impetuosity of the windes, and the mercilesse mercy of the seas, lands at Palermo , where hushing himselfe vp the first night priuately in his Inne, and informing himselfe that Bertolini was in that City; hee, the next morne, by his Lackey, sends him this challenge:  death of her brother Brellati , my afflictions and sorrowes to suruiue her, make mee contemne mine owne life, to seeke thine: to which purpose I haue left Caprea , to finde Cicily , and in it thy selfe. Wherefore as thou art Bertolini , faile not to meet me this euening 'twixt fiue and sixe of the clocke, in the next Meddow, behinde the Carthusians Monastery : where my selfe, assisted onely with a Chirurgian , and the choyce of two single Rapiers, will expect and attend thee: thy generosity inuites thee, and my affection and honour obligeth me to be the onely ghest of this bloody banquet. Stvrio.  Bertolini receiues and reades this challenge, which, to write the truth, is not so pleasing to him as was that of Brellati : he sees himselfe and his honour ingaged to fight, and knowes not how to exempt and free himselfe thereof. For first, he considereth that the ground of his defence and quarrell is not good, sith hee knew in his soule and conscience, that Paulina was as chaste as faire, and that he had wronged himselfe, in seeking to wrong and scandalize her; then that hee perfectly vnderstood Sturio was valiant and generous, yea and very expert and skilfull in handling his weapons; and withall, that single combates were variable, and onely constant in vnconstancy: so that hee began not onely to doubt, but feare, that as he had killed Brellati , so Sturio was reserued to kill him: but againe, considering that his birth and blood was noble; it contrariwise so incited and animated his courage, and inflamed and set an edge on his generosity, as with a kind of vnwilling willingnesse he accepts of Sturio's challenge, and so bade his Lackey tell his Master from him, that hee would not faile to meete him, to giue him his welcome to Palermo . The clocke strikes fiue, and long before sixe, our two young Gentlemen come ride into the field; where, giuing their horses to their Chirurgians, with command not to stirre till their duty and office call them, they both draw, and so approach each other. But though this fury of theirs begin in blood, yet it shall not heere end in death. At first comming vp, Sturio wards Bertolini's thrust, and runnes him into the right flanke, of a deepe wound: at the second, hee wounds him againe in the necke, which drawes much blood from him: neither is the third meeting more propitious, or lesse fatall to him: for Sturio , without receiuing any touch or scar, giues him a third wound 'twixt his small ribs; wherat his courage feareth,  & his strength fainteth; when willing to saue his life, though with the losse of his honor, he throws away his Rapier, and with his hat in hand, begs his life of Sturio , and with as much truth as integrity, confesseth and voweth, that he is infinitely sorrowfull and repentant for the scandal, deliuered against the honour of his most faire and chaste Lady Paulina ; for the which hee craues pardon and remission. Sturio is astonished at this vnexpected and cowardly act of Bertolini: whereat he bites his lip, but I know not whether more with disdaine then anger: onely at first the remembrance of Brellati and Paulina's deathes, for the present make him inexorable to his request and submission: but at last, making reason giue a law to choller, and Religion to reuenge, and considering that hee was more then a man, sith a Christian , as also that the lustre of his blood and extraction had distinguished him from the vulgar, and so made him honourable and noble; he, not as a cruell Tiger , but as a generous Lion, disdaineth to blemish his reputation and valour in killing a disarmed man: and so his honour outbrauing his valour and reuenge, he as a truly noble Gentleman , giues Bertolini his life, as holding himselfe satisfied, by hauing righted the honour of his dead Mistris Paulina , in Bertolini's confession and contrition. So they sheathe vp their swords, and like louing friends returne together into the City: where Sturio prepareth for his departure, and Bertolini betakes himselfe to haue his wounds dressed and cured. This combate, or Duell , is not so secretly carryed betwixt them and their Chirurgians , but all Palermo resounds and prattles thereof; and which is more, this newes speedily sailes from Cicily to Naples , and from thence rides poast to Rome , where Sturio and Bertolini likewise in short space arriue: but first comes Sturio , then Bertolini , (whose father by this time hath obtained his pardon for killing of Brellati .) The Nobility and Gentry of Rome speake diuersly and differently of our two late return'd Gallants: some, out of reason, highly applaud Sturio's fighting with Bertolini , occasioned through his affection to his dead Mistris Paulina , and then, his humanity and courtesie shewed and extended him, in giuing him his life: others, out of the errours of youth and vanity, taxe and condemne him for not dispatching and killing him. Againe, many extoll Bertolini his valour in killing Brellati , but all taunt and taxe him for his cowardize, in not fighting it out with Sturio ; and which is worse, for disgracefully begging and receiuing his life of him. Bertolini findes this scandall throwne and retorted on him, to bee very distastefull and dishonourable: in so much as hee cannot rellish it, but with discontent, nor digest it, but with extreme indignation and choller: which throwes him so violently on the execrable humour of reuenge, as he vowes to make Sturio pay deare for giuing too much liberty to his tongue, to the preiudice of his honor  & reputation. Puft vp thus with these three execrable humours and vices, disdaine, enuy and reuenge, whereof the least is great and capable enough to ruine both a fortune and a life: he, out of a wretched resolution, (vnworthy the generosity of a Gentleman) not onely forgets Sturio his singular courtesie in giuing him his life, when it lay in his power and pleasure to take it from him, but also remembreth, and in that remembrance resolueth to repay him with the vngratefull requitall, and mournfull interest of depriuing him of his. O extreme ingratitude! O vncharitable and base resolution! yea he is so deuoyd of reason, and the purity of his soule and conscience so contaminated and vilified with the contemplation and obiect of blood, as he giues way thereto, and resolues thereon: yea, permits it to forsake God , of purpose wilfully to follow the diuell: yea, his thoughts are so surprized and taken vp with this execrable and hellish resolution of murther, as he thinks of nothing else but of the means and manner how to dispatch Sturio ; and so to send him in a bloody winding-sheet, from this life to another. To fight with him againe in the field, he dares not, to assassinate and murther him in his bed, he cannot, sith he must passe fiue or sixe seuerall chambers, ere he can come at his: and to pistoll him in the open street, though it bee lesse difficult, yet hee findes it most dangerous, sith hee sees Sturio still went better followed and accompanyed then himselfe, as indeed being more eminent of birth, and noble of extraction then himselfe. But he shall want no inuention to accomplish and bring this his bloody resolution to passe: for if he faile thereof, the diuell is still at his elbow to prompt and instruct him therein: yea his impiety is growne so strong with the diuell, and his faith so weake with God , as now hauing turned ouer the records of his reuenge, hee at last resolues to shoot Sturio fro a window, with a Petronell, as he passeth the street: and vpon the attempt and finishing of this hellish stratagem and bloody Tragedy , the diuell and he strike hands, and conclude it: the contriuing and perpetrating whereof, shall in the end strangle him, because he was so prophane and gracelesse, as hee would not strangle the first conceit thereof in their births and conceptions. But leaue we here Bertolini ruminating on his intended bloody crime of murther, and come we a little to speake of poore vnfortunate Sturio , who not dreaming of his malice, much lesse of his vngratefull and bloody reuenge intended against him, like a mournfull and disconsolate constant Louer, is thinking on nothing so much, as on the liuing beauty and Idea of his dead Paulina: and although he knew it as palpable folly to bewray his immoderate sorrowes, as discretion to conceale them; yet their impetuosity and feruency giue such a predominating law to his resolutions, as hee cannot refraine from often stealing into Sancta Maria de Rotunda's Church, where shee was buryed, and there secretly bedewes her tombe, and washes her Sepulchre with his teares: an act and ceremony of Louers, which though affection authorize, yet Religion doth neither iustifie, nor can approue: all the care of his father and friends is to seeke how to purge his pensiuenesse, and to wipe off his melancholy sorrowes, and sorrowfull melancholinesse: to which end they proffer him great variety of Noble and beautifull Ladies in marriage, hoping that the sight and presence of a new beauty, would deface the memory and absence of an old: but their policy proues vaine: for Sturio , will be as constant in his sorrowes, for his sweet Paulina's death, as he was in his affection to her whiles she liued; and therefore, although their power enforce him to see diuers, yet his will can neuer be drawne, or inforced to loue any, as hauing inuiolably contracted himselfe to this definitiue resolution, that sith he could not be Paulina's husband, he will neuer wed himselfe to any other wife then his graue. And here I beginne to write rather with teares, then inke, when I apprehend and consider how soone our poore and innocent Sturio shall be by the bloudy hand of Bertolini lady in his vnfortunate and vntimely graue. Ah Sturio, Sturio , hadst thou beene more vindictiue, and lesse generous and compassionate, thou hadst preuented thy death by killing Bertolini , when they valour in Caprea formerly reduced and exposed him to the mercy of thy sword; or if thou hadst beleeued this Maxime , that dead men can neuer offend or hurt, thou needest not haue relied and trusted vpon the false promises of an incensed, and irreconcileable enemy: but what shall I say? It was not thy honour, but Bertolini's infamy, which hastneth and procureth thy death. O that thou shouldest be so true a friend to thine enemy, and he proue so deadly an enemy to thee his true friend! Sturio gaue Bertolini his life, and Bertolini , in requitall, will giue Sturio his death: but such monstrous and bloudy ingratitude will neuer goe vnpunished of God ; for as it is odious to earth, so it is execrable to Heauen: but I must be so vnfortunate, to bring this deplorable Tragedy on the Theatre of this History: A misery of miseries, that we are many times neerest our ends, when we thinke our selues farthest from them: and (not to rush into the sacred and secret Closet of Gods inscrutable prouidence) I can finde no other pregnant reason thereof either in Diuinity or Nature, but that at all times and in all places, we should be still prepared and ready for death, e're death for vs, and not protracting or procrastinating the houre thereof, but that whensoeuer it shall please God to call vs to him, or himselfe to vs, that (like good Christians) death may still finde vs alwaies arm'd to meet, neuer vnprouided to encounter it. But Bertolini is so obstinate in his malice, and so wretchedly implacable in his reuenge, as vnderstanding that Sturio is accustomed to goe to his mornings Masse, at the English Colledge , he prouides both himselfe and his Petronell charged with a brace of bullets, (or rather the deuill prouides both the bullets, the Petronell and himselfe:) and so, watching the aduantage of his houre and time, in a Munday morning, a little after the Cardinals, Farnesi and Caponius , were ridden with their traines to the Consistory, putting himselfe into an vnknowne house betwixt the sayd English Colledge and the Palace of Farnesi , he hauing his cocke bent, and seeing Sturio comming in the street, vpon his prauncing Barbary horse and foot-cloth, like a gracelesse and bloudy villaine (hauing neither the feare of God , nor the saluation or damnation of his soule before his eyes, nor once imagining that hee shootes at the Maiestie of God the Creator, in killing and defacing man his image  & creature:) lets flie at him, and the deuill had made him so curious and expert a marke-man, as both the bullets pierce the trunke of his brest; with which mortall wounds, our innocent Sturio no longer able to fit his horse, tumbles downe dead to the ground, without hauing the power to vtter a word, but onely to breathe forth two or three lamentable and deadly grones: and this was the vnfortunate and mournfull end of this Noble Gentleman Sturio , which I cannot relate without sighes, nor remember without teares. This bloudy Tragedy acted on so braue a Gallant, in the very bowels and heart of Rome , doth extremely amaze, and draw all the spectators to lamentation and mourning, and his two seruants, who walked by his horse side, are so busie in lifting him vp, and rubbing the temples of their dead Master, as they forget the research and enquiry for his murtherer: but the assistants and standers by, hearing the report of the peece, and not onely seeing the smoake in the window and ayre, but this Noble Gentleman dead in the street, they ascend the house, finde the Petronell on the table, but the shooter fled vpon a swift Spanish Gennet, by the backe doore, they of the house affirming with teares, that they knew not the Gentleman that did it, neither was it in their powers to stop or preuent his escape. This fatall and mournfull newes dispersed and spred o're the Citie of Rome , the Sargeant and Captaines guard are busie to finde out the murtherer, who by this time they know to be Seignior Bertolini: but being gallantly mounted, hee speeds away thorow the streets amaine, and is so farre from despaire, as hee makes no doubt, but to recouer the Latteran gate, and to escape this his second danger, as fortunately as he did his first, by flying into the Kingdome of Naples: but his hopes shall deceiue him: for if hee bought Brellati's murther at an easie rate, God hath now ordained and decreed, that he shall pay deare for this his second of Sturio: and lo, heere the impetuous storme of Gods iust reuenge and indignation now befalls him, when hee least thinkes or feares thereof: The manner thus: As he was swiftly galloping thorow Campo de Fuogo , (the publique place where the Pope (that Antichrist of Rome ) burnes the children of God , for the profession of his glorious Gospell) and being at the farther end thereof, with an intent to draw towards the backside of the Capitall , behold, two brick-layers building of a house vpon a scaffold, two stories high in the streete; as Bertolini passed, both the scaffold,  & the two brick- layers fell downe vpon him, and his horse; and so beat them both to the ground: but as yet the newes of Sturio's murther was not arriued thither: so as danger and feare making Bertolini forget the hurt of his fall, hee againe riseth vp, and calls for his horse, which was speedily brought him: so leaping into his saddle, hee spurs away, with as much celerity as his Gennet could possible driue vnder him: but if he haue escaped this first iudgement of God , hee shall not the second; for hauing past the Capitoll and the Amphitheatre , his Gennet 'twixt that and the Lateran , fell vnder him, which putting his shoulder out of ioynt, the poore afflicted beast could not rise with his master, who by this time is more afflicted and grieued, then the harmelesse Gennet he rides vpon. Whereupon being amazed, and fearing that the search would instantly follow and surprize him, he leauing his horse, betakes himselfe to his owne heeles: and so with much terrour both of minde and conscience, hee knowes not whither to goe, or where to hide himselfe: but at last considering that the greatest dangers haue need of the least distraction, and most discretion, hee thinkes to flie on his right hand to Horta Farnesi , or the gardens  & orchards which belong to that Illustrious Family: but then againe, fearing to meet with a woodden face, in stead of finding an open doore, he leaues that resolution, and (as fast as his legges and feet can beare him) flies on his left hand vp towards Nero's tower, (so famous for that Emperours infamy in standing thereon, when he delighted to see all Rome on fire) and here in the ruines and demolitions of an infinite number of Palaces, Churches and other stupendious buildings, our murtherous Bertolini hides and husheth vp himselfe, hoping if the day were past, to escape and recouer some secret friends house by night. But God is too iust, to let this his cruell fact passe vnreuenged, and this bloudy murtherer vnpunished: for he hath scarce beene there halfe an houre, but he is knowne there, found out and hemm'd in of all sides by the Captaines gard, arm'd with Partisans and Pistols. Here Bertolini considering himselfe a Roman Gentleman , would feyne haue made some resistance with his Rapier: but seeing their numbers to increase, and himselfe alone, as also that it would farther augment his crime, and exasperate his Iudges against him, he at their first assummons deliuereth vp his Rapier, and yeelds, and rendereth himselfe into their hands, who presently conuey him to prison, where he shall haue but little time to thinke of his hainous, and bloudy murthers, e're we shall see him brought foorth and arraigned before his Iudges: but in the Interim all Rome is possessed and informed hereof. So the second morne of Bertolini his imprisonment, he is fetcht before his Iudges, where at first the deuill is so strong with him, as he once thought to haue denied this murther of Sturio: but God prouing more mercifull to his soule, he vpon his Iudges graue and religious remonstrances, with many sighes and teares freely confesseth it, humbly beseeching them to take pitty of his young yeeres, and that it was onely the heate of youth, and the vanity of his ambitious honour, which had thus betrayed and seduced his soule to perpetrate this cruell and impious murther, and for the which hee extremely and bitterly repented himselfe. But the arrow of God's wrath and reuenge, is now fully bent against Bertolini , as his bullets were against Sturio: so as his Sacred Maiesty , causing his Iudges to resemble themselues, they are deafe to his requests, and tell him, it is not his youth or his ambition, but the deuill that hath seduced and drawne him to performe this bloudy murther: and so for expiation thereof, they, in consideration he is a Roman Gentleman, nobly descended, will not hang him, but adiudge his two hands to be cut off before the house where he shot at Sturio , and then to be beheaded at the common place of execution, at the foote of Saint Angelos bridge, his head to be set vpon a pole, ouer Saint Iohn de Laterans gate, and his body to be throwne into Tiber: which the next day was accordingly executed in presence of many thousand people of both sexes and of all rankes, notwithstanding the importunate sollicitations which his father made to Cardinall Borghese (the Pope Paulus Quintus Nephew) to the contrary; who was too Noble and generous to assist him in so base and ignoble a murther. And these were the liues and deaths of these three vnfortunate Roman Gentlemen, Brellati, Sturio , and Bertolini , and of that beautifull, chaste, and sorrowfull Lady Paulina . And here to conclude and shut vp this their mournfull History; I haue beene informed that the curious wits of Rome made many exquisite Epitaphs vpon the deaths of Sturio and Paulina , as also that Bertolini made a religious and most Christian speech at his end, of which I must confesse I was not so happie to recouer the sight, or copies of either: for if I had, I would not haue failed to haue inserted, and placed them at the end of this their History, to haue serued as a grace and ornament thereunto, in interlacing my Prose with others Verses, for the better delight and recreation of my Reader. But I must (iustly) craue excuse herein: for my curiositie sought them, though my vnfortunacy found them not: and because I wholy ayme rather to profit then please my Reader, let vs forget the shaddowes, to remember the substance, and so looke from the Mappe, to the Morall of this History: that the foule example of Bertolini's crime of murther, and the iustnesse of his punishment, may make vs lesse bloudy, and more compassionate and charitable to our Christian brethren, and consequently more pious towards God, of whom we all beare the liuing image, and true and liuely Character.
