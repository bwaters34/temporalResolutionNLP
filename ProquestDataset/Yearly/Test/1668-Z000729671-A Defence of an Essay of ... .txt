 for the most part borrowed from the observations of others: therefore, that I may not be wanting to him in civility, I return his Complement by calling him The Author of the Duke of Lerma. But (that I may pass over his salute) he takes notice of my great pains to prove Rhyme as natural in a serious Play, and more effectual than blanck Verse. Thus indeed I did state the question; but he tells me, I pursue that which I call Natural in a wrong application: for 'tis not the question whether Rhyme or not Rhyme be best or most natural for a serious subject, but what is nearest the nature of that it represents. If I have formerly mistaken the Question, I must confess my ignorance so far, as to say I continue still in my mistake: But he ought to have prov'd that I mistook it; for 'tis yet but gratis dictum ; I still shall think I have gain'd my point, if I can prove that Rhyme is best or most natural for a serious subject. As for the question as he states it, whether Rhyme be nearest the nature of what it represents, I wonder he should think me so ridiculous as to dispute whether Prose or Verse be nearest to ordinary Conversation? It still remains for him to prove his inference; that, since Verse is granted to be more remote than Prose from ordinary Conversation, therefore no serious Plays ought to be writ in Verse: and when he clearly makes that good, I will acknowledge his Victory as absolute as he can desire it. The question now is which of us two has mistaken it, and if it appear I have not, the world will suspect what Gentleman that was, who was allowed to speak twice in Parliament, because he had not yet spoken to the Question ; and perhaps conclude it to be the same, who, as 'tis reported, maintain'd a contradiction in terminis , in the face of three hundred persons. But to return to Verse, whether it be natural or not in Plays, is a Problem which is not demonstrable of either side: 'tis enough for me that he acknowledges he had rather read good Verse than Prose: for if all the Enemies of Verse will confess as much, I shall not need to prove that it is natural. I am satisfied if it cause delight: for delight is the chief, if not the only end of Poesie; instruction can be admitted but in the second place, for Poesie only instructs as it delights. 'Tis true that to imitate well is a Poets work; but to affect the Soul, and excite the Passions, and above all to move admiration (which is the delight of serious Plays) a bare imitation will not serve. The converse therefore which a Poet is to imitate, must be heighten'd with all the Arts and Ornaments of Poesie; and must be such, as, strictly consider'd, could never be supposed spoken by any without premeditation. As for what he urges, that a Play will still be supposed to be a composition of several Persons speaking ex tempore; and that good Verses are the hardest things which can be imagin'd to be so spoken : I must crave leave to dissent from his opinion, as to the former part of it: for, if I am not deceiv'd, a Play is suppos'd to be the work of the Poet, imitating, or representing the conversation of several persons: and this I think to be as clear, as he thinks the contrary. But I will be bolder, and do not doubt to make it good, though a Paradox, that one great reason why Prose is not to be us'd in serious Plays, is because it is too near the nature of converse: there may be too great a likeness; as the most skilful Painters affirm, that there may be too near a resemblance in a Picture: to take every lineament and feature is not to make an excellent piece, but to take so much only as will make a beautiful Resemblance of the whole; and, with an ingenious flattery of Nature, to heighten the beauties of some parts, and hide the deformities of the rest. For so says Horace , Vt pictura Poesis erit, &c. \--- H aec amat obscurum, vult haec sub luce videri, Judicis argutum qu ae non formidat acumen. \--- Et qu ae Desperat, tractata nitescere posse, relinquit. In Bartholomew-Fair , or the Lowest kind of Comedy, that degree of heightning is used, which is proper to set off that Subject: 'tis true the Author was not there to go out of Prose, as he does in his higher Arguments of Comedy, The Fox and Alchymist ; yet he does so raise his matter in that Prose, as to render it delightful; which he could never have performed, had he only said or done those very things that are daily spoken or practised in the Fair: for then the Fair it self would be as full of pleasure to an ingenious person as the Play; which we manifestly see it is not. But he hath made an excellent Lazar of it; the Copy is of price, though the Original be vile. You see in Catiline and Sejanus , where the Argument is great, he sometimes ascends to Verse, which shews he thought it not unnatural in serious Plays: and had his Genius been as proper for Rhyme, as it was for Humour; or had the Age in which he liv'd, attain'd to as much knowledge in Verse, as ours, 'tis probable he would have adorn'd those Subjects with that kind of Writing. Thus Prose, though the rightful Prince, yet is by common consent depos'd, as too weak for the government of serious Plays; and he failing, there now start up two Competitors; one the nearer in blood, which is blanck Verse; the other more fit for the ends of government, which is Rhyme. Blanck Verse is, indeed, the nearer Prose, but he is blemish'd with the weakness of his Predecessor. Rhyme (for I will deal clearly) has somewhat of the Usurper in him, but he is brave, and generous, and his Dominion pleasing. For this reason of delight, the Ancients (whom I will still believe as wife as those who so confidently correct them) wrote all their Tragedies in Verse, though they knew it most remote from Conversation. But I perceive I am falling into the danger of another rebuke from my Opponent: for when I plead that the Ancients used Verse, I prove not that they would have admitted Rhyme, had it then been written: all I can say is only this, That it seems to have succeeded Verse by the general consent of Poets in all Modern Languages: for almost all their serious Plays are written in it: which, though it be no demonstration that therefore they ought to be so, yet, at least the practice first, and then the continuation of it, shews that it attain'd the end, which was to please; and if that cannot be compass'd here, I will be the first who shall lay it down. For I confess my chief endeavours are to delight the Age in which I live. If the humour of this, be for low Comedy, small Accidents, and Raillery, I will force my Genius to obey it, though with more reputation I could write in Verse. I know I am not so fitted by Nature to write Comedy: I want that gayety of humour which is required to it. My Conversation is slow and dull, my humour Saturnine and reserv'd: In short, I am none of those who endeavour to break Jests in Company, or make reparties. So that those who decry my Comedies do me no injury, except it be in point of profit: reputation in them is the last thing to which I shall pretend. I beg pardon for entertaining the Reader with so ill a Subject; but before I quit that Argument, which was the cause of this digression, I cannot but take notice how I am corrected for my quotation of Seneca , in my Defence of Plays in Verse. My words are these. Our Language is Noble, Full, and Significant, and I know not why he who is Master of it, may not cloath ordinary things in it as decently as the Latine, if he use the same diligence in his choice of Words . One would think Unlock a door was a thing as vulgar as could be spoken; yet Seneca could make it sound high and lofty in his Latine. Reserate Clusos Regii postes Laris. But he says of me, That being fill'd with the Precedents of the Ancients who writ their Plays in Verse, I commend the thing, declaring our Language to be Full, Noble, and Significant, and charging all defects upon the ill placing of words, which I prove by quoting Seneca loftily expressing such an ordinary thing as shutting a door. Here he manifestly mistakes; for I spoke not of the placing, but of the choice of words: for which I quoted that Aphorism of Julius C aesar, Delectus verborum est origo Eloquentiae: but delectus verborum is no more Latine for the placing of words, than Reserate is Latine for shut the door, as he interprets it, which I ignorantly construed unlock or open it. He supposes I was highly affected with the sound of those words; and I suppose I may more justly imagine it of him: for if he had not been extreamly satisfied with the sound, he would have minded the sense a little better. But these are now to be no faults; for ten days after his Book is publish'd, and that his mistakes are grown so famous, that they are come back to him, he sends his Errata to be printed, and annexed to his Play: and desires that instead of shutting you would read opening ; which it seems, was the Printers fault. I wonder at his modesty, that he did not rather say it was Seneca 's or mine, and that in some Authors Reserare was to shut as well as to open , as the word Barach , say the Learned, is both to bless and curse. Well, since it was the Printer, he was a naughty man to commit the same mistake twice in six lines: I warrant you delectus verborum for placing of words was his mistake too, though the Author forgot to tell him of it: if it were my Book I assure you it should. For those Rascals ought to be the Proxies of every Gentleman Author, and to be chastis'd for him, when he is not pleas'd to own an Errour. Yet since he has given the Errata , I wish he would have inlarged them only a few sheets more, and then he would have spar'd me the labour of an Answer: for this cursed Printer is so given to mistakes, that there is scarce a sentence in the Preface, without some false Grammar, or hard sence in it: which will all be charg'd upon the Poet, because he is so good natur'd as to lay but three Errours to the Printers account, and to take the rest upon himself, who is better able to support them. But he needs not apprehend that I should strictly examine those little faults, except I am call'd upon to do it: I shall return therefore to that quotation of Seneca , and answer not to what he writes, but to what he means. I never intended it as an Argument, but only as an illustration of what I had said before concerning the election of words; and all he can charge me with is only this, that if Seneca could make an ordinary thing sound well in Latine by the choice of words, the same with the like care might be perform'd in English: if it cannot, I have committed an Errour on the right hand, by commending too much the copiousness and well sounding of our Language, which I hope my Country men will pardon me. At least the words which follow in my Dramatique Essay will plead somewhat in my behalf; for I say there, that this Objection happens but seldom in a Play, and then too either the meanness of the expression may be avoided, or shut out from the Verse by breaking it in the midst. But I have said too much in the defence of Verse; for after all 'tis a very indifferent thing to me, whether it obtain or not. I am content hereafter to be ordered by his rule, that is, to write it sometimes because it pleases me, and so much the rather, because he has declared that it pleases him. But he has taken his last farewel of the Muses, and he has done it civilly, by honouring them with the name of his long acquaintances , which is a Complement they have scarce deserved from him. For my own part I bear a share in the publick loss, and how emulous soever I may be of his same and reputation, I cannot but give this testimony of his Style, that it is extream poetical, even in Oratory; his Thoughts elevated, sometimes above common apprehension; his Notions politick and grave, and tending to the instruction of Princes, and reformation of States; that they are abundantly interlac'd with variety of Fancies, Tropes, and Figures, which the Criticks have enviously branded with the name of obscurity and false Grammar. Well he is now fetter'd in business of more unpleasant nature : the Muses have lost him, but the Commonwealth gains by it; The corruption of a Poet is the Generation of a Statesman. He will not venture again into the civil Wars of Censure, ubi--- nullos habitura triumphos: if he had not told us he had left the Muses, we might have half suspected it by that word, ubi , which does not any way belong to them in that place; the rest of the Verse is indeed Lucans , but that ubi I will answer for it, is his own. Yet he has another reason for this disgust of Poesie; for he says immediately after, that the manner of Plays which are now in most esteem, is beyond his power to perform : to perform the manner of a thing I confess is new English to me. However, he condemns not the satisfaction of others, but rather their unnecessary understanding, who, like Sancho Panca's Doctor, prescribe too strictly to our appetites; for, says he, in the difference of Tragedy and Comedy, and of Farce it self, there can be no determination but by the taste, nor in the manner of their composure. We shall see him now as great a Critick as he was a Poet, and the reason why he excell'd so much in Poetry will be evident, for it will appear to have proceeded from the exactness of his judgment. In the difference of Tragedy, Comedy, and Farce it self, there can be no determination but by the taste . I will not quarrel with the obscurity of his Phrase, though I justly might; but beg his pardon if I do not rightly understand him: if he means that there is no essential difference betwixt Comedy, Tragedy , and Farce , but what is only made by the peoples taste, which distinguishes one of them from the other, that is so manifest an Errour that I need not lose time to contradict it. Were there neither Judge, Taste, nor Opinion in the world, yet they would differ in their natures; for the action, character, and language of Tragedy , would still be great and high; that of Comedy lower and more familiar; Admiration would be the Delight of one, and Satyr of the other. I have but briefly touch'd upon these things, because, whatever his words are, I can scarce imagine, that he who is always concern'd for the true honour of reason, and would have no spurious issue father'd upon her , should mean any thing so absurd as to affirm, that there is no difference betwixt Comedy and Tragedy but what is made by the taste only : Unless he would have us understand the Comedies of my Lord L . where the first Act should be Pottages, the second Fricasses, & c . and the Fifth a Chere Entiere of Women. I rather guess he means, that betwixt one Comedy or Tragedy and another, there is no other difference but what is made by the liking or disliking of the Audience. This is indeed a less errour than the former, but yet it is a great one. The liking or disliking of the people gives the Play the denomination of good or bad, but does not really make, or constitute it such. To please the people ought to be the Poets aim, because Plays are made for their delight; but it does not follow that they are always pleas'd with good Plays, or that the Plays which please them are always good. The humour of the people is now for Comedy , therefore in hope to please them, I write Comedies rather than serious Plays: and so far their taste prescribes to me: but it does not follow from that reason, that Comedy is to be prefer'd before Tragedy in its own nature: for that which is so in its own nature cannot be otherwise; as a man cannot but be a rational creature: but the opinion of the people may alter, and in another Age, or perhaps in this, serious Plays may be set up above Comedies. This I think a sufficient Answer; if it be not, he has provided me of an Excuse; it seems in his wisdom, he foresaw my weakness, and has found out this expedient for me, That it is not necessary for Poets to study strict reason, since they are so used to a greater latitude than is allowed by that severe inquisition; that they must infringe their own jurisdiction to profess themselves oblig'd to argue well. I am obliged to him for discovering to me this back door; but I am not yet resolv'd on my retreat: For I am of opinion that they cannot be good Poets who are not accustomed to argue well. False Reasonings and colours of Speech, are the certain marks of one who does not understand the Stage: For Moral Truth is the Mistress of the Poet as much as of the Philosopher: Poesie must resemble Natural Truth, but it must be Ethical. Indeed the Poet dresses Truth, and adorns Nature, but does not alter them: Ficta voluptatis caus a sint proxima veris. Therefore that is not the best Poesie which resembles notions of things that are not, to things that are: though the fancy may be great and the words flowing, yet the Soul is but half satisfied when there is not Truth in the foundation. This is that which makes Virgil be preferred before the rest of Poets: In variety of fancy and sweetness of expression, you see Ovid far above him: for Virgil rejected many of those things which Ovid wrote. A great Wits great Work is to refuse , as my worthy Friend Sir John Berkenhead has ingeniously express'd it: you rarely meet with any thing in Virgil but Truth, which therefore leaves the strongest impression of pleasure in the Soul. This I thought my self oblig'd to say in behalf of Poesie: and to declare, though it be against my self, that when Poets do not argue well, the defect is in the Work-men, not in the Art. And now I come to the boldest part of his Discourse, wherein he attacques not me, but all the Ancients and Moderns; and undermines, as he thinks, the very foundations on which Dramatique Poesie is built. I could wish he would have declin'd that envy which must of necessity follow such an undertaking, and contented himself with triumphing over me in my opinions of Verse, which I will never hereafter dispute with him; but he must pardon me if I have that Veneration for Aristotle, Horace, Ben. Johnson , and Corneille , that I dare not serve him in such a Cause, and against such Heroes, but rather fight under their protection, as Homer reports of little Teucer , who shot the Trojans from under the large Buckler of Ajax Telamon. ![](/images/inline/Sgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/agk.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ἴ ![](/images/inline/Tgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif)  ,  &c. He stood beneath his Brothers ample shield; And, cover'd there, shot death through all the field. The words of my noble Adversary are these: But if we examine the general Rules laid down for Plays by strict reason, we shall find the errours equally gross; for the great foundation which is laid to build upon, is nothing as it is generally stated, as will appear upon the examination of the Particulars. These Particulars in due time shall be examin'd: in the mean while let us consider what this great foundation is, which he says is nothing, as it is generally stated. I never heard of any other foundation of Dramatique Poesie than the imitation of Nature; neither was there ever pretended any other by the Ancients or Moderns, or me, who endeavour to follow them in that Rule. This I have plainly said in my definition of a Play; that it is a just and lively image of humane Nature, &c. Thus the Foundation, as it is generally stated, will stand sure, if this definition of a Play be true; if it be not, he ought to have made his exception against it, by proving that a Play is not an imitation of Nature, but somewhat else which he is pleas'd to think it. But 'tis very plain, that he has mistasten the foundation for that which is built upon it, though not immediately: for the direct and immediate consequence is this; if Nature be to be imitated, then there is a Rule for imitating Nature rightly, otherwise there may be an end, and no means conducing to it. Hitherto I have proceeded by demonstration; but as our Divines, when they have prov'd a Deity, because there is order, and have infer'd that this Deity ought to be worshipped, differ afterwards in the manner of the Worship; so having laid down, that Nature is to be imitated, and that Proposition proving the next, that then there are means which conduce to the imitating of Nature, I dare proceed no farther positively: but have only laid down some opinions of the Ancients and Moderns, and of my own, as means which they used, and which I thought probable for the attaining of that end. Those means are the same which my Antagonist calls the Foundations, how properly the world may judge; and to prove that this is his meaning, he clears it immediately to you, by enumerating those Rules or Propositions against which he makes his particular exceptions; as namely, those of time and place, in these words: First we are told the plot should not be so ridiculously contrived, as to crowd two several Countries into one Stage; secondly, to cramp the Accidents of many years or days into the representation of two hours and an half; and lastly, a Conclusion drawn, that the only remaining Dispute is, concerning time, whether it should be contained in 12 or 24 hours; and the place to be limited to that spot of ground where the Play is supposed to begin: and this is called nearest Nature; for that is concluded most natural, which is most probable, and nearest to that which it presents. Thus he has only made a small mistake of the means conducing to the end, for the end it self, and of the superstructure for the foundation : but he proceeds. To shew therefore upon what ill grounds they dictate Laws for Dramatique Poesie, &c . He is here pleased to charge me with being Magisterial, as he has done in many other places of his Preface. Therefore in vindication of my self, I must crave leave to say, that my whole Discourse was Sceptical, according to that way of reasoning which was used by Socrates, Plato , and all the Academiques of old, which Tully and the best of the Ancients followed, and which is imitated by the modest In quisitions of the Royal Society. That it is so, not only the name will shew, which is an Essay , but the frame and Composition of the Work. You see it is a Dialogue sustain'd by persons of several opinions, all of them left doubtful, to be determined by the Readers in general; and more particularly defer'd to the accurate Judgment of my Lord Buckhurst , to whom I made a Dedication of my Book. These are my words in my Epistle, speaking of the persons whom I introduc'd in my Dialogue. 'Tis true they differ'd in their opinions, as 'tis probable they would; neither do I take upon me to reconcile, but to relate them, leaving your Lordship to decide it in favour of that part which you shall judge most reasonable. And after that in my Advertisement to the Reader I said this; The drift of the ensuing Discourse is chiefly to vindicate the Honour of our English Writers from the Censure of those who unjustly prefer the French before them. This I intimate, lest any should think me so exceeding vain, as to teach others an Art which they understand much better than my self. But this is more than necessary to clear my modesty in that point:  & I am very confident that there is scarce any man who has lost so much time, as to read that trifle, but will be my Compurgator as to that arrogance whereof I am accus'd. The truth is, if I had been naturally guilty of so much vanity as to dictate my opinions; yet I do not find that the Character of a positive or self-conceited person is of such advantage to any in this Age, that I should labour to be publickly admitted of that Order. But I am not now to defend my own Cause, when that of all the Ancients and Moderns is in question: for this Gentleman who accuses me of arrogance, has taken a course not to be taxed with the other extream of modesty. Those propositions which are laid down in my Discourse as helps to the better imitation of Nature, are not mine (as I have said) nor were ever pretended so to be, but derived from the Authority of Aristotle and Horace , and from the Rules and Examples of Ben. Johnson and Corneille . These are the men with whom properly he contends, and against whom he will endeavour to make it evident, that there is no such thing as what they All pretend. His Argument against the Unities of place and time, is this; That 'tis as impossible for one Stage to present two Rooms or Houses truly, as two Countries or Kingdoms & as impossible that five hours or twenty four hours should be two hours, as that a thousand hours or years should be less than what they are, or the greatest part of time to be comprehended in the less: for all of them being impossible, they are none of them nearest the Truth or Nature of what they present; for impossibilities are all equal, and admit of no degree. This Argument is to scattered into parts, that it can scarce be united into a Syllogism; yet, in obedience to him, I will abbreviate and comprehend as much of it as I can in few words, that my Answer to it may be more perspicuous. I conceive his meaning to be what follows as to the unity of place: (if I mistake, I beg his pardon, prosessing it is not out of any design to play the Argumentative Poet . If one Stage cannot properly present two Rooms or Houses, much less two Countries or Kingdoms, then there can be no Unity of place: but one Stage cannot properly perform this; therefore there can be no Unity of place. I plainly deny his minor Proposition; the force of which, if I mistake not, depends on this; that the Stage being one place, cannot be two. This indeed is as great a Secret, as that we are all mortal; but to requite it with another, I must crave leave to tell him, that though the Stage cannot be two places, yet it may properly represent them, successively, or at several times. His Argument is indeed no more than a meer fallacy, which will evidently appear when we distinguish place, as it relates to Plays, into real and imaginary. The real place is that Theater, or piece of ground on which the Play is acted. The imaginary, that House, Town, or Country where the action of the Drama is supposed to be; or more plainly, where the Scene of the Play is laid. Let us now apply this to that Herculean Argument, which if strictly and duely weighed, is to make it evident, that there is no such thing as what they all pretend . 'Tis impossible, he says, for one Stage to present two Rooms or Houses: I answer, 'tis neither impossible, nor improper, for one real place to represent two or more imaginary places, so it be done successively, which in other words is no more than this; That the imagination of the Audience, aided by the words of the Poet, and painted Scenes, may suppose the Stage to be sometimes one place, sometimes another, now a Garden, or Wood, and immediately a Camp: which I appeal to every mans imagination, if it be not true. Neither the Ancients nor Moderns, as much Fools as he is pleased to think them, ever asserted that they could make one place two; but they might hope by the good leave of this Author, that the change of a Scene might lead the imagination to suppose the place alter'd: So that he cannot fasten those absurdities upon this Scene of a Play, or imaginary place of Action, that it is one place and yet two. And this being so clearly proved, that 'tis past any shew of a reasonable denial, it will not be hard to destroy that other part of his Argument which depends upon it, namely, that 'tis as impossible for a Stage to represent two Rooms or Houses, as two Countries or Kingdoms: for his reason is already overthrown, which was, because both were alike impossible. This is manifestly otherwise; for 'tis proved, that a Stage may properly represent two Rooms or Houses; for the imagination being Judge of what is represented, will in reason be less chocqu'd with the appearance of two rooms in the same house, or two houses in the same City, than with two distant Cities in the same Country, or two remote Countries in the same Universe. Imagination in a man, or reasonable Creature, is supposed to participate of reason, and when that governs, as it does in the belief of fiction, reason is not destroyed, but misled, or blinded: that can prescribe to the reason, during the time of the representation, somewhat like a weak belief of what it sees and hears; and reason suffers it self to be so hood-wink'd, that it may better enjoy the pleasures of the fiction: but it is never so wholly made a captive, as to be drawn head-long into a perswasion of those things which are most remote from probability: 'tis in that case a free-born Subject, not a Slave, it will contribute willingly its assent, as far as it sees convenient, but will not be forc'd. Now there is a greater vicinity in Nature, betwixt two Rooms than betwixt two Houses, betwixt two Houses than betwixt two Cities, and so of the rest: reason therefore can sooner be led by imagination to step from one room into another, than to walk to two distant houses, and yet rather to go thither, than to flye like a Witch through the Air, and be hurried from one Region to another. Fancy and Reason go hand in hand, the first cannot leave the last behind; and though Fancy, when it sees the wide Gulph, would venture over, as the nimbler; yet it is with-held by Reason, which will refuse to take the leap, when the distance over it appears too large. If Ben. Johnson himself will remove the Scene from Rome into Tuscany in the same Act, and from thence return to Rome , in the Scene which immediately follows; reason will consider there is no proportionable allowance of time to perform the journey, and therefore will chuse to stay at home. So then the less change of place there is, the less time is taken up in transporting the persons of the Drama , with Analogy to reason; and in that Analogy, or resemblance of Fiction to Truth, consists the excellency of the Play. For what else concerns the Unity of place, I have already given my opinion of it in my Essay , that there is a latitude to be allowed to it, as several places in the same Town or City, or places adjacent to each other in the same Country; which may all be comprehended under the larger denomination of one place; yet with this restriction, that the nearer and fewer those imaginary places are, the greater resemblance they will have to Truth: and Reason which cannot make them one, will be more easily led to suppose them so. What has been said of the Unity of place, may easily be applyed to that of time: I grant it to be impossible, that the greater part of time should be comprehended in the less, that twenty four hours should be crowded into three: but there is no necessity of that Supposition. For as Place , so Time relating to a Play, is either imaginary or real: The real is comprehended in those three hours, more or less, in the space of which the Play is represented: The imaginary is that which is supposed to be taken up in the Representation, as twenty four hours more or less. Now no man ever could suppose that twenty four real hours could be included in the space of three: but where is the absurdity of affirming that the feigned business of twenty four imagin'd hours, may not more naturally be represented in the compass of three real hours, than the like feigned business of twenty four years in the same proportion of real time? For the proportions are always real, and much nearer, by his permission, of twenty four to three, than of four thousand to it. I am almost fearful of illustrating any thing by similitude, lest he should confute it for an Argument; yet I think the comparison of a Glass will discover very aptly the fallacy of his Argument, both concerning time and place. The strength of his Reason depends on this, That the less cannot comprehend the greater. I have already answered, that we need not suppose it does; I say not that the less can comprehend the greater, but only that it may represent it: As in a Glass or Mirrour of half a yard Diameter, a whole room and many persons in it may be seen at once: not that it can comprehend that room or those persons, but that it represents them to the sight. But the Author of the Duke of Lerma is to be excus'd for his declaring against the Unity of time: for if I be not much mistaken, he is an interessed person; the time of that Play taking up so many years as the favour of the Duke of Lerma continued; nay, the second and third Act including all the time of his Prosperity, which was a great part of the Reign of Philip the Third: for in the beginning of the second Act he was not yet a Favourite, and before the end of the third, was in disgrace. I say not this with the least design of limiting the Stage too servilely to 24 hours, however he be pleased to tax me with dogmatizing in that point. In my Dialogue, as I before hinted, several persons maintained their several opinions: one of them, indeed, who supported the Cause of the French Poesie, said how strict they were in that Particular: but he who answered in behalf of our Nation, was willing to give more latitude to the Rule; and cites the words of Corneille himself, complaining against the severity of it, and observing what Beauties it banish'd from the Stage, pag . 44. of my Essay . In few words my own opinion is this, (and I willingly submit it to my Adversary, when he will please impartially to consider it,) that the imaginary time of every Play ought to be contrived into as narrow a compass, as the nature of the Plot, the quality of the Persons, and variety of Accidents will allow. In Comedy I would not exceed 24 or 30 hours: for the Plot, Accidents, and Persons of Comedy are small, and may be naturally turn'd in a little compass: But in Tragedy the Design is weighty, and the Persons great, therefore there will naturally be required a greater space of time in which to move them. And this, though Ben. Johnson has not told us, yet 'tis manifestly his opinion: for you see that to his Comedies he allows generally but 24 hours; to his two Tragedies, Sejanus and Catiline , a much larger time: though he draws both of them into as narrow a compass as he can: For he shews you only the latter end of Sejanus his Favour, and the Conspiracy of Catiline already ripe, and just breaking out into action. But as it is an errour on the one side, to make too great a disproportion betwixt the imaginary time of the Play, and the real time of its representation; so on the other side, 'tis an oversight to compress the accidents of a Play into a narrower compass than that in which they could naturally be produc'd. Of this last errour the French are seldom guilty, because the thinness of their Plots prevents them from it: but few English men, except Ben. Johnson , have ever made a Plot with variety of design in it, included in 24 hours which was altogether natural. For this reason, I prefer the Silent Woman before all other Plays, I think justly, as I do its Author in Judgment, above all other Poets. Yet of the two, I think that errour the most pardonable, which in too straight a compass crowds together many accidents, since it produces more variety, and consequently more pleasure to the Audience: and because the nearness of proportion betwixt the imaginary and real time, does speciously cover the compression of the Accidents. Thus I have endeavoured to answer the meaning of his Argument; for as he drew it, I humbly conceive that it was none: as will appear by his Proposition, and the proof of it. His Proposition was this. If strictly and duely weighed, 'tis as impossible for one Stage to present two Rooms or Houses, as two Countries or Kingdoms, &c . And his Proof this: For all being impossible, they are none of them nearest the Truth or Nature of what they present. Here you see, instead of a Proof or Reason, there is only a Petitio principii : for in plain words, his sense is this; Two things are as impossible as one another, because they are both equally impossible: but he takes those two things to be granted as impossible, which he ought to have prov'd such before he had proceeded to prove them equally impossible: he should have made out first that it was impossible for one Stage to represent two Houses,  & then have gone forward to prove that it was as equally impossible for a Stage to present two Houses, as two Countries. After all this, the very absurdity to which he would reduce me, is none at all: for he only drives at this, That if his Argument be true, I must then acknowledge that there are degrees in impossibilities,
