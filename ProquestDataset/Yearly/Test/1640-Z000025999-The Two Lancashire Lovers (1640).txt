Of the Descent and Parentage of Doriclea . Of the Education of Doriclea . How her Parents, treasuring their hopes, and addressing their cares on her sought to bestow her. How Camillus became her Suiter, and how she rejected him through distaste of his breeding. How Mardanes a rich countrey Chuffe solicited her affection: and how he laboured to procure her love by indirect meanes; when the proffers of a faire personall estate could not do it. How Philocles , whom her Parents had entretained for her Scholemaster, took occasion privately, but shadowingly, to impart his affection to her: and with what seeming scorne his moiton was received. The discourse Doriclea used next day at Table, being encouraged by her Parents indulgence: alledging by way of argument, that she wond redhow Julia, Augustus his Daughter, could detract so much from her Princely descent, as to entertaine least thought of loving Ovid; & how a Schoolemaster durst attempt the solicitancy of an Emperours Daughter. The feare Philocles was in, lest Doriclea should discover his suit to her Parents. Which Doriclea , though she had made choice of that argument, only to affright him, never intended, being more affectionately disposed then either her appearance made shew of, or any expression had as yet discovered. The intercursive Letters passing betwixt Philocles and Doriclea: and how she begins to impart by Pen, what she had before conceipted in thought: and how she desired nothing so much as the accomplishment of their love, so privacy might give leave. What Plots Doriclea devised to partake in private meetings and treaties with her Philocles : and how by the jealousie of Euryclea , her Mother, she was prevented. The passions of Doriclea : and how she conversed with her owne thoughts in the election of her love: inveying against such ungrounded fancies, who measure affection rather by strength of alliance, portion, or any other respect, then the pure effects of love. How Doriclea , being deprived all means of imparting the constancy of her zeale to Philocles: having neither the benefit of Inke nor Paper, to discover her loyall intimate thoughts to her faithfull lover: she supplyed that want with her Needle, sowing her minde in Letters of Gold, and returning them in the border of an Handkerchiefe. Philocles restraint, with those passionate effects, which their enforced absence one from th' other produc'd. He findes love ever most violent, when farthest divided from his Object: yet amidst these disgusts he adviseth her to patience in his restraint. Confirming himselfe so individually hers, as nothing may abridge the accomplishment of their desires, but death. Doriclea understands by an aged Hermit, of Mardanes practise: how he intends to enjoy her by indirect meanes. And how the Spels of Spurcina , the Inchantresse, with whom Mardanes contracted, were ever frustrated by the devout morning exercise of Doriclea : signing her selfe every morne in her going abroad with the signe of the Crosse, a soveraigne receipt against Spurcina's charme. How Doriclea practised with Mellida her Maid for her escape. How she sought to delude her Mother: her prevention: And how Androgeus her Father became enraged upon the discovery of her affection. How Mellida one morning unwarily lets fall her Glove; whereon Spurcina the Inchantresse practiseth; supposing it to be Doriclea's. Mellida fals in love with Mardanes: and discloseth her passion to her Mistresse: who promiseth her best assistance. Mellida's passionate love. Philocles procures his liberty: and by a faithfull Messenger, though to his apparent danger, privately acquaints Doriclea with his delivery: and assigning her a place whereto she might safely repaire, if she could possibly make escape. Doriclea by the advice and assistance of Mellida gets from her Keepers: and in her flight by night loseth her way: but comming by chance to the Hermits house, where she took that night her repose: as, she had formerly been directed by him, she received much comfort from him, being conducted to the place which Philocles advised her to. The great content & joy which these two long divided Lovers conceived one of the others presence: The relation of their former griefes being an addition to their present joyes. They take the advice of Solinus that faithfull Hermit, what course were best to take in a case of such extremity: he adviseth the privately to solemnize that Rite, which their long affection had confirmed in heart. How these constant Lovers were hindred upon the very point of Solemnization of their Marriage, by the intelligence and pursuit of her incensed Father Androgeus : who with a strong prepared troupe entred the house where these two unfortunate Lovers sojourned: And how, by the Hermits device, Philocles to prevent his fury, was privately conveyed. Androgeus brings back his Daughter; the entertainment given her by her Mother. Doriclea labours to free her Mother fro all jealousie touching her love to Philocles; pretending, that he had voluntarily made himselfe a banished man to his countrey, through feare of their fury and enmity. Philocles writes a Letter to Androgeus , as directed from beyond the Seas: wherein he humbly craves his pardon, for his too bold attempting his Daughters affection. How his present austere penitentiall life shall witnesse to the world his repudiation of all light love. How his devotions now were reserved for Heaven, and had no communion with Earth. And that the choice he had now made, should during life admit no change. Doriclea fals (or seemingly fals) into a Fever; each day seemes to increase her distemper. Eschites , an experienc'd Physitian, is sent for to apply his best art in a case of such extremity: but he, an intimate Friend to Philocles , made show as if he despair'd of her recovery. And that no malady arising from fancy, could without enjoyment of the Object loved, receive remedy. The Parents of Doriclea conceive incessant griefe for their distemper'd Daughter; they bemoane their neglect of Philocles , and dis-esteeme of his love: but they finde no hope of reliefe to their languishing Daughter, seeing the meanes of her cure was reported to have enter'd a Regular Order. Eschites undertakes, upon the promise of their acceptance, to use his best endeavour for calling Philocles homeward; and that he is resolved, how Philocles time of Probation will be quickly relinquished, when he shall heare least hope of enjoying his Doriclea's affection. Androgeus heares how Philocles , besides his other native endowments, was descended of a generous Family; which inflames his desires more to see him returne into his Countrey. He vowes never to oppose this solemnity, so his presence may cure her infirmity. Philocles returnes home; and is accepted by the Parents for their Sonne in law: this revives their seeming distemper'd Daughter; yet fearing still a relapse of her Parents acceptance, she feignes the continuance of her distemper. The Mariage is solemnized; and with such privacy, as knowne to none but their own Family. Valeria , who was supposed to be Euphilus Page, discovers her selfe to be Philocles Sister; with whose consent Euphilus marries her, being long before privately affianced to her. The occasion of this private solemnization: and how Mellida , by the advice of her Mistresse Doriclea , assuming her name and habit, writ to Mardanes , how she preferr'd him in the choice of affection before any other; acquainting him how in a private disguise to prevent danger, and her Parents displeasure, she would meet him, when and where in a lawfull Nuptiall way, he might enjoy her. The Plot holds; Mardanes rejoyces infinitely at his unexpected happinesse; thanks his Spurcina for her well-spell'd practise; and infeoffes his unknowne Bride (though much against his will) in his riches. OR THE EXCELLENT HISTORY OF PHILOCLES AND DORICLEA .  Of the Descent and Parentage of Doriclea.  antiquity of Site no lesse memorably recorded, then for those eminent actions of her princely progenitors, renowned; there sometimes dwelled one Androgeus , a Gentleman of approved esteeme: having borne offices of account and quality under his Soveraigne: wherein he ever demeaned himselfe to persons of all conditions with such equity and equality, as none knew him, but accounted him an honour and ornament to his Countrey. This Gentleman tooke to wife one Euryclea , of good descent: a woman excellently endowed with many choice and select vertues: so as, those exquisite parts wherewith she was graced, expressed to her Countrey the native worth of that family, from whence shee descended. These two, amongst other worldly blessings, wherewith Gods providence had singularly enriched them, were made happy in an hopefull progeny. And of those, in a vertuous, discreet and religious Daughter called Doriclea ; one, whose fame admitted no blemish; whom as Nature had beautified with many extraordinary graces, so her carefull Parents were no lesse ready to adorne those native seeds, with such Education as might accomplish those promising beginnings. For which purpose, They provided her of such Masters, as might fit her in all generous Sciences. One for musicke, dancing, and a proper or gracefull posture; another for her Needle; another for knowledge of the Tongues. Nothing was awanting her that might conferre the least light or lustre to so faire and well-composed a temper. Nor was shee lesse apt to receive, nor firme to reteine whatsoever was taught her. For she was of a docile and industrious disposition: affecting nothing more then to learne, nor distasting anything more then to glory in ought that she had perfectly learned. Nor was it strange that so much care or cost should bee bestowed upon her: considering, she was the onely daughter, and consequently the darling of her Mother. One, in whom she treasured many faire hopes, and for whose future preferment she inlarged a provident care. For high were the aymes at which they levelled her Fortunes: being as curious in their choice, as shee in her prime flower of youth resolute, never to exchange her estate. Her desires were confin'd to an harmelesse ambition of knowledge: she measured no day without a line : bestowing so well the Lampe of her life, as she was ever casting forth some light or other to inlarge the Prospect of her inner house . For the highest pitch of her emulation was, in a pious imitation of such as had descended from her house, to accommodate her more knowing abilities. In a faire resemblance of that noble Roman Virgin, who made this her resolution: "That her Life and Knowledge should manifest to the world, that shee was the true Daughter of such Parents: and that her house received no derogation from her, from which shee had her beginning." Truth is, her Family, as it was worthily to be ranked with the best: so had it brought forth many eminent scienes, whose thriving plantation had conferr'd much honour on their Nation. Amongst which ONE, who though he seemed a profest Favorite to all youthfull pleasures; and as sociable in his waies, and pleasantly discursive as if he had beene a downe- right Agent of the time, preferring his pleasures before any other private mentall employment: yet did it appeare unto the world, that he enjoy'd more divine parts then a vulgar judgement could either judge or take notice of. For sundry excellent Workes tasting both of Lampe and Judgement were by him composed, though under an others name published: which expressed the ability of his pen, and the affected privacy of his mind. Nor could shee reflect upon the excellence of their parts who had derived their prime beginnings from her House: but out of a vertuous emulation shee held it a derivative duty to imitate them: though not in such exactnesse as might seeme to equall their perfection: yet in a well disposed Zeale to fit herselfe with the best accommodations and provision she could, to draw neare them in imitation. Nor is it to bee doubted, but native seedes and sprinklings of goodnesse propagate themselves to posterity: and beget in their successors not onely a desire, but ability to imitate and retaine, what their Predecessors in their commendable lives exprest. For though Wit nor Learning be no feffements of Fortune : yet shall we finde in the posterity of prompt and pregnant Parents, most commonly resemblances of that quicknesse and preparednesse in their children, which being seconded by constant and continued desires to imitate whatsoever they see worthily observed, or observably presented: ( Will and Power becomming such equall concomitants and assistants) cannot but produce some notable effect: as might bee instanced in none better then in this our Doriclea ; who directed all her actions to the improvement of her honour, as in the whole Course of her Education you shall perceive hereafter.  Of the Education of Doriclea.  something of Earth, till it bee refined. I here is no Creature so pregnant, or for native parts so inabled; but wanting the refinement of Education , all that precious Ore which it derived from Nature is but in the lumpe, till Education have searched, purged and refined it from all those mouldy and brackish mixtures or interveynings of Earth : that native source from whence it produc't its first forme. Never did Nature bestow her gifts in an ampler measure nor fuller manner then shee streamed them upon those noble Roman Matrons, Cornelia, Aurelia, Lelia, Paula, Portia, Octavia, Sulpitia, Uirginia, Lucretia: Excellent were their endowments: full of genuine worth their naturall ornaments; yet had all these lost much of their beauty, had they rested so and derived from Art no lustre to accomplish that beauty. This moved the Parents of those vertuous Matrons, to ripen these seedes which Nature had so freely bestowed, with these gracefull beamelings of Art , to perfect that which Nature had planted, and accomplish what so loving a mother had moulded. Never had that brave Berenice wonne so much ground, nor gain'd such command in the eye of her beholder; Neither had that stately presence of majesticke Sophonisba made an imperiall heart captive to her smile; Nor that love- attracting Cleopatra soveraigniz'd so much upon such princely Commanders: had not something more then the gifts of Nature accompanied them. These, as they had a sufficient portion of beauty to take the Sense: so had their Education so exactly polished those outward parts, as they wrought strangely upon the Conceit. For to be seene in Musicke; to expresse a singular grace in the Carriage of a dance; to discourse with an unaffected eloquence; to have judgement to distinguish of those divine ayres and active straines of Poesy; Lastly, not onely to relate, but to reconcile difference in relations of History; These are they, which farre above all outward Faires attract love, and promise a Continuance so long; as no new Choice may procure a Change: nor suffer the least surreptitious Conceit of any forraigne fancy to seaze on their enamoured brests: having made such a vertuous and divine Choice , as it were impiety to dreame of a Change . These were the principall motives which induced Androgeus and Euryclea , the tender Parents of Doryclea , to provide for her such Masters as might accomplish her by their Principles of breeding, in such distinct knowledges as might best suit with her condition; and expresse her with most winning grace in the sight of such with whom shee consorted. Nor were these, to whose direction shee was committed, more serious in teaching, nor exact in practising, then shee was quicke in receiving, and firme in reteyning. For her Musicke , though naturally shee stood not affected to it, being rather addicted to retyrednesse and privacy; yet seeing it was her Parents desire, she declined from her owne will, to satisfie their command to whom shee ought herselfe. And herein shee grew such a proficient, as none with more varietie and lesse affectation ever wrought upon the affection. Yet would she never bee moved to discover her perfection in this kinde, in any publicke place: so farre she was from ostentation, and so humbly affected, as whereinsoever shee was praised, shee imputed it to an over esteeme of their opinion who praised her; reteyning ever that modest conceit, or rather disesteeme of her owne abilities, as ever redounded more to her honour. To repeate sundry Cantzonets and enlivened measures composed by herselfe (were it not too digressive from the Scope and Object of our Historie) I should here addresse my penne: But my ayme shall be rather briefly to shadow, then to draw out to the full body the presentment of so excellent a piece. Howsoever, those who were of judgement have confirm'd thus much for her: That never was instrument married to voyce with more harmony, then it was, when exercis'd by Doriclea . Nor was shee lesse gracefull in her Posture or Carriage : retayning such a modest-virgin state; as those who observed her, could neither taxe her of scorne, nor of too carelesse neglect. Affable she could be without being childish: and keepe her distance without arrogance. Never could there appeare more gracefull state in a more humble heart: desiring ever rather to serve others in their vertuous designes, then to observe others rendring her praise for her deserts. Neither was she so carried away with these, as to forget what might better sort with her quality, and what might longer attend her, then these Eare-charming ayres of harmony. For her Needle , she made Dorcas her Pattern: she was ever tasking herselfe to some worke or other: wherein she made Charity her object, by preparing for the naked a Cover. Lastly, for knowledge in Tongues (though most men be of opinion that one is enough for any woman) she profited so exceedingly, as she reteyned the very accent and sound with such propriety, as she became more easily to be admired then imitated; and herein more admired, by how much her Elocution was free, native and unaffected. Thus in all these became Doriclea an incomparable proficient: so that, as she brought with her into the world an excellent disposition in affecting what was good and meriting applause: so had the improvement of her Education so accomplish'd her, as no expression received life from her, which deserv'd not due praise.  How her Parents, treasuring their hopes, and addressing their Cares on her, sought to bestow her.  forth; to take care for their well-being, then their first being. This wee see exemplified in every Creature, who out of a tender-native intimacy, prepares for the supportance, succour and sustenance of those young Ones who are bred of her. Which Care extends and dilates it selfe more amply to Creatures indowed with reason: who, as they are the noblest of all others in respect of their Image and feature: so are they more apprehensive of the necessities of their owne by course of Nature. It is true indeed what that Divine Morall sometimes observed, farre more certaine is a Parents care then the share of his Comfort ; yet, so delightfull is the constancy of this care, being directed to them, and for their improvement whom they so tenderly love, that their Care becomes a Solace , their watchfull Providence a cheerefull Expence of so many choice and select houres for the advancement of their owne. This induced the Carefull Parents of our accomplished Doriclea , to bestow their best endeavours in providing a Convenient match for their Daughter; in whom they had treasured so rich hopes, as her reverend feare and filiall obedience promised nothing lesse then much comfort to their age, from those prime expressions of her youth. Neither were the favourites of her fame (mounted on the wings of vertue) lesse slow in performing those faire Offices which so excellent a Creature merited. For as her irreproveable demeanure, reteined ever amongst her familiars, passages highly conducing to her honour: So those, who knew her not but by report, retained no lesse strength nor vigour of desire to court so incomparable a Mistris, whom the fame of her vertues with other personall indowments had so fairely displayed. Beauty, said the antient Lyricke, could not want Corrivals: but when Vertue presents herselfe to make the house beautifull throughout, it cannot but attract many Surveyers. Unlesse the judgements of men become so miserably deluded and distracted, as that young debaucht Gallants was, who could not endure the presence of his Mistris because shee was vertuous. But pure and refined judgements who make their Choice not wholly by the outward semblance, or that skinne-deepe beauty, which the winter of age no sooner rivels, then shee surrenders her glory: but by those inward perfections, which would make Zenophanes himselfe to be a wooer: fixe mainely upon that which makes fancy truly happy. And both these might a stayd affection finde stored and treasured in Doriclea : Being such an one, as to describe her truely, she was faire without art, and in that native beauty, reteyned such a winning favour, as she did nothing but what did infinitely become her. Tall she was not, but of that equall stature, as her well-tempered proportion could neither taxe her of too much, nor accuse Nature of taking her measure too little. To use Hyperboles, I hate it: yea, and in so exquisite a Subiect, as the spreading fame of her owne actions might seeme Hyperboles unto others, holding themselves so unfit to aspire to such perfections: or too farre short to reteine the least hope of seconding them in any proportionable measure of imitation. But howsoever, the carefull Parents of Doriclea aymed at nothing more then to bestow her on some person of quality, that in an equall line of love and merit their affections might close: and make every day sound like a marriage day in the joynt Correspondence of their affectionate Choice: Doriclea , ever indowed with a native modesty, pretended to her Parents the tendernesse of her youth, or her indisposition to health, purposely to protract time: whereas, indeed, it was the aversenesse of her mind from a marryed life: desiring rather under the tender tuition of her Parents to bestow her youth, then to fix her fancy on any. For that constant affection shee reteyned to privacy (as I formerly told you) rebaited the heate of Loves assaults. Neither did she desire without much instancy to frequent any publike meeting: but rather to exercise her mind in reading or discoursing with some of her intimate acquaintance; with whom she lived and conversed in such sweet and familiar manner, as their delightfull Society estrang'd her thoughts from the thought of a Lover. But her Parents, ever harping upon one string; expounded all this aversenesse and declining of hers to a modest bashfull shame, which would in time weare out, and set a better face upon the proffers of Love. And sometimes they would not stick privately to take their daughter under-hand advising her to entertaine a Fortune whilest it was tendered; and how it was their sole Care that she might bee advanced and preferred to her liking. How they grew old, and to leave her to the wide World, could not chuse but perplex them. Then would they nominate divers young gentlemen, whose estates and descents might deserve her entertainement. But no Rhetorick could bee more dissorting or discording to her eare. The discourse of a Nuptiall rite was so disrelishing a note, as there was no ayre she affected lesse; apprehending such content in her present virgin state, as to live and dye therein, she desired nothing more. But this must not serve her turne; privacy must give way to fancy: a retyred Lawne to a discourse of Love. By her Mothers provident Care, she must learn to study the care of a Mother; Otherwise, this estranging her thoughts from giving way to fancy, will be interpreted a peevish kinde of pertinacy. Suppose her then rather out of an enforced direction, then any freebred affection, entring parley with a Suitor; whose quality how unequally it suted or sorted with her disposition, in whom Art and Nature had wrought such perfection, you shall perceive hereafter.  How Camillus became her Suiter, and how she rejected him through distaste of his breeding.  are reiected, while persons of meaner condition are admitted. You may imagine that Doriclea cannot want for store, being so excellently accommodated both for outward indowments and promising estate. Where Portion and Proportion meet, they cannot but bee attractive Objects to any one that either affects profit or pleasure . For the Worldling, as his first love-question is, What h'as she? wherein if hee faile in his expectance, his affection is so weakely feathred, as his flight is but short, because his desires of having were long. So the voluptuous or sensuall Amorist, who makes sense to usher judgement ; his onely question is; Is shee an handsome wench? His fancy is in his eye. Hee cannot have enough of beauty; wherein should the object whereto he is presented, be in any sort defective: his love as it deriv'd his first light from sense: so it expires at first sight. Hee will not give his judgement leave to converse with her; to see what inward beauty may inwardly accomplish her. A feather of this wing was our penne-feather'd Camillus , whereof we are now to discourse: a right Lapwing , who had left his nest before he had shaken the shell from his head. Howsoever, on he must to be a Suiter, before he h'as well learn'd how to spell Lover. Something of Sense hee h'as in him; and this informs him, that love is a fine thing: but what use to make of that Fairing he knowes not. A fault, I must confesse, so epidemicall, as to many marriages become infected with this Colts-evill . This made that experienc'd Sage complaine so much of these indiscreet haire-brain'd Couplings, "that I wonder, quoth he, that every Age begets not a new Bedlam ." This Camillus , being one whom Fortune had more favoured, then his Parents Education had qualified, became admitted amongst others of the same List, to this too deserving a Choice for such a Changeling. A right Changeling! Not for Changing his affection to his Choice: for he had never as yet attained to such happinesse, as to aspire to the Title of a Servant, or to be stiled the deserving favourite of a Mistresse. But in that hee seemed as if he had beene changed in the Cradle: for so unlike hee was to those from whom hee had descended, as never appeared any Sprigge more ingenerous, derived from so free and fruitfull a Stocke . This unseemely lover, or amorous Lubber, being put on by his mother to advance him forward to this match; addresseth his ill-speeding course to our incomparable Doriclea : and as one, who had never beene bred in the Court of Complement , nor of Manners neither, in his rusticke way thus accoasteth her: and that I may lesse erre in his dialect or forme of speech, I shall use his owne countrey tone, though I cannot so well personate his posture, which no doubt, conferred on this Swaineling no lesse honour. Yaw , Iantlewoman, with the saffron snude, you shall know that I am Master Camillus , my Mothers anely white boy. And she wad han you of all loves to wad me: And you shall han me for your tougher. We han store of goodly Cattell: for horne, hare, and leather, peepe here and peepe there, aw the wide dale is but snever to them. My Mother, though shee bee a vixon, shee will blenke blithly on you for my Cause: And we will ga to the Dawnes, and Slubber up a Sillibub: and I will looke babbies in yaur eyes, and picke silly-cornes out of yaur toes: And wee will han a Whiskin at every rush-bearing; a Wassell Cup at yule; a Seed-cake at Fastens; and a lusty Cheese-cake at our Sheepe-wash. And will not aw this done bravely, Iantlewoman? How this strange kinde of wooing might promise it selfe any hope of winning, I leave to your judgements who know the Art and Posture of Suting: but how it relished her discreet eare, may sufficiently appeare by this answer to her home-spunne Suiter. Pretty Servant! you tell mee your mother sent you to wed me; but of all loves you must stay till the banes be askt: and perchance before the third time of asking you will be of an other mind. Fie young Gentleman, will such a brave sparke as you, that is your Mothers White-boy undoe your hopes, in marrying such a Countrey Ioan as I am? Besides, what know you but I may prove untoward, and that will bring your Mother to her Grave; make you (pretty babe) put finger ith' eye, and turne the doore quite off the hinges. Nay, besides all this; how will you brooke to heare shriking of a Child, and rocking of a Cradle? The scouling of a wife, the scoulding of a Nurse, with a pad in the straw, and a nest of hornets buzzing through all the house? Returne then my sweet amorous Servant, the same way you came: be wise before you leape, and then I hope you will not leape at all. Marriage is a madde age, how can it then sort or suite with you, that has so much Sage in your pate? Bee a good Childe, and keepe your selfe from the rodde, and I hope I shall never bring you to so unhappy a Lot. Simple Camillus tooke this for good Counsell: nor did his weake-fledg'd fancy inspire him with any fresh reply: home hee goes to his mother like a soone-rebaited Suiter: for as his affection received life onely from an others direction: without any preceding grounds of discretion, so it as quickly expired, being so weakely and Childishly grounded. Vpon whose departure, Doriclea begun thus to expostulate with herselfe not without pleasure, this rude encounter of her white-liver'd suiter: descanting on all his uncivill passages in this manner. "What an excellent purchase, Doriclea , mightst thou injoy in this Gooseling?    [   Doricleas expostulation touching Camillus .  ] One of competent fortunes; and of a disposition so pliable, as one might easily mould him to their owne bent. One, that no question, some of our wanton Gallants would not sticke to admit; nor bee dainty to entertaine for a Servant ; nay, for a Consort ; meerely to shroud their owne shame, or to maintaine their bravery with the revenues of his decreasing estate. Hee would supply the place well enough of a servile Vsher, with an affected grace to carry her Misset; open her pue; goe before her in the Street, and keepe his distance; or conduct her more peculiar Servant by a posternegate to her licentious Lodging. But are these the fruits of wedlocke? Must an husband be made a stale to sinne, or an inlet to his owne shame? O no Doriclea ! Vertuous affection cannot incline to such pollution. "Those, who make Choice of Husbands, purposely to make them their slaves, are domesticke Tyrants. Those, who make choice for profit, make filth and ordure their sole object of Conjugall honour. Those, who receive a Servant into their bosome, because he is eminent in place, make locall precedency the ground of their fancy, which cannot but close in distaste, when an higher Corrivall shall ascend his place. "But none of these merit the stile of love. Heavens blesse me! How should the reasonable Soule (unlesse all his prime faculties were drowned and drenched in the lees of sense) affect such a Swad, whose elocution suck't from the dugge, and whose formality t'ane from the Cow-sheard, taste so little of love, as discretion would not endure to bestow on it so pure a name? For say, Doriclea , is it possible to purchase fancy with a sheepish story? or with a foolish relation of. what fortunes had dropt downe upon them? And such was Camillus his encounter: proper ornaments for a Suiter. "Well, if ever fancy seize on me; which is, as yet, farre estranged from mee, I hope to fixe on such a Choice, as these weake respects shall never appeare to bee the sole ayme of my affection. For to love, where Discretion bids me loath, were an unhappy fortune: such a marriage day, were a Tragicke day; introducing no other Scenes then presentments of discomfort to an unfortunate Consort. But why doe I suffer my thoughts to converse with love; seeing I have had so little familiarity with it all my life? Hitherto have I beene devoted to privacy; wherein I have ever reaped such absolute content, as to forgoe it, or with some other condition to exchange it, were to lose my selfe, and deprive an inlarged minde of that freedome which the whole Empire of love cannot afford." Thus expostulated Doriclea with herselfe, touching this affectionate tender of Camillus . Whose choice indeed her Parents did not much approve; because his shallow Conceipt made him altogether incapeable of love. So as, Doriclea might well enough dispense with this Match: and live in expectance of a more equall and generous Mate.  How Mardanes a rich Countrey Chuse solicited her affection: and how he laboured to procure her love by indirect meanes; when the proffers of a faire personall estate could not doe it.  ever an ominous starre; there sits still an heavy fate. But whence comes this; but either from avaritious Parents, who preferre fortunes before all other more deserving abilities: holding him only worthy to be their sonne on whom the Sunne doe's shine? or from the wanton affection, or too profuse expence of light Mistresses; who make Choice of rich Servants to make Sponges of them? Their long bestowed providence must be imployed in affording to their disdainfull Consorts, excesse of maintenance. And these kinds of coy Amorists, for most part, use to articulate and indent with those they intend to marry; in what rank they shall be maintained; how accoutred; in what manner accommodated; what place they may by right challenge. Coach and Caroach gaudily distinguished, must be forthwith provided: a Summer-house sumptuously furnished, with such conveyances, as her rich Chuffe might visibly see, were not his deluded eyes ever fixt on his Hidropick Chest, what she intends hereafter, by those private passages contrived in each corner. But neither did the Parents of Doriclea stand so much ingaged to any worldly respect, as it had power to attract their affections to it; nor was Doriclea so earthly-bred, as to make Fortune the sole and absolute Object of her fancy: which might be instanced in nothing more fully then in the entertainment of her next Suitor, whereof we are to discourse as it fals now upon our History, in this manner. There was one Mardanes , a rich Grazier; one, who had all his time fed on the better side oth' bush. This rich Chrone, who made an Idoll of his Coine, made suit to Doriclea , to obtaine her love. Rich and mighty proffers he made her; pretending to throw himselfe and Fortunes at her feet, so he might enjoy her. Neither did her discreet Parents much oppose it, nor incline to it, but refer'd all to their Daughters choice: preferring her liking before any other temporary proposition. But how weakly this Mardanes proceeded, and how unprosperously he succeeded, shall appeare by the issue: which fell so crosly to his expectance, imagining his rich and plenteous estate to be an Adamant attractive enough to the dullest fancy, as he inverted the means of proceeding directly, to an odious and impious practise; seeking to procure her love by meanes of Sorcery. Suppose him then first, after his long sollicitancie had received a repulse, contesting in this sort with his affections: the grounds whereof as they were weakly planted, so were they as unhappily closed. "   [   Mardanes Passion upon his Repulse.  ] What; rejected Mardanes? Has thy worldly policie improved thy fortunes so meanly, as to be contemned in such just and ample proffers of fancie? What would she desire, if any mortall store may raise her to an happinesse of estate, which she may not enjoy in making her choice of thee? Yea, but there is such a disparity in yeares, as her smooth youth cannot endure these deepe furrowes of age. Paritie ever begets best liking betwixt either partie. Whereas her fresh flourishing Prime would brook ill to be imbraced by thy seere and saplesse armes. Besides, were she never so loyall to thy bed, rumour would not be silent: conceits would be working, and jealous feares in every corner stirring. Report would impeach her, were her continent desires never so restrained, nor to thee confined. It becomes her then, as shee tenders her honour, to make choice of such an one who may more equally suit her, and with a fresher and more agile youth better content her. "Well, then this is all that can be objected why thy suit is not received, thy proffers accepted; thou art old and declining, Mardanes ; this age is a terrible bugbeare in the eye of fancy. The desire may be strong, but the Lampe is quickly in the snuffe. There wants oyle to feed it: and if it should cast forth some sparklings, it is soone extinguished. "By this I gather, it were wisely done in my particular, if I laboured to smother this secret flame, before it increase or break forth in more violence. For by marying one who expects more than she can finde, thou maist finde that which thou never expected. Take heed then lest thy own Dogs know thee not when thou comest home. It is thine owne fault if thou fallest into Act aeons fate. Thy blood is yet uncorrupted, yellows has not tainted it. Thou deservest well to lose the libertie of thy present estate, by making thy selfe a Slave to one who holds thee unworthy of her choice. "All this works much with reason; but who knowes not, but a small portion of reason weighs heaviest in the scale of affection? I confesse, I am blame- worthy in my pursuit of such a Mistresse, whose fancie is so farre aliened from me, as she relisheth no aire worse then what I breathe, no place worse then where I remaine, no Motion worse then what I make. I know likewise, no Receipt to be more soveraigne, no Cordiall more usefull, then that approved Experiment of an amorous Artist: When a Man bleeds at the nose, and through abundance of blood is brought in danger of his life, the Physitian lets him blood in his arme, to turne the course of the blood an other way. If love issue out in too violent a streame, it is to bee cooled by a temperate expostulation with fancie: or else by fixing our eye upon some more attractive Object, divert the course of that madding passion. An excellent Rule, but who can follow it? The Lover is ever blinded with affection towards his beloved. Nor was there ever yet so discreet an Elder, that could both love and become wise together. Excuse then or condemne mee who will; seeing I am thus farre imbarkt in Loves adventure, though my aged fancie may bear the name of Dote- age, I will on, or perish with dishonour." This strong resolution of Mardanes brought him on to a desperate experiment, as the sequele of our History shall discover: meane time, we will returne to our late- solicited Doriclea , and see what plight she is in, since the rejection of this violent Suiter. Doriclea having returned Mardanes her expresse answer; and that with such modesty as beseemed one of her quality; beseeching him to excuse her, in that she could not entertaine so deserving a Servant, to whom she stood infinitely obliged for his love, seeing her disposition was altogether averse from the least thought of marriage: but if ever she affected that state, as her hopes could never aspire to such fortunes as he had proffered, so she meant to fix her fancy where it should with equality of yeares be suited. And so wishing him all happinesse (the highest period of his unhappinesse) retyring to a private Arbour, she dismissed her discontented Suiter. In which retirement, recollecting these distinct passages and passions of her two relinquished Lovers, she exprest her selfe thus. [   Doricleas Resolution.  ] " Doriclea , thou hast here kindnesse profferd thee in abundance. One presents his suit, and brings with him plenty of youth, fortunes, folly. "An other, no lesse rich in yeares then estate, cloyes thee with golden Mountaines of inducing promises: but my rest is already set in the neglect of both these. Fortunes, though youth promise them, cannot ingage me, where youth is clothed with folly. Nor shall proffers of honour or preferment surprize me, where disparity of yeares may beget in our mindes the like inequality. As Vertue is my Object: so I doubt not but if ever change my state, she will finde a Consort for me, that may improve my content." By this time had her Mother entred the Garden, into an Arbour whereof her Daughter had retired: so as, hearing her Mother call her by her name, she came forth unto her; and upon her demand, imparted unto her the answer she had returned to Mardanes : wherewith her Mother, though she seemed at first to dis-relish it, was inwardly well pleased, desiring rather that her Daughter should bestow her selfe on one, whose youth might suit with her content, then such an one, whose fortunes though they were great, yet might his age beget in her fancy a contempt.  How Philocles , whom her Parents had entertained for her Schoole-master, tooke occasion privately, but shadowingly, to impart his affection to her: and with what seeming scorne his motion was received.  their Daughter in good literature, with other usefull Principles sorting well with the accomplishment of one of her quality: there was one Philocles commended to them; whose singular parts deserved approvement with the best. For hee had bestowed much precious time, not without answerable profit and improvement, in the University. Where he became for his time such an excellent Proficient as much was expected from him: nor had he doubtlesse, frustrated their expectance, might he have beene partaker of his desires; in residing where he wished, and planting where he so much profited. But his course of Academick Studies became diverted, being call'd back into the Countrey. Where he continued not long, till he was preferred to the Familie of Androgeus . During all which time, he demeaned himselfe so commendably, as there was none of what quality so ever, but conceived infinite delight in his company. For his discretion had sufficiently inform'd him in the distinction of times: when to be grave and serious; when pleasant and ingenious. And though he knew how to argue Syllogistically, and play the Sophister wittily: yet so modest was he in the whole time of his reside there, as he was never observed to presse any Argument, no, though urged, without much instancy. A rare quality in a Scholar: who, for most part, is apt to make Logick his Subject in each society. Whereas discretion will rather moderate too unseasonable-vehement reasonings in that kinde, then become too forward a Champion in entring the List upon every unnecessary occasion. Neither had Philocles , of whom we are now to discourse, possest himselfe more strongly of the opinion and good conceit of the Parents of Doriclea , who had taken a speciall observance of the care, industry, and singular modesty of this her Tutor: but that tender tinder of affection became likewise to sparkle a little in that pure Virgin-bosome of Doriclea: Albeit, so composed were her thoughts, so divinely moderate her desires, as she chused rather to smother, and therein suffer for her fancy, then ingage her unadvised affection to a publique discovery. In the same manner did our Philocles suffer; for so constantly had his liking seated it selfe on the towardly disposition of Doriclea , as now upon the expiration of the years of her tuition, instead of a severe Master, he becomes a sincere Lover. Long had he expected what the issue would be of her late Suitors affectionate encounters: wherein Doriclea had beene ever desirous to take his advice: whose counsel, doubtlesse, would conduce weakly to their availe: and having now perceived, how lightly she entertained such ignoble Servants: and that her discreet fancy seemed rather to aime at personall worth, then the rubbish of Earth: Hee imagines a faire opportunity to be now offer'd him of imparting his minde freely to her, in whose purchase he might finde stored an incomparable treasure. Revenues hee had none to proffer her: having the constant fortunes of a Scholer; which like two Lines meet together in one Centre, equally closing in the fate of a younger Brother. Yet observe his modesty! Many times had hee resolved to discover his love, which some contrary passions ever prevented. Sometimes hoping hee might prevaile, and enjoy what he sought: other sometimes, wholly despairing to reape what his care had sown. Now would he prepare himselfe for a set speech; but no sooner came he in her presence, then as one driven to an extasie,  & wholy deprived of the benefit of memory, he only discovered his fancy by the intentive fixing of his eye: other language he could finde none: silent admiration was the sole Orator of his affection. At last, recollecting his love distracted thoughts, and bethinking with himselfe, with that amorous Youth in the Pastorall, how she whose fancie he besought was but a Woman: and that an unkinde repulse was the worst entertainment he could possibly expect, he takes to him heart of grace, and after many cold qualmes to perplexed Lovers best knowne, with the best boldnesse he could, he thus encounter'd her. "   [   Philocles Speech to Doriclea .  ] Scholer shall I call you, or your Masters Mistresse? Your years of tuition are now expired: your yeares have taught you now to learne Woman. And shall I receive no guerdon for my long attendance, save only an acknowledgement of my Service? A great part of the prime of my youth have I here bestowed in your Fathers house; where mine highest care was your proficience: nor did your increase in knowledge fall short of my expectance. You have read, how Iacob for his seven yeares service, received from Laban his Leah ." Wherewith Doriclea interrupting him, said; And if my Father had any such bleare-ey'd Daughter, you should have my consent to enjoy her. But pray you good Sir (quoth Doriclea ) whence commeth this discourse, or whereto direct you it? H'as my Father fallen in any manner short of what was promised you; or deducted ought from that annuall Pension hee conferred on you, that you should thus upbraid us in any disregard to your service? "No, Mistresse, (answered Philocles ) I have amply tasted of his bountie; his liberall exhibition towards me, hath farre exceeded any abilities in mee of requitall. If I have any cause to complaine, the ground thereof ariseth from your neglect, and so you may be pleased to conceive it." From mine, said Doriclea ? Good Sir, shew me in what particular, I have neglected any office of respect to your deserving selfe! Of all vices, I must ingenuously tell you, I have ever constantly hated that of ingratitude. Conscious I am, Heaven knowes, of too many; yet of this, my thoughts have been ever so freely cleared, as I cannot remember wherein you may pretend any just cause of taxing mee in this nature. "O yes Mistresse, answered he! I have taught you what I perceive you were as apt to forget, as you were at first to get: and in forgoing that one only Lesson, you have implyed a neglect of my instruction. You may well remember, for it is not so long since you got it by heart, how I told you the signification of Amo , and how you were to decline it." Neither have I forgot it, so farre, said she, as I meane to make use of it. For the Active I shall ever generally approve it: but for the Passive , I never mean to entertaine it. What may Amo then signifie, quoth Philocles? I love , said Doriclea ; and why do you decline , quoth he, from so sweet a signification? Because (answered she) it was one of your first Lessons to teach me how to decline it. Herein I doe but observe your Lesson, and is this in me any transgression? "No, Doriclea , No, said Philocles ; but my desire is that you would exercise the fruit and effect of that Lesson. I will not tell you how much he loves you, who first read that Lesson to you. But were there transparent Lights in his Bosome, you might easily discerne, and consequently affirme, that there were something in him who deserved your affection." Deserved my affection (answered Doriclea !) Surely, I doubt not, but my Fathers care has provided a better Jointure then a Schoolehouse for his Daughter. Trust me Sir, if this be your Guerdon which you expect for your care and serious instruction; I am very likely, for my part to prove unthankfull still: your motion falling so farre short of all hope of promotion. Nay, I must tell you, Sir, that you have so deceived my opinion, as where before I bore your person all respect, as to a serious and industrious Master; your uncivile presumption (for a better title I cannot bestow of it) shall henceforth teach me to dispense with that respect: and if you seasonably desist not, make my Father acquainted with your boldnesse. In such scorn I hold your Motion, as I can finde no passion strong enough to encounter with your indiscreet affection. With which words, as one seemingly above all measure, irreconcileably incensed, she departed: leaving her disconsolate Philocles to converse with the Aire: or like a melancholy Scholer, to enter parley with his own sullen Saturnine thoughts. But so strangely became he divided from himself, as the very Organs of his Tongue had lost the faculties of speech: his eyes, as if affrighted with some Meteor, stood staring, without distinguishing the Object they fixt upon. All was out of order with this amorous Scholer: till at last taking a little breath, he vented his dis- passionate griefs in this manner. "Is it so, unhappie Philocles?   [   Philocles Passion.  ] Must thy true affectionate care of her honour, receive so harsh an answer? Will she shew no lesse height of hate, then thou reteines heat in thy love? And whence the ground of her disdaine? Thou taught'st her the Rule to love , but shee never means to practise that Lesson. Thou hast that Cloud of a Scholer hanging over thee Philocles , which darkens the height of love. They must be accommodated in all parts, that shall merit her love. Camillus she could not brook, though young and rich, because he was a Foole. Mardanes shee could not endure, though wise and rich, because he was too old. And Philocles she will discard, though neither too old, nor altogether a Foole, because he is not rich. Well, Doriclea , my desire shall ever be, that thou maist prosper: and enjoy in any complete Gallant whom thou shalt affect, more then thou canst in the society of a Scholer. Yet, me thinks, that name should not be of such contempt, that the very tender of my affection should beget thy discontent. It is a strange requitall, to render hatred for love: civill respects deserve freer courtesies. My hopes are not yet so desperate; nor my studies hitherto so unfortunate, that they should expose me to such neglect. Why then should shee bestow on my affectionate devotion, no better title then Vncivill presumption : seeing privacie freed me from the one; and my humilitie from the other? But all this sufficeth her not: her inraged passion mounts yet higher above the banks. She has denounced on thee a sentence, if thou desist not from thy suit. Her Father must be made acquainted: and consequently thy future hopes derived from his favour, expired. And herein have you charm'd me Doriclea ; I shall surcease to expresse, what my thoughts shall ever reteine. Nay, I will turne dissembler with mine own heart: and learne to decline from what I love most. You shall have no cause hereafter to tax me of boldnesse: in the company of those you better love, I shall hold my distance; Rejoice when you are pleased in the presentment of a deserving Suiter, and heartily wish your mindes may close in one harmonious Consort together. And if this will not expiate my offence, I will go further, to regaine my peace. An Academick life shall receive me, which may in time restore to me that liberty, which since this my occasionall reside in the Countrey becomes unhappily estranged from me." This said, he retired; bearing the clearest countenance that so troubled a minde could bring forth: resolving never to renew his Suit; but if he could not weare out those impressions of love, which had writ such deepe Characters in his heart, to remove the occasion by dividing himselfe from the Object of his affection: and exchanging a Countrey love with an Academicall life.  The discourse Doriclea used next day at Table, being encouraged by her Parents indulgence: alledging by way of Argument, that she wondred how Julia, Augustus his Daughter could detract so much from her Princely descent, as to entertaine least thought of loving Ovid ; and how a Schoolmaster durst attempt the Sollicitancy of an Emperours Daughter.  disesteeme; then Doriclea apprehended motives of content from the affection Philocles had profest. Yet to cloath fancy with policy, both of these must stand at equall distance: and expresse not so much as the least beamling of their true zeale in presence. For Philocles , he durst not, being already charm'd with her threats: and for Doriclea , she would not, to try what temper hee was made of. A dangerous hazard, I must confesse it is, to trifle thus with love, and by playing with the flame, to endanger the sindging of their wings: but so well composed was Doriclea , so vertuously loyall her affection, and that winged with such continent desires, as they ever impaled themselves within the lists of modesty. Yea, she would not stick sometimes to give liberty to the quicknesse of her conceit: by making choice of some discourse purposely to amate Philocles : and shadowingly pretend a discovery of his late proffer'd and professed fancy. As it chanced one day, when her Parents and her selfe were at Table together, where through a native tender indulgence which they had ever shown to their Daughter, she had liberty to expresse her conceit upon any Subject. By means of this liberty, which she alwaies used with much modesty, she took occasion to enter into a discourse by way of argument, touching the familiarity which appeared betwixt Augustus his Daughter and the Poet Ovid : wherein she proceeded in this manner. Amongst all other occasionall Subjects, wherein my small Reading has informed me; there is nothing that occurres unto me more strangely then that boldnesse, which I finde in that ingenious Ovid , with the Emperour Augustus his Daughter. How a Poet, who even that wisest of Philosophers, Plato himselfe, had long since banished his Common-wealth; and whose height of fancy some of our ancient Sages have esteemed a meere phrensie; holding Poetry to be the Devils wine : and a Poeticall Dimension such a distraction, as it infatuated the understanding, and deluded the conceipt with deceiving shadowes of opinion; How he, I say, durst attempt an assay of such importance; by imparting his love, where he ought so much of duty: or conceipt himselfe worthy the least beamling or reflexion of such a fancy. Againe, how she, looking on that imperial House from whence she came; those eminent Allyes with which she sided; those many eyes which darted on her; the distaste which so commanding a Father could no lesse than apprehend upon so unequall a familiarity; would debase her thoughts so much, as to stoope to so base a Lure: as the highest pitch was but a Poeticall fury, an intranced rapsody, which would suit incompetibly with a Princes fancy. No, what is more, a meere Pedanticall Schoolemaster; for so I have read, he was; whose highest aime was his Soveraignty in correction:  & this ambitious Swad to assume to himselfe so much immerited state, as to presse into familiarity with his Emperours Daughter; or she to entertaine such ignoble thoughts as to accept of the protests of so undeserving a servant, is almost above the pitch of imagination to conceive; or opinion to beleeve. Why Girle, said her Father? was it hold you, so contemptible a thing in those dayes to be a Schoolemaster? Pray you tell me, what doe you thinke of some of our most eminent Princes, who have in former times beene Schoolemasters? yea, and with a voluntary dereliction of all regall state, port, and magnificence, preferred that pedanticall state before the glory of a Diadem? Dennis, Dionysius , and Seleuchus were in their times equall to most Princes for eminence of state, absolutenesse of command; extent in the limit of their Soveraignty; yet did these hold that condition which you esteeme so despicable, equall in content to that Princely honour which before they retain'd: yea, incomparably more happy did they account themselves, in relinquishing the one for acceptance of the other, then if the most famous Conquest that ever Earth was witnesse of, had recorded their regall names in the Annals of honour. This it was which moved Seleuchus that victorious Prince, upon reflex had to those many miseries and insupportable cares accompanying a Crowne, so confidently to say, that if a Man knew with what cares a Diadem was clogged, he would not take it up though it lay in the street. Nor was this the singular opinion of one; for when the Romans had despoiled Antiochus of all Asia , so lightly laid he it to his heart, as hee gave them great thanks, saying, they had rid him of many insupportable cares: yea, and of many bitter invectives beside; being at one time saluted a glorious Prince , and a furious Tyrant . Nor did these beare those mutable overtures with mindes lesse composed, then if highest fortunes with generall voice and vote had beene on them conferred. So as, a Philosopher perceiving Dionysius to sit merrily in the Theatre after he was expulsed his realme, condemned the people who banished him. It is true Father, said Doriclea : but I am halfe perswaded, that none of these whom you have named, would have cared much for a private life, had they not beene deposed. To act the part of King and no King , is an heavie taske: High spirits can hardly brooke it; and for ignoble mindes, who preferre, like an other childish Honorius the safety of Roma their Hen, before the safeguard of Roma their City; they are not to bee much pitied for what they lose, because they are altogether insensible of their losse. They who could forgoe a Kingdome for a Schoole, never deserved the Title of a Prince. Indeed, some of these there were who deprived of their Scepter made a Schoole-house their harbour; but for what end? Meerly to exercise their tyranny on Children, as they had before practised on Men. Girle, your judgement is too rash, said Androgeus ; did not Dioclesian , whom you even now named, voluntarily relinquish the flourishing'st Empire in the world? He was neither expulsed by force, nor deposed by private consent: his desertion of an Imperiall life came from his owne choice: being weary of so pressing a burthen, the weight whereof winged his resolves for a private condition. But pray thee Girle, whence came the occasion of this argument? Truly Sir, quoth she, from no great ground; and I am glad at heart, that having taken so slight an occasion, it has so neerely closed it selfe in a digression. For my Argument tooke first breath from the boldnesse of a Schoolemaster in attempting, and the lightnesse of his Scholler in consenting. The one too confident of his own parts; the other too unmindefull of her own worth. The first too opinionate of his owne desert; the latter too forgetfull of her own descent. Which Subject, presuming on your patience and fatherly indulgence, I made choice of, being the very last which occurred to my reading; which mov'd me the rather to revive it, to heare what might materially be opposed to it.  The feare Philocles was in, lest Doriclea should discover his suit to her Parents. Which Doriclea , though shee made choice of that Argument, only to affright him, never intended, being more affectionately disposed, then either her appearance made shew of, or any expression had as yet discovered.  in the disputing of this Subject: so as, if the Parents of Doriclea had suspected ought, they might easily have gathered by the going and comming of his colour, that there was something in the winde that wrough such strange effects in his count'nance and gesture. All which proceeded from an imaginary feare, doubting much that Doriclea had discovered his too bold suit to her Parents: Or if she had not already done it; this very Argument whereof she took so free an occasion to discourse, was an introduction of what she meant to discover hereafter. So as, many times in private would hee fall into sundry passions: sometimes reproving his own presumption, in presenting his love to one who was so farre above the spheare of his affection: other sometimes he would minister to his amated spirits some small semblances of hope; as if she were not the same she seem'd; but that her fancy, howsoever shadowed or shrowded for the time, would break forth into other expressions, then what her virgin modesty could yet impart. Which deceiving opinion (as hee judged it) he would streight labour to divert, and condemne himselfe of egregious folly to promise himselfe hope to obtaine: seeing all passages of prevailing in his inconsiderate suit, were shut up by his Mistresse disdaine. For to impart his thoughts to her any more upon that subject, he resolved fully never to attempt it: desiring nothing more then that his former folly might be remitted; and all occasion of discovery prevented: upon which condition hee would willingly surcease from those motives of love, which had so strongly wrought on the faculties of his minde. Nor did hee see any means to unrip his thoughts to an other, being so far from hope of successe, as now it became a sufficient task for him to prevent danger. For as the bent of his fortunes at that time confin'd themselves only to the spirit of hope: so was his hope probably like to expire, should she whom hee held so deere, make the least discovery of what had passed betwixt him and her. It behoved him therefore to apply himselfe to another designe: and recant his familiarity with love: which might both endanger his fortunes, and deprive him all hopes of aspiring higher. Thus, as the precious stone Diocletes , though it have many rare and excellent soveraignties in it, yet it loseth them all, if it bee put into a dead mans mouth; fared it with Philocles , who though he were excellently indowed, richly qualified, and for elocution generally approved; yet all these disheartned by want of hope , lost all that lustre which they formerly reteined. For though at retired houres, and at such times as he found his Muse most propitious, he composed diverse amorous Poems, apt motives to stir up fancy; Yet so much was he discouraged, as what his resolves were sometimes addressed to present, his latter thoughts ever retracted. Howsoever, his melancholly walkes, affecting nothing more then privacy, discovered to his Mistresse the effects of his fancy, who was so farre from disclosing what might redound to his dishonour; as those arguments whereof she sometimes took occasion to treat, were only urged to affright him, but in no case to prejudice him: being so tender of his welfare, as whatsoever appeared, nothing was by her intended to decline his choice, or to give him just cause of change. For so full of vertuous remorse was Doricleas pious heart, as it was more affectionately disposed, then by any appearance was yet discovered. For as the Juniper tree maketh the hottest coale, and the coolest shadow of any tree: For the coale is so hot, that if it be rak't up in ashes of the same, it continueth unextinquishable by the space of a whole yeare: So this divinely sented creature (to hold nearer resemblance with the Juniper) though the heate of her affection had beene long smothered in embers, and discovered no visible flame; yet did it reteine her vigour still, and by so much more violent when issuing, by how much longer before it came to appearing. For love inwardly shewes his heat most, when outwardly discerned least. And such was Doricleas case; though she restrained her eye from fixing on that Object which it desired: and her heart to entertaine that guest which of all others she most priz'd, yet could not her discretion make such a foole of love, as wholly to bury her thoughts from more discerning eyes. Truth is, though no profession seem'd more contemptible then that which he held: yet in her conceipt, no vocation more pleasing, being profest by one to her own thoughts so loving; with her owne desires so complying. Little then needed Philocles , to feare that she would discover any thing to her Parents to his prejudice: seeing she so inwardly affected and equally approved what he had propounded, as nothing did more infinitely content her, then at vacant hours to recollect those words which he had delivered to her. Neither was it her desire to tyrannize over her late- captiv'd and inchained Servant: whose freedome lay it in her power, should be confirm'd with as ample and authentick a Charter; as true love and constant devotion could enjoyne her. But all this little allay'd those incessant cares and feares of poore Philocles : who every day expected a discharge, when he should be deprived of the place he bore, and consequently of all future hopes of renuing his suit, or enjoying that prize which hee so infinitely valued, as the sacrifice of his life he held at a low rate to seaze him of the incomparable purchase of her love. This mov'd him one day, after a sad recollection of his thoughts, to meditate of his present condition,   [   Philocles relation of the unhappinesse of his condition.   ] and of the ground of his distemper in this pensive manner. "How is it Philocles ! how fares it with thy distracted thoughts! most miserable of all others is thy condition; meriting most, yet can partake no compassion. Shouldst thou discover thy griefes, thou exposest thy selfe to danger, and by concealing what thou feelest, with fresh fuell thou feedst thy distemper, unhappy then art thou in suffering what thou darest not disclose: and no lesse unhappy, in making those thy enemies, on whom thou depends, by discovering what thy intimate thoughts desire to make knowne. "How sweet and safe was thy condition, when Philosophy was thy mistresse: and and the Liberall Arts those brave Competitors which contested with thee for preeminence? Light-feather'd Love was then no Lure to catch thee: nor beauty no baite to ensnare thee: Nor all those amorous delights which fancy tenders, motives to delude thee. Spare commons became profest foes to light affections. "Lectures of Philosophy admitted no Audience to loves treaty. "But such is the mutable disposition of the mind: that no condition relisheth worse then what it presently injoyes. For could man value an Academicke life when he partakes it, at that estimate which hee holds it when he foregoes it, hee would not make exchange of that present state with the treasures of the age: nor lose an houres contemplation for the injoyment of an Empire. O unhappy Philocles ! and by so much more unhappy, in being once happy. In those prime flourishing dayes, wherein knowledg was the height of thy ambition, thou couldst freely without anxiety, and though rationally, with much liberty, discourse of a disdainefull Mistris. Sleight the frownes of an imperious Dame, and make it a wonder, how a little painted Earth, more purely refined then other inferiour mould, should surprize a Conceiving soule, by making the miserable sufferer present himselfe a true Malecontent: with an hat without a band over-brimming his eyes, an unfashionable habit, as if he scorn'd to suit with time, and that unbrush'd: an head, as if newly fetterd with Medusa's locks, and that unkemb'd. This made me put on the Countenance of Democritus , and weaken my lungs with laughter. And must I play the madmans part, and discover my selfe to be the very same personall Actor! well Philocles ; herein thou maist read a Lecture of humility unto others; by disvaluing thy owne strength: and submitting thy selfe to others Censure, who formerly wert so forward to taxe others of the same Error. "Meane time, what powerfull effects have all these fruitlesse passions wrought? Increase of disdaine; decrease of esteeme: and feare in thy selfe of discovering thy ayme? Well, Doriclea , did you but know, as your discretion hath sufficiently inform'd and impro'vd your knowledge, what your unworthy Servant, unhappy Philocles , has lost in offering his Sacrifice of love unto you; you would suffer the worst of extreames, rather then suffer him to perish, whose life, freedome and fortune depend all upon your affection. But be it your lot to soveraignize over me, while with resolved patience; and a minde better composed then for any affliction to shake, I embrace my owne ruine with a smile, while you close the period of my hopes in a frowne." All this, unknowne to him, did his Doriclea heare; who had much to doe, upon the relation of his unhappinesse, to hold her peace. But with what an open and affectionate brest she receiv'd his Complaints, and with what constancy shee reteyned them, shall appeare hereafter by those impressive effects which were wrought in her, and derived from her, by them.  The intercursive Letters passing betwixt Philocles and Doriclea : and how shee begunne to impart by penne, what she had before conceited in thought: and how she desired nothing so much as the accomplishment of their Love, so privacy might give leave.  entertained. This our Love-perplexed Philocles well understood, when after so many cold sweats, and distemper'd passions, which the height and heat of his unfained love had brought him to, he begun now at last to perceive, that a storme may beget a Calme: and that the frowne of a Mistris may arise from the brow, without least privity or intention of the heart. Which pleasant and unexpected overture, not to trifle out time, nor delude the conceipt of our amorous Reader, who, no doubt, longs to heare of so faire a Conclusion, to such unpromising premises, happened thus. Philocles , who had never all his time before, entred into such a league of familiarity or acquaintance with love: and now fully resolved to bid adieu to all such dis-passionate treaties as make fooles of the wisest men: after a melancholy turne or two in a solitary walke, which since the first presentment of his love to Doriclea , at retired hours he usually frequented: entring his Chamber, and casting his eye aside, hee might finde a paper close by his deske, wherein were these words contained.  Sir; Scholler then a compleate Lover ; which imply'd, that you were lov'd and knew not. Now, I would not that you made too large a construction of this: I am not she that will tell you she loves you: and if perhaps, I did, you would not believe me. For I have given you no cause as yet to conceit so. Nay, reflect upon your person and profession, and if you be any good Sophister, you cannot chuse but conclude from such apparent premises, that it is impossible I should love you. And yet, I would be loath to be accounted such a foole, as to speake all that I thinke. Trust me, Sir, J was once resolv'd never to love, but if I did, never to love you: now what have you done that could alter me? Must I believe, you, because you told me you did love mee? Be all your protests Maxims, that I should hold them for authenticke? And yet Schollers have ever beene accounted simple: were it not a sinne then, not to believe you? That experienced Sage could stile you Foxes in the Schoole, but Sheepe in the world: And shall I hold you a dissembler? No; I am perswaded you speake as you thinke: but what is all this to me, or wherein may this beget hope in you, seeing you must not have all you love? Well; God forgive you, I will not dissemble, whatsoever you do. Let me heare you once againe treate of love, and you shall see how I will sleight you. If your discourse like me, trust me, I will not be angry; howsoever, it shall not so much offend me, as to make me accuse you to any such wherewith I formerly threatned you. To conclude, though Love be seldome grounded on Reason, returne me but reason why I should love, and why I should make you the object of that love, and as I live, Philocles shall finde me a loyall constant Doriclea .  Never did hopelesse Prisoner receive more content from the glad report of an unexpected reprive, after the heavy sentence of death pronounced, then revived Philocles did in the perusall of this Letter. He now recollects his dispersed and dispacarled spirits: and bethinks with himselfe what were best to bee done upon so faire an opportunity offered. Hee resolves therefore, to prevent jealous eyes, to addresse his minde to her in writing to this effect.  Mistris; my indearedst thoughts cannot impart unto you. To give you a reason why you should love mee, I can give you no other, but that my heart tels me I deserve you:  & that humanity injoynes you to love me, seeing I hold my life an easie sacrifice to injoy you. Be it your goodnesse to believe mee; I will sooner surcease to live, then from expressing those loyall arguments of love; which your vertues deserve, and which I with no lesse constancy shall observe. I could never yet dictate either by tongue or penne, what I first conceiv'd not in heart I told you, that your selfe was my booty; the portion J expected, your vertuous beauty: and if you pleased but to crowne my hopes with your consent, our mutuall choice which should never admit change, might make us both equally happy. To tell you that either my Fortunes or descent did deserve you, were to labour, and that fruitlesly, to delude you. But let me become an Abject in the eyes of fame, an Object of contempt to the world, if my faithfull devotion & observance supply not that deficience. For my descent, as I will not boast of it, yet whensoever your parents, after passion digested, shall examine it, they will finde it neither so ignoble as to despise it, nor so meanely strengthened, as to reject it. But what are these, compared to the purity of that affection, which combines hearts and hands: And with a sacred cement so knits and contracts mindes: As those who were before divided by meanes of this holy league became so united, as nothing so much as their presence could content them, then which, nothing before did more distaste them! were my fortunes never so poor, yet seeing my fancy appeares so pure, account him worthy to deserve you, who will hold himselfe unworthy of that life, which shall not be imployed to serve you. These are all the reasons of Love, which you can expect from Your loyall Philocles .  Thus became Love a present and pregnant Secretary. This object of fancy made the taske easy. Letters know not how to blush, which cause them commit to paper, what a bashfull tongue could not so well deliver. Besides, this diverted all occasion of jealousie in a meare-looking family. Which they before all others most doubted; fearing to be prevented, now when their loves begunne to be ripened and setled: which would so perplexe the Sceane, as this Comicke introduction might casually close with a fearefull Conclusion. Albeit, so free from the least suspition of any light or ungrounded affection which Doriclea might any way harbour, were her Parents; as many times they would give their daughter liberty to ride abroad, and visit her friends. In all which freedomes she expressed such modesty, as Envy could not hatch the least occasion of jealousie from so compos'd a behaviour. Yet, a greater desire shee reteyn'd to stay at home, since her affection begunne to be setled on Philocles , then before: many times pretending an indisposition of health, or some other minted excuse, to prevent her journey, by remaining there where shee had planted her fancy. But so tender were her Parents of their daughter; being, as shee was, indeed, naturally tender: as they desired she should change the ayre, fearing much that her long stay or retirednesse at home might enfeeble her health. And this their resolve now and then closed well with her liking, having Philocles assign'd her for her conduct: whose society, out of a modest policy, though she seemed with all indifferency to admit: yet how much that cheered her heart, I appeale to all such constant and affectionate Lovers, whose fancy h'as beene crowned with such opportunity: and whose Iourneyes have beene so incomparably sweetned with the Society of a Mistris; whose conference had power enough to shorten the houre; allay the difficulty of a troublesome way; and to entertaine every object with such occasionall delight: as nothing could more cheerefully nor intentively worke on the Conceit. But howbeit Philocles had sometimes the happinesse to attend his Mistris; He was injoyned to a short returne, which could not but beget an equall proportion of passion in them both: In him to be divided from her presence whom he so intirely affected: In her, to be dispossest of those unvaluable joyes which her affection had in his Society treasured. But their personall absence was ever supplied by other remonstrances, not onely to renue what was already begun, but to prepare way for accomplishment of that, which with joynt consent they desired might be solemnely done. Intercursive Letters were ever passing betwixt them: and that in so quaint and cunning a Character, as interception, though seconded with a nimble construction, could hardly extract ought that might discover what they intended: or apply ought that might occasionally prevent what their grounded affections had resolved. For sometimes, he would write in the person of another Suiter, to free his lines from suspition: sometimes he would feague under the title of that imaginarie Suiter, that he was rejected by her: which to prevent, he would revive those protests of love hee had formerly professed. And to instance these, and display the subtilty of a Lover, peruse this Letter, which under the faigned Name of some dis-esteemed Suiter, hee thus addressed to her.  perusall of my passions, let this be your maxim: that it rests in your affection or rejection to make me happy or unhappy in my state, your Zeale to goodnesse, amongst these many gusts of extreames, assures me, your pious and well-disposed heart cannot but entertaine remorce to a Servant so loyall, as hee holds the intyrest tender of his life, an easy purchase to time, but an easier sacrifice to fate, to purchase your love. Let me joy in enjoying you, and let me be deprived of all joy if in every subject I close not in your content, to make our mutuall joyes more truly absolute. Amidst these, hope and feare doe equally encounter me; it is in your discreet brest to banish the one, by returning assurance of the other: and by checking the latter with a frowne, to give encouragment to the former with a smile. Your yeare of mourning is now expir'd; receive him into your bosome, who will hold you so deare, as your comfort shall never expire. My long neglect of attending you, proceeded from the discouragement I received from you at my last being with you: but J am perswaded that assurance your owne hand hath plighted me, will induce you to recollect your thoughts, and revive those sacred tyes, which are so firmely united, as by death onely to be dissolved. Let but one line redart one small beameling of love, and winged speed shall enliven my desires for those parts, and style me in the fruition of you, Your long trusty, now happy Servant.  How much these plaide, nay pleas'd the imagination of Doriclea , it is not easy to conceive. Smyling with her selfe at the Conceit of Philocles , in seeming to feare what he feared not; and pretending the affection of a Suiter whom he knew not. Nor was Doriclea lesse prompt in addressing her affectionate thoughts to Philocles , but still after his Copy; for either would she make bold with subscribing Mellida's name to her owne Letter: or counterfaiting some other Character, to expresse the intimacy of her desires, and constancy of her vowes to her selectedst Lover. Nor would she inlarge herselfe too much; lest by some Circumstance or other she might discover what her private thoughts would not have disclosed, for the true and unvaluable estimate of her honour. Yet did not her penne drop lesse love for the contractednesse of her line: Each Sillable had his Emphasis , as may appeare by this amongst others, which shee sometimes wrote unto him to solace his pensivenesse.  constant. No line can limit my love; no distance divide my heart. Meane while lodge these lines in thy bosome till I see thee. Cold North, hot South, cleare East, wet West Shall ne're divide me from thy brest; On this then, Dearest, set thy rest, I am the same that J've profest; Meane time, sweet fancy, use thy charme, Till sleepe enfold us arme in arme.  No day past without some memoriall of this kinde. A strong motive to love; re- conveying to the memory, what personall absence might raze forth without revivall. This it was which wrought so strongly on the enlivened spirit of Marke Antonie: as there was nothing that made him so great a stranger to armes, which he naturally affected: nor estranged his affection more from his Octavia , to whom by conjugall love he stood obliged: nor divided him more from the care of securing himselfe, then one line comming from the hand of his Cleopatra . Though her majestick state begot an admiration in her beholders; a strong impression in the wounded hearts of her lovers. Though her eye reteyned a power to command love, and subdue the commandingst Conquerour with a look. All these soveraigniz'd not halfe so much on Antonies affection, as those amorous lines he received from her, writ in Christall, Amber, Amethist, and Ivory. Not a line but contained a loves charme. No modell which ever fancy devis'd, or the imagination stampt; which subtile Cleopatra presented not to make a Commander her Thrall; a Conquerour her Slave. Those secret delights of love which modest eares would scarcely have received; nor shamefast eyes perused, were into his conceipt freely instilled: to decline his affection from those, whom hee ought to have loved best: and to ingage his heart to her, whose embraces hee should have dis-relished most. Thus did she cast forth her lines for lures , to seaze on one of the highest flyers, that ever perch'd Roman stemme: becomming her own witty Secretary, to ensnare the fancy of her deluded Antony . But more modest were the lines of our two Lovers; and farre more vertuous their aimes. Reason became no captive unto sense. Neither did the conceipt of a Nuptiall night so much transport them, as to deprive their apprehension of the end for which honourable rites were first ordained. This, Philocles sufficiently expressed, when at such time as after Doricleas returne home, having no good opportunity to impart his thoughts more freely to her, he commended these lines to paper, which he privately conveyed into her pocket.  to you faithfully expressed. What, though opportunity for the present barre us from conference, our eyes shall witnesse that unfeined love that is betwixt us. And in approvement of it, subscribe under these few lines, but these words, I will be ever your faithfull Consort : And you shall perceive, ere long, that a faire opportunity shall give freedome of enjoyment of our loves. Where we way freely and vertuously enjoy one the other; and with continuall comforts partake the benefit of our lawfull loves to Gods honour. Meane time, write these words under this, my dearest choice , so shall my constant love pronounce me yours without change. The Match is made with joynt consent, Onely subscribe, I am content : Where nought but Death shall e're divide Your dearest consort from his Bride.  Nor need you doubt but Doriclea upon perusall of these lines, was as ready to subscribe , as hee to propose . So loyall were their chaste loves, so constantly united their minds. Yet were they no such Novices in the Schoole of Love; nor so uncapable of those effects which pure love might bring forth: as not to aspire to some higher degree then yet they had attain'd. Yea, even vertuous Doriclea , who never heard any light discourse without a modest blush: nor had given harbour to a wandring thought without a seasonable reproofe, desired nothing more then the accomplishment of their love, so privacy might give leave. For that tender filiall zeale which shee bore to her Parents made her resolves more doubtfull; and time more protractive; then her desires, were she her owne Guardian, could freely give way to. Howsoever, to free her faithfull Philocles of all feare; and to confirme him in that which he did most desire: with as much convenient speed as the opportunity of that time would allot, with a prepared hand and an affectionate heart shee subscribed to whatsoever his vertuous requests had propounded.  What Plots Doriclea devised to partake in private Meetings and Treaties with her Philocles: and how by the jealousie of Euryclea , her Mother, she was prevented.  which they love. Though at times of repast, and some other houres of the day, Doriclea might enjoy the presence of her Philocles , yet through the intercourse of her sundry Suiters, who now like golden showers came daily falling  & distilling into our Dana es Lap: they were barred that freedome of discourse their bequeathed hearts so much affected. Nor could it doe lesse then perplexe the troubled thoughts of Philocles , to see his Doriclea so daily courted; ample promises of high preferment, with other titles of honour, dangerous baits to catch a Woman, proffered: so as, if she were not all the constanter, howsoever she had largely protested, he was verily perswaded her Maritan Castle could not long hold out. Every kisse was a killing to him; and by that, judge how often he might be killed every day! He many times thought of that Poeticall Proverbe:  Lips are Loves-portels, to sly Wooers known, Which once surpriz'd, the Fort is quickly wonne. Yet patient Philocles ! he must say nothing, whatsoever hee think. His eyes must partake in the sight of their wooing dalliance;  & glad he may do so, to prevent the worst. And sometimes these silken Suiters will vouchsafe him that honour to supply a place in their amorous pastimes; as in making Gooselings in the fire, or drawing of gloves , or such like harmelesse toyes, to passe the night away. Nay, sometimes they imploy'd him further, in returning a message to Doriclea ; a task which suited best with his liking, but no doubt would loose much of his spirit in carrying. For to be a second Porter of Bellerophons Letters could not sort with his disposition, who had casten his lot, and found one equally closing with him in affection. But all these servile imployments, as he conceived, were imposed him, purposely to humble him. Albeit, such trials needed little, being one of such temper, as his thoughts were farre above an inferiour Spheare. For as hee beheld nothing in this Theatre of Earth, worthy affecting, but his Doriclea : so hee conceipted so well of his choice, as he rested confident, such an excellent piece could not finde a brest to entertaine a change. And his opinion was truly grounded: for howsoever his Doriclea might seeme out of a desire to give her Parents content, to converse with these jolly Wooers, and to leave them in suspense, lest an absolute rejection of them might procure their distaste; wee have ever made it a constant Maxim, Where the eye is, there the minde is: which might well appeare by the behaviour of this constant Maid: who, though she seemed amorously to converse with these, had her eye ever fixed on her Philocles . But all this was not sufficient to her, unlesse she might enjoy the presence of her Dearest; from whom to be divided, even in private treaties or parliance, was no small affliction. Suppose her then contriving sundry plots to partake in what she did so infinitely desire. Love is ingenious in devising, but many times not so prosperous in succeeding. Private meetings, purposely to relate their affections, with meanes of preventing of what her Parents, for ought that she knew, might be intending; was her aime; further she aspired not: for so pure and undistained were her thoughts, as they hated to mixe themselves with any irregular desire. Now to bring to passe what she sought; many evenings would she pretend some one businesse or other, to stay below behinde her Mother: but so light was her occasion, as her Mother perceived, that it made her more jealous of her excuses. Seeing then these would not do; she made use of a Trap-doore within her Chamber; intending to come downe by it, and so enjoy the benefit of time. But none of these plots would hold; for Euryclea , who by some private intelligence, or what other ill office I know not, receiving notice of her Daughters practise; one night when Doriclea suspecting no harme, was to come downe by the Trap-doore, as she had formerly done, was received below by her Mother instead of her Lover. Which how it perplexed this unfortunate Doriclea , exceeds the art of any Pen to expresse: being not only deprived of that beneficiall opportunity, with an evening treaty, to crowne their fancy; but ingaged to a just censure or opinion of jealousie. Which her Mother had good cause to conceive; seeing what private advertisements had informed, she found so apparently confirmed. Imagine then incensed Euryclea , who prized nothing more then her Daughters honour: nor distasted ought more then those imputations which censure might justly cast upon her, taking up her Daughter in this manner. "What Girle, is your modest seeming come to this? H'as our care, our too much care of your preferment, made you forgetfull of your honour? Have you either so meane an opinion of your selfe; or so weak a conceipt of our love, as to suffer your desires to mount no higher, then to be the affectionate Mistresse of a Schoolemaster? H'as your breeding begot in you a neglect of what you are, or a contempt of that duty which you owe? Be your actions so dark, as they must have the night to shelter them? Must your Fathers Family receive a blemish by your infamy? Is this the hope we treasured in you, the comfort we expected from you? Little, did either your Father or I imagine what you meant by that quaint discourse you occasionally vented at the Table; in talking of that immodest love betwixt a wanton Poet and Augustus Daughter. It seemes you delivered that Argument only to try us, whether we stood affected to such a profession, on which you had pitcht your wilde affection. Simple Girle! conceive remorse in time; do not undoe your Fortunes; there is none yet that can (such is my too indulgent hope in you) justly traduce you; unlesse the eyes of this Family. Redeeme their opinion; be more tender of your reputation. There is no portion proportionably comparable to the gage of honour: which perish'd, you are lost for ever. No treasure so precious as a continent soule; nothing more to be lov'd, and nothing harder to be redeem'd, being once lost. "It will grieve mee, to heare your selfe griev'd with the relation of an ill report. You may bee confident I shall take small pleasure in the discovery of this nightwork. Well Girle; those relenting teares promise amendment: how soone is a Mothers anger appeased? I shall be ready to salve all, so I finde a desire in you to amend all. I will not make your Father, your too passionate Father acquainted with it; neither will I shew in publique any displeasing countenance towards your too presumptuous Philocles . All shall be carried with that equall and faire temper, as you shall have cause to say, that never indulgent Mother did more render her Daughters honour: nor could use more connivence, where she found the least hope of repentance. Retire then with all privacy into your Chamber; I shall charme your Maide that shee discover nothing. Only let this be a warning unto you henceforth, never to expose your honour so freely, as to give occasion to the family to speak lightly of you. For as honest repute is the highest prize; so it merits of it selfe such approved praise: as were your actions never so private, the eye of piety would survey them and crowne them. Neither can any device finde such a shroud or shelter for vice, as the piercing eye of fame will not discover it, and display the Actors when they least dreame of it. Be then what you have so long professed, vertuous; you cannot improve the Family from whence you came, better: nor conferre on your maiden yeares more true honour. This if you observe, it will give us cause to blesse you, and second the continuance of our care, in providing a Match for you that may equall your birth and fortunes: yea, and to close all in one, confirme the opinion of your own fame, by leaving to your posterity a president of your surviving goodnesse." With these words, seeing her Daughter lodged in her Chamber, she departed: leaving poore disappointed Doriclea to summe up her discontents, and to ask her Pillow counsell in cases of such extremity, what were best to be done. Whom now you may imagine turning and tossing in her bed, without taking any rest: desiring rather to be deprived of what refresheth and nourisheth Nature most, then to be rest of so sweet an opportunity of enjoying his presence, whom she prized best.  For though she sought her Parents minds to please, Her highest thoughts were fixt on Philocles . But the day must now supply the night, with our Doriclea : by contenting her selfe with the sight of him, in the presence of her Parents, whom she in private conference so much desired to enjoy. Their distance must admit no conference: all their language now must be delivered by the eye: readie no doubt to expresse by a look, how much their united hearts stood ingaged to love. Those Hesperian Daughters never kept their golden fruit with more vigilancy, then restrained Doriclea was by her Mothers jealousie. So as, though her unfeined love devised many plots to possesse her of that which she so much desired, yet by her Mothers intelligence was she ever prevented. Howbeit, she ever bore faire with Philocles : never so much as discovering any discontent towards his person: nor at any time reproving him for his presumption; in aspiring so high as the procurement of her Daughters affection. Albeit, one day taking him aside, she told him; that she conceived it to be a far better course for him, to returne to his former Academick life: and that he lost but his time in the Countrey: especially, seeing for the present they had no imployments for him, that might any way improve him, nor answer those hopes he expected, nor parts deserved: yet if occasion should afterwards fall forth, that it lay in their way to advance him: hee should not faile in obtaining the best meanes that their assistance or furtherance could possibly procure him. But little wrought these with Philocles : he preferred one Mistresse before nine Muses. His highest of humane Philosophy rested in the affection and contemplation of her on whom he had fixed his fancy. Neverthelesse, he expressed himselfe thankfull for so unwelcome a tender: pretending ever that he expected daily to receive notice when some place might fall, and then he would neglect no more time but addresse his course that way; which hee hop'd e're long would offer it selfe in such ample manner and measure, as might highly conduce to the improvement both of his credit and profit. Meane time, hee hoped, his demeanure should not be such, as might make any place where he sojourned for the time, weary of him. And that he would choose rather to undergo the poorest life, then be confined to that place, where his carriage might not merit love. But little did these reasons satisfie jealous Euryclea ; who laboured to prevent the worst, by dividing Philocles from her presence whom she tender'd best. To whom we must now returne, and see what extreames she is brought to; who in this her languishing plight intimates her griefes; and in a secret repose, to give more vent to passion, imparts her discontents in this private pensive relation.  The Passions of Doriclea : and how shee conversed with her owne thoughts in the effecting of her love: inveying against such ungrounded fancies, who measure affection by strength of allyance, portion, or any other respect, then the pure effects of love.  lament more the inequality of his fortunes, which made him unworthy the embraces of his endeared Mistresse, in the opinion of her Parents: then this division from him whom she so entirely lov'd, troubled the dis-passionate minde of Doriclea . Her unsociable disposition now discover'd her affection. Dark-shady Launes agreed best with her humour, where in some private Spinet, conversing with her own thoughts, she used to discourse of the effects of her love, in this manner. "How far art thou divided from thy selfe Doriclea ? Are all passages now stopt up, of partaking his society to whom I have ingag'd my heart? Can Children esteeme this for tender love, which deprives them their sight whom they only love? Alas! do they hold it a matter of such indifferency, to dispense with fancy? Admit I have made choice of him for my dearest Lover, whom my Parents provided for my Schoolemaster, must this deserve such strict censure, as to divide me from the presence of my Tutor? This were to make a Truant of a Scholer. Must none marry but with their equals? None rich, match with poore fortunes? What will become then of poore vertue? She may live a single life, and never partake in the society of love. Silken vice, be it never so deformed, must be honoured: she cannot want preferment, nor choice of Suiters, nor variety of Admirers, because wealth h'as advanc'd her above the rank of inferiours. Our Wooers now adayes must be rich, or our Parents will entertaine them with a frowne. Meane time, what discontent attends such hopelesse marriages, where fortunes make up the match, while their affections never meet? Does Loves essence consist in outward substance? Was it this that made Leander crosse Hellespont, and intombe his dying hopes in the waves? Was it this that moved love-seazed Orpheus to encounter all hazards for his captiv'd Eurydice ? Was it this which expos'd long-divorced Ithacus to all adventures for his constant Penelope ? Was it this which ingaged trusty Telamon to such perils for his Hesione? O no! It was true love which drew them to those extreames. And yet did these rarely ground their affections upon equality of descents or fortunes. Their choice was better planted, and therefore continued longer. For alas, what will honour do to a discontented heart? She that is so matched receives small joy from the Title of a Lady, when this naked style h'as bestow'd her on One she cannot fancy. Ungrounded are these affections, and so weakly to be weighed, as I shall ever choose to inveigh against them, who hold it sufficient glory to enjoy precedency: meane time, discontent becomes their Chamberlaine: seeing, neither style nor estate can reconcile an enforced love to a loathed bed. O consider you this, reverend Parents, who enjoyne your Children to live where they cannot love! "This it is, beleeve it, which makes modest mindes too often transgresse, by conforting with unlawfull loves, and mixing with those, whom sensuall affection h'as made choice of in exchange. Enforced loves beget straying eyes. They finde nothing at home worth affecting, which makes them with Dinah to go abroad, and with too prepared a boldnesse to impaune their honour. O retract then your too severe commands, who enjoyne your Children such Tasks, as affection cannot beare, nor freedome of minde embrace, without a resolved distaste! It is better seasonably to forgoe what we cannot like; then seemingly to approve what we cannot effect, and then repent too late. For my resolves, I hope, they shall never close in any other period then this: That it shall be my constant scorne, to measure affection by strength of allyance , which to divided hearts can afford small assistance; or portion , which without a love-inducing proportion, begets the enjoyer nought but affliction; nor any other respect , be it never so gracious or specious to the eye; but that only which conveyes pure and effectuall love to the heart. Never let Parents think that any other affection can prosper: seeing it is not grounded on that foundation, which tenders the minde true solace and contentment. Albeit, such who make their choice by the eye, receive only direction by sense; and such a love neither deserves approvement, nor to offer it selfe to others for a president. But where reason and affection meet, there such a sweet union and communion of mindes close in the enjoyment of one the other, as nothing can dissolve that individuall tye save only the discharge of that debt we owe to Nature. Yea, but will provident Parents say, there is more required in solemnizing a marriage, then only bare love. It is true; yet where love is truly grounded, it will ever finde a state competent to the minde, or a minde competent to the state. It is impure love that proves poore. Affection cannot want: a very little sufficeth where love reigneth. Whereas greatest meanes prove meane fortunes, where affectionate mindes are wanting to mannage those fortunes. O let mee then enjoy my choice, and it is not in the world that shall make me desire to change. Rich am I above comparison, enjoying the freedome of my affection. Miserably poore above relation, being deprived of loves fruition. Either then give me liberty to live where I love; and to become seaz'd where I have ingag'd mine heart: or let me bee restrain'd for ever, rather then so espous'd where I needs must hate. O my dearest Parents! reflect upon your owne condition, when your unriper yeares gave first motives to your glowing thoughts of affection. Did you only value meanes? Was portion the only lure? Could nothing work so strongly on fancy, as fortune or outward ability? Yes, yes; more purely were your undefiled loves grounded, and more successively graced, then with the refuse of Earthy Oare to be only guilded. Look then down upon us; we are of the same mould; if our temper were impurer, we should lesse deserve the priviledge of your favour. Since we resemble you in our desires, second what we desire, and accompt of us, as you shall value the estimate of our deserts. "Howsoever Doriclea , be it thy assay to reteine the good opinion thou hast purchas'd from thy Philocles ; his constancie h'as deserv'd thee; his demeriting parts every way equall with those fortunes thy friends may conferre on thee. Meane time, endure the aversenesse of thy Parents with patience, so may the effect crowne thy hope, and minister thee seasonable reliefe, when all visible meanes denie helpe." Thus conversed Doriclea with her own thoughts; thus with much privacie discovered she her owne passions. Resolved to endure whatsoever fate or fortune might inflict, rather then forgoe the choice of her Philocles , whom shee before all others did affect. But how much shee became deprived of all meanes to expresse the love shee professed, and which remained so constantly fixed, as nothing but death could divide it, the Chapter ensuing will declare: where you shall finde nothing so constant an attendant to love as care: nor no distemper, when brought to extreames, more desperate of cure.  How Doriclea , being deprived all meanes of imparting the constancy of her zeale to Philocles: having neither the benefit of Inke nor Paper, to discover her loyall intimate thoughts to her faithfull Lover; shee supplyed that want with her needle, sowing her minde in Letters of gold, and returning them in the border of a handkerchiefe.  amorous Scholer: as, though she prevented all means of familiar conference or treaty one with the other, yet she still doubted the worst: wherefore finding her Daughter one Evening privately in her Chamber writing, and perceiving the character by the first blush, and too hasty subscription of her Letter: to Doricleas small comfort, she thus encounter'd her. "What, Girle, will this never be left? Will your Mothers instructions receive no place? Is there none for you to love, but whom we dislike? Trust me, Daughter, this will neither redound to your comfort nor credit? I pray you, what hopes may you look for at his hands? Will his unprocured revenews maintaine you? Or his Philosophy feed you? Or the leane hopes of some fat Advousion hereafter sustaine you? Las, do you not see how a Scholer is but made an instrument of necessity: and after he h'as done his work, like an old decaied Servingman to be discarded; or if he stay, to be fed with reversions; or take his repast without feare of a surfet, at a Philosophers dinner? Prevent then this foolish love: which, left you should hereafter signifie by the least line, I shall remove all occasion: for Pen and Paper you shall have none to expresse your inconsiderate affection: the period whereof may bring you to a too untimely affliction. Nay more; assure your selfe, that the next time wherein I shall observe the least semblance of your unseasoned love, I shall divide you beyond the distance or limit of any line. No pretended excuse shall satisfie me, to induce me to suffer him to sojourne any longer within our gates. Resolve then what you meane to doe; fixe not your distemper'd fancy on him whom you cannot have. Submit your affection in all obedience to our choice. In vaine it is to oppose us, seeing you labour to intercede for that which you can never receive from us. I have hitherto shrouded your too forward fancy: and casten such a vaile before the eyes of the Family, as no dishonour yet h'as touched you. Compassionate my care, and requite it with a constant desire, to effect what we most affect: by setting your rest on such a choice, as may, when God shall send you one, support your charge." Thus was poore Doriclea deprived all meanes of imparting the constancie of her zeale to Philocles . No treaty could she partake with him. No line of love could she addresse to him. Eyes only were those Messengers of love which so redarted affection, as the Optick part return'd a legible Lecture of a constant assurance one to the other. Yet would not this suffice loyall Doriclea ; now must she skrue her invention to the highest Pin, and by some other meanes supply the expression of her Pen. Which the pregnancy of loves art quickly performes. For having neither the benefit of Ink nor Paper, to discover her loyall-intimate thoughis to her faithfull Lover, she contrives an other way to expresse what she did so unfeignedly professe: and in so modest and composed a manner, as the subtilest part of jealousie could not unrivet the secrecie of such a Letter. Her Plot is then to supplie that want with her Needle, sowing her minde in Letters of Gold, and returning them in a curious border of needle work, so neatly and artificially shadowed, as it was not in the power of art nor strength of fancie to discover it. And amongst other curious devices which loves invention composed, she addressed this, in that manner we have expressed.  To manifest my love to thee; While every stitch shall sting my heart Till it take harbour where thou art; Where landing, may it dye a shore If e're we live divided more. What strong and impressive memorials these and such as these were to our constant Philocles ; I leave to your judgements, experienc'd Lovers, who have suffer'd under the malevolent quality of such a Planet: where restrained of all oportunity, your Mistresses invention found way by some ingenious device or other after this manner, to discover the constancy of their affections. Truth is, as there is no passion which sooner works distraction then a depriving or distancing of us from the object of our affection: so is there no such motive to the conceipt, as this conflict of love. How witty it is in contriving? How various in those numerous delights which the height of that fancy is ever working? No difficulty, but love will encounter it; no extremity, but she can digest it. There is no action meriting honour, that can be atchieved without labour. Infinite were those tasks, and those full of jeopardie, which were imposed on Alcydes , before he could be seazed on his tyrannizing Omphale . Nor were the affections of loyall Mistresses of lesse pursuit in their reall expressions to their Servants. What vast unfrequented deserts, unknowne to any other inhabitants but wilde Beasts, have their tender virgin-feet traced, to finde out those whom they loved? What strange disguises have they taken; what eminent fortunes have they forsaken; what honours rejected; what powerfull friends disclaimed; to enjoy one only friend, whom they so highly preferred, as by their personall seazure they held themselves sufficiently enriched? Instances we might here bring forth such store, as might make up a story of themselves with out any other intervening discourse. But omitting others both forraine and moderne, in reflecting upon our constant Doriclea , we shall finde such noble constancy and masculine spirit in her, as every Act shall present a sufficient approvement; and publish her by the impartiall verdict of time, worthy that applause which the relation of that age has given her. For as there was none which ever shewed more constancy to those they lov'd; so was there never any who with a more composed temper encounter'd those affronts which either friends or fortunes cast upon her. Bearing all occurrents with so sweet and pleasing a smile, as even her very profest enemies (being, I must confesse very few, though vertue must ever have some) suffered with her, turning their passion into compassion, the heat of their fury into a relenting admiration of her fancy: which became so equally tempered, as no distaste could alter it: being no lesse ready to enter the List to enjoy her love, then to obtaine the conquest of enjoying his love, in whose bosome she desired only to live. Thus was our Doriclea resolved to suffer, and to joy in her suffering, that she might enjoy him; to whose affection as her thoughts were devoted, so no houre passed, wherein she was not contriving by one meanes or other, for their honest loves to be clothed and closed with honour.  Philocles restraint, with those passionate effects which their enforced absence one from the other produc'd. He findes love ever most violent, when furthest divided from his Object: yet amidst these disgusts, he adviseth her to patience in his restraint. Confirming himselfe so individually hers, as nothing may abridge the accomplishment of their desires, but Death.  confident to prevaile, so he remained ever jealous of Eurycleas affection to him. Nor could that smooth carriage which she pretended, free him from suspicious thoughts. For in his private retire, when divided from the eyes of men, would he many times recollect himselfe, and argue the promising effects of this amorous task: as if he were made sole Moderator of his own affections. Sometimes would hee object to himselfe those inevitable perils, whereto he ingaged his hopes and fortunes, by putting himselfe on an assay of such difficulty: and which probably might encounter with such diversity of rubbs: as his weak meanes would prove insufficient to remove them, and without much patience, the poore mans supportance, too heavie to beare them. Othertimes, he would be so farre from objecting these fears or encounters of friends as he stood irrevokeably addressed to go on with what he had begun. Nothing could divert him; affection had so steeled him; and a meditation of the worst that might fall had so prepared him; as come what could come, he was resolved to slight all difficulties, esteeming the conquest more glorious, by how much the combat seemed more dangerous. Yet againe would he draw back a little and call to minde those passages of her Mother Euryclea in labouring to disswade him fro a Countrey life, and advising him to returne to his former Academick condition. Surely, quoth he, this motion aimed at something. It was not our of a desire of my proficiency in learning, but to divide me from the Subject of loving. She saw something which she liked not, or such uselesse perswasions had never been delivered. Well, I know not, what to conclude upon such suspicious premises: but sure I am, that a poysonous Snake may lye hid under the sweetest hearbes. Those waters are not from perill freest, which run the smoothest. And too forward a Spring is ever nipt the soonest. Though the Fish Sepia bewray her subtile encounter by a black colour, which she casteth out to cover her: others can go lesse disguised, and consequently lesse suspected, yet more dangerous are these, because they delude most, when they are least feared; surprize soonest, when we are least prepared. Neither were these diversely perplexed resolves of his, without cause, for whether by some ill offices done him, or by some Letters intercepted which came from him, or some other markes or tokens of love observed betwixt them, her incensed Parents upon complaint made how Philocles had laboured to inveagle their Daughter, and against the lawes of the Kingdome, sought privately to convey her, he became restrained: which was so farre from amating his spirit, as he applyed all these extreames as soveraigne Cordials: fearing little, but as it was his hard fortune to suffer much for her: so her noble disposition would not be slow in returning a faire requitall, to recompence those many occurrences which he encounter'd for her. Yet in this restraint, would he many times, and that not without a strong conflict, break out in the discovery of those passionate effects, which their enforced absence one from the other produc'd. "O, where shall I live, said he, being deprived of her presence whom I only love? O how sweet were this restraint unto me, were I not restrained from her whose presence would give me liberty? How easie are the fetters of love? How unwelcome that liberty which divides us from those we love? Yet was my former freedome in this more gratefull to me than this restraint: in that I was admitted to enjoy the sight of her, from whom I am estranged by restraint. Neither can this dis-passionate censure of her incensed Parents in procuring my commitment, work halfe so effectually upon mine extasied thoughts; as the griefe I conceive for my dearest Doriclea : who, no doubt, upon the hearing of these newes of my restraint, will become so perplexed, as the conceit of her discontent afflicts me more, then whatsoever her angry Parents may inflict. For time may appease their fury, by reflecting on themselves, and weighing the costancy of our united fancy: but should my present thraldome beget her distemper, my hopes were lost and perished for ever. And what may I expect lesse from one so truly loyall! No doubt, but she h'as found as well as my selfe the reall proofe of that experiment. Love is ever most violent, when farthest divided fro his object. So long as we have liberty to enjoy in seeing, what we may not more fully partake by injoying, yet our eyes afford us some solace, to allay those extreames of love with the fruition of their presence. But when deprived of that benefit; and to supply the comfort of such an incomparable Object, we must make Grates and Spider-woven wals our pensive Consorts, would not imagination hold it above humane suffering? No, no; while we live, we are made to be Actors of passionate Scenes on this Theatre of love." "Should all on Earth enjoy what they desire, Earth would become the period of their desires: further, poore mortals would not looke, should they enjoy whatsoever they like. Resolve then Philocles , patiently to beare, what thy impatience cannot cure. And amidst these disgusts, advise her to patience in this thy restraint; that her anguish give not fresh fuell to thy discontent. Be it thy care, that she suffer not in thy cure. One is enough to perish, and too many by one; could misery fix on a lesser Subject then one." Setting then Pen to Paper, and accommodated by a convenient Messenger, in this manner he imparts his minde unto her.  Mine heart lives there, though I be here confin'd; "Cloath that is dy'd in graine can nere be stain'd," Nor can occurrents shake a constant minde. Let me in thee but such a freedome finde; And then let Fates, Friends, Fortunes, all repine, I shall Doriclea's be, Doriclea mine.  Thus confirming himselfe so individually hers, (though divided from her, by meanes of hers) as nothing may abridge the accomplishment of their desires, but death: with a cheerfull brow he dissembles with griefe: imploying these tedious houres of his restraint in reading the stories of discontented Lovers. Where he found some in the way of enjoying of what they most affected, and suddenly Ixion -like deceived with a Cloud. Others as deeply plunged in despaire of injoying what they loved, and these above expectance found their desires crowned, where their hopes were nearely expired. And of these he made use as occasion serv'd: sometimes to humble his hopes, lest they should mount or aspire above themselves. Againe, were his hopes depressed; with other instances he found them raised:  & these were the most usuall consorts wherewith he conversed, in those retyred walkes whereto he was confined. But how heavily his constant Doriclea took his restraint, it is not easie to expresse: being not only deprived of his presence, the highest benefit which was admitted her: but equally suffering with him, conceiving how those extremities which he now suffered, were inflicted on him by her inraged Parents for the love which he bare her. These wrought strange effects in her passionate thoughts. Labouring sometimes by meanes of Friends, other sometimes by private policies, his freedome from durance: but the issue never seconded her desires: so as, she resolv'd to impose that upon her selfe freely, what her Philocles was enforced to suffer of necessity. But from these extreames we must now descend to other occurrents: and leave these two divided Lovers, to the relation of their own griefes, with this constant resolve; that nothing may divorce their loves, but their graves.  Doriclea understands by an aged Hermit of Mardanes practise: how he intends to enjoy her by indirect meanes: And how the Spels of Spurcina , the Inchantresse with whom Mardanes contracted were ever frustrated, by the devout morning exercise of Doriclea , signing her selfe every morning in her going abroad with the signe of the Crosse; a soveraigne receipt against Spurcina's Charm.  rejection, we shall easily gather by this story which hapned in this manner. This contemptible worldling having sought by all meanes to enjoy his Mistresse; who made the object of her thoughts of farre ampler extent then riches; but all in vaine: for besides their inequality of yeares, their disparity of disposition would ever run discord, and disrelish nothing more then union: to shew the unworthinesse of his debaucht mind every way, what his faire proffers could not procure, he meanes by indirect wayes to effect. Which by the notice of an aged Hermit became happily discovered. Doriclea , now with in her voluntary retire, used to converse with very few: only sometimes it was her custome to repaire to a pleasant soveraigne Spring, to bathe her selfe according to the season of the yeare: neare which there lived an old religious Hermit: a man of a strict and rigid life. To this devout man, had Doriclea often resorted, and with him conversed: from whom she had received much comfort, as she her selfe confessed. So as, comming one day occasionally to him, he imparted his minde fully and freely to her; which fell forth happily for her, as you shall heare hereafter. "Daughter, quoth he, you are now in the prime of your youth;    [   The Hermits Speech to Doriclea .   ] incline then your eare to one who h'as now attain'd ripenesse of age. I have beene young as you are, and no doubt but addicted to like youthfull vanities as others were. All which my aged sorrow must now rinse with teares. But let me tel you, of all those conflicts which I observed to be hottest, I founde none more violent then the moderation of fancy. This was a Subject fit for youth: for other affections, they did not so much as attempt, much lesse taint so faire a feature. Nay, so wilde is fancy, that unlesse it be timely curbed, it incurres that infirmity which cannot be cured: and unlesse seasonably checked, it makes choice of those which deserve most to be rejected. This, I shall little need, Daughter, to apply to you: for your modesty promiseth farre more discretion in fancy. Yet I must tell you, I heare what I abhorre to relate." Wherewith abruptly breaking off, he demanded of her whether she knew not one Mardanes? Very well, answer'd she; he was pleased sometimes to be my Suiter. It is true, said the Hermit, and he intends ere long to be your enjoyer. Mine, quoth she! "Nay be patient, said the Hermit. I must tell you, he h'as ingaged himselfe in a desperate course to enjoy you. Your repulse barr'd him of his aimes; now his practise is to enjoy you by indirect meanes." My Grave shall first receive me, answer'd Doriclea . "Nay, this is the violent straine of a Woman, said the Hermit; you will rather dye in the expression of a passion, then incline to any receipt to cure that passion. Pray you heare me. This evill Man, whom you so slighted, h'as lately contracted with an hatefull hideous Hag, to practise on your person, by receiving something from you, that may indirectly procure him your affection. No longer since then yesterday, was it my fortune to be gathering Simples near Penell Hils ;    [   In Mapalia, circa oras Penellicollis sita, teterrim ae illius regionis venifices convenerunt, ubi quo iturae, quid perpetraturae, statuerunt.  ] near which place to a private Graunge had resorted sundry persons, and some of these of seeming quality, but all of them miserably exposed to that hatefull profession. Where each discovered unto other whither they were to go, and what feats they were to do. Monstrous were their practises: most of them aiming at blood: and meerely for revenge without hope of benefit to themselves. Others, though not so cruell, yet no lesse unjust in their attempts; were to practise plots and projects of love, which in short time should fall into such tragicall hate, as nothing should compose the quarrell, but the Actors life. Amongst which I heard one, whom the rest of that miserable Meniey, as I remember, called Spurcina ; an ougly deformed Gamar she was: and she disclosed what she intended to do, being what she was perswaded to by one Mardanes ; which was, that she should repaire daily to your Fathers house, and by some meanes or other, as by practising on something you might weare, or some money you might bestow, to procure him your love. And this she resolved to put in present execution. And this must you prevent by serious devotion. Let not the morning aire breath on you, nor the rising Sunne shine upon you, before that victorious signe of the Crosse hath arm'd you. Such receipts will frustrate these deceipts: they cannot surprize you, so devotion accompanie you. This armour will shield your honour: and make that Inchantresse faile in her fruitlesse labour. I have now told you what you are to do: thank your selfe if you be deluded: seeing such meanes are proposed to you, to prevent it. Meane time, deare Daughter, my blessing rest upon you, as my prayers shall be for you, my entirest wishes with you. Desiring, that you may finde such a choice as their vertues may cheere you; to which happy choice I commend you." Thus after a reverend salute, and humble adieu by Doriclea to this ancient Hermit; they both retired, but severall wayes. He to his Cell, she to her selfe: where imagine her, upon a due and serious discussion of every particular, touching the strange relation of that reverend Father, unloading her troubled brest, full of perplexed passions, after this manner. "Unhappie Doriclea ! is thy fortune such, as thou must not only be divided from those thou lovest, but by indirect meanes coopled to those thou loathest? What have I done, that I should thus incense those Superiour powers against me? Have I at any time dishonoured their temples: or cloathed my vices with pretended vertues? Have I violated my faith: or where I professed love, proved false? Have I laboured to delude a simple lover: or gloried in the conquest of my inferiour? Have I not perform'd those sacred vowes which piety enjoyn'd me: or neglected that office which charitie exacted of me? Were my professions of love directed for lucre, wanton dalliance, or pursuit of honour: or have I fashion'd my habit to the fancy of the time, to please mine own humour? Did I ever cast out any light lures to catch a cock-brain'd lover: or exprest my selfe to the deservingst Suiter, too liberall of mine honour? Have I made the publique street my Gallery: or desir'd unlawfull looks to seaze on my beauty? H'as my example given others liberty of offending: or afforded least hope to a light wandring eye of purchasing? Have I accompanied any presence with disdaine: or requited any pious office with neglect? Did I ever wish any ones hurt: or requite true love with undeserved hate? Yes, yes, Doriclea , herein hast thou offended. Hadst thou lov'd Mardanes , he had never betaken himselfe to unjust practises. And must I either then love where I cannot affect, or make those I reject, practise what humanity would detest? Injurious Mardanes ! Hadst thou none to exercise thy spels nor inchantments on, but such an one who is not her own? This is impiety above president. What were it to enjoy, where thou canst never partake any joy: or inforce her thine, whom Magick incantation, no sincere affection h'as confirmed thine? And this were thy case, Mardanes , in enjoying me. It is no sorcery can beget true fancy. Where indirect meanes procure love, tragick events produce hate. Desist then, unhappie man, from these assaults, which shall redound to thy shame, and cloathe thee with infamy in succeeding times. Those hellish consorts, with whom thou conversest, nay, miserably contractest, are soone discomfited, when a more commanding Power shall countermand it. Pittifull practises! where should the innocent'st soule finde succour; or a succourlesse Maide harbour, should these receive effect to the desire of their Author? So limited then is their power, as they can practise nothing that is impure, upon a soule divinely pure. Practise then, Mardanes , what thou canst; thou shalt never enjoy what thou wouldest. I am better fortifi'd then to be so surprized: stronger fenced then so foiled. Nor shall I cease to render thankes to him by whom I am, and by whom I am so well prepared: next under him to that devout man, by whom I am so well informed. Nor need I feare to be subdued, being so supported: nor relinquished, being so supplyed." Nor were her resolves with lesse constancie seconded. Early and late offer'd she up the sacrifice of her Prayers. Constant was she in her care; to prevent all insuing harme. Those usefull directions which she received from that old Hermit, she freshly reteined. Which so farre prevailed, as by her devout morning Exercise (being the season which the Inchantresse most commonly used, ever hoping to take her unprovided) those odious fruitlesse Spels became ever frustrated. All which, Spurcina the Spell-woman afterwards confessed: when after her conviction for offences of more high and hainous quality, she publiquely attested: that though by the procurement of Mardanes she had sought early and late to practise upon something received from her: yet could she never effect her own desires, though she had matter enough to work on, because Doriclea signed her selfe every morning in her going abroad with the signe of the Crosse: which that ancient Hermit, whose name the Sorceresse could not endure to heare, had prescribed for a soveraigne receipt against her Charme. Thus lived Doriclea every way assailed and assaulted; but never vanquished nor discouraged. Farre more did she feare the welfare of her deare restrained Philocles : then the subtilty of these inchantments. His liberty she preferred before her own safety. Yet so farre was she from procuring what she so intirely desired: as the continued jealousie of her Parents declined her hopes from ever effecting what she so much labour'd. For to intercede her selfe for his liberty, she durst not; lest it should increase their suspition: and to intrust any other in that suit, she had found it so fruitlesse, as it made her despaire of all successe. To a private retired walke inclosed with sweet breath'd Sycomours, twice a day she usually repaired: where divided from the noise of the world, she would passionately converse with her own thoughts, and propose sundry devices for the freedome of her Philocles . Wherewith her fancy became so infinitely pleased: that though none of these took effect, yet it contented her to imagine how she might by such meanes procure his liberty: whereof he remain'd deprived for his loyalty. And in this retired shade, or Elysian Grove: for Art and Nature had exprest their distinct workmanships in it; sometimes should she chance to finde the Witch Spurcina , which confirmed what the Hermit had affirmed: but being demanded by Doriclea , what occasion she had there: her excuses would appeare no lesse lame than her selfe. Sometimes pretending that shee came thither to gather some Hearbes or Sallets: or else perceiving Doriclea to be walking there, she came to beg some reliefe at her charitable hands. But neither of these was her errand; but to practise what she intended, by some linnen or wollen that might fall from her: which, though she no lesse maliciously then opportunately received, and by them practised, yet were her Spels ever defeated, her Charmes frustrated by the incessancy of her devotion, as hath been formerly related.  Thus Love's exposed to a twofold harme, A Parents fury, and a Witches Charme: The first she cures by giving way to time; The last she frustrates with an Holy Signe. 1  How Doriclea practised with Mellida her Maide for her escape: How she sought to delude her Mother: Her prevention: and how Androgeus her Father became inraged, upon the discovery of her affection.  restrained Philocles : but her Parents jealousie of the one side, and the distance of miles which divided him from her on the other side, so disheartned her hopes, as what she one houre intended, the next houre she reversed. But yet this would not so content her: love cannot be so satisfied. She findes her selfe divided from her selfe, so long as she becomes removed from her Philocles . On then she must, though all difficulties shold oppose her: friends disswade her: no hope of obtaining her purpose, encourage her. And now to expedite this Assay, she findes none fitter to commend her practise to then her Maide Mellida . A witty Wench, who knew well enough where her Mistresse shooe pinch'd her: which if the Last of her invention could ease, she held it one of the best services that ever she could do her. And to her did Doriclea communicate her thoughts and counsels in this manner. "O Mellida , thou knowest, and I blush that thou knowest, how my affection h'as beene long time fixed on Philocles ; and now thou seest, how he, on whom I have set my rest, is divided from me. O advise me then how I may enjoy his presence, whose absence is to me death. Alas, thou seest what discontents attend my unhappy state, while I am here by jealous eyes prevented, from enjoying what before all other things I have preferred. Deluded eyes may imagine that I have the world at will; because I am mine own Mistresse: and want in nothing that may outwardly solace me. But little know these, how in enjoying what I have, it augments my discontent being deprived of that which I once had, but now have not. Addresse then the best advice thou hast; to afford me some comfort amidst these extreames. Without hope the heart would burst. Hope I reteine, but in small measure, unlesse from thee Mellida , I receive succour. For I am barr'd all opportunity; watchfull eyes being ever set over me: which continually labour my prevention, for repairing to him who is the sole object of my affection Commiserate then my case, good Mellida , and devise some meanes or other for me to enjoy his sight, without which I am lost for ever." Lost for ever answered Mellida! God forbid Mistresse, that I should suffer that, if it be in my power to prevent. I had thought dying for love had been a thing quite out of request, in these dayes. But since our too kinde hearts are made of such soft temper, some Salve must be provided either to harden them, and so make them lesse sensible: or procure the means to bring them to enjoy what they so much desire, and so make their sufferings more curable. Thou examines and searchest the ground of my griefe, and understandest the meanes how thou maist make the unhappiest Woman alive infinitely happy. Prepare then by applying, what thou perceivest may soonest cure: there is no task so difficult which I shall not with a free embrace susteine, so I may but partake what I so incomparably desire. You do well, answered Mellida , thus to arme your selfe against all difficulties: but surely you shall little need to stand in any great feare of what I shall enjoyne you. I know little yet what may in time befall my selfe: and then I must submit my selfe to others advice, as you now vouchsafe to do to mine. For indeed the very wisest in businesse of this nature, are ever found the greatest fooles when they come to advise themselves. But Mistresse, you have ever heard, how Love delights in nothing more then in playing the dissembler. Ante-Masks are ever usher'd in by Whifflers. And this part must you act, or I know not what way else to supply you. Love is personated with most grace, when it entertaines a disguise. And this habit must you undertake: and now when I think of it, you may furnish your selfe with a convenient disguise; you know Proclus our Page, put upon you his Suit; I shall procure you it, when he is asleepe. With which you may privately and without suspicion convey your selfe. And if your Mother inquire of you, I shall acquaint her, that you are at rest: and so prevent all present discovery for one night: meane time, by the benefit of silent night, and the conduct of your constant friend Alc aeus , you may in time come where you would be: while I am left to the mercy of the winds. For what may I answer for my selfe when you are gone? Well, I will hazard a service for your content and solace: I shall hold my selfe happy in my endeavour, so you in this assay do but prosper. Doriclea needed no quickner to this motion. Winged are her desires to second Mellidas advice. And having now fitted her selfe with Proclus Suit, towards Alc aeus her conducter she hastens her course. Who exprest himselfe very readie to do her any friendly office; becomming her Guide, in directing and accompanying her to her dearest Friend. But as ill successe often attends best designes, these two were unhappily stayed by the Watch, upon this occasion. A Gentlewomans Daughter of good quality and great fortunes that very night chanced to be stolne away: upon which occasion, pursuit was made: and especiall direction given, that if any person should suspiciously or unseasonably passe by the Watch, they should be stay'd and examined. And such was the fate of unfortunate Doriclea ; who surprized when least feared, must of necessiity with her Conducter, remaine under the Constables hands till the next morning: for truth was, the Officer (by what accident I know not, but you may partly imagine) was held altogether unfit that night to examine them, which of all others, hapned the worst for her advantage. For the very next morning betimes were all places set for staying of Doriclea , by expresse directions from her Parents. So as being found upon search, the poore amorous Girle was stript of her Pages habit, and re-attyr'd in her own Neither could Alc aeus , without much meanes and mediation of friends, procure his peace. You may suppose with what discontent our disappointed Doriclea returned to her tedious lodging: sorrow was her best melodie; and her choisest musick an incessant Lachrym ae . For though her restraint was before sufficient; and her Mothers eyes too too vigilant: yet now were their cares and feares more numerous than before, which beget far more intention to this charge then before. Many times would she relate her grounds of discomfort to her Mellida ; who, poore Wench, became so discouraged by the sinister successe of her Plot: as the best reply she could now shape to her unhappy Mistresse; was either silence: or, "good Mistris be content, there is no hope to escape. Learne to forget him, seeing you must not enjoy him." But this wrought no effect upon her affectionate desires. One assay she holds not sufficient enough to expresse her love to him, whom she esteemes so deare. One night therefore, being impatient of her disconsolate restraint, she practiseth with an aged Woman, who was her Mothers henwife: to change apparell with her, hoping to receive better successe under that disguise, then her late Pages habit. But so well was this old Woman charm'd by her Mother, as she became Doricleas discoverer: so as, her Mother meeting her, and pulling off her Muffler, this device received no better speed then the former. Thus was Doriclea ever practising, but never prospering. Nor was her fancy so lightly fixed, as to give over upon receit of two foiles. As she was constantly planted in her affection; so she made it her usuall task, to labour after the enjoyment of him, to whom she was so nearely ingaged in her loyalty and devotion. Rich booties sweeten the greatest difficulties. A low-creeping spirit, deserves not to enjoy the benefit of fortune. Nor that love which is waited on by pusillanimity, the just reward or recompence of fancy. And this was the resolution of constant Doriclea ; who, though none more observant of Parents command; nor tender of her fame; yet her Philocles must not be forgot. His restraint from her, and her division from him work such strange effects, as sleepe becomes a stranger to her. Nightly she asks her pillow counsell how she may attain what her longing desires so much affect: and she resolves once againe to put in practise what he unhappy fortune had hitherto crossed her in. Suddenly then one night, when she imagin'd all the family, save only such as she imployed in this plot, to be fast asleepe, she privately departed forth of her Chamber intending by that meanes to make escape. But Parents eyes are ever vigilant: and their eares of quickest hearing: especially, where the least jealousie begets in the a thought of feare, or enjoynes them to a seasonable preventing care. This might appeare well in Euryclea , who the very same houre lying waking, and hearing the entry doore creek, presently arose, and lighting of a candle, repaired to her Daughters lodging; where drawing neere to her Daughters bed, instead of her Doriclea she found a Mammet or feature so artificially made up in her night attire, as in represented her Daughter to life. Boulster'd up was this Puppet with Pillows, as if Doriclea had been sitting up on end in her bed: which at the first fight deluded her inquisitive Mother, imagining that it could be no other but her Daughter. So as, calling upon Mellida , she resolved to returne to her chamber. Mellida , who all this while lay shaking and trembling in her bed, doubting that she might be call'd in question, upon Doricleas discovery: as one betwixt sleeping and waking, asked who was there? And perceiving it to be Euryclea : oh Mistresse, quoth she, what h'as distemper'd your rest, to be out a bed at this unseasonable time of night? Mellida , said she, you take great care of your Mistresse, to suffer her to sit up in bed and catch cold after this manner. And drawing neare the bed, to put her Daughters armes and higher part of her body too within sheets: perceiving it not to be her Daughter: but a Baby-clouts only to delude her. It is not easie to declare what extremity of passion she conceived: sometimes accusing Mellida to be guilty of the practise: threatning her with the severest punishments that Law could inflict, if she told her not forthwith whither her Daughter was fled. But she, dissembling Girle, pretended that she was never made acquainted with any such plot: seemingly wondring, what time her Mistresse could have for making up any such piece, without her knowledge. And to allay Eurycleas fury towards her, as one compassionating her case, she admired how any one could practise to delude their Mother in such manner; having beene ever so tender of her welfare. While they were thus debating Doriclea's escape, they might heare one rusling below: which Euryclea observing, she runne hastily downe, imagining to finde some of her servants made privie to this plot, and by that means to reskue her Daughter. But far above her expectance, she findes none other but Doriclea : who having forgot the key of the Court-gate by which she was to go forth, was turning back to fetch it. Who meeting with her Mother, what an unwelcome encounter she received, I leave to you to judge: being farre above the art of passion to expresse. But Doriclea set as good a count'nance on the matter as possibly she could: telling her Mother that she did but only this to try her. And that if she intended any such escape, she would have beene better provided then it appeared she was. But all this satisfied her Mother nothing: for to encrease the long-grounded jealousie of her Daughters affection towards Philocles : whereof she had received so many apparent arguments and demonstrations, as nothing could be more probable, being to every observing eye visible: chancing that very night to search her Daughters pocket, she found a Letter bearing Philocles character, directed to her in this manner.  tell me if any one ever suffer'd more in the delay of her enjoyment whom he prized most: or suffer'd more in the burden of their indignities whom he valued least. What sad ominous starre is it that so misguides me, or darke sullen cloud that hangs over me, as to live still thus divided; and by an injurious restraint, divorced from that only object where my thoughts are affianced, and the constant zeale of a truly-loyall Servant devoted? I am daily travelling in pursuit of you, yet fruitlesse in my pursuit; some sinister occurrent or other estrangeth me from you. Did he ever live, that did more unfeignedly love; or could more readily and really sacrifice his life for the purchase of his love? And what solace to recompence so faithfull a service? Shall my harvest, where I expected so good a crop, requite my long-languishing hopes with tares: and close the unhappy Scene of a lingring life with fruitlesse teares? O reflect on these, and expedite his blisse, who never yet could paint out his griefes with deceiving colours; nor delude the Object he affected, and to whose sole choice he stood affyed with feined ay-mees: nor dictate with tongue, nor expresse by Pen what hee first conceiv'd not in heart. Confident I am (nor is my confidence grounded on weak presumptions) that many officious Agents, whose particular aimes made them Rhetoricall Counsellours, interposed themselves to divert our choice, and offer to our affections reasons of change: yea, such who applyed these dangerous receipts to us both: to work their own ends the surer, and ingratiate themselves with us both, under a friendly pretence but forged colour. Our owne bosomes when they shall become unlocked each to other, may one day mutually discover; and smile with pleasure at such a selfe-loving deceiver. But the winde, I hope, is got into another Coast. So as, I doubt not but your discretion will henceforth prefer a constant choice, before an inconstant trust. I have prepared the way (and that by a Reverend one, in whom life and learning do equally shine) to consummate whatsoever hath been so long proposed, and as I hope, mutually concluded; so you be but pleas'd only to breathe on these lines with your pious modest assent, and confirme me, which, of all things earthly, may only cheere me, in being, and happy in so being, inviolably Yours.  So numerous were these private plots, confirmed with amorous Letters, as Euryclea could hold no longer from imparting these passages to her passionate Husband Androgeus , who became so inraged upon this last discovery of her affection, as he could containe himselfe within no bounds of patience. So as Doriclea could not be halfe so serious nor solicitous after the pursuit of her restrained Philocles ; as Androgeus was to chastise that too much freedome of his inamoured Daughter. It chanced, that as he walked one evening not without much discontent; he might heare the voice of his Doriclea , from a private Arbour neare adjoyning. Whereto drawing neare and giving good attention, he might understand what griefe she conceiv'd, in procuring her Parents displeasure so highly against her; wherewith she seemed so infinitely afflicted, as it struck teares in the old mans eyes: so as drawing neerer the Arbour, with purpose to comfort her, he accoasted her in this manner. How now Doriclea , what meane these teares? Want you ought that may conduce to your content? Is out love either so cold, or our care so light, as either of these should be occasion to you of teares? These, trust me, are no pleasing ayres to the eare of a Father, nor suiting with the condition of a Daughter. " Lachrym ae , replyed she, should not only be in the eye, but stamps of more retentive sorrow in the heart. A Pilgrims passage is such a passionate progresse, as it cannot be pursued without sobs: nor continued without sighes. I have found sufficient occasion for that Musick: nor can I eye that place, which may afford other melody. A continuall Sinner and a rare sigher promiseth small comfort hereafter. Our dayes are but few and evill . Not an houre without some crime to accompany it. Let the Soule never receive her surfet of sorrowing; till she h'as first found in her selfe a loath to sinning. But in these, deare Sir, there is nothing that reteines in it more sense; then the remembrance of my disobedience. Your discontent h'as begot in me the deepest impression; nor shall I desire longer to live, then my endeavours shall not be directed to regaine your opinion. Your frowne hath beene ever my greatest feare: which if my too liberall youth h'as too carelessely incurr'd: relinquish me for ever, if my penitentiall teares shall not labour to redeeme. More would I speak, if my constant zeale and reverence to your person would permit. Be it yours to command: Doriclea's to obey." This divine Rapsodie wrought so strongly on Androgeus , as it were hard to say, whether she was more readie to crave pardon, or he to grant it. Soone was his passion allayed, and to compassionate teares resolved. More he could not wish then she had professed: nor she in the office of obedience performe more then he expected.  How Mellida one morning lets fall her Glove; whereon Spurcina the Inchantresse practiseth supposing it to be Doriclea's. Mellida fals in love with Mardanes : and discloseth her passion to her Mistresse: who promiseth her best assistance.  in practise her impious designe: in pursuit wherof that hideous Hag was no lesse forward, then if the issue or successe thereof solely imported her self. And now at last she holds her selfe perswaded that she h'as got her purpose, which hapned upon this occasion. Having, as her usuall custome was, many times repaired to that private walke, which Doriclea so much frequented, it chanced one day as this Beldame was entring the walke, she might perceive with her old gummie eyes a Gentlewoman, whom she took for Doriclea , hastily leaving the walk, and with more haste than good speed, as one fixt upon some present occasion, letting fall her Glove. An happy opportunity, as Spurcina thought, to effect her malicious designe. With much joy therefore she returned, acquainting Mardanes the prime agent in this hellish bunesse, what good meanes she had now to bring her purpose about: which she promised him to effect with such speed, as his owne desires could not wish more haste: nor his privatest thoughts better successe. For, said she, I shall by my secret art, make her more eager in the pursuit of your love, then ever yet you were in pursuit of hers. Which so transported this love-besotted Mardanes , as his imagination became now wholly fixed and fired in the conceipt of his marriage-night. Sometimes thinking what sweet parliance his inchanted Doriclea would use to him; with what amorous imbraces she would expresse her love unto him; with what variety of winning discourse she would entertaine him. Surfetting more after this manner with the conceipt of it, then if he had obtain'd the reall fruition of it, wherein his deluded thoughts might seeme to close with that opinion of the Poet:  No doubt, but th' fancy of a marriage-night Presents far more then th' actuall delight. And so it fared with Mardanes : nothing now pleaseth his palat but the imaginary presentment of his Doriclea ; of whom he holds himselfe as good as possessed, if all prove true which his Sorceresse h'as professed. But as the Devill h'as beene still a Lier, so he presents himselfe to her a cunning dissembler: Doriclea must be reserved for an other Owner: a more deserving and compleat Lover. Howsoever, this Inchantresse Spurcina blesseth the morning that gave her so faire an occasion. And as she conceives her selfe to have happily found it, so she no lesse speedily practiseth on it: supposing it still to be Doricleas , the sole Object of rejected Mardanes . Great and unsearchable is Gods permission, in suffering practises of this condition. Whether it be to deterre others by these examples, not to be too secure; but ever watchfull, seeing every houre presents an enemy so deceiptfull. Or else to try and search the constancy and faith of his beloved Champions: who, like pure gold, are ever more and more refined; when they are thus tryed, and by Satans Ministers buffeted. Yet is their power so bounded and limited, as though they work on the flesh, yet can they not touch nor taint the soul: whose dignity is such, that as it became redeem'd with the highest price, so it becomes secured by adhering to him that bought it, from the injury of their power. True it is, that some fall away, and that miserably, by lying themselves open and giving way to the Devils subtilty: who under many formes and semblances insinuates himselfe to their knowledge: and by this meanes feaseth on their deluded weaknesse: bringing some to lay violent hands upon themselves: others to renounce their faith: others to labour by all indirect meanes how to procure the effecting of their unlawfull desires. But who are these, but such who have left God by preferring the counsell of the Witch of Endor , before the divine wisdome of their Maker . And justly do such suffer, by dereliction of their Creator, and in a violent way exposing themselves to inevitable danger. Now, what strange effects Spurcina wrought by practising on poore Mellidas scatter'd Glove, shall forthwith appeare. For what private Spels, Charmes, or Incantations she had used, Spurcina and her Familiar know best: But unhappy Mellida must feele the brunt of it. Poore Wench! She now feeles what she never felt before: a strange rising at her stomack with an infinite desire to see Mardanes . Whatsoever she sets her eye on, she verily thinks it presents the feature of Mardanes : and in that lovely manner, as her very heart leapes for joy with the conceipt of enjoying so accomplish'd a Lover. Poore accomplishment! For what part had Mardanes in him that might deservingly beget love; or merit the acceptance of a Mistresse? But so so miserably had Spurcina's inchantments wrought upon her bewitched fancy: as Narcissus , for all his lovely proportion, seemed a vulgar Object, no, a contemptible Subject, being compared to her Mardanes person. Which in a passionate expression to her selfe, being jealous that none should over-heare her, she discovered in this manner! "What in love Mellida ? Nay, I know not: it is a thing I was never hitherto acquainted with; and if now, too soone. I know not well what to think on't; but if Mardanes be not a proper handsome man, I am farre deceived. I remember well he made sometimes love to my Mistresse: and I wonder much she should so neglect him, being so compleat a Gentleman as all Europe, in my conceipt, cannot compare with him. But what is all this to thee Mellida ? Canst those either think so well of thy selfe, or so meanly of him, as to imagine that he will fall of from the Mistresse to the Maide (a fault must confesse, too common) or step from his Canopie Curtaine to a Trucklebed? No Mellida ; content thy selfe with browne bread: such a dainty dish is reserved for a choiser tooth. And yet me thinks, if a good conceipt of my selfe do not mad me; I find something in me that may deserve his love and merit the title of a Wife. If Marriage were only to be made by equality of blood, or fortunes: many good faces would be enforc'd to bestow their beauties on poore Husbands: yea, many a well- natur'd Girle might wed this yeare, and beg the next. I have read in my time, how Iove fell in love with his Milke-maide I o; Apollo with Daphne; Neptune with Hesione; Theseus with Ariadne; Perseus with Andromeda; Alcides with Omphale : and is there any such disparity betwixt Mardanes and Mellida ? Well; as I meane not to be too confident, neither is there cause that I should utterly despaire. Good fortune h'as before this fallen into many Wenches laps unexpected, and why may not the like befall me? None of these bore more true love to their Suiters, then I do to my Mardanes . And, oh, that I might call him mine! For I feare much, in becomming lesse than mine, I shall become lesse then mine own." And just as she spake these words came in Doriclea ; at whose presence a fresh vermillion dye bestow'd a new complexion on Mellida . Which her Mistresse perceiving, having had experience of the very like passion in her selfe, demanded the cause. And she, though at first seeming dainty, framing many apron-excuses, but so far from purpose, as she had farre better said nothing: begun at last to disclose her passion to her Mistresse; acquainting her how she was infinitely in love with Mardanes . Whereat Doriclea could not chuse at first but smile, asking her what she could see in him, that should move her to fall in love with him? See in him, answered Mellida! well, Mistresse, quoth she, you made a strange choice, when for Mardanes you took Philocles in exchange. Why, pray thee Wench, said Doriclea , doest thou hold him for so proper a man? I trow, I do, answered Mellida ; and upon condition I might enjoy him, and purchase his favour; were he the poorest Beggar alive, I would not change my state with the greatest Emperour. Sufficiently could not Doriclea admire this strange humour in her Maide: and the more, in regard she never found her formerly affected to love any: but of all others Mardanes , from whose affection she had sometimes disswaded her selfe, when he was a Suiter to her. And a purpose she had to have chid her, for her too much forwardnesse: but perceiving pearled teares trickling downe her cheeks, she quickly altered what she intended. She found them both drawing one yoake: to allay then her discontent, she became her Physitian, who in her own respect was no lesse a Patient. "Nay grieve not woman, quoth Doriclea , for the matter. Since thou art now fledg'd in birdlime, thou must seek meanes how to unwinde thy selfe. Thou hast beene ready in my greatest extreames to afford me thy best advice, and to ingage thy selfe to perill for my sake; so as I cannot chuse but reflect on thee, if at any time I look upon my selfe. Two things then I must advise thee to; or never expect successe in this amorous enterprise; Silence and Patience . Do not discover thy affection to any: restraine thy looks when thou art in his companie. Next this, be sure thou shew no impatience, if at any time crossed in thy expectance. Thou seest how many sharpe encounters I have grapled with: and little nearer a conquest then I was at first: yet must I not suffer my hopes to be so extinguished. No task can be long, where hope pretends a purchase of love. Look up then Wench, cheerefully; let not the subtilest Artist draw from thy look, the least blush of love, or line of fancie. Wing thy desires with hope, that hope may crown thy expectance. And proceed in a temperate pursuit, since thou canst not dispense with thy choice; in which assay I faithfully promise thee my best assistance." This could not chuse but highly cheer love-inveigled Mellida to finde her Mistresse her directresse: by having her for her adviser, who formerly was advised by her. But so strongly did those amorous Spels work upon her, as these rayes of comfort shone not long upon her. Impatient was her unbounded affection of delay, which drove her into passion above measure; as by this sorrowfull Niobe , whose choisest melody is lachrym ae , you may perceive hereafter.  Mellida's passionate love.  restrained. Of all which, none work with more contrariety, then those which arise from a troubled fancie. Love runs with too strong a current too [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE063F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) firce a torrent to be staid at an instant. This, poore love-inthralled Mellida felt too well experienc'd in her, when that which so lately seemed to cheere her most, doth now most afflict her: nay, even that which so seemingly afforded her the soveraign'st cure, now becomes the only producer of her care. Such strange effects had these Spels of hatefull Spurcina brought forth; as all was struck out of order, though at the first appearance nothing but promised all successe to the undertaker. But miserable were those distractions which her inchantments bred through the whole family; but principally on Mellida , who now overcome with a deepe jealousie; imagined, that whatsoever Doriclea her Mistresse had professed, were expressions meerely dissembled. And that her reall love towards Mardanes was such, as she would prove her Corrivall rather than Assistant, by interceding for her selfe in this amorous imployment. Which groundlesse suspicion of hers received life from that which if her deluded thoughts had not misguided her, might have discovered to her, how infinitely she stood bound to her Mistresse for her love. For discreet Doriclea perceiving the passionate affection of Mellida ; and desiring nothing more then to bring her in a way of enjoying, of what she was so eagerly pursuing; resolved of a course that might expedite this designe: and this was, to expresse all showes of affection to Mardanes : as if she intended nothing more then to reteine him her constant servant, whom she had formerly rejected: and to redeeme that neglect with such arguments of love, that the world might take notice that he and none but he was the man whom she affected. Which relation (so ready is fame to disperse her selfe upon every occasion) no sooner vented it selfe abroad, then her Parents, supposing her love to be now declining from Philocles , infinitely rejoyced. Nor was insnared Mardanes lesse transported, hoping e're long to enjoy what his desires had so long pursued. But with this was jealous Mellida no lesse afflicted: imagining that no hopes could accompany her suit, where her Mistresse affection had taken place. Thus in this Comedy of Errors were all things confusedly carried, and by as doubtfull an issue attended. Mardanes loves Doriclea , and he is loved by Mellida: and Mellida thinks Mardanes lov'd by Doriclea ; when all her taske is, how she may espouse Mardanes unto Mellida . Againe, Doriclea's Parents think, that their Daughter h'as relinquisht Philocles , and solely fixt her affection on Mardanes ; whereas the show of love she pretends to Mardanes ; is only to prepare a way for her enjoyment of Philocles . But this little contents distressed Mellida : she collects by what she sees, the aime of what she most feares. Her poore simple heart is so farre from dissembling, as she verily thinkes these Love-signes and tokens of her Mistresses, cannot but proceed from the heart, and what hope then left for her to enjoy her Sweetheart? The meditation of these drove her into such extreames, as in the most disconsolate manner that ever accompanied perplexed Lover, she discovered her discontent, with as much privacie as the retirednesse of the place could afford; that the Aire might be only witnesse of her griefe, while she became her own relater. "Unhappy Mellida! hadst thou none to make choice of, but one who doth despise thee? None to impart thy thoughts to, but one who will deceive thee? Alas! thy fortunes must not aspire to such happinesse, as to enjoy the imbraces of Mardanes . One of higher state prevents thy suit. He and thy selfe have now got one Mistresse. Poore rejected Mellida! What Sanctuary maist thou retire to? Or what affectionate friend maist thou impart thy minde to? It was not done like a loving Mistresse to promise her poore Maide assistance: and to betray her trust, where she reposed most confidence. She might have disswaded thee from thy choice, by acquainting thee how she meant to enjoy him her selfe: and so discouraged thy hopes at the first, rather then thus delude thee at the last. I should have quickly desisted, though the losse of my love had shortned the line of my life, had I but knowne how she stood affected. But under so faire a semblance to shroud a dissembling count'nance, and make a shew of affection, when it is guilded with treason; should I freely remit it, Loves Soveraigne would not so easily pardon it. 'Las! what a poore conquest h'as Doriclea got, in her competition with Mellida? who had never attempted what she now affecteth; had not Doriclea first rejected, whom she now esteemeth. The ground of Mellida's loving, was Doriclea's leaving. And can she now have the heart to love, whom she did sometimes leave, because what she did so scornefully leave, Mellida begins now faithfully to love? Did her distaste beget my love, and must my love now beget her distaste? Well; this do'es meanely requite me, if she would remember what fidelity she h'as found in me. There was no night so dark, no task so hard; which with a free bosome I entertain'd not, so she might enjoy what she had not. Philocles then was the only man in her eye, and I her Agent which she wrought by. Proper parts were the Adamants of her affection: and these she found in none so well to life portrayed as in her Philocles. Mardanes was then a rough-hewen Swaine, whose presence she so much hated, as she estranged her selfe from that place which he frequented. And must he be now entertained, because he is by poore Mellida affected? Well, I am glad that the love of her Maide h'as chang'd her minde, and advanc'd him to the choice of a Mistresse. Let my losse be his gaine; my deprivall of what I desire most, the enjoyment of her whom he expected least. The ruine of a poor Maide is all that she can have; which cannot redound much to her honour, seeing she, on whom she so much relyed, and to whom her secret'st counsels were imparted, became the only instrument to undoe her." Doriclea having over-heard some of these distemper'd passions of love-sick Mellida , could containe her selfe no longer; but interrupting her in this manner, resolved by a contrary cure to allay the extremity of this distemper. "How now Mellida , h'as love so distracted you; or too much liberty of enjoying your own desires so much entranced you; as to become thus forgetfull of what you are, whom you serve, or whose affections you so highly deserve? Must my endevours addressed for your good be so interpreted? My desire of your advancement so recompensed? Is your conceipt so meane of me, that these expressions of my love and familiar respect to Mardanes proceeds meerely from my own affection, without relation to your selfe? Or, that I did purposely leave him, with a resolution that whensoever you made choice of him, I would love him? Trust me Mellida , this distemper'd fancie tastes of a frenzie. These humours will make your constant'st friends your profest foes. Shake off this jealousie, lest it become thy mortall enemy: I am the same I have professed, nor will I faile in ought I have professed, so thy ill- grounded suspicion divert not my aime; which effect if it produce, blame thy selfe. I know well there is no way for thee to attaine thy desires but by this meanes. He must first take knowledge of their love, who love him not, before ever thou canst enjoy him who loves thee not. Doriclea must take upon her the person of Mellida , and Mellida be taken for Doriclea , before ever Mardanes make his Bride of Mellida . What I intend, I will not yet discover; only let me advise thee to restraine this indiscreet humour: perswading thy selfe that Mardanes had never received a gracefull count'nance from Doriclea , but in hope of advancing Mellida . And that my better thoughts are so farre from domineering in thy ruine (which were a poore conquest indeed) as it shall be my principall aime to prevent it, so thy indiscretion crosse not my designe. Let it suffice thee, that though it concerne thee most, thou maist be seene in it least. So present I am in others affaires, so weak in mine own; as I am confident, unlesse some unexpected opposition divert me; in such a successive manner to mannage it, as the issue shall conduce to thy profit, my credit, in so fairely carrying it, as it may expresse the affectionate office of a Mistresse to her Servant." These last words comforted poore Mellida's dejected heart so much, as those seeds of jealousie which she before conceived, are now suppressed. With destilling eyes she acknowledgeth her selfe bound to so kind a Mistresse: who interposeth her selfe for her preferment. She laments nothing more then her late suspicion: which, as it was planted on weak grounds, so her humble desire is, that her Mistresse would forgive and forget it, as she seriously vowes never hereafter to harbour it. She submits her selfe wholly to her direction in this high project of her affection. Wherein, if her endeavours prosper, she becomes her obliged creature for ever: if otherwise, she will become humbly thankfull, seeing her affectionate endeavours were no lesse, though they prov'd lesse usefull. This said, they retired, for the closing of the day approached; which gave more freedome to Doriclea's working thoughts to contrive what might close best with these impatient desires of her Maide, and what might procure content to her selfe; which seemed as yet so farre divided from all hope, as there appeared not yet so much as the least opportunity to afford them helpe: though more hope of successe to her Maide then her selfe, wherein she rejoyced no lesse then for her selfe. But strange occurrents oppose themselves to her designes: so as, whatsoever at the first view promised no lesse than a prosperous close, became, as you shall hereafter understand, darkned with a Cloud. Albeit, Doriclea's constancy appeared such, as the difficulty of no task, could deterre her resolution to attempt.  Philocles procures his liberty: and by a faithfull Messenger, though to to his apparant danger, privately acqaints Doriclea with his delivery: and assigning her a place whereto she might safely repaire, if she could possibly make escape.  successe, that she should heare such good newes of her Philocles liberty, which he procured upon this occasion. Diverse Persons of good quality were so taken with the pleasing discourse and company of Philocles , as they usually resorted to him, being admitted by his Keepers freely to come and converse with him. Now it hapned one day, in these their accustomary visits, that his visitants were pleased to use a little more freedome in a sociable way, then they had formerly done. Which, whether it was purposely intended or no, I know not: but brimming healths must go round, and such noble Friends remembred, as in common civility must not bee neglected. Which Philocles , (though naturally most abstemious) observes for company sake, lest he should be taxed of an unsociable disposition, in refusing what was generally entertained. But with such hot pursuit were these Bacchanals exercised, as his Keepers braines were so mudded and in Lethe steeped; that they had farre more desire to take one Nap with Morpheus , then to taste one Cup more with Bacchus . Which strange distemper appearing more in these then any of all the company, some have imputed to Opium , put, as was thought, into his Keepers Cups, to bring them asleepe, and by that meanes to expedite his escape. Howsoever it hapned, Philocles having first taken his civill adue of those Gentlemen who purposely came to visit him: and to prevent all occasion of their accusation, privately betook him for a little to his Chamber; and afterwards by the assistance of an under-Porter who ever highly respected and honoured him, he was let out by the Porters Lodge; and shortly arrived where he intended at a friends house of his, where he was kindly and hospitably entertained: having formerly upon diverse mutuall offices betwixt them so strongly ingaged one another, as no respect could be too entire, no undertaking too great, wherein either might tender to other the profest curtsie of a votive Brother. But as there is no earthly sweet but h'as his soure accompanying it: so infranchis'd Philocles could not rejoyce so much in his delivery from restraint; as he found cause upon his friends report to conceive just ground of discontent. So strangely be all our inferiour joyes interveyned with griefes: as no day so cleere but it may close in a Cloud. And so it fared with perplexed Philocles , whose late-enjoyed freedome brought him the saddest newes that could ever possibly enter any true Lovers eares: for he heard, how his Doriclea , since his restraint had estranged her affection from him, and fixed it on Mardanes , her sometimes rejected Suiter; and that their nuptials were to be solemnized soone after. Pleasing were his former Fetters to these tydings: each faculty had lost his function, every Organ his motion, and could finde no answer to such a relation.  Small fears finde teares, which may supply a tongue, "Small griefes are speakers, when great griefes are dumbe." But recollecting himselfe, as one unwilling to give such way to passion, as not to moderate it with reason: after an enforced smile, he addresseth himselfe to his friend in this sort. Trust me, firme friend, I can scarcely give my theughts leave to conceipt or harbour the least jealousie of Doriclea's inconstancy. Nay, so well am I perswaded of her loyalty, as I verily think she would rather give way to the extreamest encounters of [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE063F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) faith, then admit of the least breach of [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE063F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) fate. No; Doriclea's vowes cannot so easily be infringed; nor those divine vertues which adorne her, so blemished: nor those strong tyes betwixt us, so dissolved. God grant it prove so, answered his friend, as I hope it will. Reports are commonly deceiving, so as you do wisely not too credulously to incline to them. After such discourses as these, his friendly Hoast brought this perplexed Guest to his Chamber; where after some merry passages purposely occasioned to allay his discontents, he left him to his rest. But he left him to that which he could not get: for on two severall tasks he bestowed this tedious night: the one no lesse pleasing, then the other dis- relishing. For the former part of the Night, he bestowed on the thoughts of that familiar conference, amorous, but harmelesse dalliance, sacred vowes, immutable seales, mutually passed betwixt them. These made the houres of sable night, so delightfull, as no Euphuus golden slumber could so infinitely cheere him. He was wholly [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18020001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE063F0&area=prose&forward=textsFT) extasied with the gratefull remembrance of these imaginary fancies. But leaving these, and reflecting on those which he so lately heard related: he found houres farre longer in their progression, then the other were, running so pleasantly upon that harmonious descant of affection. " Doriclea , false, said he! may that tongue be ever silent that shall utter it; that injurious conceipt a corrasive to it selfe, that shall believe it. And yet these relations cannot be so generally dispersed without some ground. Opportunity may do much where Parents assent gives way. Thy restraint, Philocles , and discontinuance in thy suit might work strange effects. He is rich who is thy Corrivall: and Women must love to live, aswell as live to love. Thy impoverish'd quality is a mighty eye-sore to fancy. Wealth is a good salve for age: and though she cannot affect him as he is, she may hug him for what he h'as. Marriages go not altogether by joyning of hearts but hands. His store will so highly improve her state, as it will enforce fancy, and raise her to what thy fortunes may not aspire, the title of a Lady. And yet me thinkes all this should little move the constant and loyall brest of Doriclea . Heavens cannot chuse but frowne on breach of faith: which is ever attended by an heavie fate. Yea; but admit she be compelled; what meanes may she finde to resist it? Parents will is a command: and as she h'as ever borne the modesty of a Maide, so h'as she reteined the duty of a Daughter, and obedience of a childe. Parents command then might far prevaile with her: seeing obedience was ever so much preferred by her: as all feares had been before this time prevented, had not this parentall sacrifice restrain'd her. Well; be it so. Patience shall be my Crowne: my prayers for her successe. No griefe, shall so much surprize me, as the desire of her happinesse shall delight me. Meane time, I will suspend my judgement: and expect better then I heare: but if the issue second this report, I hope soone after that an everlasting retire from Earth shall cure my care." Thus passed Philocles the lingring night, estranged from nothing more then the thought of rest. At last perceiving Aurora's dishevell'd tresses, dispersing her golden beames through every corner of his restlesse roome; he leaps out of bed, and having made himselfe ready, and performed those morning vowes which his devotion had enjoyned him; He sets Pen to Paper, and like a poeticall Lover, in an amorous manner, addresseth his last nights supposed vision, to his Doriclea: making a dreame of love, by shadowing those jealous feares for the losse of his love in a Dreame.  Sweet dew of sleepe hath quite forsook mine eyes. Some startling dreams I have, which more appall My Soule, then if I had no sleepe at all. Sometime I dreaming see, and sigh to see, A Sable-sullen cloude hang over me And menacing a storme: thou full of feares This to prevent, resolves to pearled teares: But more thou weep'st, the more provok't thou art, The sight whereof wounds my relenting hart. Now do J see my Danae in a tower Tempted untainted with a golden shower. Now my faire Semele , feeding loves-flame In her pure brest, consumed with the same. Which visions were but shadowes of thine, Or meere conceptions of Prometheus shrine, Which once enlivened by an heav'nly fire, Might to a numerous Family aspire. Sometimes, me thought, Isickles sought to sip Ambrosean Nectar from thy roseat lip; And this I check't, and did incensed seeme, Telling Old-age, frost would not suit with greene. Which just reproofe, me thought, thou entertain'd With a sweet smile, the gole at which I aim'd. Whence over-joy'd, I cull'd thee, where thou stood, But like Ixion , I embrac'd a cloud. My sacred Genius succour me, and keepe My waking thoughts fro such an ominous sleep! Yet in these Dreams more comfort did I take, Fed with conceit, then when I did awake; For dreaming, I enjoy'd thee; but that blisse By waking vanish'd; while I breath'd out this: "The Dorian straine was once th' best melodie, Had I Doriclea , now twere so with me!" But since t'imbrace thee, dreaming still I seeme, O that my life were a continued Dreame! But this dreaming veine did not hold long with him: he resolves to acquaint her in an other straine; and tell her truly that he was waking when he wrote it. And the Character of this Letter must expresse the benefit of his freedome; signifying unto her, how his late restraint was now changed into liberty; which priviledge he had rather for ever lose, then be deprived of the continuance of her fancy. To expedite this affectionate designe, he directs his Letter by the conduct of a faithfull Messenger, though to his apparent danger: acquainting Doriclea with his delivery: and assigning her a place whereto she might safely repaire, if she could possibly make escape. Delay he holds dangerous: he accompts opportunity the sweetest companion to fancy: desiring nothing more then that she would continue what she h'as professed, confirme what she h'as vowed,  & consummate what both divine decree and their own united hearts have sealed: closing his Letter with an amorous passion, after this manner:  I saile, aye me, for Ireland with my Lord, Where sayles are sighes, Seas, teares, while th' friendly winde Shall bring you word, I left mine heart behinde. But if you shall me for your Consort take, I'le march through ranks of Furies for your sake. Returne me answer then as may become you, "Pistols nor Poniards shall not keep me fro you." This was a strong Resolution, which he windes up with as loving a Subscription.  This Tearme from travell am I staid, To make my Consort of a Maid ; Confirme then, Deare-one, Heav'ns decree, And make exchange of hearts with me: Which done, this Posie shall he thine, Which is and must be ever mine: "To live, and have no heart were strange, Yet have I none but by exchange." Thus writ passionate Philocles , which came shortly after to the hand of his Mistresse, who how joyfully she received the report of his liberty; but how passionately those imaginary grounds of his jealousie, shall appeare in the progresse of our Story.  Doriclea by the advice and assistance of Mellida gets from her Keepers: and in her flight by night loseth her way: but comming by chance to the Hermits house, where she took that night her repose: as, she had formerly beene directed by him, she received much comfort from him: being conducted to the place which Philocles advised her to.  Philocles , it is not easie to expresse what infinite joy she conceived in the delightfull perusall of those lines which signified unto her the happy occasion of his liberty: yet could she not chuse but bite the lip when she read those dreaming fancies of his, shadowing forth his jealousie. The comfort she conceived in the former, was made bitter by relation of the latter: which enforced from her this just ground of complaint, which she breathed forth in this manner. "How is it Philocles , that the Heavens should thus look on thee, in freeing thee from restraint, and thou unthankfull for so great a benefit, thus to abuse the priviledge of thy liberty? During thy restraint, for ought that ever I heard, thou harbour'd not the least conceipt of jealousie: and now when thou enjoyest the freedome of ayre, and stands dis-ingaged from a captives care; like an habituate prisoner, whose long restraint seldome makes him better, thou picks a quarrell before offence be offered, and hatchest suspicion where none can be justly grounded. For tell me; pray thee, tell me, deare Philocles ; wherein have I ever given thee occasion to tax me of inconstancy; or in my bosome desired to lodge any one beside thee? Have I not neglected all my fortunes, nay, my zeale to those whom I preferre before all fortunes, to bestow my selfe upon a Scholers fortunes? If either rich youth or age could have wrought on Doriclea's fancy, she might long before this, have prevented all grounds of jealousie; and been a Mistresse of an ample Family. And yet you are cunning Philocles ; you will not plainly say you suspect me, for that were to tax you of too palpable jealousie: but you must shadow all under a dreame: and make visions your arguments of feare where you imaginarily see Old-age courting me; a rich fortune besieging me;  & my too easie Fort sore straitned by his golden battry. Well, Philocles , God forgive you; you have hitherto had sufficient experience, how much my disposition hath scorned to be taken up by such prostitute affection. If Gold would have done it, your loyall Doriclea might before this have enjoy'd it. No; no; these were no motives to me to inchaine my fancy: or with a yeelding hand, but a dissembling heart, to engage my person to such a subject of folly. "O disburden your selfe, Philocles , of these conceipts: they so ill become you, as nothing makes Philocles so unlike himselfe: nor chils my affection more towards him, who is my second-selfe. I have not begged much at your hands, since the time we so firmely united our hearts: all I intreat of you is this, and it will redound to your own hearts-ease as well as mine: to discard these injurious conceipts towards your own, by reflecting on her who can be no lesse then yours, if her own. "And trust me, deare Sir, you may thank God, that you remaine seazed of such a heart, which is not apt to take offence where such good occasion is offered. Some cautious Girles, if they had but perceived the least inclination to jealousie in their amorous Suiters, which your own Character h'as sufficiently discovered in you, they would in time have prevented that mischiefe which might have incurred; and collected what domineering jealous Husbands they would have showne themselves being once married, having exprest themselves such suspicious Batchlers, when they were unbestowed. But love findes an easie shroud for the highest crimes: nor can Doriclea interpret Philocles Dreame any otherwise then an unbounded affection breaking into extreames: which, when it cannot with sufficient freedome impart her strength by day, borrowes of the night to discover in a dreame. And who can blame such vigilant love; when the eyes though they sleepe, the heart keepes true Centinell, lest fancy should take her opportunity and make her escape? Free leave then do I give thee, Philocles , to dreame still of me; but so, that thy dreames do not suspect me. For so might thy deluded imagination, which is seldome attended on by reason, present to thee what is false for what is true: and make thee credulously beleeve, that inconstancy may accompany true love. Surcease then from these, as I shall sooner cease to live, then withdraw my love from Philocles ." Thus discoursed constant Doriclea with her Philocles , in the absence of her Philocles . But least she might forget her selfe by neglecting what her dearest choice expects: after such time as she had rewarded the Messenger, who brought her that Letter, and that to his apparant danger, had not the late conceipt which Doriclea's Parents conceived of their Daughters declining her affection from Philocles secured him, and given him freer accesse unto her: She, I say, prepares to second her Philocles desire, by accommodating her selfe with all conveniencies, and addressing her course to that place, whereto Philocles in his Letter had given her directions to repaire. Desist then she must for the present, from spinning Mellida's love-threed: that she might weave up her own the better: for though the furtherance of Mellida's suit was deare unto her: desiring much to have her seazed of those ample fortunes of her undeserving Lover: yet her own case must be first preferr'd, being urged by such importunity, as she held it fitting then or never to discover those true effects of fancy. By the advice then and assistance of Mellida , whose wits were ever more pregnant in devising for her Mistresse then her selfe, and to whose vertuous love she wished no lesse successe then to her selfe; Doriclea gets from her Keepers, being then more secure of their charge then before, in regard her Parents became lesse jealous of her love to Philocles then before. Dark was the night, which promised her more security: but an inconvenience she findes in it: for in this her flight by night she loseth her way. Up and downe she wand'reth, and wandring, wooeth the Stars, that they would afford a distressed Maide, some small beamelings of their light, to guide her to that place where chaste love had treasured her richest prize. But many by-paths she took, ever travelling, but little nearer approaching the place, at which she aym'd: which deeply perplexed her love-inflamed minde. Till at last, (so propitious were the Stars to their vertuously-grounded loves) comming by chance to the Hermits house, she took that night there her repose. Next morning early, for little power had sleepe upon her fancy; she acquainted this aged Father with the whole passage of her intendments: First, how she had received knowledge of Philocles liberty, with what desire she had to observe the time which he had limited, with the place which he had proposed for her to repaire to: humbly craving of him, that as she had been formerly directed by him, he would be pleased to continue his care, by affording her his best advice in a case of such necessity, as the issue made her of all others either most fortunate, or most unhappy. And that he would not impute this her private departure from her Fathers house, to any act of immodesty, but to the constancy of her affection, which had expos'd her to all extremity. The good old man, who had ever tender'd her well-fare, could not forbeare from shedding teares, in hearing her expresse those passionate overtures and passages of her love: with what desperate adventures she had encounter'd to partake, what her vertuous desires so unfeignedly sought. But affection must have a more soveraigne balme applyed to her, then any effeminate passion. Eyes compassionately weeping without a brain effectually working, can bestead poore Doriclea nothing. First then, he proposeth the way for her to obtaine what she would: which he strengthneth with such able directions, as being well observed, they promised nothing lesse then an happy arrivall at the place whereto she aimed: with a prosperous conclusion to their long delayed desires, having there arrived. And to encourage her the more, he applyed these receipts unto her, which so infinitely cheered her, as her confidence readily winged her enlivened fancy with an undoubted assurance of successe. "Daughter,    [   The Hermits Speech to Doriclea .   ] it had been well you had made your Parents command the line to have directed your love. But since your affections are so firmely united, as not to be divided: I hold it an office of piety to effect, what vertuous loves so jointly affect. Thus long have I had experience of you, and I have neither seene nor heard any immodest expression fall from you: this confirmes me, that you are no lesse then what you seeme: not pretending to be what you are not, but in desiring to approve yourselfe what you seeme. This those faire out-sides fall short of, who affect nothing more than to appeare most, what they inwardly professe least.  For these whos' ere they be seeme thus to me, They be and seem not, seem what least they be. "For goodnesse-sake estrange your better-disposed thoughts from these painted Puppets: who may be aptly resembled to the Zibethum , which naturally yeelds a sweet perfume to others, but reteines a stinking sent to it selfe. Let those precious odours of you vertues not only afford sweetnesse to others, in proposing an example worthy imitation: but to your owne heart, which cannot flye from it selfe, but must one day returne as it do'es now reteine, of whatsoever it hath receiv'd, a true naked impression. You have now enter'd the Maine: where you shall graple with many contrary winds, and surging waves. Report, like an ill-winde, will be quickly raised: and this may happily disperse a light fame upon all your actions. As first, this private retire from your Parents, and making your selfe carver of your own affections without, their consent, may beget you a strange opinion in the world. Men will judge all is not well; more then pure love drove you to these courses. Waves likewise there will be to menace your ruine. Divided passions to perplexe you, and inthrall your late-enjoyed freedome to the worst of extreames. Yet, what of all these? The roughest windes of infamy to a pure and undefiled minde can do no injury. Nor all those naturall inbred passions which breed distemper'd spirits most disquiets, can annoy the rest of that Soule which is fixt on the exercise of piety: and makes her triumph over her own affections, her highest victory. Observe this rule, Deare Daughter, and these intended Spousals of yours shall finde an happy period: and after so many violent windes of infamous tongues: so many turbulent waves of swelling passions; you shall finde that calmenesse, as neither that lownesse of fortune which may hereafter encounter you, shall amate you: nor all those contemps which injurious disdaine may throw upon you, any way disturbe you. I have showne you the best roade, which if you hold directly, you cannot but arrive safely." Doriclea having received much comfort from these instructions of the Hermit: and encouraged too with the promise of his conduct to the place which Philocles advised her to: after a small repast (being enough for a stomack inflamed with love, to digest) she addressed her selfe to the short remainder of her journey; which though short, had appear'd long to her longing fancy, had not the difficulty of the way been sweetned with the Hermits company: by whose happy convoy she soone arrived, where her desires were lodged, and where she found her Philocles safely reposed.  The great content and joy which these two long-divided Lovers conceived in one of the others presence: The relation of their former griefs being an addition to their present joyes.  a rough Sea. The least beameling breaking forth of a Cloud appeares like a more full and glorious light. This experimentally felt these long-divided Lovers, who conceived such infinite joy and content in the sight of one the other: as their first encounter for want of expression closed it selfe in silence, wanting a tongue to discover what delight their intranced apprehensions took in one anothers presence. Looks now were to supply more discursive Organs: gladly would their affectionate breasts unfold themselves, and relate those many occurrents which their true loves had passed and with comfort vanquished: but their desires must be first feasted with eying and intentive looking upon one another. This must be the pleasing prelude to a more delightfull Sceane: at last, affection labouring of too strong a passion, to be enjoyned a perpetuall silence, broke forth on Philocles behalfe after this manner. "Ah Doriclea ! which taking accent so transported him, as not an other word for a long space came from him.---Am I in a Dreame or waking? Can I imagine any mortall capable of such joy? How pleasing now is the memory of my restraint? My long division from thee, my dearest Doriclea , whom I preferred before the world? For to be ever happy so surfets the conceipt, as it dreames of no other state: a small storme to him who hath ever enjoy'd a calme, seemes like a tempest. Whereas my present condition makes me more sensible of my former affliction. I was deprived of thee whom I incomparably loved. From all civill curt'sies, save such as I received from strangers, excluded. All hopes of future advancement, by thy Parents distaste, estranged. A Grate became my best prospect: the World my story: where I saw no action of sorrow presented more to life, then my own misery. O how the relation of our former griefs become an addition to our present joyes! Before I had none to converse with, but such pittilesse Guardians, as rejoyced in my restraint. Tedious were the houres of my life, because divided from the object of my love. Terrors I encounter'd with daily: passions I wrastled with hourely. No receipt found I to allay my griefe: none to impart my woes to, but such whose hearts were iron-temper'd like my Grate. O what an exchange have I found, in being free'd from what did so inthrall me: and in being restored to her presence, which of all earthly joyes doth only revive me! O my Doriclea , how many fearfull visions have startled me! how many distemper'd Dreames have disquieted me! And whence proceeded all these but from that love and feare equally working, and no lesse sundry effects producing, which had taken such strong possession of me, as not to be removed without enjoyment of thee?" At which, Doriclea interrupting him, after a more cheerefull recollection of her over-joy'd spirits, said unto him. "O my deare Philocles , I am an eye-witnesse of your distemper'd dreames! You know well what the Contents of your last Letter discovered: trust me, I will not chide you, for I can finde no such language in my tongue: but I would not for a world have you think waking, what you suspect dreaming." Philocles calling to minde the purport of that paper of Verses he had writ unto her: and how much his too affectionate feare had made him transgresse: desiring her pardon, by imputing that error to report; acknowledged his fault, and condemned that too liberall relation of erring fame. "What relation might that be, my endeared Philocles , answered Doriclea ? H'as fame reported to you, that since your heavie restraint, I have been too liberall of mine honour, or admitted too much freedome to an intrusive Suiter? Have I slighted you in any discourse, or preferred any other in your place? So indeed, report went, replyed Philocles ; that your sometimes rejected suiter, rich Mardanes , had obtain'd your affection: and that your marriage was to be shortly solemnized. What, Mardanes , answered Doriclea? Nay, then me thinkes you should have holden your selfe safe enough: for of all men, to engage my fancy to an Earth-worme, whose ambition consists in having, but never in enjoying: and who prefers this poore rubbish of Earth before the treasure of a divine minde, my firme resolution hath been ever so farre divided, as I should loathe my selfe to be so matched. Panarchus sometimes propounded a Riddle, and it was this: How a man and no man, can with a stone and no stone, kill a bird and no bird, sitting upon a tree and no tree? And Athen aeus makes the answer; that an Eunuch is the man, and a pumice is the stone, a Bat is the bird, Fennell is the tree. Surely, I had rather contract my selfe with the first, and with modesty I speak it, content my selfe with the second, and make Apollo's bird of the third, then tye my selfe to such a barren tree. And howsoever the wise Simonides truly concluded, being one day asked, whether vertue or riches were of more reputation; that the vertuous did more frequent the doores of the rich, then the rich of the vertuous: meaning, that vertues constant attendant was poverty, many times enforced to beg reliefe at the gate of a vicious but rich family. For thy vertues, Philocles , did I chuse thee: other poore respects were so far from working on my fancy: as they never received entertainment in my thoughts. I have ever accompted poverty a sweet companion, where content was the Guardian; piety her Darling. Vice be she never so richly endowed, dyes poore: whereas vertue be she never so much impoverished, appeares rich. O how much then did my deare Philocles fall short in the merit of his opinion, in imagining his betrothed Doriclea could weane her affection where she loved so much, to plant it on one whom she valued so little? But Doriclea h'as an excuse in store for her beloved Philocles : I know, Deare one, it was thy unfeined love which begot this feare. Had not thy thoughts been fixed on me waking, I had been least in thy thoughts when thou were sleeping." Thus did these two loving Turtles rejoyce in their meeting: wherein the Hermit took no lesse content: observing how their loves were grounded on vertuous ends, which could produce nothing lesse then prosperous effects. With many pleasant stories did he delight the eares of these two affectionate Lovers: describing the happy successe of such, who preferred vertue before wealth: and how love could not want where there was no want of love. Yes,   [  The Hermits discourse of the purity of Love. ] reverend Father, said Doriclea ; there may be a want in the eye of a worldling. Yea, Daughter, replyed he, but that worldling cannot be properly said to love. Amphiaraus loved Eriphile, Eriphile Ampiaraus ; but what moved Amphiaraus to loue Eriphile but lucre; what induced Eriphile to love Amphiaraus but hope of honour? Now, how could these continue long, being so irregularly planted; where either the ambitious style of a Lady, or desire of money gave first conceptions to their fancie?  Who makes the object of his fancy Gold, Growes cold in fancy when his mony's told. And she who faignes to love, to live a Lady, Is honours Faunt, I know not what she may be. Nor is the purity of love to be stained with any earthly thought: many pretend love, but they cloathe it with an undeserving name: it declines from that at purity, wherewith it was endowed, by exposing it selfe to an immodest liberty, from which it should be estranged. Love should have staid eyes, to affect nothing lesse then wandring. A discreet eare, to heare nothing that may to lightnesse be inclining. A chaste touch, to embrace nothing that may be wantonly moving. A modest speech, to deliver nothing that may be any way corrupting. And in every part so well composed, so gracefully disposed, as an inbred love to piety may be cleerely discovered. This deserves well the title of loved whatsoever transgresseth these bounds, admits no such appellation, but rather to be displayed by that badge, which may best set her forth to her greatest dishonour and imputation. This He rightly weighed, who labouring to deblazon love and lust in their proper and distinct liveries, descanteth thus upon them, entitling his Poem, Loves Description .  Love , what's thy name? a phrensie, whence thy birth? From Heaven ; how comes it then thou lives on Earth? I live not there; yet e'ch usurps thy name: 'Tis true indeed, but hence redounds their shame! I live not there, my Nature's pure and just, But lust lives there, and love's a foe to lust . It was great pitty, said Philocles , that you, Father, who can discourse so contemplatively of so divine a subject, would never yet actively practise it. So Scholastically to reason of love, and be never a Scholer in the Schoole of Love, begets in me admiration. O I confesse, and with trickling teares, said the Hermit, that my youthfull follies exceeded all number, so long as I so journ'd in the world, and became there a wanderer. I could not walke in any street, but I encounter'd many mistresses: for pride , trickt and trim'd up in a gorgeous habit, infinitely took me. Licentious liberty peep'd in at my window when I was at study, and she surprized me. Luscious fare prepared me delicious viands, and these estrang'd me from sobriety. Sloth whisper'd to me in my bed, the Sluggards Lullabe, with yet a little, and yet a little , and this belulled me. Wrath sparkled in my veines, and spurr'd me on to revenge, and made me apt enough to forget ought that did most concerne me, but to imprint in my memory, the thought of an injury. Envie revenged her selfe justly on me, and made me pine away at the very sight of an others prosperity. And Covetousnesse , that age-benummed sinne, made me desire most when I needed least, and so besotted me. Nor could I shake off these, till shak'd off my self by leaving the world, which harbour'd these. But within one halfe Apprentiship, I blushed at those vanities I formerly affected: and by a private retire from the world, found what the world was while I was in it. Many were the conflicts I must freely confesse, which I suffered, before I could wholly leave it. Yea, delights above conceipt, presented themselves to my fancy, solliciting me to love it. And with these I long contested, and at last conquered, but with such difficulty, as I many times failed, and had been quite foiled, had not a more assisting hand guided me in the fight; and crowned me in the Conquest. Since which time, I have ever in a contented privacy remained: knowne too much to the world to affect it: nor so little to my selfe, but that my infirmities humble me in it. Many, too many, heaven knowes there be, who professe this regular course which I have entertained: but their profession is but how to delude the world: by bleering the eyes of men with a pretended sanctity: and under this vaile cunningly shroud their base hypocrisie. And One of these have mine aged eyes seene in these later times. A profest Gallant in his prime: and one who delighted in nothing more then a phantastick dresse: sufficiently conceipted of his own parts: yet strip him naked, he was neither good Morall, sound Christian, nor Philsopher. Yet did this dainty youth, when fortune begun to frowne on him, and vanity, for want of maintenance, to leave him: pronounce his divorce from the world. In a Rock he immures himselfe: Herbes and Rootes must be his Viands: cold Spring water his Wines: the Woods his Walkes: Beasts his Consorts, and Birds his Quiristers. None must serve him, but an old decrepit Woman, whom Nature had so disabled, as she could hardly serve herselfe. Thus seem'd he not to prize the world a Button, yet unbutton him, and you should undo him so farre out of fashion for his inward composition, as he could not be so regular without, as he was irregular within: as afterwards well appeared by him, when he forsook his regular life for secular love. Thus discoursed the Hermit, nor were his two hearers lesse delighted with this relation of his Eremiticall condition: but the night running now far on, after a little repast they betook themselves to their repose; resolving next morning to conclude of some course, to consummate their love, the very conceipt whereof made the lingring night seeme long.  Thus bad Loves Coment clos'd their fancies so, As two hearts lodg'd in one, and one in two: And like two lines that in one Centre meet, Though different in motion, took one scat.  They take the advice of Solinus that faithfull Hermit, what course were best to take in a case of such extremity: he adviseth them privately to solemnize that Rite, which their long affection had confirmed in heart.  golden locks to the blushing Morne: till these restlesse Lovers desiring nothing more then lawfully to enjoy the fruits of their long-continued loves: repaired to Solinus that faithfull Hermit and their constant Assistant, to receive his advice what course were best to take and securest to pursue in a case of such extremity; the prevention whereof might frustrate their hopes, and with a sullen Cloud darken their fancy. The Hermit they found walking in a private Garden: fixing his thoughts on higher contemplations then worldly love. Who, upon their comming to him, and hearing them so desirous of his advice, imparted his minde to them, in cropping a sprig of Tyme . This, I do, now, said he, may serve you for an usefull Embleme. Time must be taken while Time is. This herbe smels now sweet and redolent: But should it wither, and lose her strength and vigour, it would soone lose her beauty too, which consists in savour. There hath been ever more advantage in dispatch then delay . Since then your hearts are so nearly linked, as nothing can divide them: To prevent loose love, which goodnesse hates: and embrace chaste love, on which vertue smiles. As likewise, to secure your affections from surprize: which, no doubt, Doriclea , your Parents will by all means labour to assay: my advice is, that with all privacy, whereto this very place gives opportunity, you solemnize that sacred Rite, to do fancy right, which your long affection, to which my daily Orisons shall wish all successe, hath already confirmed in heart. For let me speak freely to you both: fancy becomes a frenzie, when it is not restrained by grace. And love too long delayed, may become polluted, and so lose that unstained purity, which it formerly reteined. Private familiarity accompanied by opportunity become dangerous Inlets to youthfull fancie. Besides, I have knowne in my time, many a loyall Lover deprived of their hopes, by spinning Penelopes Web, and protracting time too long. Had too provident Uirginius accepted of Ioilius , his Virginia had never incurred that unjust sentence of Appius Clauduc . It may be after a little time, when your Parents, Doriolea , shall see no means to remedy it, they will admit of it. Meane time, you must prepare your selves to suffer whatsoever the weight of a Fathers displeasure can lay on you. Small hope is there to reconcile you; till time, the best cancellor of injuries, attone you. Nor should I have inclined to ingage my selfe in any such advice, as in this private manner to solemnize your Nuptiall Rites without their consent, but that an inconvenience is to be preferred before a mischiefe. Having in this sort delivered his opinion, and by his advice made way for the happy enjoyment of their affection: hee made show as if he would returne back to his Cell; saying: Now, deare Daughter, you need no more the conduct or counsell of your poor Hermit: Nor you, my Sonne, the unnecessary presence of an Old Man, who can afford you no helpe, should you be pursu'd by hate, nor supply your want, should you need reliefe. Privately then, with your leaves, will I retire to my Cell: where, though I be divided from you, my poore devotions shall remember you. But neither of these true Lovers could endure to heare of his departure from them: desiring him, that they might partake his fatherly blessing, and enjoy his presence in the solemnization of those Rites which they intended the next day to consummate, according to his advice. For alas, said Philocles , your grave and discreet counsell may bestead us highly both before and after. For us two, we know only how to love: but how to provide for our safety in a case of necessity, our wits would be to seek: and our braines too shallow, to contrive. I cannot be ignorant, how many pursuing eyes, and revenging desires I have hunting after me. For Doriclea's Parents cannot be more incensed against me: then those Warders from whom I escaped, are enraged towards me. No Watch nor Ward must be unlaid to seaze on me: no device unassai'd to surprize me. And whom have I to flye to, but to the armes of Love; a weak, though willing defence to preserve my life? And what more, said Solinus , can an aged Hermit do for you; whose staffe is his only strength, and whose prayers the richest presents he can offer for your redresse? And what better Armour, answered Doriclea , in the time of danger? Besides, your advice may usefully import us, in directing how and in what manner we may bestow us, to prevent perill, which as my dearest Philocles truly affirmes, is every where inclosing us. I know my Fathers passion to be hot, but his nature to be good. Our retire for a time may not only for the present secure us: but by the power of interceding friends reconcile us. Which, for the instant were impossible to effect: or by the most perswasive wayes, to allay their discontent: seeing my Parents hasty nature, will for the present, admit no Moderator. The good old Man was perswaded by these reasons, to stay one night longer with them: which he, indeed, the rather desired to do: wishing some faire conclusion to their resistlesse affection: and to become a witnesse himselfe of the consummation of that Rite, which these two Lovers had in such strong pursuit accompanied with an eager, but a chaste delight. Nay; this discreet Hermit imployed his conceipt a little further: contriving a course how and where to place them for the present: till the storme were over-blowne, and a calmer season might promise some respite to their feares. For that private Graunge, wherein they then sojourned, could neither be so secure, as to priviledge them from search: nor so remote from jealous eyes, as to keep them any long time unknowne. And a neare Ally unto Androgeus dwelled not far off, who, upon the least notice of Doricleas retire to that place, would soone acquaint her Father, and prevent their enjoyment by a speedy surprize. So serious was the poore Hermits care, as these two Lovers could not be more faithfull in their fancy, then he was carefull for their safety. Nor was it requisite, that his care should have beene either lesser, or his advice weaker, amidst such perillous concurrents, as you shall understand hereafter.  How these constant Lovers were hindred upon the very point of solemnization of their marriage, by the intelligence and pursuit of her incensed Father Androgeus: who with a strong prepared Troupe ent'red the House where these two unfortunate Lovers sojourned: And how, by the Hermits device, Philocles to prevent his fury, was privately conveyed.  that preceding night to their Nuptials. Right pleasing was the Hermits advice unto them: which, next morning, long before any Canonicall houre, they addressed themselves to put in practise. Those hearts, which had been so long plighted, expected now, nothing more, then to see those Rites accomplished; and which they hoped, Heavens would propitiously look upon, though her Parents dissented. Hourely they expected the man that should performe it: who, at last there arrived, to solemnize what they expected. Nothing was wanting that so private a place could afford them. The Hermit must personate her Father, to bestow her on Philocles , her dearest Lover. No Clarks they needed, their own naked breasts would confirme, whatsoever the Priest should pronounce. But heare, O heare, yee dis-passionate Lovers, and hearing, resolve your eyes into teares! Then, even then when they should hand in hand go up to that sacred place, which admitted no feet but those of peace; they might heare resounding in their eares, nothing but allarms and noise of war. This pittifully affrighted that small assembly: howbeit, so strongly steeled with resolution was Philocles fancy, as with much confidence he willed the Minister to go on; and if any were to incurre censure, he would be the man, who would interpose himselfe betwixt death and danger. But by this time had a strong Guard enter'd the House, the noise of whose fury so increased the poore mans Palsey, as he could go on no further for a world. Thus were these constant Lovers hindred, upon the very point when their Marriage-Rites should be solemnized: which came to passe by the intelligence and pursuit of her incensed Father Androgeus : who with a strong prepared Troupe, well-armed against any one that should make resistance, in a furious invasive manner ent'red the House (Hymens dishonour'd house), where those two unfortunate Lovers resided. An unhappy sojournall; where such Comicall hopes become wholly Tragicall! And mount will Androgeus with all his company, there is no remedy. Which Philocles perceiving, as one resolved rather to imbrace death, then ingage his fame to an ignoble life; or to accompany that miserable life with discontent: on he intends to go against all assailants,  & in the presence of his Doriclea against the daringst Combatant bid defiance. He esteemes him unworthy the purchase of such a prize, who will suffer his thoughts to be seaz'd on by any Panick feare. Death, he knowes, to be the companion of mortality, and to be affraid of that which he must necessarily endure, he holds worthy of no better name then a cowardly care. He observes, how fortune h'as been ever his profest foe; valour then must be his friend. And armed with this spirit, downe he resolves to go, but is staid by Doriclea ; who was now become all Niobe ; Limbecks were her eyes of teares; a Furnace was her brest of scalding sighes; a constant Fever surpriz'd her joynts; yet with these did her sweet condition enforce a smile: and with this, mixed with a pearled teare did she beg this Boone of her deare Philocles . "Do not, oh do not, dearest Love, cast your selfe away; by exposing your life to such apparant, nay, inevitable danger. One is enough to perish; and let me be that one to secure my Philocles . If not, let me become an Advocate for my Philocles . A Fathers hand will spare his Daughter: and, perchance, for her sake pardon her Lover. Trust me, Philocles , you shall not bouge a foot; your wrastling is in vaine with Doriclea ; perish with me you may, without me you cannot. The whole World would exclaime against me, and tax me of a key- cold fancie, should I suffer you even before mine eyes to oppose your selfe against my Fathers fury. Be advised then, my dearest Philocles , you shall not go; trust me, you shall not go. Death and danger with naked breast will I sooner encounter, then ingage your safety to the remorselesse hand of my Father. Retire then, and let me be your Advocate, wherein should I faile, my extreamest fate can be no worse then I expect it." With which words leaping forth of his armes, with a virile spirit, she went downe staires: where she met her furious Father comming up. Who, upon the very sight of her, was so incensed, as scarce any perswasion could prevaile so far with him, as to hold his revenging hand from inflicting too severe a punishment on his Daughter. Who appearing as one nothing at all amased, and desiring above all others to have her dearest Philocles secured: which she conceived by protracting time in this hazardous expostulation with her Father, to be best effected: in a composed modest manner, after such time, as with an humble knee she had begged pardon to beget more compassion in an equall hearer, she in this sort, addressed her selfe to her inraged Father. "Deare Sir, look on me,    [   Doriclea's Speech to her Father.   ] or I am lost for ever. It is true, I have justly incurred your displeasure: and I am sorry for it, and with the sacrifice of my dearest life, would I seek to redeeme it. I have transgressed those religious bounds of childelike obedience, and not only ingaged my selfe but One, whose welfare I prefer before my selfe, to infinite dangers. Yet cast me not off for this. If you would have me live, let me enjoy him whom I love. Let me but partake in your blessing, I shall expect no other portion: the free fruition of my fancy, shall be unto me an ample fortune. Alas! what comfort would a Father reape in the matching of his Daughter: when an enforced uniting of hands should beget a dividing of hearts: and make her such a miserable Bride, as she shall with her Bed changed into a Grave? That Bridall feast, her Funerall, to invite a mournfull guest? And this were Doricleas case, to impaune her virgin-state to such a curse. O then, by these unfeined teares, this humble-bended knee, your poore distressed Daughters prayers, look on me; and make me his, who do'es so entirely love me! And lesse, deare Sir, you cannot make me; since my faith h'as confirm'd me his, which cannot be dispensed by me. For such Sacred Vowes are too strong tyes to be loosed:    [  Our pure Vowes of love, are Sign'd above ] being recorded in Heaven, where such contracts can never be cancelled. Injoyne me what you please, so you injoyne me not to leave Philocles: for sooner may Doriclea leave from being her selfe, then leave his love whom choice without changeh'as confirm'd my second selfe. If the true obedience of your lowly Daughter may expiate this offence (and alas this offence is only love) that Task shall not be by a Father imposed, which shall not be by a Daughter freely embraced." This Speech wrought more remorce in her auditory, then in her Father; as may appeare by his discontented answer. " Doriclea , but my Doriclea , I shall never accompt thee;    [ Androgeus Answer to his Daughter   ] tell me, canst thou look on thy Father, thy dishonoured Father, and not blush at so egregious an errour? Shall my Family receive an ignominious brand from my Countrey, through thy loose and irregular liberty? Is there no remedy, but my gray-haires must be brought with sorrow to their grave? Have I bred thee, Viper-like, to destroy me? Go on, and see the issue of it. Prefer the love of Philocles , before the blessing of Androgeus . Disclaime that obedience thou doest owe me; bestow thy selfe on him, who of all others is most contemned by me. Thou canst not contract this unhappily spun threed of life, before the Destinies will. Meane time, expect revenge; for believe the indignation of a Father, who intends to take a full revenge of this licentious affection of that inconsiderate Philocles : and make him glad to relinquish his suit, by entertaining the meanest state, to secure his life. Reserve then those knees, for whom thou reservest thy selfe; those easie-enforced tears, for him who thou preferrest before thy self; those undevout prayers, to continue his love, whom thou meanest to make thy second- selfe. But this fruitlesse expostulation foreslowes my revenge; I will see if I may finde the trace of this bold Libertine; whose pleasing oratory h'as so deluded thee: whom having found, I shall shortly divert the current of your fancy, and by a legall course deprive him of future liberty." And presently upon these words, neither Doricleas prayers nor teares, nor the perswasion of his entirest friends could so farre prevaile with him, as to keepe him from ascending the staires. But such good opportunity had these passionate debates below given to that discreet Hermit above, as by his device, Philocles , to prevent his fury, was privately conveyed: so as, what Androgeus expected; could not be pursued. None findes he above but the old Hermit, and that intended agent for solemnizing their Nuptials, who was as full of fear as Androgeus was of fury: but wisely pretending himself to be one of the Family, he passed by him without much inquiry. So unexpectedly was this pleasing Morne darkned with a sullen Cloud. Two friends, then which none more dearer, must be divided; all occasion of recourse one to another, henceforth debarred; this faithfull Hermit, who addressed his discreet care for their cure; to his Cell confined. Thus must me leave all things dis-joynted and out of orders a discontented Father contesting with his Daughter; a dis-passionate Daughter labouring to appease her Father: all which have power enough to perplexe a Family, and beget rumoue in a Countrey, as you may heare hereafter.  Androgeus brings back his Daughter; the entertainment given her by her Mother.  depart. Leave her Philocles she must without taking leave. For having laboured (as was formerly expressed) to appease her incensed Father, but all in vaine; she, before she could come into the roome, (that sorrowfull roome) wherein she had left her Philocles , by the device of that discreet Hermit, to prevent Androgeus fury, which admitted no treaty, was he conveyed, and with that privacy, as he became priviledg'd from discovery. Along now must Doriclea go with her Father: who, desiring nothing so much as to surprize her conveyed Lover, but prevented of what he most expected, he holds himselfe for the present sufficiently content with the reskue of his Daughter. Whom he hoped to reclaime from this madding affection (for so he conceipted) by one meanes or other. A dayes journey, at the most, they had scarcely travelled, till Androgeus with his Company arrived where he desired: and bringing his perplexed Daughter in his hand to her Mother, to this effect he recommended that charge unto her. Euryclea , I have brought back at last your dainty Daughter; and prevented what her wilde fancy was incurring: she desired much to be our late Pedant Philocles his Bride: all things were prepared to accomplish what they intended; and had not timely intelligence frustrated this designe, she had to both our discomforts beene unworthily married. It was my aime to have intercepted Philocles ; who, since his escape from prison, hath beene more forward in the pursuit of his desires then before: but how, or by what way conveyed I know not, him I could not finde, so ready was some friend of his to expedite his escape. Now must I recommend this charge to you, Euriclea , as you tender our honour, and the reputation of your Daughter, to reteine a more circumspect eye of her Walkes then you have hither to done. Let such attend her, as will not be deluded by her. Mellida h'as been too much her friend: whose indiscreet counsell, had it succeeded, had made her selfe her only foe. Abridge not her liberty, so you be confident of her company. Too much privacy may hurt her health: as too much liberty revive her love. Time may weare out these prints of youthfull fancy. Imployment or delightfull company, being such as may suit with virgin modesty, may finde power to discampe these dangerous Assailants, which so mainly work upon the inward quiet of the minde. I make little doubt, Euryclea , but your kinde heart will be too tender, to inflict on her any heavie censure. Be it as you please, seeing to your charge, care, and cure, I freely recommend her. So tender-hearted was Euryclea , that at the very first sight of her Daughter she could not refraine from teares: oft did she feine anger, and with a furrowed brow foreshow a tempest: but her teares were in earnest her anger in jeast. Yet desirous to schoole her, and in such manner as her discretion conceiv'd, would leave the deepest impression in her, she receives no other entertainment but this from her Mother. "Disobedient Girle, what faire fruits have our deceiving hopes produced? How often have I colour'd thy private escapes, and enjoyned this whole Family not to publish thy folly? What pleasing promises have I received from thee, that all should be amended, Philocles undeserving love rejected; and those Suiters entertained, whose fortunes might raise thy preferment? And what requitall hast thou given thy Mother, for her care, too tender care, on thee conferred by her? Now it is in vaine to stay the tongue of Rumour: the whole Countrey resounds with the report of Doriclea and her wandring Lover. And how gladly would I be to still this report, to recover thy repute! Well, there appeares yet a little hope, which relyes on this one and only helpe. As good fortune was, all this time Mardunes h'as been abroad, and so farre remote from us, by reason of his occasions elsewhere calling him, as this report of your straying course may happily yet be concealed from him. Let then that love which you so lately pretended, be continued. Once againe, let a Mothers teares or threats prevaile so farre with you, as to estrange your thoughts from him, whom you must not affect. Be perswaded, Girle; let not poverty come in at one doore, while love goes out at th' other. Let not your fame receive a blemish from your indiscreet choice: with our blessing you cannot enjoy him, timely then relinquish him: I will not have too strict an hand over you; so tenderly presuming am I of you. An hard, and harsh task were it for me to enjoyne you ought that might deservingly beget your discontent. Tender then a Mothers care, and prevent her feare: her care to procure your good; her feare lest you should prevent her care. Be thus prepared, and you shall not only redeeme the time you have lost; but regaine our esteeme, with the ample interest of our love: which you have so strangely forfeited, as it resteth in your obedience only to repaire it."  Doriclea labours to free her Mother from all jealousie touching her love to Philocles : pretending, that he had voluntarily made himselfe a banished man to his Countrey, through feare of their fury and enmity.  then Doriclea , desirous out of a pious duty, to satisfie her Mother; whose passion, tempered by a naturall affection, seemed something allayed; labours to free her Mother from all jealousie, whereof she had received too inducing motives, touching her love to Philocles: and that her defence might appeare grounded upon sufficient reasons, she proceeds in this manner. "Deare mother,    [   Doricleas Speech to her Mother.   ] I must confesse, (and with teares of pious sorrow I lament it) that my indiscreet affection h'as exceeded those bounds which maiden modesty should have kept: by giving too free scope to my own fancy: but let not these be any motives to decline your good opinion from me. There is no offence so great, which repentance may not extepuate. And now to remove all occasion of jealousie, believe it Mother, that never any arguments of love shall be continued betwixt us hereafter. For the feare of your fury, h'as diverted our fancy, and made discontented Philocles a banished man, and that by voluntary censure, to his native Countrey. It is true; our amity begot your enmity; our love your hate. But now, believe the true relation of a Daughter; that ayre which he here breathed, grew distastefull to him, through the distaste you conceived against him. A voluntary exule is he become, and h'as constantly vowed to entertaine that condition, which shall free his youthfull minde from light affection. Indeed, had not my Fathers seasonable comming prevented what our resolves had mutually intended; Neither might he without my consent have enjoyed that liberty: nor my selfe been so freely at your dispose as now I am. But since the Fates would have it so, I shall not only study to obey your commands, in whatsoever you may be pleased to impose: but infinitely rejoyce in performing whatsoever your Parentall awe shall enjoyne. " Philocles appeared no such Adamant to my fancie, that might any way make me to foreflow the discharge of my dutie. Yet must I needs confesse, deare Mother, such was his vertuous love as I could not lesse expresse my selfe then tender him a gratefull requitall for such ample testimonies of his constant affection. Then with your favour be it, that I reteine so thankfull a memory of his professed fancie, as for the present to affiance my selfe to none: love, though it be countermanded, it cannot for the present be extinguished. Meane time, as your tender care h'as been and continues ever for my future advancement: and that Mardanes must be the man, whom you hold fittingst for my choice: so far shall my countnance appeare free from strangenesse; my entertainment of him from nicenesse, as he shall finde no cause of dis-respect from me, nor ought that may dishearten his hopes in pursuit of me. Nay, so entire shall be my obedience, as were the disposition of Mardanes like that of Margites , of whom it is said, that he never plowed, nor digged, planted, nor reaped, nor in private affaires advised, nor discreetly conversed, nor did any thing all his life-long that might tend unto goodnesse, but wholly unprofitable to the world. I should with a free embrace receive him, because your commendations did present him, and your obedience enjoyne me to love him." This ingenuous acknowledgement of her offence, and expression of her obedience, infinitely over-joyed her Mother; but above all others, the relation of the travell of her Lover: Imagining, that all occasions now were removed: and no feare at all that their loves should be hereafter renued. But whatsoever Doriclea pretended, old love could not be so banished. Love she must, but seeme to dis-affect her Philocles . Hate she must, but seeme to affect Mardanes . And so far from coynesse must she seem, as she must have a smile in readines whensoever he comes in presence. And the freedome which her Mother gave her, being now secure of Philocles , ministred occasion to Doriclea , to invent many quaint devices to ingage more strongly her distasted Lover Mardanes to her pretended affection. Whereof he perswaded himselfe to be so firmly possest, as nothing had power to alien her love from him: so as, he began to be so far presuming thereof, as the very least distaste which she might seeme to offer him, received a very harsh construction from him. This might appeare by one occasion which hapned casually, and it was thus. Doriclea , to allay those pressing discontents which surprized her amorous thoughts; would make it her pleasing task now and then to play with fancie: and to discover sundry apparent arguments of her unfeined good-will towards Mardanes , the better to expedite those desires of love-enwreathed Mellida , and to reteine that constant zeale which she religiously professed to her Philocles: diverse private meetings, accompanied with some of her more familiar Consorts, would she purposely appoint to passe an houre or two away (and tedious had the passage of those houres been had not some merriment allaid it) with her late-created Servant, Mardanes . And one time above the rest, she had prefixed him time and place for giving him a more private meeting; but by what occasion I know not, or whether it was not purposely done to delude him, or to try his temper; but he either mistook the Signe where they should meet, or she appointed a place where there was no such Signe: but meet they did not; upon which disappointment being infinitely netled, and presuming whatsoever he writ unto her, would be accepted, in this domineering way, he declared his spirit.  Mistresse; faile, my lines can hardly deliver; much lesse expresse that irreparable Discontent which I suffer. Boyes might be easily without offence deluded, as I was by your a    [   a To prepare a smoother passage to her love-pretended Sceane, She deluded Mardanes with a counterfeit Signe   ] Signe , the like whereof was never yet there founded. But you reply; you were there, but I was gone. Trust me, Mistresse, I stayd there till seven oth' Clock, which was a whole houre beyond the time limited: and finding no such Signe as you named; you may imagine, if I were sensible of so apparant wrong, it could not chuse but work strongly on me. By this, I seriously vow, you have lost that Love, who would have sooner ceased to live, then fall short in ought that might have conduced to your love. This is the resolution of your dis-esteemed Friend.  An other of the same stampe , bearing the like style and state , was this; wherein, (though in a milder temper) he takes occasion to tax her of neglect, in this manner.  Dearest; else I was strangely slighted by you. Trust me, Deare One, your own businesse could not more trouble you, then your neglect of his service and true affection distasted him, who so firmely dedicates himselfe to you! Believe it, this was an unexcusable errour, not to deigne him so much favour, as to acquaint him with your place of aboad; the time of your stay in Towne: nor where he might with conveniency wait on you, to accommodate your affaires with his best advice and assistance. You cannot possibly conceive lesse, then that this was a great tryall of patience: To appeare there disesteemed, where he stood most fixed. Admit hee bee aged; grave yeares beautifide with gray haires are more to be honoured then neglected: nor may your privacies be with lesse alacrity seconded, then if they were with more youthfull blood inflamed. Let your more serious eye look upon these, and I appeale to the justice of your selfe, without any other Referre , whether these have not sensibly and strongly wrought (to your own bosome, I say, I leave it) upon your truly approved and affectionate Servant.  This was Mardanes Letter to Doriclea ; which she might rather have taken for some Challenge, then any Love-present. But this wrought no great alteration upon Doriclea's thoughts. The losse of his love with which he threatned her, could not much perplex her, seeing, his hate closed best with her desires: for of all men, whatsoever she pretended, Mardanes she most hated: but in the pursuit of her aymes, she surceased not to discover all expressions of fancie that might any way promise him successe, that, what she intended for Mellida might be sooner brought to passe. Neither was his spleen so much incensed; nor his spirit so inraged: but at their next meeting those furrowes which before appeared on Mardanes brow for his disappointment, was quickly smoothed. One smile,  & that Heaven knowes, enforced, had power enough to calme that storme, and beget in his amorous thoughts a longing desire to please. Many brave presents would he send her; sundry rich gifts would he bestow on her. All which she returned unto Mellida , for happy presages of what was to ensue. And in giving her these Tokens, she would usually say: How now Mellida! This is no leane love. Happy were thy poor Mistresse, if she might receive but the least of these remembrances from her Servant. But alas! Mine is too far divided from me: distance of place barres us all hope of recourse. Why Mistresse? In what better case am I then your selfe? I love one, and he loves me not: and you love one, who hates you not. I may every day see mine, but I am never any whit the nearer enjoying him. You, though you may not see him, in your desires you enjoy him: and partake in more freedome of love with your Philocles , then ever I expect to do with my Mardanes . Never expect, Wench, replyed Doriclea? Why, pray thee, what accomplish'd parts doest thou see in him, that thy love should not deserve him? Didst thou ever heare any one so highly taken with him, but thy selfe? That's no matter, said Mellida : but I am sure a neater personage is there not in mine eye, in all the World. And how far would poore Mellida goe, to receive one pleasing smile from him? That were an excellent precious Pilgrimage, answered Doriclea . Surely, Wench, thou wouldest gladly play Pilgrim, to undertake a journey for such a Lossell. But thou doest well to be constant, nor shall I ever perswade thee to change thy choice. Change my choice, said Mellida ! No, may I sooner change to Earth. Alas! my desires are not great: nor my ambition high. Might I but be entertained to be his Handmaid; to attend him; though as his unworthy Consort I might never enjoy him: this would in some measure content me. Yea, quoth Doriclea , but this perchance, would in time beget in thee discontent. Discontent, said Mellida , and be in the presence of my Mardanes ; how could that be! By seeing other Creatures of the same Sex, answered Doriclea , received, while thou were't rejected. Indeed, said Mellida , I should hardly endure to see that:  No earthly crosse may haste so bitter prove, As to admit Corrivals in our love. And yet, me thinks, I should never love him worse: seeing, I could conceive no other cause of their too much love, but his perfection. And were it reason that I should hate him, because others love him: or fall short in my esteeme, because others did so highly prize him? And yet, I must confesse, I could not well suffer another to become too familiar with him. Patience could beare no more then it could: and a breast I have ready to embrace any injury, rather then digest such apparant grounds of jealousie. Thus privately used these two to bestow some houres of the day in discourse: wherein Doriclea ever reteined so admirable a temper: as no extremity of passion was ever seen outwardly to work upon her. Love she could, and constantly: forego the presence of her love she could, and modestly. Expectance in this only made her happy: this combate with contrary fortune would not hold out still; she at last hop'd to obtaine a victory: and therein more glorious, in that her bickrings were more grievous. A suspicious sigh must not leape from her; nor an amorous teare betray her: her own heart must be the treasury of her care, till patience crown her hopes with a more soveraign cure. Neither was she more discreet in her love, then he perswasive in his line: for now you must suppose him estranged from his Countrey, divided from all thoughts of fancy, and if you will believe his own hand, such a strict Convert, as Doriclea may have small hope to make him her Consort.  Philocles writes a Letter to Androgeus , as directed from beyond the Seas: wherein he humbly craves pardon, for his too bold attempting his Daughters affection. How his present austere penitentiall life shall witnesse to the World his repudiation of all light love. How his devotions now were reserved for Heaven, and had no communion with Earth. And that the choice he had now made, should during life admit no change.  stranger; exposed to winds and waves, and divided fro his friends. Nay, since his supposed arrivall, he pretends his induction into so strict a profession, as it proclaimes him to the World an Alien to all youthful affection. But what Harbour received him, or what place this was which harbour'd him, or what Profession it was that admitted him, appeares not fully by any Relator: howbeit, what he was, and what he resolved to continue, may appeare sufficiently by his own Letter.  to be directed from beyond the Seas, may seem strange; and yet know, noble Sir, that this is true. He, even he, who sometimes affected irregular love, h'as now betaken himselfe to a regular life: and in this his poore mendicant profession, humbly craves pardon (and be it your generous pity to encline to his suit) for his too bold attempting your Daughters affection. It was love, and that seasoned with as much vertuous constancy, as youth could afford. But know now, deare Sir, that his present austere penitentiall life shall witnesse to your selfe, whom he h'as so highly offended, and to the whole world, wherein he h'as too long youthfully sojourned, his repudiation of all light love. And too long, Heavens know too long, h'as he there lived where true discretion could finde nothing worthy to be entirely loved. For what shall man finde there but a Tragick Theatre hung about with Arras presenting a numerous confluence of feares and cares? All complete Actors , but their Play-bill beares no better style then A Comedy of Errors . To see a Man turne himselfe into all shapes like a Camelion, or as Proteus , transforming himselfe into every prodigious forme: to act twenty parts at once for his advantage; to temporize and vary like Mercury the Planet, good with good, bad with the bad; to forme himselfe to all religions, humours, inclinations; to fawne like a Spaniell, rage like a Lion, bark like a Curre, fight like a Dragon, sting like a Serpent; as meek as a Lambe, and yet againe grim like a Tyger, weepe like a Crocodile, insult over others, and yet others insult over him; here to command, there crouch, tyrannize in one place, be baffled in another; a wise man at home, a foole abroad to make others merry. Then to reflect upon the indignity of the Age. To see a Scholer crouch and creepe to an illiterate Pesant for a meales meat. For there is nothing, from which Learning receives more dishonour, then to have her freedome ingaged to anothers Trencher. A Scrivener better paid for an Obligation, then for a studied Sermon; a Faulkner receive better wages then a Student; a Lawyer get more in a day, then a Philosopher in a yeare; better rewarded for an houre, then a Scholler for a yeares study: He that can paint Thais , play on a Fidle, curle haire,  &c. sooner get preferment then a Philosopher or a Poet. And is not this a dainty Theatre to win the heart of a discreet Spectator; where Love and Hate are like the two ends of a Perspective-glasse: one multiplies, the other makes all things lesse? O how rightly did that moderne Stoick invey against those inhumane qualities in Man: which, if he did but see into himselfe, he should finde so unmanly, as they made him altogether unlike himself! c  2 How shall I know thee to be a Man (said that Golden-mouth'd Divine) when thou kickest like an Asse, neighest like an Horse after Women, ravest in lust like a Bull, ravenest like a Beare, stingest like a Scorpion, rakest like a Wolfe, as subtile as a Fox, as impudent as a Dog; shall I say thou art a Man, that h'as all the symptomes of a Beast? How shall I know thee to be a Man, by thy shape; that affrights me more, when I see a Beast in likenesse of a Man? And what did poore Philocles encounter withall, so long as he conversed with the World, but Creatures of this condition? Well then might mine eye, my strangely deluded eye, be made the sense of sorrow, because the sense of sinne. Nought could I see but did wound me: no pleasing Object but did pollute me. Only my thoughts, deare Sir, were so free from harbouring one light conceipt of your vertuous Doriclea: as I saw in her that goodnesse as disheartned any loose attempt. And may your Age receive that comfort in her, as those easie errors which too deservingly bred your distaste, may be redeemed by a fuller surplusage of content. My desire shall be only this, that you would not decline your affection from her, for her sometimes bestowing so much undeserving respects on me. Divided am I now from her, and all the World: and who knowes but that I was thus prevented in my love, to the end I might be weined in my love from the World? Admit then my Plea; and let it receive place: seeing my devotions are now reserved for Heaven, and reteine no communion with Earth. Love was never to converted Philocles so familiar, as it is now a stranger. It now rests, that my best prayers ever accompany you; and that my teares wash off those wrongs J have done you. Be it your piety to have mercy, and to look on Philocles resolve, who h'as set up his rest upon this stake, that the choice he h'as now made, shall during life admit no change. Philocles.  This good Androgeus expounded, to be that new course of life or religion, or whatsoever else he had so lately professed: but constant Philocles had another meaning, which he ever expected time would bring to perfection. Howsoever, Androgeus was not a little cheered in the perusall of this Letter: the Contents whereof so well freed his suspitious thoughts from this mortified Lover, as hee could not containe himselfe from expressing the joy he conceived, which to this effect he discovered. "Well done, Philocles! In this course thou hast taken, thou procurest thy selfe peace; and us rest. Thou hast done rightly to disesteeme fancie, and to preferre thy private Study before such a vanitie. There is no comparison betwixt pure devotion and light affection. Content is of ampler extent then the whole Continent. And if my serious care prevented thy indiscreet love, be it thy love, in thy private devotions, to remember my care. Thou saist, thou hast now set up thy rest; and in this thou hast done right. Worldly love and Heavenly contemplation suit ill together. Thou could'st not here enjoy whom thou lovedst with our consent; thou didst well then to relinquish her love, the purchase whereof might beget thy ensuing discontent. How happy had many bin, if they had been so prevented: for so had they never tasted those miseries which they so unfortunately incurred." As Androgeus was thus privately discoursing of Philocles late profession, which he conceived to be so sincere, as all occasion of further renuall of his Daughters love and his was wholly removed: Euryclea came to him, to whom he read the Letter which he had received from Philocles . Wherein they equally joyed; while Euryclea related to her Husband the free entertainment which their Daughter, upon her direction, had given to Mardanes ; and how she feared not, if they gave approvement to it, but that would be very shortly a Match. And though, said she, there be a disparity in their yeares; that will beget our Daughter more esteeme. And a good life with an Husband exceeds all youthfull love. And yet I must tell you Husband, said Euryclea , if his harsh disposition should either beget in him a jealousie, or any other unbeseeming quality, I should chuse rather to go to her Buriall then her Bridall. For, poore Girle, her good condition would brook so ill that surly humour, as it would discourage her for ever. And I have heard his disposition was none of the best: and what were it then to enjoy all his estate, and want the comfort of a contented life? Our care h'as neither been so weak, nor Gods providence so small; as that the Portion we intend to conferre on her, may not procure her such a Match, as may suit with her desires both for competency of estate and equality of yeares. And for my part Husband, said she, I never knew any Match made up for wealth only, that ever begot comfort to the party. And you your selfe know Husband, that when at first I preferred you in my choice, the very least thing that wrought upon my affection was your wealth: and yet have we had ever enough,  & so much the more, in regard we thought love in those dayes to be enough. How is it, Euryclea , said Androgeus , that you plead so much in defence of poverty, and would not admit of Philocles , who was none of those who had superfluity? One must make a vertue of necessity , replyed Euryclea . I know Philocles , to be poore enough, and to love Doriclea enough. But our Daughter was not to ground her love on every poore Lover, for that might have made her a poore Liver: but so to plant her fancie, as neither the undeservingnesse of the man might beget in her a neglect of duty, nor a coldnesse of affection by meanes of poverty. To divert then the current of her love, I made choice of one for her, who had sufficient whereon to live. That by comparing the want of a Scholler, with the wealth of a worldly improver, she might the sooner discerne her errour, and betwixt these two cull out one, whom she might both approve and love: and expresse himselfe worthy her choice, by his faire and affable temper. Yea, said Androgeus , but it was dangerous to give opportunity to fancie; which it seemes you have done to Mardanes already. Alas, good Old Man, answered Euryclea , there is small doubt but his yeares have so tempered him, as in affaires of love, his moderate desires rather aime at a Consort then a Play-fellow: one to cheere and comfort him, then with light dalliance to solace him. And could you then endure one in the prime of her youth, whose posterity should be the comfort of your age, to close in such unequall imbraces: and by living where she does not love, make her grieve that ever she did live? No, Androgeus ; no, replyed Euryclea ; my desires are that she may live, where just grounds of discontent may never give her occasion to grieve. And this, I think, she very hardly will finde in Mardanes ; for as the richest treasure closed in a Chest, affords but small comfort to the Owner; when to his own he becomes a Prisoner: so all outward substance, be it heaped up in never so much abundance, can scarcely minister the least portion of content to a minde ingaged to all heavinesse. But our Girle shewes no such thing; for if she dissemble not, (and I verily think her condition will not admit it) since my direction, she h'as profest more love to Mardanes , then any other that ever suited her excepting Philocles . Nay, she will not stick sometimes to say, that her unmannaged youth stands in need of such a Tutor: and that since Philocles absence and reliction, reverend age was the most taking Object to her affection. If it be so, said Androgeus , the Girle shall have her minde: but I am perswaded, when fresh youth comes in the presence of age, though she pretend reverence to age, she will incline rather to imbrace youth. Thus discoursed her Parents of their Daughters love, but were farre from diving into her heart, to search out for whom she reserved her constant love. But love she must; for tender is their care to bestow her where both person and fortune may give her content. But all is not Gold that glisters; nor all winners that are Wooers. For though she have an enforced smile for Mardanes , she reteines an heart full of care of the safety of her Philocles .  Doriclea fals (or seemingly fals) into a Fever; each day seemes to increase her distemper: Eschites , an experienc'd Physician is sent for to apply his best art in a case of such extremity: but he, an intimate friend to Philocles , makes show as if he despair'd of her recovery. And that no Malady arising from fancy, could without enjoyment of the Object loved, receive remedy.  Art may receive approvement, Love and no other Object should be the instrument. This Doriclea feeles, who now fals (or seemingly fals) into a Fever. Long is it now since Philocles absence; but longer to her conceipt then any other: having not as yet heard from him since his departure from her. From the benefit then of fresh aire, which could not chuse but infinitely cheere her, she retires: making her selfe a stranger to those Groves and Gardens wherein she walked; and betakes her selfe to her Bed, where she privately expostulates with fancie, recalling to minde wherein soever she had suffered. A violent Fever within some few dayes after strongly seazed on her: which whether it was seeming, or so indeed, I will not here dispute, but each day to the great griefe of her Parents, seemed to increase her distemper. Sleepe was a stranger to her eyes; meat distastefull to her palat, and loathing to her stomack. A great desire she had to be private: pretending, that much talk distemper'd her braine: and willed her Maid to keepe the Curtaines ever closely drawne, saying, that nothing weakned her eyes more then light. Mellida , who knew best next to her own breast, what most disquieted her, when she was at any time sure that none could over-heare them, whether it were to cheere her, or to impart her own griefs unto her, would use in this manner to converse with her. "Good Mistresse rouse up your spirits, do you think lying in Bed will serve the turne? But if you will not be so much a friend to your selfe, I pray you befriend your selfe for my sake. Alas, all this time while you lye sobbing and sighing here, my Suit to Mardanes growes cold. And I must tell you a secret too Mistresse; but none must know of it, for if they should, it might be a great blemish to my credit. Truth is, as truth ever goes farthest, that since you fell into this distemper I became mine own Solliciter: but I made bold still with your name. And in very deed, (this you may think to be an immodest part, but I am sure it came from a loving heart) I sought in my Letter directed in your name, to know the time when he would make me his own." Fye, Girle, answered Doriclea , thou hast spoiled all: proffer'd love had never yet good savour. And in the meane time thou hast brought me upon the stage in a dainty fashion: by making Mardanes believe that I am liberall enough of my reputation. But, pray thee, Wench, what answer receivedst thou? "Nay, Mistresse, said Mellida , you shall know all; but I pray you impute it to my too much love, if my love h'as wronged your name. But the harshest answer did I receive from him, that ever poore Wench received from any one, loving so dearly as I did." And with that, opening her bosome, she pull'd forth a Paper, which she reached to her Mistresse, containing this Answer.  modesty; I shall close in an equall-line, sorting with our joynt desires, when I shall see mine own time: and may meet best both with your occasion and mine owne. Meane time, trust me, this importunity rather duls then sharpens fancy: So rests he, who will euer reteine a true estimate of your honour.  Doriclea could not chuse but smile, though her heart were ill at ease, to heare this insulting humour of deluded Mardanes: but at first she knew not well whether to be angry at her Maids forwardnesse, or to pitty her weaknesse: so as, raising her selfe a little in her Bed she used these words unto her. "Surely; Mellida , thou canst not possibly be so simple as thou makest thee. Thou hast now made a one hand of it: to make thy own Sweet-heart beleeve that without his love I cannot live. Thou hast brought mine honour unto the Stake: and I must in hope to get thee an Husband, be thought, nay be rumour'd, that I beg one. Nay, it is very likely that he will now out of his Pesantly condition slight my affection, because too freely offered: or conceipt strangely of my modesty,  & with much easinesse cashiere me: and what then will become of thee? All wayes then are stopped; all meanes prevented; when I my selfe, who sought by pretending love to him, to match thee to him, shall be so contemned by him, as he shall hold me unworthy of him. Alas, Mistresse, answered Mellida , pardon my kinde heart, that could hold no longer then it could. Had I lov'd lesse, my modesty had been more. But truly Mistresse, I am so troubled with phantasies sleeping and waking, that if I have him not, I shall not be long mine own woman. Yet, rather Mistresse, then you receive any dishonour by my indiscreet love, I shall write in your name how my mind is altered, and that I never bore him so much love, as now I heare him hate; I care not, I will do it, rather then displease you; though it should break my heart. Doriclea pitied much the Girles humour; willing her by no meanes to discover the least token or semblance towards Mardanes of displeasure. And that so soone as she should be able to leave her Bed, she would spare no labour nor profession of favour to purchase her desires. But she held it fit to use some small intermissions to make him sharper: for such Haggards, said she, are soone cloyed; they must then see their Game seldome, and by rare and easie flights become sharpned. Hawks full gorg'd will stoope to no Lure, nor seaze on no Prey. No more will thy ancient Sweetheart, if he finde thee too plyable to his Call. Nothing cheered Mellida so much as to heare her Mistresse so well appeased: resolving to be only directed by her: what issue soever should befall of her love. But as they were thus discoursing, the Parents of Doriclea came into the Chamber, bringing with them one Eschites , an Artist of knowne experience, approved judgement, and in his Profession of such honest imployment; as his chiefest care was his Patients cure: scorning nothing more then to spin out time, or to practise Plebotomy upon his Patients Purse, or to magnifie his Cures with Mountebank Bils. Such an one was this judicious Physitian, who they brought to their Daughter, as to his Profession he was an honour, and to his Countrey under God, a soveraigne succour. Him therefore they besought to apply his best receipts, and to exercise the height of his Art in a case of such extremity: as they should be ready to gratifie his care, her cure, with an ample expression of their love. But promises of rewards were the lowest of his motives: his greatest gaine was in his accompt to do good. And because delay might prejudice his cure; drawing neare to her Bed-side, and taking her gently by the wrest of her hand, felt her pulse; which, though for want of naturall rest, discovered some distemper, yet could not he gather either by Pulse, Urine, or any Symptome, that she could be seased on by any violent Fever. Imagining then (and his imagination hit right) that there was some other private distemper which wrought extreamely on her; and purposing to search out the quality of her disease, if either Art or industry could effect it; he requests her Parents absence with the rest that were in the roome, pretending that he was to try an experiment, wherein the privacy of his Art would not so fitly comply with their presence. "And now the Room being voyded,    [   Eschites Speech to Doriclea . ] Eschites taking her by the hand, said thus unto her. Mistresse, if I have any judgement, as my long experience should teach me some, you may be a Physitian to your selfe, if you please. Nay, it is in your own hand to kill or cure." I do not know your meaning (answered Doriclea ) but surely, Sir, you have no such strange conceipt of me, as to think my selfe so much my own foe, as not to cure my selfe if I could. I have not, Mistresse, said he, but my skill failes me, if you may not do much if you would. I pray you let me ask you one thing, Mistresse; are you not strongly troubled with imaginations? I have a phantasie, quoth she, as others have, and that must needs according to the nature of it, be discursively wandring here and there, but never fixed on any one Object. I will burne my Books, said Eschites , if that prove so. Come, Mistresse, I must be round with you; your minde h'as begot in your body this distemper: your blood had never beene infected, had not your minde beene first to love affected. Be then so much a friend to your selfe, as either labour to forget him: or by imparting your thoughts more freely to your Parents, to enjoy him. This is the best receipt that Art can apply to you; which if you reject, dye, and who will pitty you? Doriclea wondred much how Eschites art could possibly so soone make him of her Cabbinet counsell; as so quickly to discover her infirmity. Bnt long it was before her modesty would admit any such discovery. At last, with a winning kinde of reluctancy, after a Vermillion blush, which plaid the shamefast Harbinger to prepare way for what should come after, she disclosed her griefe freely to Eschites , in this manner. "Sir,    [ Doriclea discovers her griefe to Eschues .   ] so presuming am I of your secrecy, as a poore Patient intends to make her Physitian, her Secretary: nor am I lesse confident of your care then your cure: of your care to keepe my counsell; then of your desire to cure my Malady. I shall here relate to you, what I meant to have buried with me. It is true Sir, there is one that I have lodged neare my heart, and remove him I cannot; and enjoy him I may not. Nor will I conceale from you any thing: the Man who h'as taken this place is Philocles , now a banished man to his Countrey; which censure he h'as voluntarily incurred and cheerefully imbraced to decline my Parents fury. And his absence it is, Sir, that h'as begot in me this infirmity." No sooner did Eschites hear Philocles named, then he rejoyced much to have so faire an occasion offered him, both in respect of his Patient whom he desired to recover: as likewise for the advancement of his friend Philocles , whose former acquaintance had ingag'd his respects more then any other. To palliat all things then with more art: he intends to work a cure without applying any medicinall receipt: and this must be by Argument, for otherwise he knowes not how to effect it. And now a fit opportunity is given him: for this perswasive receipt must not be ministred to his Patient , but her Parent. Who desirous to heare what the Physitians opinion was touching their Daughter, came in the very instant; which prevented Doriclea from imparting her mind any more at that time to Eschites. Androgeus beckning oft to the Physitian, demanded of him what he thought of his Daughter, and whether he had hope to recover her or no. Eschites withdrawing himselfe a little from her bed side, and taking her Parents aside, begun freely to discover his opinion of her in this manner. Sir,    [   Eschius opinion of Doriclea .   ] as it h'as never beene my use in the whole course of my profession to delude my Patient with vaine hope, where I found my receipts could afford no helpe: so I must ingenuously tell you what I think without flattering you: in cases of this extremity, I finde small hope of recovery: unlesse her youth be a meanes to repell the malignity of this humour. Nature is much weakned in her. Her sleepe, which is the very dew of the braine, h'as left her. Nourishment will she take none, and if she did, yet by reason of obstructions in the Orifice of her stomack, it would not digest with her. So as, should I apply purgative or ligative medicines unto her, yet would they work small effect, by meanes of those indisposed humours which have got dominion over her. Shall I tell you my minde freely? It is not in the vertue of hearbs that may returne her remedy: her malady proceeds from fancy: which must receive cure from the Object it loves, or no hope of recovery. Having delivered his opinion in this sort, he took Androgeus and Euryclea by the hand: desiring to know of them whether their Daughter had not at any time professed love to some Gentleman or other in those parts: or whether she had not discovered so much unto them? yes, answered Androgeus , she doted too much upon one Philocles , whom I here reteined for her Schoolemaster: one of knowing parts, but weak fortunes. Then it seemes, said Eschites , you crossed her in her desires. We did indeed, answered Androgeus ; for we conceived that such a marriage would redound highly to her dishonour, to marry a poore private Scholler: and therefore sought to decline her affection that way. Which, like an obedient childe, she h'as since that time done; and observed our directions with that care, as an ancient Gentleman, and one whom you well know, whose rising fortunes may highly advance her, h'as lately renued his suit unto her: whom she with all faire respect entertaines. So as her former indiscreet fancy seemes wholly banished: and consequently her Malady, if it should proceed from any such occasionall fancy, perfectly cured. Alas, replyed Eschites , what your Daughter may pretend is one thing, but what she intends is another. Affection I must tell you will be hardly forced: whatsoever her filiall obedience may enjoyne her; love reteines too much soveraignty to be so countermanded: or to extinguish that heat which it first cherished. Thus he, though he professed no such matter, but as an Artist should in delivering his opinion touching their Daughter, expressed himselfe an intimate Friend to Philocles , by making show as if he despaired of her recovery, closing his judgement with this Maxime: That no Malady arising from fancy, could without enjoyment of the Object loved, receive remedy. Which much perplexed her sorrowfull Parents, conceiving by Eschites relation, that the image of Philocles had stamped so deep an impression in their Daughters affection, as the ground of her distemper arose from being so imperiously divided from her Lover.  The Parents of Doriclea conceive incessant griefe for their distemper'd Daughter; they bemoane their neglect of Philocles , and dis-esteeme of his love: But they finde no hope of reliefe to their languishing Daughter, seeing the meanes of her cure was reported to have enter'd a Regular Order.  distemper, then her Parents did for their daughter. Tender was their love, and incessant was the griefe they did conceive. No meanes was left unassaid; no cure unpractised, to regaine her health whom they so dearely loved. But all experiments were in vaine: the more they laboured, the more she languished. So as little could be expected, but that this her encreasing distemper would bring her e're long to pay her debt to nature. This moved Androgeus and Euryclea the tender affectionate Parents of sick Doriclea , to bemoane their neglect of Philocles , and dis-esteeme of his love, which her Father one day discovered with a pensive heart, and passionate voice in this sort. "O Euryclea , how well have we deserved to suffer this affliction, in neglecting Philocles and his honest affection? Admit his fortunes were poore, his conversation was vertuous, his life blamelesse, and his love to our Daughter loyall and religious. Were we to contemne him, because Fortune had not so freely imparted her selfe to him? Was love only to be weighed by meanes, without respect to those inward endowments which conferre the best beauty on man? What comfort might wee have reaped in seeing them live in constancy of love: and composing their mindes to their state; to bestow the residue of their dayes in content? All must not be neglected, whom Fortune h'as not favoured. It is blinde love that is directed by such a deity. And too tyrannous are those Parents to their Children, who labour to enforce their affection." It may be, said Euryclea , that her distemper, for all this opinion of her Doctors, receives ground from some other griefe. For I verily think, Doriclea could not so dissemble with us, as to pretend love to Mardanes , and reteine such a constant remembrance of Philocles . Let us call forth then if you please, her Maid Mellida ; who knowes her minde best, and we shall perceive by her, whether her fancy continue towards Philocles or no. Mellida , who sorrowed no lesse for her Mistresse sicknesse then any: for her distemper wholly declined her hopes from enjoying her Mardanes: acquainted them, how those little short sleepes she had, were full of distractions: and how ever and anon she called upon Philocles . Which so confirmed them, as they presently gathered that his absence had begot this distemper in their languishing Daughter: which highly aggravated their sorrow. Gladly would they recall him, so they might regaine him, but they finde no hope of reliefe to their weak Daughter; seeing the meanes of her cure (the sole cordiall of her care) was reported to have enter'd a Regular Order. No hope then remain'd for her recovery, being so deprived of the Object of her fancy. While they were thus discoursing and descanting of their griefe, one below called for Mellida ; which was a Messenger indeed from Mardanes with a Letter directed to Doriclea : the issue of whose motion her Parents desired much to partake. So as, presently upon Mellida's going in to her Mistresse to deliver this Letter, they went in after her, but with that privacy, as upon the delivery and perusall of the Letter, Doriclea knew not they were there. The Contents of this amorous Scroule were these.  my personall attendance: and trust me so they had, could I have dispensed with one occasion which requires present dispatch. Let not the least conceipt of disloyalty pre-possesse you. I will sooner perchance then your own opinion can assure you, see you, to consummate our joyes, which, by how much the longer delayed, in our fruition will be more sweetned.  Alas, good Man, said Doriclea ! how he troubles his braines to no purpose? As if his personall presence could do me any good, or procure me ease! No, no; unlesse he were transformed into Philocles ; and then the enjoyment of his feature would do me an infinite pleasure. Surely, said Mellida , I could wish with all my heart that we had them both in their own proper shapes: I know who would be the more pretious pearle in my eye. Well, replyed Doriclea , God send thee much good of him, when thou shalt have him. And if I recover my health, whereof as yet I finde small hope, I should make little doubt but by a device I have, to possesse thee of him. I pray God you may have your health restored you soon, said Mellida ; for I am sure you cannot suffer more in your Fever, then I my selfe do, till I be made happy by the free enjoyment of Mardanes favour. This discourse seemed strange to Doriclea's Parents, for they little knew what their Daughter intended by that device: howsoever, they now perceived that the love she pretended to Mardanes was not reall, but dissembling: and that Philocles was the Man who was only interessed in her heart: and that without him she despaired of health. Which could not chuse but strangely perplexe her affectionate Parents; who now, so they might become confident of their Daughters recovery, would easily incline to Philocles fancy. But they were out of all hope to procure her health by this meanes: seeing, retired Philocles was now to his Countrey a stranger, and had enter'd a strict religious Order: which assured them, that he had now disclaimed the title of a Lover.  Eschites undertakes, upon promise of their acceptance, to use his best endeavour for calling Philocles homeward; and that he is resolved, how Philocles time of Probation will bee quickly relinquish'd when he shall heare least hope of enjoying his Doriclea's affection.  languishing distemper. For now her stomack, by feeding on those fancies which her loyall love to Philocles usually suggested, was so sated: as other nourishment she could admit none: unlesse such Julips or Cordials as required no strong digestion: so well became Nature sustained with the very conceipt of affection. Nor is this much to be admired; for if that Maide of Poittiers could abstaine so many yeares from all sustenance, and be surprized by no such fancy; what may we imagine of Doriclea , whose digestive parts were so well satisfied with the thoughts only of her dearest Philocles , as no repast could comparably delight or refresh decayed Nature, so much as the very conceipt or apprehension of his affectionate feature. Her Parents desirous to try all meanes to allay her griefe, and to banish the memory of her transplanted friend from her distemper'd minde: sent for such neighbouring Maides as formerly kept her company to come to her: and to invent one sport or other to passe away the lingring night, or to tell Tales to solace her troubled braine, which for want of sleepe, was much distemper'd. And many pleasant pastimes would these Countrey Girles finde out, purposely to cheere her. While one amongst the rest drawing neare the Bed-side, and taking Doriclea by the hand; Good Lord, Mistresse, said she, what a stirre you make with this love? I am sure for my part I am troubled with a thing as like love as can be, and whether it be downeright love or no I know not: but every night there appeares to my fancy, a dainty proper young Man, but of what Countrey I know not; and to my knowledge, waking I never yet saw him. But trust me Mistresse, I wondrously love him: and if he be no Hob-Trush nor no Robin . Goodfellow , I could finde with all my heart to sip up a Silly-bub with him in my Fathers Broome- pasture. For I shall on my conscience never love any one halfe so well. And yet I know not whether I shall love him when I am waking so well as when I am sleeping: nor do I know whether I should know him, if I should see him: and yet every night I infinitely love him, and could chuse to live with him, if he be flesh and blood, as I hope he is; for else I should not for all the world endure him. Doriclea could not chuse but smile within her selfe to heare this simple Countrey Girle discover her imaginary love in this manner. While an other as simple as the former, but a more reall and substantiall lover, stept forth; and as one angry that her fellow should spend so much time in discovery of a Dreame, or a dreaming fancy, she proceeded in this sort, Sister, what makes you thus trouble Mistresse Doriclea's eares with a story of a Cock and a Bull? Dreames are but fancies of the braine; and a thousand nights have I had such Dreames: and me thought took great delight in such a yongsters company, that I car'd not a Chip for next morning. But I pray you Mistresse Doriclea heare my Fortune: for I love in good earnst; and if he be a just Man of his word, he loves me too. Climenes is the Man, I am not ashamed of my choice: a proper Dapper Youth, and h'as wonne the best prizes from Admetus, Melintus, Palemon , and the activest Youths of all our Parish, at our Summer-Games two yeares together. And my Father, good Man, h'as promised him, that if hee come away with the prizes next yeare againe, he will bestow me on him. And I could wish with all mine heart, that I were his now; for a whole yeare will be too long to languish in love. But one thing now above all others, there is, Mistresse, that grieves me; and it is this, Our Neighbours say, he will never have a Beard; and what a rivell'd Russeting will he look when he comes to age? But if Nature will not be so bountifull to him, if there be a Beard-maker in all our Countrey, I will want of my will but he shall furnish him. Your case is happy in comparison of mine, said the third Girle; one of you loves, and you know not whom; another loves, and may enjoy whom she loves: but my Fortune is harder: for Æ gon profest as much love to me, as ever Suiter did to Woman: and I knew nothing but that he thought as he spake, and would performe what he had promised. But Swaines can dissemble as well as greater Men: for going th' other day to our Parish Church, I might heare the Banes of Marriage publiquely asked betwixt Æ gon and Leucippe: so as, all those professions of love wherein he stood ingaged to his Matilda , must now be renounced, and a new love entertained. And yet, Mistresse Doriclea , I were a Foole to lay that to my heart, which another lyes to his heele. A disloyall Man should never break the heart of a wise Maid. He that can so easily leave his old Love, may stand in need of the least graine of it if he live. Meane time, I hope if I live, to enjoy one who shall more constantly love. Thus discoursed these Countrey Girles, and much content took Doriclea in this relation of their simple loves. But her Father and Mother comming in, prevented all further discourse, for that time. Their Daughter they found still languishing: small or no hope of recovery ministred least comfort unto them. Many times they wished, that they had not opposed her affection, but inclined to her will; for so they might have enjoyed what now by all probability is very likely to be taken from them. And as they were thus bemoaning their sick Daughter, who daily grew weaker in strength, but stronger in her distemper; Eschites came into the Chamber, enquiring how it was with her? Drawing nearer and nearer to her end, answered her Father. Small hope of amends appeares yet. Nor will any probably appeare, to my judgement, said Eschites . No cure can be possibly effected, till the cause be removed. And though the cause of her distemper be too far removed as the case now stands, the cause must be restored, or no recovery to be expected. Androgeus desiring to know what he meant, requested him to explaine himselfe. To whose satisfaction he willingly inclined, and in a grave demure manner, imparted his minde freely to them: discovering both the grounds first introducing, and receipts most soveraigne for curing her distemper. Sir, you may remember,    [   Eschites Speech to Androgeus .   ] how forth of experienc'd grounds of Art, I sometimes told you, which they shall finde true that have neare relation to you: " That no Malady arising from fancy, could without enjoyment of the Object loved, receive remedy . And though love rarely work such effects in these dayes: yet, too neare an instance you have here of your owne, who confirmes what powerfull, nay incurable distempers the quality of love produceth; not only in the affections but constitutions of such who have received such deepe impressions of love, as they must seaze on the person they effect, or cease to live. Too long have you deceived your selves with flattering hopes, expecting that either by strength of Nature, which you may perceive much enfeebled in her, or by Physicall means, which I told you could smally benefit her, she might recover health. And now you see, how farre she is from seconding your hopes: as every day promiseth nothing but a decline from worse to worse. To prevent this, if you expect ever to see her in health againe, give way to my directions: let her enjoy what she h'as so unfeignedly desired. It is Philocles that must performe this Cure, or effectlesse is our Art, fruitlesse our Care. Let him then be called home, whose returne gives me assured hope of her health. Alas, answered Androgeus , if that were possible to be done, we should easily encline to such a motion: but as he is not only divided from us, but enter'd a strict-austere Order, there is small hope that ever his purpose is to returne hither. For since his departure hence, I received a passionate Letter from him: wherein he not only humbly craved my pardon for his indiscreet pursuit of my Daughters affection, but advertised me of his late Conversion. And how that course which he had now embraced, had aliened his thoughts from all light love; and that the choice he had now made, should during life admit no change . Very like, said Eschites ; But I pray you how expound you that Clause? His Choice , no doubt, which he meant by was your Daughter, which he never intended to change . Come Sir, Discourses in affaires of this nature should be used as preparatives of what may succeed after: you desire your Daughters health, and you perceive the meanes to effect it: but out of a scrupulous feare you doubt the way is diverted. What say you unto him that shall expedite the way: and make you happy (if nature be not too much debilitated) in her recovery? We shall be defective in nothing that may further it nor ungratefull to whomsoever shall labour in it, said her Parents. With which words Eschites , who tender'd nothing more then the advancement of his affectionate Philocles , became so encouraged, as he undertakes, upon promise of their acceptance, to use his best endeavour for calling Philocles home-ward. O said Androgeus , fruitlesse will be your endeavour in an assay of that nature! Religious courses must not be so soone diverted: Fancie can now have no place with him, I am perswaded. So as you may to more purpose desist from any such enterprize, then go on with it. Be not so definite in your opinion, nor so constant in your feares, answered Eschites . Admit his thoughts have entertained any such conceipt, it is very likely he is not setled in it: and then I am resolved, how Philocles time of Probation will be quickly expired, and his purpose soone relinquished, when he shall heare the least hope of enjoying his Doriclea's affection. Howsoever, recommend the carriage hereof to my care, and impute the error to my neglect, if I faile in the cure.  Androgeus heares how Philocles , besides his other native endowments, was descended of a generous Family; which enflames his desires more to see him returne into his Countrey. He vowes never to oppose this Solemnity, so his presence may cure her infirmity.  dearely-respected Philocles : and Fortune opened her bounty to Philocles to ingratiate himselfe by the interceding of Eschites . Neither was Androgeus lesse serious to accomplish what his promise had ingaged him to performe upon the undertaking of Eschites . And greater reason he findes to comply with such a motion then before: in regard he heares how Philocles , whom he so much dis-esteemed, as he held it to be a disparagement to his house to incline to any such obscure Match; besides his other native endowments, which well deserved the best of fancie, to be descended of a generous Family, which came to his eare upon this occasion. A Gentleman of quality chanced to come into those parts to enquire of Philocles : with newes that faire fortunes were lately befallen him by death of his Uncle; who had conferred on him his estate, by adopting him for his Heire. And thither was Euphilus , for so was this Gentleman called, directed, to impart these tydings to his affectionate Philocles . These newes came to the hearing of Androgeus , who desiring to become better satisfied touching his descent and fortunes, repaired to Euphilus , to whom he addressed himselfe in this discourse. Sir, I understand you are a stranger in these parts, and have taken your journey hither to enquire after one Philocles : you may be pleased to know that one of that name sojourned sometimes here with me: but whether the same whom you desire to finde, I know not: but by his description you may become better satisfied. The Gentleman whom I so much desire to see, answered Euphilus , was of a middle stature, black hair'd, and sanguine complexion; and to this Coast, as his friends are informed, came he; where he was placed in a Gentlemans house, to teach, and educate his Children. For though his fortunes promised faire upon some expectance hereafter; yet his present meanes were so short, that after some short stay in the University, he retired into the Countrey: for so free-bred and truly generous was his nature, that he could not brook beholdingnesse, nor relye on others dependance. And I must tell you Sir, during all that time wherein we remained together,  & equally communicated our Studies one to another, such infinite cotent we mutually conceived in one & th' others company, as nothing appeared either so gratefull to me, nor so delightfull to him, as the fruition of this Society. So as in time we became Sworne-Brothers: no lesse friendly then freely imparting what either comforted us, or by any other occurrent crossed us, with such confident familiarity to one anothers bosome, as our comforts by partaking one with th' other became highly augmented; and our afflictions, if any such befell, sweetly allayed. This was an excellent argument of unfeined friendship, said Androgeus , and such as deserves approvement with good men. It is true, replyed Euphilus ; but this happy amicable condition of ours could not promise to it selfe any firme nor fixt continuance: for as his disposition became disheartned by some occurrents, so was he enforced to discontinue those Academick Studies wherein he had so commendably profited; and to embrace a life much different to his humour, by accepting the government of a private charge, as his friends have been since enformed: a course, I must ingenuously tell you, which his nobler thoughts sometimes highly scorned: but there we heare he was planted, and purchased that good opinion of the Family where he resided, as nothing could be accompted too deare for one whom they so dearely loved. There is none that can more truly witnesse the truth of that relation then my selfe, answered Androgeus . For into my Family (as by your description I am satisfied) he was hospitably received, affably entertained, where he for a time lived, none more beloved. But all this could not content him; for his more ambitious thoughts could not containe him, but out of a presuming confidence from his too familiar entertainment in this manner, he attempted the affection of my Daughter; my only Daughter; one in whom I had treasured my hopes: and her he solicits with such instancie, as her indiscreet affection begun to encline to fancie. Fortunes she had profer'd her, which might highly advance her; Suiters of eminent accompt, approved reptite, ancient descent in their Countrey; yet could not all these decline her resolution from that whereon she had so strongly fixt and firmely fancied. Imagine then, good Sir, how this could do lesse then highly perplexe her too carefull Parents; and consequently incense them against his boldnesse: who out of too much presumption, desisted from those grounds or principles of education, to work in her easie disposition moving impressions of affection! This resolves me nothing, replyed Euphilus , where now Philogenes may remaine; whose fight I so much desire to partake: and to whom I am to impart such tidings as mainly concerne him, and which by the just decree of Heaven are very like highly to improve him. I must tell you, said Androgeus , and sorry am I that I must be enforced to tell you so much, that the goodnesse of his nature and sweetnesse of his temper was such, as conceiving the distaste we took at this his presumptuous attempt to be great, and our indignation irreconciliable: he voluntarily left these parts, and as he h'as since further informed us, devoted himselfe to such a strict-regular course, as now hee dis-esteemes all light fancie, and made devotion his choice. Your usage, it seemes, answered Euphilus , drove him to these extreames. And unthankfull you to requite his vertuous affection with such disdaine. For I must tell you Sir, though I make no question but your Family is ancient, your fortunes faire and eminent, yet had you knowne his fame and Family, as well as you were acquainted with his fancie, you would have held it no dishonour for Philogenes to match with your Daughter. Androgeus desired much to heare of his descent; which his faithfull friend Euphilus related in such manner, as it begot teares in the Old-mans eyes; repenting much that he rejected one whose nobler parts so well deserved, and whose generous and ancient linage seconded those excellent endowments wherewith he stood graced. And thus continued these two their discourse, till such time as one came to Euphilus , acquainting him how a Page below would speak with him: which broke off their conference for that time: resolving next day to meet againe, and to conclude of some course, that if too strict a tye had not engaged him, he might be recalled, to enjoy what he so much affected, and what his own fame, family, fortunes, and fancy, so well merited. Whereto sorrowfull Androgeus replyed, that a Gentleman of good accompt, and eminent in his Profession, meaning Eschites , had undertaken something to that effect, but whether likely to produce any good end or no he knew not. Meane time, Euphilus goes downe to the Page which staid below for him; to whom he delivered a Letter written, as this Page pretended, by one Albanus an intimate acquaintance unto Euphilus , the Contents whereof were these.  counterfeited Letter from Albanus , presents his Service to Euphilus . ] my resolutions are now fixt for Travell; and something J desired to leave you as an argument of that constant love I beare you. Receive then this Page, and reteine him for his sake, who could not send you a Token which he did more esteeme, nor what his endeavours will more deserve. Your disposition I know to be milde, which will comply well with the easinesse of his condition; and whose approvement may hereafter win more ground on your affection. Trust not Albanus , if your further tryall of him confirme not what I have promised for him. The Winds call me, the Mariners hasten me, so as I must contract my lines while they spread out their Sayles, closing in this our absence, one from th'other, with this constant Subscription of your affectionate Brother.  Now, what was meant by this Letter, our History must not as yet discover. Let it suffice, that this Page was his own Secretary; and had lodged Euphilus so dearely in his thoughts, as he accompted it his highest earthly solace to be admitted to his service. Returne we now to Androgeus , whom we may suppose, upon this relation of Philocles Fortunes and Family, to have his glowing desires more inflamed to see him returne into his Countrey. But doubtfull he remaines ever to enjoy so much happinesse: for the Sea, as he understands, h'as divided him; and his late regular profession so confined him: as if his desires stood so affected, yet could he see no possibility to have it effected, seeing those vowes (as he conceived, but herein deceived) could not so easily be dispenced. And highly did Androgeus admire the modesty of Philogenes : who never all the time that he sojourned in his house, would discover so much either touching those possibilities which now his fortunes had conferred on him, or that lineall descent from whence he was derived. An undoubted argument, surely, of a noble minde; which desires rather to display his descent by actions of desert: then arrogantly to boast of the House from whence he descended; and by his ignoble expressions to debase that honour which was lineally derived. For what is it to glory in guilded Earth; or to magnifie ones selfe in the generosity of his Race: when Vertues, which should be the best Signals to distinguish a noble Stock, have lost their impressure in him? For better is it to be ignobly derived, and vertuously accomplished; then Nobly descended, and viciously affected. And as every thing reteines his degree of dignity in goodnesse: so holds it the same degree of ilnesse when it is abused: for honour never looks so unlike it selfe as when it is disparraged. But where descent and desert meet, they present such a comely structure; as it becomes an imitable president of honour. And in these did Androgeus seriously reflect upon Philogenes . So as, a double respect may seeme mutually to ingage him: a constant care of his Daughters cure: and a desire to have her so matcht, as fame, fortune, and family, with such loyall arguments of fancy may joyntly meet. He vowes then never to oppose this solemnity, so his presence may cure her infirmity. This induceth him to wish all faire successe to Eschites faithfull endeavour; the prosperous issue whereof (though encounter'd with some rubs) you shall understand hereafter.  Philocles returnes home; and is accepted by the Parents for their Sonne in law. This revives their seeming distemper'd Daughter; yet fearing still a relapse of her Parents acceptance, she feignes the continuance of her distemper.  his dearest Doriclea's distemper: and privately, how he conceived that his returne from that fruitlesse retire, would not only free her from further danger, but be a direct way to accomplish his own desires. So as, there was nothing more expected then his speedy repaire by her Parents: which, (if he intended not to stand in his owne light, and prevent all promising hopes to do himselfe good) he wished him not to foreslow, least delay might increase her distemper,  & consequently abridge his hopes of aspiring higher. But such inducements little needed to hasten with winged speed the returne of Philocles . Nor could he at first imagine this relation of his friend Eschites to be any thing else but a dreame, or some practise to surprize him: so as he seemed doubtfull what to resolve, protracting so much time till he had expostulated with his own thoughts: by offering unto them a survey of those dangers he might probably incurre, with those incredible comforts, which if these relations prov'd true, he might assuredly partake. "Happy, thrice happy art thou Philocles , if these newes be true which come from thy Eschites! But canst thou expect so present a calme after so rough a tempest? Were not all her friends lately opposed against thee, and so incensed at thee, as nothing could appease their fury but thy captivity, nay thy blood, if they could have seazed on thee? And were these deepe Characters of their boundlesse passion writ in Sand, that they should be so quickly razed: or their vowed revenge so easily forgotten, that it should be so speedily extinguished? Well, I know not what to think on't! These lines writ by my deare Eschites makes me confident: but those experienc'd practises of her incensed friends and my implacable foes makes me more irresolute. I am assured, that Eschites would not ingage his Pen to one line, that might endanger my life. And I know this to be his own Character. Besides, to make his relation more probable, he here tels thee of Doriclea's distemper, and how her Fever took her upon thy departure from her: and how thy returne, if his judgement faile him not, may recover her. Be it then unto death, I will encounter with the worst of danger, so my presence may restore her, and cure her distemper. Pretended feares are meere shadowes to loyall fancy. They cannot strike that heart which is truly struck with love. And I appeale to thee Doriclea , if mine be not truly wounded. Be my returne then for thy safety, and I shall hold my desires crowned in perishing for thee." This said, in a private disguise he addresseth himselfe for his returne; to the end he might with lesse suspicion repaire to his firme friend Eschites , and upon further conference with him, be satisfied whether the Coast were cleare or no. And in short time might he make his returne, seeing, whatsoever he pretended, his distance was not great by meanes of his retire. For as yet he had not crost the Seas, nor taken any other Order then the constant profession of a Lover: who had made Doriclea his Saint, to whom he was so devoted, as wheresoever he sojourned; his engaged heart could not be divided from that object wherewit was so inseparably united. But the wayes of love, when they promise most smoothnesse, are ever encounter'd with sundry difficulties: This our Philocles felt, who in his returne walking one evening on the Sea-shore, to refresh his spirits with the aire of the Sea, was had in suspicion by some Seafaring-men for a Spy, and restrain'd that night by command; with a purpose next morning to bring him before a Justice, who had given direction upon notice thereof, that he should be safely guarded, and early next morne he would take examination of him: and upon what occasion he took such serious survey of that Coast and Vessels within the Roade. Philocles , as it fortuned, having been formerly acquainted with this Gentleman who should examine him (for they had been C oacademicks) and fearing much lest these delayes might either be interpreted in him a coldnesse of fancy, or towards his approved Eschites an opinionate jealousie; to hasten his departure thence, he prepared his way to this Justice, in these lines.  Sir, the course of an injuried Supplicant, are for most part become Spiderwebs to enwreathe and enwarp the smaller, to give more liberty to a powerfull Offender. See the misery of time! But to recall my selfe, this is not the errour of time, but of man. Where a direct eye becomes squinted by respect; or bleared by receipt; or quite put out by a prejudicate conceipt: Dangerous aymes are these to a well-governed State. Where Religion shapes it selfe to Policy , and candid pretences cloze with impiety. As you are Man, observe that Goldenmeane , which returnes the best Character of Man. The fairest path that conducts man to immortality, is ever on this Theatre of Earth, to remember his mortality. And the nearest resemblance that Man can have to his Maker, is to mixe Justice with Mercy , and to reduce them to an equall temper: by exhibiting them to all in a proportionable measure. Lilies among Thornes are Beauteous Objects. Be you the sume in this World of Weeds. So shall your name flourish, and leave a report behinde you better meriting praise; then emirency of state, or precedency of place. These Paper Presents are but weak reflexions of stronger affections: yet being the best Sacrifice of a friend and no Spy, (unlesse it be in the security of his owne heart) they deserve the higher place in your esteeme. Meane time, expresse your selfe what your Countrey expects from you, the State requires of you, and for which all good men will love you: which shall be the most assiduate and affectionate wish of him, who remaines the constant honourer of your vertues, Philocles .  This Letter infinitely pleased the Gentleman; but when he found it subscribed to by Philocles , the Character pleased him so much the better. In a word, so farre was he from entertaining him as a Spy, as he familiarly embraced him in the armes of a friend. His Guarders were soone discharged: desiring nothing more then to heare the relation of his fortunes. Which done, after his earnest invitation to stay longer with him, he accommodated him with whatsoever might necessarily befit him:  & with a friendly dismission wished him all happy successe in his love-assay. The next evening, he privately came to his constant friend Eschites his house; with whom he freely conversed, being satisfied by him that all things were very like to second his expectation: and how nothing was more desired then his speedy and happy arrivall. Yet, he told him withall, that he held it fitting that he should not presently approach the presence of his Mistresse, least she, who was not as yet wholly recovered, by being overjoyed by his presence, might make relapse into her sicknesse: which to prevent, he intended to prepare her by degrees, to the end his unexpected comming to her, might through an immoderate passion of joy, lesse occasion her distemper. Meane time, while this approved Artist was preparing way for his securer accesse to his Mistresse, he neglects not that office which amity enjoynes him to performe to his Friend. For having heard where his faithfull friend Euphilus lodged, whom he so intimately loved; and that for his cause he was there arrived: he could not chuse but expresse those loyall devotions which his love so much deserved, and what his travaile for his sake had so well confirmed. It is not easie to relate what incredible joy and comfort the one conceived in the others presence: wherewith Philocles seemed so intranced, as in the end not able to containe himselfe any longer, but out of the affluence of his joy, he burst forth in this manner. "Deare Euphilus , I now perceive well that the influence of those Divine Powers, whose eyes are ever fixed on us, knowes best how to attemper our greatest discomforts with rayes of solace. Long it is not since we were divided, yet during that small distance of time, never did poore mortall encounter with more extreames, nor taste lesse of hope, nor partake lesse in helpe. Injoyned I was to live where I did most loathe; and to be estranged from that place where I did most love. Divided I was not only from my fancy, but restrained of my liberty. Those whom I honoured most for her deare sake whom I loved best, publish'd themselves my profest foes: desiring nothing more then to have me in pursuit; yea, and if the Lawes would extend so farre, to bring me within the compasse of my life to recompence the constancy of my love. Yet behold! how by the Divine Clemency this storme is cleared; these menacing Clouds dispelled; these foggy vapours dispersed; poore Philocles released; his captivity to liberty reduced; what he least expected now freely offered: and that humane comforts might come linked, as my former discomforts came not singled: behold, a double blessing invirons me! The presence of a firme Friend, with the fruition of a faire Mistresse." Euphilus no lesse rejoyced in the enjoyment of his Philocles ; to whom, after he had related the occasion of his repaire to those parts, and mutually solaced themselves in the repetition of their former pleasures and studies: A Messenger from Eschites cut off their further discourse: for now was Philocles summoned to a more amiable task; the delightfull visit of his Doriclea . The absolute comfort whereof is more easily conceived, then delivered: for in discoveries of this nature, Imagination ever becomes the best Painter. Let it suffice, that their first salute closed it selfe in silence; discourse was supplyed with long-languishing looks. Tongues had their tyes, while affection became sole Prolocutor for the heart. One that had seen Philocles , would have thought that he had been some professed Artist: and that he was gathering the symptomes of her Malady by the motion of her pulse. And for Doriclea , though she durst not well forget her Fever for feare of her Father, yet she found in her selfe no such distemper, but she might leave her Bed, and admit the style of a Bride, so this dissembling love-errour might free her from censure. Nor need she much fear her Parents displeasure; for so propitious a Genius h'as breathed on Philocles , as in this his returne home, Hymen is ready to pronounce his doome, being so well accepted by the Parents for their Sonne in law. This so revives their seeming-distemper'd Daughter, as her Doctor may safely leave her, seeing Philocles presence secures her from danger. A silent expression, gives the pregnant'st testimony of a deepe grounded affection; where every look darts forth love ; no other parliance was afforded to these two extasied lovers: unlesse a trickling teare drain'd from the exuberance of love, stole innocently from Doriclea , to discover that passionate impression, wrought in her amazed thoughts through affection: thus were loves lines legible in both their eyes; and their eyes sole intelligencers to their thoughts. Much had restored Philocles to speak to Doriclea : no lesse, had restrained Doriclea to impart to Philocles . Joyes had their fresh supplyes; as if some golden dreame had imparadis'd their thoughts with some glorious vision; the conception whereof could not be delivered, till a sacred Rite had really confirmed, what their united hearts had mutually vowed. Yet like a discreet jealous Girle, fearing still a declining of her Parents acceptance, which might beget in her a relapse, or some further inconvenience, she feignes the continuance of her distemper: which soone after becomes clearely removed by her Parents cheerefull approvement of their loves, as you shall heare hereafter.  The Marriage is solemnized; and with such privacy as knowne to none but their owne Family. Valeria , who was supposed to be Euphilus Page, discovers himselfe to be Philocles Sister; with whose consent Euphilus marries, being long before privately affianc'd to her.  birth  & perfection: And that which before breathed only in desires, must now cheerefully aspire to action. Suppose we now Doriclea to have shaken off her Fever, left her Chamber, to prepare her selfe for those loyall and lawfull embraces of her constant Lover. Her Parents to inlarge the extent of her comforts, rejoyce no lesse in their Sonne, then she in her Spouse. All things are provided, nothing neglected that may comply with the content of two enlivened spirits so affectionately united. Hands could not be wanting, where hearts were so joyntly knitting. Nor could there want a full Consort to cheere their assistants with complete harmony; when these two affectionate. Consorts so gracefully appeared in Hymens livery. What would you have more to life expressed? The memory of their former discomforts becomes quite exiled by this presentment. Here might you see loves Metamorphosis lively acted, and by such persons, as their attractive features bestowed an infinite grace on whatsoever they presented. But Love admits no Rhetorick; unlesse it be that which the Orator held the sole ornament and accomplishment of an Oration, which without any other adjunct completely closed it selfe in Action . To make an abstract then of all, conceive our late distemper'd Doriclea now recovered (and perchance her feigned Fever discovered,) her deare Philocles now restored, and in a new state ready to be invested, her distasted Parents now attoned, and all things so well composed: as this long-desired Marriage is now to be solemnized; and with such privacy, as knowne to none but their own Family. Mellida , who every foot, no doubt, thinks of her own Sweetheart, must be the only Bride- maide to her Mistresse: and faithfull Euphilus the only choice Consort that must wait on Philocles . The way with flowers is privately paved; no Guest invited but what their owne Family afforded; all things were with much secrecy carried, and to good purpose, as shall be hereafter declared. To the Temple they come, where these Nuptials are with all privacy celebrated. And here Doriclea's Father takes his Daughter by the hand, and playes the best part that joyfull Doriclea could ever receive from a Father. Which Rite being thus solemnized, and the Married Couple with their few Attendants homeward returned: an other occasion of infinite joy unexpectedly arose from this auspicious meeting. After dinner, Philocles with his dearest Doriclea , took along with them in their company his loyall and constant friend Euphilus to recreate their spirits abroad: to whom Philocles imparted himselfe in this sort. "Deare Friend, though every minute of time be this day incomparably precious to me, being only to be imployed in discourse with my Choice: yet must I reserve ever some houres for your selfe, from whom I have received not only contentment in my youth, when our Studies were communicated together, but from that continuate profession and expression of your love; all which confirme me yours so long as I have life. You have been this day a witnesse of my long-expected happinesse: nor could I have one, to whom I stood more indeared, in all the world to witnesse it. And I should hold my wishes highly crowned, might I have you seazed of her whom you sometimes so much affected. I meane Valeria , one, who though my Sister, preferred you in her conceipt farre above her Brother. And I must freely unbosome my selfe to you; it did not a little content me to perceive such arguments of mutuall affection betwixt you. But perhaps, Euphilus , your disposition becomes now estranged from those thoughts. Either her meane fortunes could not content you, or some aversenesse in her friends distasted you; or some better hopes of preferment have so possessed you, as Ualeria h'as lost that place in your heart, which she sometimes had, and consequently, poore Wench, must be content against her will to forego, what she so entirely desir'd, and leave you to a Choice whom you better deserv'd." You reteine a worse opinion of me, Philocles , then my true zeale and affection to your vertuous Sister ever yet exprest. No, my noble friend, Ualeria never found Euphilus inconstant to this houre. I have preferred her in my choice,  & fortified my resolves against a change. Nor was it a weaknesse in her fortunes that declined my love: but the meane estate of a younger Brother which could not supply us with meanes how to live. "This was discreet love, answered Philocles ; those who truly love, make it the least of their feares, how they may afterwards live. But if that be the only let, I shall easily supply that want. I have not prized your love at so low an estimate, as to accompt you worthy so neare a gage as Brotherhood, and then exclude you from sharing in my estate. My Uncles providence shall be unto us an equall purchase. Be not so unadvisedly modest as to refuse it; you shall accept it, with her love to boot who may deserve it. And when your rising hopes shall better furnish you, then may your modesty requite it." This free and friendly offer forced Euphilus to reply with silence: which Philocles observing; "What, said he. do you take this curtsie so strangely, as if it were not an inherent office of amity, for friends to have dependance one of an other in cases of necessity? Trust me Euphilus , were you in my case, I should make bold upon the same tearmes, to become a sharer with you in whatsoever fortune with a more bounteous hand had bestowed on you. Neither shall your desires be foreslowed; for with your Parents leave, my deare Doriclea , within few dayes shall our speed be winged homeward, to consummate that which you and my Sister have so long wished, and from which my aged Father hath not much declined." Delay, answered the Page, breeds danger; and marriages are the merriest, when they come together. Pretty Wagge, replyed Philocles , but where must we finde a Bride? The least feare of a thousand, answered the Page; no doubt, but if my Master will finde a Bridegroome, and you prove as good as your word, the Page shall finde one to make a Bride. Wherewith, Ualeria , who was supposed to be Euphilus Page, discover'd her selfe to be Philocles Sister: with this excuse, how it was fancy, with a feare (for so report told her) of a forraigne Intruder: both which, put upon her that disguise, and prest her to that adventure: and no immodesty (though too inlarg'd a love may weare that Livery) that first put that habit upon her. A generall joy was conceived upon this discovery. For Philocles could not rejoyce so much at the sight of his Sister, as his Sister did in the enjoyment of her Brother: nor Doriclea in this mutuall joy of them both, more then amazed Euphilus in this strange Metamorphosis of his Page to his Lover. The relation whereof cheered not a little the old Couple, Androgeus and Euriclea : who provided a new Festivall for this unexpected Nuptiall. For, with Phllocles consent, to their incomparable content, was loyall Euphilus married to his loving Sister; being long before privately affianc'd to her. This occasionall Solemnity, made a second dayes private Jubilee in the whole family. For the night, we leave it to the free and lawfull embraces of these affectionate Lovers: wch admit no light lines to disclose the freedome of Loves Lawes. If Phidias had a Curtaine for his Picture; well might these lively-lovely features shroud their delights from the too inquisitive eye of a wanton censure.  The occasion of this private Solemnization: and how Mellida , by advice of her Mistresse Doriclea , assuming her name and habit, writ to Mardanes , how she preferr'd him in the choice of affection before any other; acquainting him how in a private disguise to prevent danger and her Parents displeasure, she would meet him, when and where in a lawfull Nuptiall way, he might enjoy her.  Solemnizaiton: and you shall heare the cause which induced it. Happy Doriclea (for now h'as she attained the height of her desires) was not altogether forgetfull of poore Mellida's distresse, in the seazure of her own happinesse. Something must be done, or this foolish-enamour'd Girle is quite undone. For you may be confident, Mellida could not play well the Bridemaid, but she must sigh how to be made a Bride. Teares are too sweet a food for affliction. And none ever felt it in an higher degree then she did; who, rather then she would be deprived of that aged Object of her grounded love, could chuse with all her heart to surcease to live. But live she must, and enjoy her love, or her faithfull Mistresse must faile in her designe. Which the better to prepare Doriclea now possest of what she affected most, becomes stronger in her fancy, in regard her conceipt was not now to work for her selfe; for that love-task was done, but for her perplexed Maid who desired nothing more then to enjoy what her Mistresse had done. And protraction is a torture to affection. Her aime is to expedite her Maids desire: lest too much thought of love should weaken the effects of love. The Plot then must be thus carried; and thrice happy Mellida , if not miscarried: for if it prosper, Mardanes must enjoy Mellida & Mellida those embraces (aged God wot) but to her more pleasing then the copletest Lover. For never was Woman taken more with the affection of such a feature: nor ever favoured any object more, that presented lesse favour. But Lovers are blinde, or a blinde God could not so easily wound them. Mount then must our amorous Mellida to the height of her affections, and in them to an unexpected growth of fortunes by her Mistresse meanes, which she accommodates thus. Mellida , by the advice of her Mistresse Doriclea , by whom she must be directed, or all her aimes are distracted, assuming her name and habit writes to her endeared Mardanes , whom never before beauty lookt upon, much lesse doted on; and his reverend age, which now grew hottest in love, when he grew coldest in blood, she thus encounters.  which would be taxed immodesty, being delivered by the tongue. I appeale to your selfe, (for your privatest thoughts cannot be lesse then conscious of my love) if I have not preferr'd you in the choice of affection before any other: closing with your desires in all things that might not touch mine honour. But it is the Evening crownes the Day; confirme then what you have professed; those vowes wherein I standing aged, shall not be neglected. Should I tell you as much as I write to you, I could not chuse but blush; I love you ; and if you lose no time, may live with you. But Parents I have, and their command must be obeyed; nor do I finde them so well affected towards our loves, whatsoever they formerly professed. Sir, I must freely tell you, lose no opportunity if you hold me an Object worthy of your fancy. To prevent then prying eyes (affections dangerous spyes) let me acquaint you (nor is it to be conceipted immodesty but strength of fancy that thus directs me) how in a private disguise to prevent danger and my Parents displeasure (whose constant aime is to bestow me upon an other) I shall meet you when and where you please in a lawfull Nuptiall way, to accomplish both our desires, and divert those approaching feares which surprize me, till you may with all freedome enjoy me, by accompting me your own: which interest I shall preserve with an unstained fame. Nor do I hold any place both for safety and conveniency more proper then that Elme grove adjoyning to Solinus Cell. If you approve of this Plot, or desire to enjoy Doriclea's love, or to prevent a Corrivall in your love, or to crowne both our desires in our happy fruition of the effects of love, bring one along with you, who may consummate that Rite, which remaines inviolate till death dissolve it. yours or not her own, Doriclea .  When Mellida had writ this Letter to her affectionate Lover, by the direction of her Mistresse; whose pleasure it was that her own marriage the day before should be privately solemnized, that it might not be discovered to Mardanes ; she addressed her selfe in this manner to her Mistresse. Alas Mistresse! But should Mardanes now heare either of your marriage, or take my Mask off to kisse me before he h'as married me; what would become of me? And you know, lip-labour cannot want, where true love h'as once warm'd the heart. Doubt not Wench, said Doriclea ; for my marriage, it was so privately carried, as excepting our own Family none knowes of it: which privacy was only intended for thy preferment. But if thou hast no power over thy selfe, but thou must unmask before the watch-word be given, I cannot remedy that. Nay, Mistresse, replyed Mellida , I would do any thing so I might enjoy him; but I feare much I cannot hold when I see him, but I must have an hearty desire to take a taste of him. Thy virgin-modesty, answered her Mistresse, may dispence with that; so thy indiscreet fancy bring thee not to a discovery. Solinus I have prepared to second thee; whose approved zeale h'as infinitely ingag'd me to him. Only then, let me advise thee, be wise in this carriage of thy love: lest thy own folly bring thee to a losse in the pursuit of him whom thou doest love. I am perswaded, the Plot will take, if it be not spoiled by thy own mistake. Thus encouraged Doriclea her perplexed Mellida ; directing her in every passage what to do: and advertising her withall, that if she observed but two particulars, she could not possibly erre in this Project: Silence , and concealing of her count'nance . And this Mellida promiseth to observe: and that she will not kisse him till she h'as married him: nor unmask, till the Mask be done; meaning, till the marriage be finished: unlesse, Mistresse, said she, too much love make me forget, and then I am sure my fame, fancy and fortunes, shall fare the worse for it. Thus is a way prepared for Mellida's happinesse, as she accompts it: nor is she slower in her care to have this Letter delivered, then she is in her desire to have her affectionate wishes crowned. A Messenger then, and such an one whose fidelity promiseth secrecy, is provided: while every houre seemes a yeare till she heare such an answer, as may breathe upon her hopes; by affording her that content which she cannot enjoy in a single state. Forestall our History we must not; the issue of this Plot shall disclose it selfe in this our ensuing and closing discourse: which, as Comick conclusions suit best with love, where vertue drawes the line, makes it the least of our meaning to set in a Cloud, but to cleare all preceding stormes with a cheerefull calme.  The Plot holds; Mardanes rejoyces infinitely at his unexpected happinesse; thanks his Spurcina for her well-spell'd practise; and infeoffes his unknowne Bride (though much against his will) in his riches.  serious in effecting, then Doriclea was in contriving, nor Mellida , whom it concerned most, in expecting. Suppose now Mardanes to have received this Love-letter: which his foure eyes are not content with once reading, nor revising, but examines every love-line. Every accent must be crowned with a blessing: every period with a gracefull acceptance. Infinitely rejoyces he at his unexpected happinesse, that he should come to enjoy such a Mistresse, whom both youth and fortunes suited for their Bride, but fell short of their hope. Many thankes he gives his Spurcina for her well-spell'd practise; and commends his own pate for attempting such an enterprize. He holds it not fitting to spin out any needlesse time for effecting his Doriclea's desires. He findes too much passion in her lines, to counterfeit with the disposition of her heart. But there is nothing that makes delay seeme more hatefull to him, nor fuller of danger; then that some may become competitors in his love; and by her Parents choice, leave him in the lurch. This makes him stirre his stumps, and to answer her Letter with such speedy cheerefulnesse, as Mellida can expect no lesse then all successe to her desires, and to her long-languishing hopes assured happinesse. Neither was there any thing which wrought more pleasingly upon his deluded thoughts, then that witty device (as he conceived it) of suting herselfe in a disguise to prevent her Parents aimes: which confirm'd the love she profest, and ingag'd him to requite her love in that which he esteemed best. And that was his substance; wherein, like a free-hearted Bridegroome, he resolves so amply to infeoffe her; as her large Dower-might appear a manifest argument of the love he bore her. But indeed. this bounty of his proceeded rather from Solinus advice then his own disposition: who cunningly told him; that the only way to winne her Parents acceptance after the private consummation of their marriage, was to invest her in all his estate before their marriage. Which would not only be a means to reconcile them, but highly to inlarge their bounty towards him. Nothing could be moved, whereto Mardanes h'as not assented. Neither is it easie to beleeve how he begins to burnish his crazy carkasse afresh. His crisping and frizling Irons must be used; his bald head with a ruffling Periwig furnished; a Pomander to sweeten his earthy savour prepared; an Orange stuck with Cloves to restore that breath which was wholly mortified. And to publish to the world, that he reteines still some colour of love, he displayes his light fancy in the lightest colours of loves livery. But so improperly suited, as his antick habit proclaimes him an unqualified Gallant. Infinitely stands he devoted to his Glasse; and yet me thinks he should not love it for presenting him a face so neare him, which might rather affright him then like him, if he were not too much besotted on it, for his sake that owes it. For so strongly had those amorous lines wrought on his conceipt, as he verily thought there was something in him which deserved more love, then either his age could promise, or the decayes of nature performe. Suppose him then with as much speed as his Snaile-like pace may afford him, addressing his course towards the place where his Doriclea is to meet him, to consummate those Rites which incomparably transport him. And meet him she will, but not as a Bride, but a Maide to his Bride: for they have chang'd their habits, to make the Plot passe for currant: that the Mistresse in this mysterious disguise might passe for her Maide, the Maide for her Mistresse. For howsoever, Doriclea was sometimes resolved to recommend the whole carriage of this Plot to Solinus , who had exprest many faithfull offices betwixt her selfe and her dearest Philocles ; yet being jealous how Mellida would demeane her selfe in the presence of her Mardanes , she desired to become an Agent in the project; which no question was better mannaged by her presence, then it had beene without her assistance. Love-aged Mardanes omits no time, nor neglects no meane, but provides a Man to accomplish that Rite which so equally complyes with both their desires. Who, as they enter'd the Elme-grove neighbouring to Solinus Cell; they might see two Gentlewomen masked, with one ushering them of grave and reverend aspect. Whom, upon their approach Mardanes saluted; but no conference was admitted, lest the Plot might be discovered, Howsoever, great desire had poore-enamour'd Mellida to bestow a more familiar curtsie on her ancient Bridegroome, but he must not as yet be admitted that honour, for her Mask without discovery could entertaine no lip-labour. To this private Solemnity they go, wherein Solinus supplyed the place of a Father to Mellida ; who was with such observance attended by Doriclea , as no Maid could be more officious. The Rite thus solemnized, and Mardanes seazed of what (as he conceived) he most affected, and Mellida of what she before all the World preferred; as the Bridegroome and Bride were lovingly going hand in hand together, Mardanes might perceive this Inscription newly indorsed on the rinde of an aged Elme, as they were to go forth at the West end of the Grove.  Love is a witty thing, and can devise A thousand tricks to blinde a thousand eyes. He loves and weds, but weds not where he loves; She loves and weds, and weds whom she approves. Many before this time have oft assaid The Maid forth' Mistresse, M r s for the Maid. If you would know the issue of their love, Inquire of Cupids Mask in a   [   a Properly, styled, Platin aes Elysian Grove , or Erycina's Paphian Lawes .   ] Venus Grove . A Match well made, she poore, and he is rich, But wed't, she's rich, he poor,---gramercy Witch. This was ingraven the very morning before by Solinus ; the perusall whereof did not a little trouble Mardanes . But no sooner was his Mellida unmask'd, then he needed no Oedipus to expound this Riddle. Then, but too late, he findes himselfe deluded: but never too late, said Doriclea , to be contented: vertue must be made of a necessity; and a poore vertuous Maid may well deserve your fancy. Not altogether so poore, replyed Solinus ; for if she be poore, what will become of Mardanes : who h'as infeoffed her in all his estate, and invested her in all the meanes hee h'as in the world? Nay, said Mellida , he h'as indowed me with the personall estate of himselfe, which I preferre before all the world. And would you have more, answered Doriclea ? Trust me, Mardanes , you shall finde more true love in the Maid, then ever you could have found in her Mistresse. The one could give you an hand, but no heart: whereas the other gives you both hand and heart. The one was ingaged; the other free, and to your love devoted. The one might live with you, but never love you; the other can both love you, and live with you. Never then in my opinion did any Witch a better part, then in bestowing an old fortune on a young heart. A spirit that can dispose it, and not scatter it: as your care was to provide and gather it. The Bridegroome stood as mute as a Fish all this time: till at last the Brazen-head spoke, saying; What must be, must be . But he vowed if ever it were his fortune againe to match, he would never buy a Pig in a poak, nor wed a Wench in a Mask. But those that were there, thought he might save that labour, for by course of Nature he had married his executor. After they had accompanied them home; broke the Bride-cake, and brought the unweldy Bridegroome to his bed; wishing the Bride good rest (being all she could possibly expect) and advising her to take a good life of that she had, to keep an hank of that she held, and to supply the want of youth with the wealth of age; they departed thence; while Doriclea with many thankes commended Solinus to his Cell; neare which her dearest Philocles with his constant Euphilus purposely retired to bring her home: who upon relation of these unexpected newes to her Parents and Family, rejoyced highly. Within some few Moneths, after an heavie leave and hearty blessing, these two married Couples returned into their Countrey, where they were received with great joy by the Gentry, who admired much the relation of their amity: and whose constancy to this day, reteines testimonies of their living memory. To close then our History , whose ground-colour is truth, and consequently deserves to be entertained with more trust: as vertue playes her Master- prize in every noble enterprize; so by her Princely presence and timely attendance, these lived together lovingly, loved neighbourly, and rejoyced mutually: which happy Period is wished to all faithfull Lovers by the Compiler of this History. ![](/images/inline/agk.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  .
