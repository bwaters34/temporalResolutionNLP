 As honours are paid to the dead in order to incite others to the imitation of their excellencies, the principal intention of Epitaphs is to perpetuate the examples of virtue, that the tomb of a good man may supply the want of his presence, and veneration for his memory produce the same effect as the observation of his life. Those Epitaphs are, therefore, the most perfect, which set virtue in the strongest light, and are best adapted to exalt the reader's ideas and rouse his emulation. To this end it is not always necessary to recount the actions of a hero, or enumerate the writings of a Philosopher; to imagine such informations necessary, is to detract from their characters, or to suppose their works mortal, or their achievements in danger of being forgotten. The bare name of such men answers every purpose of a long inscription. upon his monument, instead of a long detail of his discoveries, which no Philosopher can want, and which none but a Philosopher can understand, those, by whose direction it was raised, had done more honour both to him and to themselves. which can never become vulgar or contemptible, if bestowed with judgment; because no single age produces many men of merit superior to panegyrick. None but the first names can stand unassisted against the attacks of time; and if men raised to reputation by accident or caprice, have nothing but their names engraved on their tombs, there is danger lest in a few years the inscription require an interpreter. Thus have their expectations been disappointed who honoured Picus of Mirandola with this pompous epitaph, Hic situs est Picus Mirandola , c aetera norunt Et Tagus et Ganges, forsan et Antipodes. His name, then celebrated in the remotest corners of the earth, is now almost forgotten; and his works, then studied, admired, and applauded, are now mouldering in obscurity. unadorned, without exaggeration, superlatives, or rhetoric. Such were the inscriptions in use among the Romans , in which the victories gained by their emperors were commemorated by a single epithet; as C aesar Germanicus , C aesar Dacicus , Germanicus , Illyricus . Such would be this epitaph, Isaacus Newtonus , natur ae legibus investigatis, hic quiescit . the publication of their virtues, and the preservation of their memories, and in the composition of these it is that art is principally required, and precepts therefore may be useful. affects no other composition; the place in which they are now commonly found restrains them to a particular air of solemnity, and debars them from the admission of all lighter or gayer ornaments. In this it is that the stile of an Epitaph necessarily differs from that of an Elegy. The custom of burying our dead either in or near our churches, perhaps originally founded on a rational design of fitting the mind for religious exercises, by laying before it the most affecting proofs of the uncertainty of life, makes it proper to exclude from our Epitaphs all such allusions as are contrary to the doctrines for the propagation of which the churches are erected, and to the end for which those who peruse the monuments must be supposed to come thither. Nothing is, therefore, more ridiculous than to copy the Roman inscriptions, which were engraven on stones by the highway, and composed by those who generally reflected on mortality only to excite in themselves and others a quicker relish of pleasure, and a more luxurious enjoyment of life, and whose regard for the dead extended no farther than a wish that the earth might be light upon them . regard for the senseless remains of a dead man impertinent and superstitious. One of the first distinctions of the primitive Christians, was their neglect of bestowing garlands on the dead, in which they are very rationally defended by their apologist in Minutius Felix . "We lavish no flowers nor odours on the dead," says he, "because they have no sense of fragrance or of beauty." We profess to reverence the dead not for their sake but for our own. It is therefore always with indignation or contempt that I read the epitaph on Cowley , a man, whose learning and poetry were his lowest merits. Aurea dum late volitant tua scripta per orbem Et fama eternum vivis, divine Poeta, Hic placida jaceas requie, custodiat urnam Cana, Fides, vigilent que perenni Lampade Musae! Sit sacer ille locus, nec quis temerarius ausit Sacrilega turbare manu venerabile bustum, Intacti maneant, maneant per saecula dulces. Divinities that favoured him in his life, may watch for ever round him to preserve his tomb from violation, and drive sacrilege away, is only rational in him who believes the soul interested in the repose of the body, and the powers which he invokes for its protection able to preserve it. To censure such expressions as contrary to religion, or as remains of heathen superstition, would be too great a degree of severity. I condemn them only as uninstructive and unaffecting, as too ludicrous for reverence or grief, for christianity and a temple. with the same regard to the solemnity of the place, cannot be denied: it is an established principle that all ornaments owe their beauty to their propriety. The same glitter of dress that adds graces to gaiety and youth, would make age and dignity contemptible. Charon with his boat is far from heightening the awful grandeur of the universal judgment, tho' drawn by Angelo himself; nor is it easy to imagine a greater absurdity than that of gracing the walls of a christian temple with the figure of Mars leading a hero to battle, or Cupids sporting round a virgin. The pope who defaced the statues of the Deities at the tomb of Sannazarius is, in my opinion, more easily to be defended, than he that erected them. passenger, a custom which an injudicious veneration for antiquity introduced again at the revival of letters, and which, among many others, Passeratius suffered to mislead him in his Epitaph upon the heart of Henry king of France , who was stabbed by Clement the monk, which yet deserves to be inserted, for the sake of shewing how beautiful even improprieties may become, in the hands of a good writer. Adsta, Viator, et dole regum vices. Cor Regis isto conditur sub marmore, Qui jura Gallis, jura Sarmatis dedit. Tectus Cucullo hunc sustulit Sicarius. Abi, Viator, et dole regum vices. were drawn up with far greater propriety than can be shewn in those, which more enlightened times have produced. Orate pro Anima---miserrimi Peccatoris, was an address to the last degree striking and solemn, as it flowed naturally from the religion then believed, and awakened in the reader sentiments of benevolence for the deceased, and of concern for his own happiness. There was nothing trifling or ludicrous, nothing that did not tend to the noblest end, the propagation of piety and the increase of devotion. the name of the deceased is not to be omitted; nor should I have thought such a precept necessary, had not the practice of the greatest writers shewn, that it has not been sufficiently regarded. In most of the poetical Epitaphs , the names for whom they were composed may be sought to no purpose, being only prefixed on the monument. To expose the absurdity of this omission, it is only necessary to ask how the Epitaphs , which have outlived the stones on which they were inscribed, would have contributed to the information of posterity, had they wanted the names of those whom they celebrated. observed which do not equally relate to other compositions. The praise ought not to be general, because the mind is lost in the extent of any indefinite idea, and cannot be affected with what it cannot comprehend. When we hear only of a good or great man, we know not in what class to place him, nor have any notion of his character, distinct from that of a thousand others; his example can have no effect upon our conduct, as we have nothing remarkable or eminent to propose to our imitation. The Epitaph composed by Ennius for his own tomb, has both the faults last mentioned, Nemo me decoret lacrumis, nec funera, fletu Faxit. Cur? volito vivu' per ora virum. neither conceives any veneration for the man to whom it belongs, nor is instructed by what methods this boasted reputation is to be obtained. not confined to historical impartiality, yet it ought always to be written with regard to truth. No man ought to be commended for virtues which he never possessed, but whoever is curious to know his faults must enquire after them in other places; the monuments of the dead are not intended to perpetuate the memory of crimes, but to exhibit patterns of virtue. On the tomb of M aecenas , his luxury is not to be mentioned with his munificence, nor is the proscription to find a place on the monument of Augustus . same circumstances in which the bulk of mankind are placed, and which, therefore, may admit of many imitators. He that has delivered his country from oppression, or freed the world from ignorance and error, can excite the emulation of a very small number; but he that has repelled the temptations of poverty, and disdained to free himself from distress at the expence of his virtue, may animate multitudes, by his example, to the same firmness of heart and steadiness of resolution. upon a man whose writings are well known, the other upon a person whose memory is preserved only in her Epitaph , who both lived in slavery, the most calamitous estate in human life. ![](/images/inline/Zgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbeegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/Kgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) .
