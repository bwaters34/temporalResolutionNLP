 noblest parts of Men, if always entertained with the most serious and profoundest Notions, either over-prest with the weight, they crack; or clogged, they become dull and unapt to exert their proper Faculties.  Quod caret alterna requie durabile non est, Haec reparat vires fessaque membra levat. Says Ph aedra to her Hippolitus , then strengthneth her Argument with a Similitude  Arcus  & arma tuae tibi sunt imitanda Dianae, Si nunquam cesses tendere, mollis erit. But contrariwise, by seasonable pastimes, our faculties are so recreated and well disposed to their several operations, that they produce Effects most strong and vigorous. This makes me hope, kind Reader, that when thou art tired with thy more serious affairs, or desire to be rid of some troublesome thoughts that disturb thy Quiet, thou wilt afford this Little Rogue some Minutes to make sport. Be not afraid to entertain him, 'tis not his designe to make thee of his Gang, nor is he a Newgate-bird that may at length pick out thy Eyes, or a Gipsy that may rob thee secretly. No, no, he's a Pretty Rogue , not guilty of Murther, and those hainous Ballad-crimes that are as miserably sang every day in the street, as committed, if they were true. Yet this I'll tell you; He lives by his Wit, and perhaps it shall cost thee a shilling or two before thou get him; but what's that, when large sums are daily given for Rogues that are Transported before they have play'd halfe so many pretty pranks as he hath done. But I have the English Rogue , say you, and what need of a French one? In truth I can give no better answer to this objection then the common one; it is the Fashion, and He's the better company for Ladies, and was it not so in the old Romans time, when they did Omnia Gr aece . In a word, 'tis this hath made me put him forth, and expose him to the publick view: for though I have calculated his Nativity, and find that this off-spring of idle hours is born to no good Fortune, but to be laught at and jeer'd: yet hang him, burn him, I shall never pitty him, he's a French ROGUE . But hold, you have him not all, pray be not so uncharitable as to condemn him by halfs, there is somthing remains besides what is here contained, and thy kind reception of this may be an encouragement to the continuation of it, and the manifesting the rest. Farewel. Immortal, even as his that built the same; Yet he did ill, by how much more ought we To raise his Merit in our Elogie; That onely paints out Vice, but paints it so That Virtue in such Cloaths might freely goe. Such Wit and such Invention here I find, That if I judge according to my mind, Virtue looks well, yet I am forc'd to say, Night-Pictures are as good as those of Day .  His Education at Callais in Picardy, at a Farmers-House not far from the Sea, and what Pranks he plaid there in his Infancy.  part, I knew neither of those that had given me life; till having lived my first Seven years in a Farmers-House at Callais , not far from the Sea; my Courage increasing with my Years, and my Nature daily manifesting it self more and more, did plainly evidence that I was not derived from the meanest Parents. I fought daily in the Street, upon small or no occasions; yet always came off with so much victory, that I was feared as much by the Neighboring Children, as I was complained of by their Parents. This caused me many Blows and Reproaches from the Old Man, who pretended he kept me on Charity, not knowing so much as my Father or Mother: Therefore I carried my designs more closely afterwards, not as before I had done by Open-Wars, but by Secret- Policy, which seemed naturally to be annexed to my Valour. Sometimes under pretence to play with those that had any ways wronged or abused me, I accompanied them to some old Barn, a good distance from the House, there would I shut them in, and leave them; that sometimes they lost their Dinners, sometime their Suppers; nay, many staid all Night sore an hungred and afraid. Again, I would entice them to go with me to a small Arm of the Sea to wash their Feet, where making as if I fell off the Bank, I would pull Three or four in after me; so sweet was revenge to my tender age. A thousand such like Pranks, which either my wit could devise, or occasion offered, I played every day: One amongst the rest I shall not omit, which will not seem altogether unpleasant to the Reader; and yet be very necessary for the prosecution of my Story. Remembering by my self some Blows I had received of my Foster-father, by the Complaints of his Son, a Child much of my bigness and age, I resolved to shew him no less kindness, then I had to the rest of my abusive Companions; yet I was much pusled to effect it: For beside that, he was the Darling, and onely Child of his Mother, she also hated me, being an untoward Boy; so that I was not so often with him, as the other Children of the Neighborhood, and consequently had the less opportunity to plague him, and bring my desire to pass; which nevertheless I brought to pass by these means. A Gentleman, Son to the great Nostrodamus , so much renowned for his Prophecies, by name C aesar Nostrodamus , an acquaintance of the Farmers, living some miles distant from our Village, came one day to the House to see us, when I by chance, sent on some small errand, crost the Room where he was. He either taken with my Complexion, which was Sweeter, or Stature, which was greater then Children use to be of my age; or moved by the skill he had in Physiognomy, to pass his judgment on me, calls me back, and no sooner looked on me, but told my Foster- father, That I had in me, both the French Mercury , and the English Saturn: I understood not at present that dark saying. He added also, That I resembled much in Feature, a fair Gentlewoman living at Bologne , and married to an Old Merchant, and could be judged to be no other bodies Child then hers, were she not accounted by her friends barren. The Farmer, I perceived, was something puzzled at his words, but at last told him, He was wholly ignorant of my Parentage, and that he kept me more for my ingenuity and comely Feature, then any knowledge he had of my Birth and Descent. The Learned Man would have said more, but the Farmer conscious of a Truth which you shall hear hereafter; to divert the discourse, calls up his own Son, to see likewise if Nostradamus would foretel any thing concerning him. He jesting, said, That when I lost, he should find; and that he should get more by his folly, then I by my wit. Nevertheless he gave me ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Une piece de cinq soue.   ] Five pence to encourage me, being an Orphan; and said, Here, buy what you desire most. I thanked him in better words, and with more civility then he could well expect from a Clown of my years; which increased his admiration so much the more, and so I left him.  The prosecution of the foregoing Story, Caesar Nostradamus's Prophecy, verified concerning the French Rogue, and the Farmers Son.  Nut-tree there by, whither, if he would go with me, we might store our selves with Fruit enough to banquerupt, our Companions (for it was our custom then, as the Old Romans did, Ludere par impar ) He as greedy of this booty as I seemed to be, or you may imagine Children are, went out with me; but instead of what I promised, I brought him to several Ditches and deep Pits, whence Gravel and Chalk had been dug; till at length, finding one fit for my purpose, unseen by him, I threw in my Five pence, then feigning, that I discovered a piece of Money in the bottom of the Pit, I pretended, if I went down, I would have all; but he challenged half for being with me when I found it: At last, by my Proposition we agreed, That he which went down should have Three pence, the other Two pence; for I assured him, as well I might, it was a Cinq sous in the Pit. Besides, I being the stronger, pretended to be better able to pull and help him out of the Pit; for I knew he could not ascend without me. But he was no sooner in, then I ran away, crying out, as though one would have beat me. This hapned before Dinner. I came home and dined with the Servants, and by reason the Farmer and his Wife dined above with the Stranger, Whether they thought their Son was below, or the Servants that he was above; he was not mist for the present, till towards night, that the Gentleman before-mentioned, went away; who again seeing me, asked me, What I had bought? I answered, A young fool, and had put him in a Cage to learn him more wit. He laughed heartily at my expressions, but without farther examination, having some miles to go, took his leave. The Farmers Wife soon after inquired for her Son, I went out of the way on purpose, that I might not be questioned where I left him; but it fell out happily. That one passing by that way had helped him out, and he came in crying, and complaining to his Parents of what had hapned. I was called and examined, I pretended the Man, whose Field it was, would have beat me for coming there, which he could not but know, having heard me cry out; and that I would have told her, but that I could not come to her, being above at Dinner with the Stranger; besides, I thought he could easily have got out. With such like excuses, for my Eloquence was nothing inferior to my Policy in such matters, I cleared my self. Then were we made good friends again by dividing the Cinq sous ; whereof he for his folly had Three pence, and I which lost it had Two pence; which made true the Gentlemans Prophecy of us in the first Chapter, That when I lost, he should find ; and, That he should get more by his folly, then I by my wit , which hapned in the division of the Cinq sous . Now because I have made mention of C aesar Nostradamus , Son to the great Astronomer , I shall make bold to insert briefly a true Prophecy of his Fathers, though not concerning the present matter, yet no less pleasant as follows.  A Pleasant Prophecy of the Great Astronomer Nostradamus fulfilled, by way of digression.  the Ninth of France , and the best Astronomer of his age, being in Lorrain in the Castle of Faim , belonging to the Lord of Florinville , Walking one day with the said Lord in the Yard, saw two little Pigs, one White, the other Black: Whereupon the Lord inquired of Nostradamus in jest, What would become of these Two Pigs . He answered presently, We shall eat the Black, and the Woolf shall eat the White . The Lord Florinville intending to make him a lier, did secretly command the Cook to dress the White for Supper; the Cook then killed the White one, drest it, and spitted it ready to be rosted, when it should be time; in the mean while having some business out of the Kitchin, a young tame Woolf came in, and eat up the Buttocks of the White Pig that was ready to be rosted: The Cook perceiving what was done, and fearing his Masters anger, killed the Black one and drest it, and sent it up at Supper. The Lord then merry and ignorant of what had hapned, Well Doctor , said he, we are now eating of the White Pig in spight of Fate. Not so said Nostradamus, I will wage, that it is the Black one upon the Table . The Wager laid, the Cook was sent for, and examined, who related all that had hapned, with much contentment and pleasure to the Guests.  How he served a Butcher that had offended two of his Companions in his absence.  of my Play-fellows, that I seemed rather their Commander then Companion; and the biggest of them despised not my Counsel, but rather sought my help in their designs. It fell out one day, That a Rustick-Butcher driving some Swine before him in a narrow Dirty-lane, met two of my Companions, who desiring him to stay till they were past a place more Muddy then the rest, stopt the Herd. But he with the more vehemency drove them on, insomuch, That one fell down in the Mire, and was trampled on; the other by leaping over a Ditch into the next Field, fell down and received some small hurt. They came afterwards by our House home, and relating to me all that was past, desired my help against their Enemy. I councelled them to go home and change their Cloaths, and return with speed to me, who in the mean time would find out some way to revenge. This I did, that they being clean, and in other habits, might not be known by the Butcher, or in the least suspected. In the mean time, I drove some of our Sheep together with their Lambs, excepting one Lamb, supposed to have been stoln or eat by the Woolf a week before, into the same Lane, by which I knew the Butcher must return. Then meeting with my Companions, we stood a good distance off the Flock, expecting our Enemies return. We no sooner espied him, but we ran to our House not far distant, crying, A Rogue was stealing the Lambs in the narrow Road . We had then at home two lusty young men belonging to the Old Farmer, who running out presently with long Poles, without farther inquiry, knocked him down, and hauled him to the Magistrate; where we being brought, according to agreement testified, That he had driven the Lambs into a straight place, and was laying hold on them, either to kill or carry them away alive . Our words as of innocent and harmless Children, were taken before all his excuses; who being found to be a Butcher that sold to the Ships, was much suspected. Being examined likewise, What he did that ways ; he related, That he was returning from driving a Herd of Swine to such a place, and had never been that way but once the week before ; which was much about the time our Lamb was lost. I presently related the loss of it to the Magistrate; this also the two young men affirmed; so that he being convinced of what he was not guilty, was forced to pay for our Lamb that was lost, and go away contented with the sore blows he had received, without the least pitty of the hearers.  An ingenious Device, whereby he rob'd the Old Mans Orchard where he lived.  satisfied without the enjoyment of them, yet still I observed this general rule in all my Actions, to aim at the best: And thereupon, seeing in the Garden a bon Chrestian Pear-tree, I affected most, as being a forbidden Fruit, ( Ruimus in vetitum nefas ) for every Pear was numbred, and the unkind winds blew not one off; whose place the Old Man could not find; whose loss he mourned for, as much as those few Hairs Old Age bereft him of. Besides, the Wall was high, insomuch, that the very Sea-men who had oft attempted it, could never scale it. These Reasons deterred me from asking of them, for no other could be suspected, especially since I oftentimes used to play in this Garden. I deferred my design therefore for the present, till one day walking in the Fields, where were many young Oaken Trees full of Acorns, I perceived many Swine rubbing themselves at the bottom of those Trees; I knew not the reason, till approaching near, I perceived the Acorns to drop, which they presently devoured and began to rub against the Tree to shake down more. This subtility of the Bruit Beasts, put a Period to my design in hand. For when I came home, I left the Garden door open for two or three days on purpose that our Swine in the adjoyning Yard might enter. Finding one at length in the Garden, I climb'd the Tree, gathered most of the Fruit, and hid the best in a place I had designed for that purpose. I gave the Hog so much other Fruit in the Garden, that whosoever had seen him, would by his Belly have guessed him the author of the mischeif. This done, and my Pockets emptied, for fear of a search, I ran in crying, That the Swine by rubbing himself against the Tree, had shaken down and devoured the best Pears, notwithstanding all I could do to drive him away . This made the Old Man chafe and run faster then ordinarily he could into the Garden, where finding the Swine, under the Tree devouring some Relicks I had left him, suspected nothing of the Plot, but drove him away, as sorrowful as he came in angry, with threats onely to kill the Hog at Christmas . This puts me in minde of an Old Monks Verses to his Pig on the like purpose.  If thou wer't big, My little Pig, Then thou should'st die. For why? Because of thy Voracity. At Christmas ye (The Pig cry'd we) Will bigger be. And then shalt die, when thou art big, Because thou wer't more sawce then Pig.  How he deceived a Merchant.  Vineyard belonging to our Farm, enough to serve our Family, and pleasure our Friends) when the Old Man was pleased to give me a new Suit, Christmas then approaching, which we celebrate Ten days sooner then here in England . Another of my Companions, Son to a miserable, covetuous Userer, had also new Cloaths at the same time. Our want of Money was alike also; mine, being an Orphan, was great; his being Son to a covetuous Father, was no less. I therefore who could never be confined to now and then a penny, often tempted him to endeavor something on his Fathers Bags: He hating the Coveteousness of his rich Father, was willing to have done it, yet still deferred the performance. I met one day a Merchant knocking at our door, who having heard of our Vineyard, desired to buy some of our Wine for his own drinking on Ship-board. The Farmer told him, the quantity of Wine which he made was so small, that he never sold, but kept it for his own use, or the pleasure of his Friends. This opened the door to my desires; for he was no sooner gone, but I found out my Companion, told him, I had a brave design, if he could by any means help me with some Bottles . He answered after short consideration, He had the Key of his Covetuous Fathers Seller, who trusted none but him; and that the next morning before he was up, we should search . According to this appointment we came, and found all full but two great Leather Bottles, both containing about Seven Gallons; these we conveyed into an old Stable remote from the House, and filled them about Three Gallons apiece, with Water up to their necks which contained about a Quart, then thrusting down some Rags, we immediately poured Pitch over them, leaving room onely for a Quart of Wine, which I soon procured at home and filled them. This done, I enquired the Merchants name, and got some knowledge of him: I then went to him as sent from the Farmer, who I pretended, was sorry he had not sold him some of his Wine, since presently after his departure he was informed by a Gentleman both of his Quality and Countrey, but had now sent him two Bottles full containing seven Gallons, which not being able to bring, I left with my companion at such a place, whither if he would send two of his men he might have them. The Merchant having seen me at the Farmer's door, suspected nothing of the Knavery, but thanking and intreating me civilly, sent his men, who returned not long after with my companion: I told him then, as well he knew, the Wine was very new but very rich, and that if he kept it some time it would prove very well; he nevertheless tasted it, then stop'd the Bottles and sealed them: we returned well paid, and he satisfy'd, for we gave him no reason to complain with the Poet.  Cum peterem mixtum vendidit ille merum.  How he cheats the Farmer with whom he dwelt, of Twenty pounds.  way to spend it as fast as I got it, which set my wits every day to seek for more. I cast my Eyes into every door and on every person, nothing was rich, nothing precious, but I had a vehement desire to it, this made me attempt many things in vain, for want of faithful Confederates, as Plate, Jewels, and the like things of great value. At length having observed the great Trade my Master drove with several strange Merchants for victualing their ships, and that great parcels of Money were oft brought home before him by our men, for sometimes he was treated and staid much longer. I got several such bags of several bigness, and filled them with Peble stones and Lead to a just weight. These I kept till occasion offered it self, which was on this wise. A Spanish Merchant having bought many Swine of the old Man, invited him and his Family to a dinner on Shipboard: the Money in the mean time one of our men brought home by several parcels and charged me to stay till he brought the rest: he was no sooner gone but I emptied one, containing about 20 pounds of English Money, filled it with my Pebbles, and pieces of Lead, and left it whence first I took it; the Man return'd not long after with the rest of the Money, and the old Man, his Wife, and his Son with him. I was then playing before the door, and gave no cause of suspition, for oftentimes Money had been brought into our House on this wise. The old Farmer put up his bags in his Closet, till some days after having occasion to pay out some Money for Cattle, amongst others, he brought down this Bag, when finding the deceit, and not mistrusting the fidelity of his Servant whom he had found faithful in more important matters, could attribute it to nothing but the Merchants subtilty, and with grief was forced to put it up for a Spanish trick.

And therefore I don't blame him if he went With thee, to see thy Pyre was his intent. He lov'd thee well that follow'd thee to death, And I'le love him as long as I have breath.) I resolved never to rest till I had either found out the owner and recovered my Money, or by some stratagem got as much of his in lieu of it. I went therefore the next day to see first if the owner would sell the Tree, but I heard it was already cut in pieces and piled up for Fuel. This therefore not succeeding, I went instantly to the Man, faining that I had dream'd for ten nights together, which was then the number of my years; That in such a Tree there was a Treasure hid, in such a place, describing both the shape of the Bag, and the colour of the Strings: I added further, That an old Woman appeared to me in my sleep the tenth night , which was that night before the Tree was cut, saying in these words, I am sorry, Poor Orphan Child, thou hast not had the wisdom to goe take and enjoy the Treasure I laid up for thee, in the place whereof I have often admonished thee; nevertheless if thou wilt at length believe me and goe to the owner, he shall certainly restore it, or be so plagued, that his death shall be more desirable then his life, Farewel . The Countrey man strangely amazed at my words, and true description of the Place, Tree, Bag, and all other circumstances, confessed more out of fear then honesty, he found such a Bag in the same Tree, and therein the value of Five pounds, and thereupon gave me so much, who seeming ignorant of twice as much that he kept behind, thanked him and returned home well satisfied for the present. But I let slip no occasion for the recovering of the rest, for that same evening I sent one of my faithful companions to strew Henbane which I had prepared amongst his Poultry in the yard, and the night being somewhat dark, I went my self immediately with others of my companions to his Farme, where finding a young Colt of his in a Close adjoyning to the House, we forced his mouth open and put a strong gag therein, many sheep we served the like cruelty, and to a fat Hog in a Stie we gave some Lees of Wine that I had brought for that purpose, and so departed till the next morning; then before day I stole from home and returning to the Cattle, ungag'd their mouth's, but the poor beasts by the misery they had endured all night, could not graze at ease in the morning, after their accustomed manner, but opening their mouth wide, after strange postures came bleating towards the House, so that passengers stood staring on them at a distance; judging them to have been bewitched: the Poultry likewise some reeling, some dead, some drooping, would have moved pity in any one; but above all the Swine in the Stie who had greedily devoured the Wine Lees, lay along so drunk, that all adjudged it to be dead. These things seemed like so many Prodigies, and the report drew all the neighborhood thither, insomuch that the poor man was almost distracted, then relating to his friends what he thought was the reason of this misfortune, was by all advised to search for me presently, and give me the residue of the Money: I was not long to be sought for in such an occasion, for I was there present as one drawn by the news, and pretended by my feigned Tears in my Eyes to be very sorry for his misfortune; he laying all the fault to his own dishonesty, gave me the residue to a farthing; and the next day when he saw the Cattle recover their stomachs, his Hog alive again, which seemed dead to all appearance; for by this time the intoxicating strength of the Wine was spent, and some few onely of his Poultry dead, he rejoyced exceedingly, That he had escaped so well.  Two Cheats he puts upon his Master, an English Gentleman.  whom I lived; but the noise of it now, was so spred abroad, that it reached his ear; nor was any Child in the Town, ignorant of my good fortune. He therefore commanded me, being young, and one that knew not the good use of Money, to commit my Wealth to his custody: This grieved me much, though indeed I did but render him his own; then considering my self, as miserable now I had Money, as I was when I had it not, I found the Miser spake true of his Gold.  Thy want is grief, Thy presence no relief. This was my condition then, but like the growing Palm, I rose with the more reluctancy against the weight that oppressed, endeavoring daily to be at my own Liberty, the Old Man seeing my inclination was to a loose life, which in all probability would never succeed well; and having this parcel of Money of mine in his hands, was resolved to lay it out to my good, especially since the evil that hapned to the other Man, passed every where amongst the people for a great judgment of God. He thereupon resolved, either to bind me Apprentice, or furnish me with Cloaths and Necessaries fitting me to wait on some Gentleman, putting the two ways of life to my choice. The latter pleased my ranging fancy best; for I could not be contented with a bit and a knock; and my Soul was to large to be confined to the narrow limits of a Shop and Yard. I did not long want a Master, for an English Gentleman newly landed, wanted a Lackey that should understand both Languages, English and French ; the latter of these was natural to me, the first by oft conversation with Englishmen , which were always in our Haven, I had pretty well gained: So that this making for me, and my Feature and Age concurring, he took me to be his Servant for Eight Pistols Per annum ; which amounts in English Money to Six pounds. I had served him three quarters of a year without considerable damage, except the stealing his Wine, and such things as I could make merry with amongst my old Comrades in his absence, till at last I had gained so much of his good will, that I dared presumptuously to abuse it; which was on this wise. My Master hapned to make a journey to Deep , where he had Goods in a Ship that was to unload there, which gave me opportunity to search in every hole, and to open all his Packets I could come at, amongst the rest, I found several pieces of Silks, whereof I chose one, and bound up the Packet again so exactly, that the most curious eye could not have perceived the string to have been stirred. This stopt my appetite till such time my Master came home, who amongst the rest of his Goods, brought two good English Horses, wherewith he intended to travel farther into our Countrey, I thought two Horses too much for one Man, and resolved to rid him of one, as fast as I could, without giving him suspition of my infidelity. My Master having use but for one of his Horses, desired the Old Farmer, with whom I dwelt, for there they were kept, to let the other run in some Pasture Ground of his; but it was so well fenced for fear of the Poor Seamen, who were continually lurking about the Town, to steal and pilfer what they meet next, that it excluded all possibility of getting him thence undiscovered. There was one Villain more notable then the rest then at Callais , for want of Money to transport himself to his Native Country. Pretending therefore occasion to go see some sick Friend of mine, I begged leave of my Master, which he easily granted. Then went I to a poor comrade of mine, not acquainting him in the least with my design, but desiring him to lend me the worst Cloaths he had, because being to go by such a Road to such a place, I feared lest I might be stript by some Villain of those I wore. He soon granted me so small a request, and I changed there my rich Cloaths, for those that were scarce estimable, ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif)  . Thus arrayed and unknown by them that saw me, I went to the Sea side in search of the person above-mentioned, who was wont to be there to help load and unload Goods brought in and carried out of the Port. I soon found him, for indeed he had no other house, nor shelter, then what the Shore by day, and the Rocks by night afforded. I had prepared my Speech with all the rhetorick I had to perswade, sometimes tempting him to this theft, by representing to him his miserable condition in a strange Country, and how great his felicity would be, if he were in his own, which by this one action he might easily procure. Then I proposed all the probability I had to effect it secretly, That I knew the House very well, the Field, every passage and turning thereabout: Lastly, That it remained on his part onely to get a receiver ready, when I should bring it the next morning to the Sea-side, in such a Creek, about Two Miles from the Great Haven. He needed not much prompting to such a wickedness, that would prove, in all probability, so advantageous to his obtaining his liberty; nor was he long before he found a Receiver, being as I told you before, well skilled in this sort of Knavery. Besides, gain is so sweet, and the thirst of it so great, that there are few Ship-Masters so honest, who will not for its sake, or at least under colour of obliging the Poor Seamen, whose case may happen to be theirs, buy any kind of stoln commodity. He bid me therefore, prosecute my design with the greatest diligence and secrecy possible, and not to fail him at the place and time appointed the next day, where he would certainly expect me. I returned, changed my Cloaths, and came home: The next day, as I was wont every morning, I rid out the Horse to breath him, but with far different intention; for he was never to return again to my Master. As soon as out of sight, I reinvested my self with my rags, and rid directly to the place appointed. My comrade, on his side, had performed admirable diligence in preparing a Flemish Bark that was to set sail that day, ready, and was already expecting my arrival. Things hitherto fell out exceeding well, when one of our Neighbors passing by might have discovered all, had I not suddenly before he could see me, given the Horse to my comrade to hold. This I did with intention, that if he took any knowledge of me, I might afterward pretend the Horse was forced from me, which I could not do, when I should be known to have had it in my hand, and he but on foot. Nevertheless he passed by, not discerning who I was, being clouded in such pittiful disguise. We soon agreed with the Master for our price, by selling it at an under rate; for the Horse, being worth about Twenty four Pistols, which amounts in English Money to Eighteen pounds. I had for my share Six Pistols, and my Confederate as many. So he sailed away well satisfied to his own Country, and I having hid my Money in the Field, with hopes of better success then I had of my First Treasure, mentioned in the Eighth Chapter, Came crying home to my Master, who admired much my long absence; but wondred more to see me come home in such Rags, on Foot, and with Tears in my Eyes. Yet I so well feigned my grief, That I moved the Heart of the good Gentleman, he bid me therefore relate, without fear, what had befel me, if possibly it might be remedied. Then intermixing a thousand sighs and tears, which the moisture of my tender age supplied me with, I began on this manner. It was the unhappiness of your Poor Servant, and then I cryed, to ride out your Horse this Morning as I was wont; and then I sighed. But alas! And here I would have left off, and cryed again, had he not cheered me up, and bid me manfully to relate the whole Misfortune: A certain Villain, whether a stranger, or no, I cannot tell; but I am sure he was a Rogue, came to me, and taking opportunity at the goodness of your Horse, and my Cloaths; as likewise, my weakness, being but a childe, laid hold on my Bridle, pulled me off, and bound me, till having brought me to the Sea-shore, he first shipped your Horse; then indeed did I expect to follow, and never to have seen my good Master more, or my Foster-Father; but whether in compassion of my tears, or that he knew not how to dispose of me, stript me of my good Cloaths, and putting me on these ugly Rags, bid me go learn to shift for my self. And what shall I do for Cloaths! These Rags! Well, my Boy, said he, and could not but laugh, seeing my pretty Innocency in preferring my Cloaths of small value, before the loss of his Horse, I shall provide thee better Cloaths. And thus by my dissembling, I safely did conceal and bring my wickedness to its desired effect.  So Sinon once the Trojans did perswade, To take the fatal Horse the Grecians made. My ragged habit like to his appears, Such are my Sighs, and such my feigned Tears. In all things we agree, excepting this, I took my Masters Horse, he gave them his.  His Night-Meetings with his old Companions, with his witty devices to rob his Master of his Wine, and Neighbors of their Poultry.  the quality of the person I served; and I went about my business with the same diligence I had formerly used, meaning thereby to rub out whatsoever suspition my Master might have of my infidelity. I was always at his Elbow at home, and took opportunity for satisfying my desires when he was abroad. Then did I meet with my old Companions, and according to every ones secret Conspiracies; some brought Pigs, some Capons, Turkies, Geese, and whatever good cheer, either by stealth, or otherwise they could get. The procuring of Wine fell to my share, by reason of the poverty of their Friends, and the richness of my Master, who kept store of Wine in his Seller; yet his care of it was so great, that it forced me to invent many ways to obtain such large quantities, as our frequent meetings required. But our Wine being in Earthen-Vessels of two or three Gallons, gave me opportunity to break them several times, when I had almost exhausted them; and then when I had just occasion to go down next into the Celler, I would speedily return, crying, That either the newness, or the strength of the Wine had broken such a Vessel, and if speedy care were not taken, the rest were in the like danger. He put his Wine at length according to our Countrey fashion, in great Leather-Bottles, which are indeed more sure and more commodiously Portable then those of Earth. But alas, when the force proceeded not from an inward, but an external cause, this could in no wise secure them. For though they were new, and of strong Leather, such as could not be broken or burst by the strength of the Wine; yet I soon found out another invention with a Bodkin, so to prick their sides till they lost their dearest Blood, and that the wound appeared to be the knawing of the Rats. For by reason of the newness of the Leather, and something wherewith it, was greesed on the out-side that smelt strong, it could not have easily been perceived to have been done by any other cause. This trade continued so long undiscovered till our Seller was almost full with empty Bottles; then I dared to proceed no farther, but pretending want of Wine at that time; I changed my Office in our company, and took upon me to procure Poultry. My first adventure was in a Neighbors Hen-house, which was at the end of a Barn, in their Yard; the one side towards their House, the other towards the Fields; the latter I attempted, broke in through some thin Boards, killed so many, till by their often fluttering, notice was given to the owners by their Dog in the Yard, That the Fox was in the Barn; the People ran out with Lights and Staffs to the Door, but I had secured that, by stopping the Key-hole with Pebble-stones and Sand, and had time enough to retreat with my Booty in safety, having not far to go to our Club; where I had no sooner related the process of my theft, but I was entertained by one of my companions with a story no less pleasant. He, watching about the door (for he had knowledge of my intention) no sooner perceived the People to be run out to catch the Fox in the Barn, but he slipt into the House, where a fat Goose was roasting by the Fire; this he took, Spit and all, and brought it away undiscovered, which made me say.  Poor Fools, to think your Goose was sure In open House, when Locks could not secure Your Hens. Know then the Fox loves both, A Roasted Goose, as well as Cock in Broth.  Two notable Pranks he Plays at an Inn in Callais .  had to follow them, by reason of my Masters business, which often called him abroad; and the good success of my first attempt, spurred me on to a second adventure of the like nature. There was an Inn not far off, which for the accommodation of Merchants and Strangers that arrived at our Port, was always furnished with great store of delicate Viands. Hither, I came accidentally to drink with my companion that in the stealing away my Masters Horse, had lent me his Cloaths, and was conducted by the servant of the House into the Kitchin to the Fire. The Chimney was so large as to contain one in each Corner, and the Weather being something cold. I placed my self there, where casting up my eyes accidently, I espied great number of Neats Tongues; and then pretending the Fire to be over- hot, I desired another Room, and called up for more Wine: Afterwards I imparted my minde to my companion, and the desire I had to those Tongues, nor was my invention far from my desire to obtain them; for I presently agreed, That I would feign my self in a Swound, and that while the People came up to my succor; he under colour to go fetch my Friends, might carry away what he pleased. The Plot took well, for I so acted the Dead-man, that I employed all the People of the House to fetch me to life. My companion was, in the mean time, as nimble as I seemed immoveable, and had conveyed away, under his Coat, six of the best; and then returned in great hast, that he could not find my Master; at that, the best way was to send me home in a Chair. But at his return I seemed to come to my self, and by degrees grew better and better. They would have sent their Man with me home, but not desiring his company, I said, That I had been used from my infancy to have such fits; and was as well after them, as before them; being troubled onely for that time they came on me ? Then paying my reckoning, with thanks for their pains, in my recovery, I took my leave. But the half dozen proved so well, that provoking my appetite, they bred in me a lust for more, and caused me to attempt the rest, which was on this wise. Passing often before the Door, I saw one day a great tumult there, and approaching, perceived that two Sea-men fell out with the Host; who seemed not satisfied for a Dinner they had had that day, they cryed, They were cheated, and would pay no more ; at last it came to blows; and the two Men, oppressed with the multitude of Townsmen that took the Inn-keepers part, paid by suffering what remained of their reckoning, and so departed discontented, as you may imagine, at such open shame. I went therefore that same Night, and fired a little Barn belonging to the House, and went my ways, till such time the Fire blazed out, then came I with my companions, as most of the Neighborhood did, to see that sad accident. For though indeed there was no farther danger, then of the Barn, being separated from the rest of the House; yet such is the fear of people in such a calamity, that their Doors were all opened, and they began to remove their Goods all out of their Houses. Here we had opportunity enough, whilest they minded to pack up their best Goods, for what we intended, and besides got a considerable booty out of many other Houses; especially the Poultrey seemed to be vanished away in the fright, for we had conveyed away above Twenty Chickens, and Twelve Geese and Turkies, which afterwards we enjoyed.  A very ingenious device whereby he clears two Seamen taken on suspition to have set the Innkeepers Barn on fire.  appeased till the next morning, then the Inn-keeper supposing, that it came by two Seamen, whom he had the day before injur'd, resolved to prosecute them, and thereupon made diligent search and inquiry after them, which he could easily doe being acquainted with most of the Merchants and Ship-masters that used our Port. He had no sooner apprehended them, but he brought them before the Magistrate, and swore against them, which caused them, notwithstanding their just excuses to expect the rigor of the Law in such cases, Having heard of these proceedings, I immediately went to the place of Judicature, and desired to be heard, which being permitted, I began in this wise. GENTLEMEN, Though none here is ignorant of the late Fire that seized on this mans Barn, yet the cause is totally hid from you. For it happens in such cases oftentimes, that by some foregoing passage we mistake the cause of the thing: So have I heard of a Gentleman that bought the Hat of a murdered Person for a new one ignorantly, and being afterwards found with it on his head, was prosecuted by the dead mans friends, and lost his life, and these two poor men, strangers to you and me, because they quarrelled the day before with this man, are thought to be the Authors of what they never did, and to have revenged themselves on his House for the abuse done to their persons. This makes me bold in their justification, being innocent of that sad accident of which you shall know both the Author and the Cause, who hath not feared to offer himself to protect and set free the innocent. I was passing by your Barn, Sir, with a Torch in my hand, the night being obscure, in haste, and knockt it against the corner post, so that I left some burning upon the side of it. For indeed my Childish simplicity had not yet furnished me with that caution to put it out, and my business called me away too hastily, for I found at my return the Barn in a-blaze, which I ran to inform you of, but before I came it had discovered itself by its fearful operations. It was not therefore set on fire by Counsel or Conspiracy, but by accident; not by any envy these men intended, or revenge they desired, but by my negligence: inflict therefore the punishment you desire on the guilty offender, but let the innocent goe free; for I could suffer any thing patiently rather then endure to see so great injustice done to people that in no wise deserved it; and here I offer my body, for I am an unhappy Orphan, and can make no restituion by money or Goods, to suffer the penalty of my Crime . My Words and the Ardency wherewith I spake them, caused great admiration to the hearers; all applauded and wondred at me: the Inn- keeper heartily thanked me that had kept him from so great wickedness as he should have committed in putting two innocent men to death, and forgave me what I had done; and the Magistrate sent away the two Seamen free, and all went away with great content and admiration.  Now all's secure, the Fire's out, and you Seamen, that felt the storm but nothing knew, Depart in peace, the worst of danger's past. So after a tempestuous Sea, at last Our safety's seen, by Fire about the Mast.  How he leaves Callais and goes with his Master to Diepe in Normandy, thence to Rouen, and what hapened to him there.  my last adventure had brought my Master into so good an opinion of me, that he resolved to take me with him in his Travails to Diepe and other parts of France that he intended to visit. My roving mind as it always had a desire to novelty, agreed with my Masters proposition; and the old Man my Foster- Father, whether willing to be rid of me, or thinking it might prove to my good, consented to it. It was not long before we Landed at Diepe , a Haven-Town in Normandy , built on an Arm of the Sea, between two Hills, which secures the Haven, both from the violence of the Weather, and the attempts of Forein Enemies. The Town lies within these Mountains a quarter of a Mile up the Channel. On the top of the Hill is a strong Castle, commodiously seated, both to defend and command it. Here I saw one rarity I shall not omit, it was a Mans Head that had been found in an old Ruinated Wall, inclosed in a Pewter-vessel made for that purpose; it had continued there according to the inscription, Three Hundred years and more, yet the Flesh appeared firm, and retained the countenance of a Warrier with a great Scar, even from his Forehead to his Chin. This was all I saw there, and by reason of our short stay, could act nothing worthy of the relating. Next day we set out for Rouen , my Master rid on his English Horse, but for my part, I could get none for Money, and so was forced to ride in a Chariot, where the dirt. so plagued me, That I repented very much I had sold my Masters Horse at Callais in Picardy ; but bore it patiently as the reward of that injury. We arrived at last at Rouen in an old Inn, and for our Supper was brought up a Rabbet so tuff, that my Master could not eat it; then they brought us an old Hen, which was scarce eatable. This made me fear a change of Fortune, and that I was now to expect Misery; for I had already found the want of the Horse I so wickedly sold, and had now before me such a Supper, that I could scarce tare in pieces, which seemed to be a punishment for my thefts of Pullets. The City Rouen is large, and very pleasantly situated betwixt Mountains on three sides, it contains Thirty two Parish Churches, besides Abbeys and Relligious Houses, which caused my Master, whose business was onely curiosity, to stay two or three days. Inquiring out the rarities of the place, we were informed of a pretty House in the Town, that a Gentleman, by name Boniface , of obscure Parents, which had raised himself to a fortune in the Wars, had built to be an Asylum for his age, this we went purposely to view. It was built like a Half Moon, and the Wall that inclosed the Court before the Door, made a perfect Circle. On the outside, round the House, was a good Border of Ground, a dozen Yards square planted, with most pleasant Flowers and choice Fruit; then a clear Moat well stored with Fish, which secured the rest. On a Gallery of the House, I read this Inscription, Tentanda via amore & armis . A Motto well agreeing with his fortunes, and seeing one that I took for good admonition, and resolved since I was ignorant of my descent, as he had been, to make him my example. My Master very much pleased with the House, was no less desirous to see this Gentleman, whose device he much admired; and thereupon knocked at the Door, and indeed we found, that though the outward appearance had promised much, yet very little in comparison to the Master, whom we found a person most generous and civil, something taller then the common sort of men, his visage was adorned with a grace, That though his age was great, shewed him plainly to be both valiant and generous, he entertained us the whole Afternoon with the greatest civility imaginable, understanding that my Master, was an Englishman (for he was of the same Nation) and forced us by his intreaties to stay Supper; where we had plenty both of costly Meats and Wine; till Supper being ended, he was pleased at my Masters desire to relate the History of his life.  The pleasant History of Boniface and Clora .  the whole world, hath reacht your ear; A man who at fourteen years old was Colonel of the Switzers in Flanders , a little after Marshal of the Camp, then Marshal General; at the Siege of Amiens he was sole Lieutenant of his Majesties forces, though there were many Princes of the Blood in the Army; and to compleat his greatness he was Peer of France , and the Barony of Biron erected into a Dukedome, this valiant man drawing up his forces by the Sea side, saw an English Ship shot through in several places in a sinking condition, yet the kinder waves seemed to take compassion of what it bore and drove it towards the shore; the Dukes curiosity was such, as to send out a small Boat, either to help her or bring her to the shore, if no person were alive in her that could give account of her misfortune; they brought back word there were several dead bodies in her, but the rest seemed to have escaped in the Boat which was gone, and onely one Child alive which they had brought; the Duke took me in his Arms, and it seems at the sight of his Armour I smiled, which caused him to say I should certainly prove a valiant man, that in the midst of such fortune smil'd in his arms, and therefore admiring my strange preservation, as one that was reserved by the Gods for great matters, and taking it for a good omen against his enemies, gave order to two of his men to carry me with speed to a rich Citizen at Paris who should educate me with his greatest diligence: thus was I brought up with the greatest tenderness and care, as if the Duke had been my Father, and was instructed according to his order in all the ornaments both of body and mind; but I must confess my nature inclined more to the Battel then the Gown, and I so behaved my self as to bear office under the Duke at the Siege of Amiens , being then sixteen years old: but to relate the childish years of my Infancy, would but abuse your patience, and lose time, which would be better imployed in relating acts of greater moment; yet let me say thus much, without boasting, I so improved my self in all exercises of Body, and Mind, that this most noble Duke who was certainly one of the most Generous in the World, loved me with extraordinary kindness, and made me companion to his Cousin Florus , a young Lord of France ; for though he was the handsomest youth I ever saw, and had an Air in his Countenance above the common sort of Men, yet my Acts got me such esteem of all, that I seemed a companion most fit for his Quality: I gained indeed the love of the King for my service done him; the good opinion of the Duke for the same cause, and the inclination of the Ladies, as well for that reason as my Feature, which was fairer then to let me escape the eyes of the fairest; so that in the infancy of my Servitude, as oft as I went from the Generous Florus upon any Complement to the Fair Clora his Sister, she would aske me a thousand questions; sometimes how I liked the Court of France , sometimes how her Brother did, and how I liked such a Lady, or such a Lady, and many other pretty questions, That I easily observed she was something pleased with my company, for when the Generous Florus sent any other, she onely returned answer unto the Message brought her, though indeed seldom any was imployed but I, for I always desired the honour of that Service. Thus as long as Infancy lasted, I was the happiest in the world, till my Sixteenth year, then I went with the Duke to the Siege of Amiens , where my Acts were beyond belief of all but the Illustrious Duke, who knew it was possible to be both young and valiant; for he himself at Fourteen, had been Lieutenant of the Switzers in Flanders . I was not dealt with therefore as others who first goe into the World; but on the contrary, at our return from Battle, was Treated as a Man of Noble Extract. The Beauteous Clora , for every minute seemed a thousand years till I saw her, held discourse with me in a more reserved way and less familiarity, though always with the same sweetness. At that time the Lord Florus came in and interrupted us, just as by a blush of mine she seemed to have discovered something of my Passion: I wondred much to see him so sad that was wont to be the most debonaire person alive, nay he had so much forgot himself, that he mist of his due respects to the company; this made us depart sooner then our company intended, and the Beauteous Lady, desired me very much to get out of her Brother, whom she most dearly loved, the cause of his grief; I that was willing to do any thing in her service, to have the opportunity to see her again, promised my utmost endeavour, both to satisfy her demands, and bring the Generous Florus out of his serious melancholly. 'Twas the next day early in the morning, for he had taken but little rest that night, when he came to my Apartment, and since I was his dearest Favorite and Companion, he made me the onely Confident of his Passion, but in such sad expressions, that my soul was also much troubled in his behalf: for consider, said he, the crosness of this adventure, that I should passionately be in Love with the fair Iris , whom so many Nobles Court. Ah fortune, said he, is it not enough to give me ten Rivals, but I must have a thousand, for whom hath she seen that she hath not captivated? Ah my Friend, said he, you know not what Love is, yes replyed I, you have a Companion in your Misery. Can Florus be unhappy and his Friend at rest? doe not mock me, said he, for you cannot harbor a passion without sensible alteration, or carry fire in your bosome without being troubled with it: yes, cry'd I, as long as you are my Friend, I shall never appear unhappy to the World, 'Tis on your welfare depends my health. Good Gods, said he, are you then at last my Rival, and desire me to be well, that is never to love the fair Iris more? The Gods have directed my Eyes a better way, said I, then to offend so generous a friend in desiring to make my self happy by his misfortune: Be happy then my Friend, replyed he, in thy desires, since I cannot be happy in mine: yet clear me at once of all suspition with the name onely of her you Adore: That would be, said I, to incur the displeasure of my dearest Friend, and tender my self miserable forever: well then, replyed he, you have a dearer friend then Florus that you will not disoblige, and a Mistriss that I must never know, though I have revealed mine to you; ah Friend, must this be the end of Amity, must I then renounce my Friendship and good will towards you, whom I have loved so dear; have I told you my mind, and have I not as faithful a Breast to conceal yours? he would have said more, but unwilling to give him cause to suspect infidelity in me, since he was to be the greatest instrument of my happiness, it is, said I---who, said he, is she without a name? not so, replyed I, she hath a name that I Adore above all names, but I must crave your pardon first, before I utter it: Except Iris , said he, I would give thee the Empire of the whole World, were it in my power, rather than cast thee from my Breast; name but another: It is then, said I, the Beauteous Clora , that the unhappy Boniface loves, if you can forgive me that Crime. I doe not forgive onely but shall always, replyed he, be your servant in this point, and desire no other reward but your help in my misfortune: that shall never be wanting, said I, as long as you mediate with your Fair Sister for me, which I hope you will vouchsafe, since by your own passion you may guess the vehemency of mine. Farewel, dear Friend, I hope at my return to bring you more comfort then can be expected from the shortness of the time for my diligence shall never be wanting to my dearest Florus ; Farewel, I left the sad Florus without giving him time, to return answer, and so went to act what I could in his behalf. But since mornings are not fit hours to visit Ladies, I stayed till the afternoon, and then I came so soon after dinner, that I found the fair Iris alone in her Chamber; after I had rendred an officious Complement, which she returned in great civility: Madam, said I, unto her, I am very sorry I come upon so bad news, yet it is my duty to acquaint you, that the Generous Florus is a prisoner: Florus a prisoner, (replied Iris infinitely astonished) Hath his Enemy surprised him at Amiens? No Madam, said I, he is in the City, and is taken by one of my acquaintance, and it is in your power to release him. I cannot deny, said she, but the misfortune of him you name doth exceedingly trouble me, for besides, he is more beautiful then any that ever I saw, he is kinsman to Isara , whom I love very well; it must therefore be either a Crime or an impossibility, if I will not help him: as for things onely difficult, I will attempt them all to save the life of an unfortunate man, that is a very stranger unto me, much sooner for a Friend whom I infinitely esteem. Be pleased, Madam, to resolve then, said I unto her, you will set him at liberty: I will said she; but will you be pleased also to forgive me, when I tell you by what means he is a prisoner, and by what means he must be set free? The fairest Iris was so surprised at this discourse, that she looked upon me and could not answer, and began to suspect the truth. Nevertheless, for her promise sake, she said, she would; then did I make her acquainted with all the Eloquence I could of his misfortune, that without her pitty he was a prisoner forever; sometimes praising his Ancestors, sometimes his Valour, sometime his Beauty, that I gained so much of her good will, that she bid me tell him he was at liberty, and blushed, not able to speak more. Well, Madam, said I, and kist her hand, you have not set him at liberty onely, but made me the happiest Man in the World, her modesty tied her Tongue, and forced her to make signs with her hand, that I should leave her. I willingly obeyed, and the good news so winged my speed, that I soon found out the generous Florus , who had been no less diligent in my behalf, in as much as he was always in his Sisters company, and she loved him most dearly. He thanked me Ten thousand times, and I thanked him as many; but alas his success proved better then mine, for in two moneths space he enjoyed the Beauteous Iris . But Dimnas , my cruel Rival destroyed my Peace, he was a Lord of France , of a haughty Spirit, of twice my Age; yet although not so much in favor with the Beauteous Clora , he thought nevertheless his Birth so far beyond mine, would prevail beyond my tender Addresses, or her Brothers Mediation. One day coming from the fair Clora, Dimnas met me, and speaking very coldly unto me, I have sought you several days, said he, but never could meet you, unless with the Lord Florus , or his Sister, in whose presence you are continually. Had I known your intentions, said I, with the same coldness, but very civilly, I should have come to you to know your pleasure; Perhaps if you had known it, said Dimnas , you would have been so far from coming to me, that you would not have come to the Lady Clora . Since I do not use, said I, to shun either my friends or enemies, I know no reason you should speak to me in this manner. I know less reason, said he, you have to carry your self so of late. Since I ever followed the Rules of Reason, answered I, I do not know how I have misbehaved my self. When I first knew you, said he, it was not easie to see that your frequent visits of the Princes would afterwards prejudice me, or that a Man of your quality should be so bold, as to oppose such a one as my self. My quality (said I, much incensed) is indeed unknown to me, but I had rather be received by the Lady Clora for my own Vertue, then for my quality onely, though it were higher then yours. You may do well, said he, to think of your own, and let mine alone; therefore, let me see you no more with the Lady Clora . If I do--- How Sir, said I, and interrupted him, Force me not to lay aside the respects I should otherwise pay to your quality; for men of carriage cannot brook to be threatned. You shall suffer my threats, replied he, and the effects, if you correct not your self; provided our Swords be equal, said I fiercely, the inequality of our condition shall not hinder you from preventing me: Do me the honor therefore, to tell me with your Sword in your hand, whether it be Nature or Fortune that puts a difference betwixt us; you shall know presently, said he, and drawing his Sword, bid me defend my self. Animated therefore by my love, by my jealousies, and by his angry language, did fight with such fury, that Dimnas as gallant as he was, had a hard task to resist. I found my advantage, and pressed so hard upon him, that I killed him in the place; which forced me in the greatest dispair, to take my Horse and flee for my life in disguise, without taking leave so much as of the Lady, I so dearly loved. How did I wish for Ten thousand Rivals, rather then leave her; how did I curse my self, that I suffered not my adversary to sheath his Sword in my Brest, that I might have died in her service. Thus I lived three years in the greatest misery that man could suffer, till the Wars in Burgundy began; then I resolved to go unknown and regain my credit with the King, and obtain his pardon, or die under the Banner of the Duke that had given me life; but he had no sooner setled the affairs in Burgundy , but he was convicted of High Treason, and afterwards beheaded in the Bastil; then was all my hopes of pardon lost with him, whom before the King loved, as never Man loved. This made me retire hither, and with what my Fortune hast blest me, spend the remainder of my days in sorrow. Thus well satisfied with the History of his Fortunes, my Master thanked him for the pains he had taken in relating them, and the night growing late took his leave.  He goes on with his Master from Rouen to S. Claire; thence passing by Mont- Martyr, he comes to Paris . Two pleasant Stories of S. Dennis and his Church.  ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Villages. ] Dubargs , we came at last to S. Claire ; here were no rarities to entertain my fancy as at Rouen , which gives me leisure, to tell what befel me that night in the Inn. It was so taken up with Passengers, that I could not lie any where: nea my Master, but was forced to lie in the remotest part of the House, over an old Ware- house, in a Bed provided for the Carriers, when they came that way. This gave me opportunity to view the Secresies of every Packet in the dead time of the night. But I found onely about three Pistols in Money, the rest was such stuff that I had no appetite for, and so I returned to Bed. I was no sooner laid, but I could hear one come after me, which caused me to suspect I had been perceived. Therefore I locked my door, and laid my Sword by me with this resolution, rather to kill them that dogged me, and shift for my escape in the morning, then to be subject to the rigor of the Law in a strange place. But it fell out much better then my expectation; for strait one knocked at my door, and in a Womanish voice cryed. My dear, my dear open the door . I was indeed much suprised at this accident, but knowing by the voice it was a Woman that spoke, and desirous to see the end of this adventure, I rose, and opening the door, I returned to my Bed, she followed me as eagerly, being in her Smock, and laying her self down by me. I have waited, said she, this hour for you ever since I saw you first amongst your Packets, how came you in so late late to night. By this time I easily perceived the Poor Wench had mistaken me for the Carrier that used to lie there, and with whom she had formerly used this familiarity; and thereupon making some excuse, that my Horses were faln lame, and the like, I went about that I had never done before. How well I answered her expectation, she onely knows, yet before five a Clock in the Morning, that she went away for fear of being discovered by her Master, she seemed to be as well satisfied with her new Bed-fellow, as I was pleased with the mistake. Not long after my Master rose, but not so well satisfied with his lodging I suppose, as I was with mine, and we passed on in our journey to Paris through Pontoise, which is the last Town of Normandy that way; thence we passed by Mont-Martyr not far distant from Paris: Here it is reported, That in the time that the Heathens inhabited Gaule , many of the faithful suffered Martyrdom: Of these S. Dennis is cheif, being the titular Saint of France . For, say they, after he was beheaded, he made no more to do, but snatched up his head Sir, and ran with it down the Hill, in his Arms, as fast as his Legs could carry him; till at the end of half a mile from the place of his execution, he sate and rested himself, then rose again, and continued the same Eight times more, till he came to the place where they have now erected a Church to his memory; nay, according to that of Minutius Foelix, Majoribus nostris tam facilis in mendaciis fides fuit, ut temere crediderint illa monstrosa miracula: Et quicquid fam ae licet fingere illis erat libenter audire . The Inhabitants are so bewitched into a belief of this miracle, that at every resting place they have built a Stone-Cross and worship there. Now because it will not be altogether unpleasant to relate another story concerning S. Dennis's Church, I shall repeat one, which I finde no where better set forth then where it is, in these words. Paris . the Second, his Father, had cruelly slain Sadrasagille his Governor; and to avoid the fury of his Father, much incensed with that action, he was compelled to wander up and down France , hungry and thirsty; and as he went, and he went (for this Tale says the Author, should be told in the same stile that Wenches tell theirs by the Fires side) till he came to the Sepulcher of S. Dennis , where he laid himself down and slept; and then there appeared unto him, a fine old Man with a Grey Beard, and a Staff in his Hand; and he told him, That his Father was dead; and that he should be King; and he prayed him of all loves, That when he came to be King, he would build a Church there, to the honor of S. Dennis . He had an hard heart, that could deny so sweet an old Man so little a courtesie for so good news; and I trow, he was more kind then so. And so when the Church was built, the Bishop was sent for in all hast to bless it: But it chanced the Night before the Day the Bishop was to bless it, there came to Town an ugly Leaper, and the foulest that ever was seen; and this Leaper would needs lie in the Church: And when he was there, about Twelve a Clock in the Night our Saviour came to the Church in Garments as White as driven Snow; there came with him the Apostles, the Angels, and the Martyrs, and sweetest Musick that ever was heard in the World. Then Christ blessed the Church, and said unto the Leaper, that he should tell the Bishop, That the Church was already blessed; and for a token of it, he gave the Leaper his health; who presently became as fine a sweet Youth, as one should see in a Summers day. Auditam admisse risum teneatis . You may laugh, if you please, but I will assure you this is the Story: Neither is it a jot the less Authentical, because of the stile. Such ridiculous stuff did the Monks and Friers of those times, invent to please and blind the people. But enough of this, Ne quid nimis , I shall return to my Master, who at our arrival at Paris , being a Gentleman, would not lie in the Common Inns, but took a Lodging in a Private Citizens House.  Hitherto Fortune crown'd me with success, And every Action had it, more or less. Perhaps th'are childish though, and these to hear, Is Meat for such, and no Judicous Ear. If Childish, I was then a Child you know; And Vices must as well as Vertues grow. Pardon me, Courteous Reader, for what's past, That was the top, the bottom comes at last. Thus skill'd in Arts, Apprentices do go To Cities, their themselves and Crafts to show. And I that formerly, to act have been afraid, Am come to Paris now, to drive full Trade.  He Cheats a young Gallant with whom he Liveth, of One hundred Crowns, and a Countrey Maid of her Virginity.  the House fell sick of a Feaver, and being then in his Climacterical year, yielded up his last breath. The Widow then left with Children grown to Mans Estate, who like Birds as soon as feathered leave the Nest, forgetting the Respects which they owe to those that gave them Life, found it too hard a matter to rule or govern them longer; for the Son commonly thinks himself too wise to be ruled by a Womans Orders, and scorns to submit unto a Sex which seems to be born to live in subjection. This made Laris , for so was her eldest Son's name, take little care for any thing but gratifying his sensual pleasures, for having carried away the Means and Estate from the rest, he imployed his time onely in Hunting, Gaming and Visiting his Neighbors, and such like exercises being the usual recreations of head-strong Gallants. 'Tis no wonder then if this loose kind of life opened a door to greater debauchery; for by these courses of life the fire that lies hid in youthful Blood is soon kindled. 'Twas his fortune one day as he Hunted, to cast his Eyes upon a a Farmers Daughter whose Beauty was above a Countrey-comliness, and whose person had nothing clownish but her Apparel; thus Nature who breeds the fairest Pearls in the craggiest Rocks, takes delight sometimes, to shew, that she is no less industrious in the Countrey then in the Cities; in a word, Beauty is there for the most part most chaste, and Chastity more fair. The young Gentleman inthralled with her Love (whose name was Villa ) thought by reason of his great Riches, that he should easily obtain his desire: and as the French Blood is very active in this case, he let slip no opportunity to effect it; but he found himself far wide in his account; for besides that by a natural Modesty, she avoided all the importunities of this Complimenter: she was also withheld by another tye, being long before engaged to a young man of her own quality, whom she loved dearly as her life. This made her more circumspect and wary, and in no wise to correspond to the fooleries of Laris , for seeing him come, she would turn another way or imploy her self about some huswifery, in conclusion, she avoided this Youth in such manner, that all the subtilties which he invented to entrap her, were as so many vented Mines without effects. This brought his passion to that height that it plainly appeared in his countenance, and could lie hid no longer, for according to that of Apullcius , these be the signs of Love, Melancholly, Pallor deformis, Marcentes oculi, quies turbida, & spiritus cruciatus tarditate vehementior , or as Ovid speaks concerning Canace .  Fugerat ore calor, maciesque obduxerat artus, Sumebant minimos ora coacta cibos. Nec somni faciles, & non erat annua nobis: Et gemitum nullo pressa dolore dabam. So that I soon perceived (for by reason of my debonaire humour, I was often in his company) that his jovial disposition was now smothered with a sudden melancholly, and that he bent to solitariness now more then ever he did before to good company: I resolved therefore to search out the cause of it, telling him that though I were a stranger, and one that he knew not so well as his Brothers, yet I had a Breast as faithful as theirs, and a courage that could never brook an injury done to my friend. My Brothers, said he, I know are not well wishers to my life that inherit the whole Estate; nay I would rather trust it in the hands of a stranger then theirs: then, replyed I, you shall, if you please, find by the effects, that I am no stranger but your friend to the last, impart onely to me the reason of your sudden change. At these words the credulous Youth could no longer smother his Passion, but in much sorrow told me all that I have been hitherto relating; adding, that if I could help him, it was not that (putting a handful of Money into my hand) but a greater recompence should be made to my fidelity. I had now hit the mark I aimed at, and was ready to doe any thing one these conditions. First, therefore I sought to know the name of him she loved as the key to my designe, and where he lived, which with much difficulty at last I gained, on this wise. I disguised my self in poor Habit, coloured my Face Tawny, and my Voice did naturally concur; for being educated at Callais in Picardy , I had not yet polisht the roughness of my clownish French with the City Dialect; that I was more like a true  Ægyptian then a natural French man. Then went I to the Farmers house desiring some Bread, and that I would tell them their Fortunes for it, pretending great skill in Phisiognomy, and Chiromancy: the young Maids, as it is common in such cases, desirous to be informed of their Sweethearts, came flocking to the door, but I saw not the Daughter amongst them: well, said I, you are not all come, there is one behind still, pray tell her she shall have as good fortune as the rest if she please to hear it: nevertheless I fell to my Art, some I told this, some that, and pleased them so well, that at last they called her out. Qualiacunque voles, Jud aeus somnia vendit, spondet amatorem tenerum, &c. : Well, said she, and how many Sweethearts shall I have? their's, said I, pointing to the rest are to come, but you have one already, nay two; then calling her aside, tell me, said I, the name of the first, and that you may believe that I have skill in my Profession, I shall tell you the name of the other, and which you shall certainly have. This so tickled up her fancy, that immediately she confessed his name was Jacques Moulier , then I pulled out my Table Book, and making some Figures therein: well, said I, it falls out thus; the first Letter of another that loves you, is L. which coming between I. and M. unfortunately shall lose his aime, two having more prevalence then one, and so you shall certainly enjoy the first. Now, I , the first Letter of his name being the third Vowel of the Six, is to be multiplied thrice, the result is Nine, and it follows, you shall enjoy your Love on Saturday Seven-night, which is the Ninth day from this being Wednesday. By these Quirps I induced her to believe all was true; nay, said I, Venus and Ameriger , the great Gods of Love being now in conjunction, signify, this shall be brought to pass by a Letter and a Cross. The Maid was again overjoyed, the time of her Marriage grew so near, and I had so described the person of Laris , that was to be deceived of all his hopes to her, that I gave her no cause to suspect the least deceit, she rewarded me as I had pleased her, with more Bread and Cheese then a Stomach well an hungred could have eaten, yet I thanked her for it, and so returned to my friend. But not acquainting Laris with what had passed, well, said I, what would you give me, if in a weeks time I bring you into the Arms of your beloved, without being tied to the bands of Wedlock; I would give more then I am worth, said this desperate Lover, if I had it, to enjoy her: well, said I again, a hundred Crowns shall suffice for my Reward, and you shall, providing onely you will furnish me with a Priests Habit, and your self with a Peasants; that I can easily doe, replyed he, and thereupon sent his Lacquey to an old Fryar of his acquaintance; and afterwards to a Tenant of his not far distant. This done, you must be ready, said I, on Saturday Seven-night in the Evening at Five of the Clock, to go to the Fifth Cross on Saint Dennis -Hill in those Cloaths, with a patch on your face, and an old Periwig on your Head, there you shall meet her, but counterfeit your voice as much as you can, and say what you imagine the other would say in your case, for by a Letter I shall bring it to pass, that she shall meet you there instead of her Lover Moulier , at five of the clock in the evening; thence you shall conduct her to the Flower de Luce Inn on that Rode, where, as by your appointment I shall come soon after in my Priests Habit and marry you; you may pretend this Secresie, is least you should be known by your friends and the like, so shall you enjoy her that night, and if you please, discover your self next morning as her lawful Husband, or go satisfied in your desires: for the probability of my propositions he gave me fifty Crowns, with promise of fifty more after I should have brought the matter to pass. So I returned to my Master till next days leisure gave me time to write and send her this Letter. My dear Villa , I Have resolved at length in answer to all thy tender love, to marry thee next Saturday Seven-night, at the Flower du Luce Inn, near S. Dennis Church: Meet me therefore at five in the Evening at the Fifth Cross, and I shall conduct thee thither, where I have appointed a Priest to meet us. I shall come in disguise it is true, but you shall know me by a Patch on my Face, and a short Perewig; for I dare not yet discover my intentions to any, for fear of my Rival Laris, accept the faithful Villa, from whom death shall never part. Her true Lover J. Moulier . She received and read this Letter, and whether induced by what I had told her of the time, and the place, in form of a Gipsie, or out of a desire to be married and frustrate Laris intentions, to believe it was true. She met at the time and place appointed, where I married her, and my confederate enjoyed her. This allayed his Passion, for as the desire had caused it, so the enjoyment of the thing dispersed all appearance of Erotique Melancholly in him.  Thus for a hundred Crowns I sold the Maid, By my fallacious stratagem betray'd, Unto the arms of him she hates. I fear That he hath bought repentance too, too dear, But I thrive. Bought wit's best, and therefore it's fit, When the Crows gape, the Fox should get the bit.  What hapned the next Morning.  youth, concealed in the shades of Night, made good use of his time, to the satisfaction of his beloved, being well pleased with the sweet potion I had procured for his Passion. For scarce had the Sun left Thetis Brest, and blushed above the Horison, when these two lovers parted likewise she to her Fathers house, without discovering the deceit for C aecus Amor ; he to his Mothers, as debonaire as ever, for Amoris vulnus eadem qu ae facit sanat , according to the Epigram, ![](/images/inline/Tgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) , ![](/images/inline/kgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eegr.gif) . ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/naugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sbAgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/khgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ugr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  . ![](/images/inline/Kgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/aacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ohtigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/isubgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/utigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ὒ ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/thgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rbohgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ἔ ![](/images/inline/bgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  .  I, sweet am Telephus, thou Achilles be. And let thy Beauty cure that wounded me. He related me the whole Passages, and Success of the foregoing Night, wherewith he seemed so well pleased, That he gave me the other Fifty Crowns; and to compleat our mirth, I rehearsed what befel me in the Inn, when I was mistaken for the Carrier. Thus we passed the best part of the Morning till my Master rose, who according to his custom had scarce walked in the Garden an hour, but Dinner was ready. After which, they walked out in the Garden, My Master, the Widow, her Son, Laris and her two Daughters, to the Fountain in the midst of the Garden; which was the most pleasantly planted that ever I saw any belonging to a private house. The Fountain was on this wise. A great Brasen-Snake circled round, the Body of a fair Orange-Tree, which was then onerated with its Golden Fruit, which the Rays of the Sun made to appear most glorious, dispersed its Crystal Waters through Seven Heads (for so many Children had she had, and her Husband had there erected so many Heads) three yards distance from every side of the Tree, round the which was a Marble Seat curiously cut into several Fruits and Flowers, where it was most pleasant either to sleep by the noise of the Falling Waters, or sit in the hottest day of Summer, secure from the scortching Rays. Here they entertained my Master with several pleasant Discourses, for I staid Dinner with the Servants which were two Women, and as he was pleased to tell me afterwards (for such things Decies repetita placebunt ) the Widow began thus.  The Pleasant History of a Knight of Pavia .  recover the Holy Land , made an Universal Invasion over the Sea; which Saladine , then Sultan of Babylon , a Man as vertuous as Politick hearing, resolved to go in person, and see what the Christian Princes did; and thereupon disguises himself in Merchants habits with two of his greatest Lords: And having put his business in order in Egypt , pretends he will go a Pilgrimage. Thus viewed he many Christian Provinces, till riding at last by Lombardy , to go over the Mountains, it came to pass, That going from Millan to Pavia , and already belated, he met with a Gentleman of Pavia , who was then returning with his Men, his Hawks, and his Dogs, to a House of his by the River Tesin. Saladine therefore asks one of Mr. Thorels men (for so was the Gentlemans name) how far they had to Pavia , and whether they could arrive there that night time enough to get in. Mr. Thorel did not stay to let his Men make answer, but seeing they were strangers, answered himself, My Lord, you cannot arrive time enough to get in. Then said Saladine , tell us, if you please, because we are strangers, where we may lodge. That will I do with all my heart, said Mr. Thorel , I was just now sending one of my Men not far from Pavia , about some business; and he shall go with you, and conduct you to a place where you may be very well lodged. Then whispering to one of his men, he gave him charge to carry them a farther way about to his House. This done Mr. Thorel takes a nearer way home, before them, and furnishing a Table ready in a Summer-House, he stood expecting them at the Window. His man that had led the strangers over many pleasant Paths, to give his Master time enough, did now approach; and Mr. Thorel no sooner perceived them, but he came down Stairs, and smiling said, Gentlemen you are very welcome. Saladine then saluted him in these words. Sir, If men may complain of those that are civil, we may complain of you, that force us without any merit of ours to receive so great a courtesie from you. This courtesie you receive from me, said Mr. Thorel , is not comparable to those such persons merit, as your faces promise you to be; but out of Pavia you could not be well lodged, and therefore I desire you would not take it ill, if you are stopt a little in your way for your ease; and saying thus, All his men came to attend them, and took care of their Horses. Then Mr. Thorel brought these three strangers to the Room he had prepared for them; where with cool Wines, and pleasant Discourse, he entertained them till Supper. And those that were with him could speak Latin, which was the cause they understood one another: So that it seemed to these strangers, that this Knight was the most courteous and accomplished Gentleman they had ever seen. It seemed likewise to Mr. Thorel , that his guests were great men, and that they merited more then at first sight, he thought. So that he was sorry in himself, that he could not help them that night to better company that might entertain them better; but resolved to recompence it the next day at Dinner. Therefore he sent one of his men to his wife at Pavia , to prepare against the next day; and afterwards led them into his Garden, where he desired to know who they were, to whom Saladine answered, They were Cyprian Merchants which came from Cyprus . Thus from one Discourse to another, they passed the time till Supper, where they were so entertained, that it was much beyond their expectation, if it had been a set Banquet. When the Cloath was taken away, Mr. Thorel imagining they might be weary, conducted them to a large Bed-Chamber, and a little after took his leave. His Servant that he sent to Pavia , had done his message to his Wife, who sent for many of her Friends, and of Mr. Thorels Servants, and prepared all that was necessary for a great Feast according to her Husbands commands. Next day the Gentlemen rose, and Mr. Thorel taking his Hawks with him, contented his guests wonderfully with that pleasant pastime. But said Saladine , who will inform us, which is the best Inn in Pavia . It shall be I, said Mr. Thorel , that will inform you, for I am going thither, as well as you. Thus they passed on till about nine of the Clock they arrived at Pavia , and thinking they were going to the best Inn, they came to Mr. Thorels House, where about Fifty of the cheifest of the City were ready to receive them. At this sight, Saladine , and his Companions, much amazed. This is not that, said they, that we desired of you, therefore pray leave us in our way; to which, Mr. Thorel answered, My Lords, for what is past, I am more indebted to Fortune then to you, in as much as you had need of diverting there: But for this morning I have prepared, and likewise all these Gentlemen that are about you; therefore if it seems to you, to be civil to refuse to dine with them, you may. Saladine and his company overcome with his perswasions alighted, and received by all the Gentlemen, were brought into a Chamber richly furnished for them; then having pulled off their riding Cloaths, and being a little refreshed, they were conducted into the Hall, where all things were triumphantly in order; here they sate down to dinner, where they were so magnificently served with such varieties of meats, and such good Order, that the Emperour himself had he been there, could not have been better entertained; and although Saladine and his companions were great Lords, and used to see great Feasts; nevertheless they much wondred at this, considering the quality of the Knight, that they knew to be a Citizen and not a Prince. When they had sate a little after dinner, the Gentlemen of Pavia , according to Mr. Thorel's desire went out, and he remained with the three strangers onely. Then, that their might be nothing that he loved but they should see, he sent for his Wife, which was a Woman very fair and beautiful, richly cloathed, and accompanied with her two little Boys that appeared like Angels on each side of her; when they saw her they saluted her with great respect, and made her sit between them, and made much also of her fair Children; then after a little discourse had past between them, she asked from whence they came and whither they went: to which they answered the same they had done to Mr. Thorel : then said the Lady smiling, I perceive my womanish advice will prove to the purpose, which I desire you as an especial favour you will not deny, nor scorn the little Present I shall cause to be brought, but that you will accept of it, considering that Women according to their small abilities give little Gifts; and that you will look more on the will of the person that offers it, then the quality of the gift; then she presented to each two Gowns, one lined with Silk and the other with Velvet, not in that fashion that Citizens and Merchants ware them, but as Lords, three Coats likewise of Taffita, and fine Linnen, saying, take if you please these Robes in which fashion I have this day clothed my Husband, and for the other things, though they are of small value, yet they may doe you some good, since you are farre from your Wives, and have farre to goe: the Gentlemen more surprized at this then all that had passed, perceived that Mr. Thorel would not leave undone the least courtesie, and doubted, seeing the richness of the Presents, lest Mr. Thorel had discovered who they were. Nevertheless, said one to the Lady, These are, Madam, very great Presents, and which ought not to be lightly taken, if we were not constrained by your desires that cannot be said nay: this done, Mr. Thorel came again into the Chamber, and his wife took her leave; then asked he the strangers if they were pleased to take Horse and see the City, which they willingly consented to, and according to Mr. Thorels intreaties that had so much obliged them, they afterwards returned with him to his House, and stayed there all that night; the next morning they rose to goe on their voyage, and desiring their Horses might be brought, they were presented with three fresh and tall Geldings, instead of theirs that were weary, and likewise fresh Horses for their men, which Saladine seeing, turned to his companions, and said, I protest that there never was a man more courteous and generous then this, and if the Christian Kings were as much Kings in their particular, as this is a Knight, the Sultan of Babylon must not expect to take one of them, much less all these that are preparing against him; and seeing he could not well refuse them, he thanked Mr. Thorel and mounted; Mr. Thorel with several of his friends accompanied them a great way out of the City, and though it grieved Saladine very much to part with Mr. Thorel , nevertheless being constrained by his affairs, he desired him to return. Mr. Thorel then troubled likewise to leave them, said, Gentlemen, seeing it pleases you, I will, and desire to know no more of you then you please, yet whosoever you are, I shall never beleeve you to be onely Merchants, and I commend you to God. Saladine having already taken his leave of those that were come with Mr. Thorel , said smiling to him, Sir, it may come to pass hereafter, that we may show you of our Merchandize to your satisfaction; Farewell. Thus departed Saladine and his companions, and having travelled over several Provinces, they at length returned to Alexandria , and gave the People warning to prepare in their defence. Great preparations were made on both sides, and now the time was come, that the Christians should make their invasion, and amongst the rest, Mr. Thorel being a most valiant man, notwithstanding the Tears and Prayers of his Wife, resolved to goe, and having prepared all his things; he said to his wife whom he dearly loved; My Friend, I goe as you see, as well for my Honour, as the Salvation of my Soul: I leave thee our Estate and our Honour, and because I am not certain of my return for many accidents that may happen in the way that I am going, I desire one favour of thee, that whatsoever becomes of me, if thou hast not certain news of my life, thou wilt stay a year, a month, and a day without Marrying, from this day that I depart; the Lady weeping, answered; I know not how to bear the affliction you leave me in by going from me; but if my life be stronger then it, and any accident befall thee, whether thou live or dye, I shall certainly remain Mr. Thorel's wife. I am very certain replyed he, as for thy part it will be as you say, but thou art a fair young woman, and of great birth, and thy Virtue is known by all; these things will cause several great persons if they had the least news of my death, to ask thee of thy Friends and Brothers against thy will, and this is the reason that makes me limit this time and no longer; The Lady answered, I will doe what I can to prevent this, and when I am at last constrained to doe otherwise, be assured I will obey you in this you command me, then weeping and taking the Ring off her Finger; if it happen, said she, I die before I see you again, remember me when you see it: thus taking leave of his Relations, Mr. Thorel went on his voyage, and in few days joyned with the Christian Army; but either by the Industry or Fortune of Saladine , the slaughter of the Christians was so great, that few escaped death who were not taken prisoners; amongst the rest was Mr. Thorel carried prisoner to Alexandria , there unknown and afraid to be known, he pretended skill in Hawks, which indeed he took great delight in, and was at length sent for by the Sultan out of prison, and made his Faulconer, but passing onely under the name of the Christian, he was unknown to him. Mr. Thorel , who could never put Pavia out of his mind, had several ways tried to escape, but none succeeded. One day the Sultan talking with him concerning his Hawks, Mr. Thorel chanced to smile, making a certain action with his Mouth, that Saladine when he was at his House in Pavia , had particularly taken notice of, this made him call Mr. Thorel to mind, and looking earnestly on him, he imagined it was he, and said, tell me Christian of what Countrey art thou? I am of Ponat replyed he, a Lombard of a City called Pavia , a poor man and of low condition, Saladine half assured of what he doubted, caused forthwith all his Robes to be hung in a Chamber, and bringing Mr. Thorel in, Tell me Christian, said he, if amongst these Robes there be any that ever thou sawest. Mr. Thorel lookt on them all, and saw those his Wife had given to the Cyprian Merchant, yet could not believe they were the same. Nevertheless he answered, Sir, I know not one of them, but 'tis true, these two are like two Robes which heretofore I gave to a Cyprian Merchant that came to my House; then Saladine could no longer withold himself, but embracing him, said, You are Mr. Thorel , and I am one of the three Merchants to whom your Wife gave these Robes, and now is the time come that you shall know my Merchandise, as I told you, when I departed from you. Mr. Thorel was glad and ashamed together, to have had such a guest, and to have entertained him no better. Then Saladine cloathed him in rich apparel, and brought him in the presence of the greatest Lords; and after he had spoken many things in his praise, and of his valour, he commanded he should be honored as himself, by all those that desired his favor, as every one did afterwards: But above all, the two Lords that were in Saladines company at Mr. Thorel's house. Thus the worthy Knight had lived happily the remainder of his days in the Sultans Court; but when he remembred Pavia , and his dear Wife, he fell into such a Melancholly, that he lost his appetite, and taking his Bed, resolved to die. Saladine that loved him extreamly, no sooner heard of this, but he visited him, and knowing at length the cause of his Melancholly, he blamed him, that he had not acquainted him with it sooner, and desired him to be of good comfort, assuring him, That if he would he should be in Pavia within the time appointed, and acquainted him with the manner. Mr. Thorel gave credit to the words of the Sultan, having heard it was a thing possible to be done, and that had been done, and often sollicited him to it. Saladine then commanded a Negromancer of his, whose Science he had already experienced, that he should find a way whereby Mr. Thorel might be carried to Pavia in one night on a Bed. The Negromancer answered it should be done, but it would be expedient to cause him to sleep. When Saladine therefore had given him order concerning this matter, he returned to Mr. Thorel , and finding him altogether disposed to go to Pavia , if it were possible, or else to die. He said, Mr. Thorel if you love your Wife affectionately, and you doubt she is married to another, God knows whether I can help you to such another; for of all the Women that ever I saw, it is she whom Vertue hath rendred most worthy of Praise and Love. It would have been a thing very agreeable, since Fortune hath brought you hither, that the time we have to live, we should pass together in this Kingdom that I hold. But if I cannot enjoy your company, because it comes in your mind to go to Pavia , in the appointed time, or to die, How unhappy am I, that I cannot send you home with that honor and company, that your Vertues merit. But since it cannot be so, and you must be there so soon, I will send you in that manner I told you. To which, Mr. Thorel replied, Sir the effects without your words, have made me know your good will, which I neither deserve, nor ever shall; but I can scarce believe it possible, I should to morrow be in Pavia . Nevertheless since you have promised, I desire it may be done quickly, for to morrow is the last day of the time. Saladine said it should be done, and caused a very rich Bed to be made in his Hall according to their fashion, of Velvet, and Cloath of Gold, with a counterpoint embroidered with Pearls and Precious Stones, two Pillows likewise sutable to the Bed. This done he Cloathed Mr. Thorel , in a Saracens Robe, the richest that was ever seen; and on his head he put a large Turbant, according to their fashion. Then sitting by him, almost weeping, he began to say, Mr. Thorel , the hour that must separate you and I, approaches; and because I cannot accompany you, for the quality of the way you are to take will not suffer it, I must take my leave of you here in this Chamber. Therefore before I bid you adieu, I desire you by the love that is between us, That after you have put your affairs in order in Lombardy , you will come and see me once more before you die, that so I may be recompensed of the grief I have to part with you so suddenly: And in the mean time, pray think it no trouble to visit me with Letters, for I shall as willingly do any thing for your sake, as any man that lives. Mr. Thorel could not withhold his tears; and therefore to hinder them, he answered in few words, That it was impossible he should ever forget his good deeds; and that he would do without fail what he had commanded him, if God permitted him leisure. So Saladine having embraced and kissed him, said to him with tears, Farewel . The other Barons took leave of him likewise, The Doctor not long after, brought him a drink to strengthen him; but he had no sooner drank it, then he fell asleep. By this time the Negromancer was ready staying to be dispatched. Saladine therefore caused Mr. Thorel to be laid, as he was sleeping, on the rich Bed he had prepared. By him he placed a large and rich Crown with an Inscription, signifying it was for Mr. Thorel's Wife; on the other side, a Sword, whose riches were inestimable. Then on each side, a Golden Bason full of Double Duckats, and Precious Stones, and Jewels. On his Brest, he placed a Plate beset with Pearls; and on his Finger he put a Ring, wherein was set a Carbuncle so resplendent, that it seemed a Lighted Torch. This done he kissed him, and bid the Negromancer dispatch: So that Mr. Thorel and the Bed, in the presence of Saladine , were carried out of sight, and not long after put in Saint Peters Church of Pavia . The Sexton next morning entering into the Church with a Light, amazed at the sight of this rich Bed, ran away in great fear: Which the Abbot and Monks perceiving, Come let us see, said they, what hath frighted you; then the Abbot and Monks entred into the Church, and as with several Torches they had brought, they were looking on, and admiring the Riches of the Bed; the Knight awaked and fetcht a great sigh: This made both the Abbot and Monks to flie, as the Sexton had done before, crying out, God help us . Mr. Thorel opening his Eyes, and looking round about him, perceived he was where he had desired of Saladine to be, and without going farther; because he saw the Monks did already run away, he called the Abbot by his name, desiring him not to be afraid, for he was Thorel his Nephew. The Abbot hearing that, was more afraid then before, for it was the common talk, that he was killed in the Wars; yet after some words had passed between them at a distance, he began to be a little better assured; and making the Sign of the Cross, he went to him. To whom Mr. Thorel said, What are you afraid of Father, I am alive, God be thanked, and am come from beyond the Sea hither. The Abbot by this time, though he had a great Beard, and was in strange habit, perceived it was he; and taking him by the hand, said, My son thou art welcome. But you must not wonder that we were afraid, for there is not one in the City that doth not firmly believe you are dead; insomuch, that the Lady Addaliette your Wife, overcome with the Prayers and Threatnings of her Parents, is against her will to be married this day, and all things necessary for the Feast are ready. Then Mr. Thorel rose up, and having given great presents to the Abbot and the Monks, desired them to speak nothing of his return, until such times he had performed a business he intended. Then putting his treasure in a sure place, he told his Uncle all that had hapned to him since his departure. But, said he, before my Friends know any thing of this, I would willingly know how my Wife will bear this marriage; and although it be not the custom for Churchmen to go to such Feasts, I desire you for the love of me, to give order we may be there. The Abbot answered, He would willingly do it; and as soon as the day came, he sent word to the Bridegroom that he would come with a friend of his to the wedding; to whom he answered, They should be welcome . Therefore when Dinner came, Mr. Thorel in the same habit he was in, went with the Abbot to the Bridegrooms house, where he was admired by all, but known by none. For the Abbot said he was a Saracene , that the Sultan had sent Ambassador to the King of France . He was placed at a Table over against his Wife, who did it on purpose that she might have the better view of his strange habit. He was also very glad of the pleasure he had to see her, and perceived easily by her countenance she was not well contented with the marriage. She oftentimes looked on him, not for any knowledge she had of him, but for his great Beard, his Turbant, and his strange apparel; also the firm belief she had that he was dead, blinded her eyes. But when Mr. Thorel thought it fit time to try whether she remembred him, or no; he took in his hand the Ring she gave him at his departure, and calling to a young Page that served by her. Pray, said he, tell the Bride from me, that it is the custom of my Countrey when any stranger is at the Table, that the Bride to signifie she is glad of his coming there, sends him the Cup wherein she drinks full of Wine; and after the stranger hath drank what he pleaseth, he covers it, and sends it to her, who to show she is pleased with his being there, drinks the rest. The young Page did his message to the Bride, who taking him for some great person; and to show that she was pleased with his being there, she commanded they should wash a great Golden Cup that stood before her and fill it full with Wine and carry it to the stranger. Mr. Thorel in the mean time, put the Ring she had given him in his mouth, and as he drank, he let it fall in the Cup, no body perceiving it, then leaving but little Wine, he covered it, and sent it to the Lady, who received it; and that the custom might be accomplished, she opened it and drank the rest. Then perceived she the Ring, and without saying a word, looked on it, and knowing it to be the same she gave Mr. Thorel when he parted from her; she looked more stedfastly on him, and at last knowing him, rose without regarding what was before her, and embracing him, cryed, My Lord, and my Husband . Then Mr. Thorel desiring every one to keep their place, related all that had hapned to him from the time he went to the War, concluding, That the Gentleman ought not to be displeased, who thinking he was dead, had taken his Wife for his Bride, if he being alive had taken her from him again. The Bridegroom seeing himself deceived, answered freely, and as a Friend, That it was in his power to do with his own what he pleased . The Lady then took off the Rings and Crown she had of her new Husband, and put on the Ring she found in the Cup; and likewise the Crown that Saladine had sent her, and went with all the pomp of the Wedding to Mr. Thorel's house. There he gave large presents to him that made the Feast, to the Abbot, and to all his Relations; and afterwards sent the news of his good fortune with thanks to Saladine . These are the ends of Mr. Thorel's and his Ladies troubles; and this the recompence of his vertues, with which the Widow entertained my Master at the Fountain. But I fear I have trespassed too much on the Readers patience by this long digression, which makes me draw back my thoughts, and bring them out of the Garden into the Kitchin, to relate what passed at Dinner between me and the two Maids. For if the relation prove as pleasant to the Reader, as the thing it self did to me, he shall therein reap much content: It was as followeth.  He lies with the Chamber-Maid, then puts her off for a Beautiful and Vertuous Virgin, to Laris , the Widows Son, with whom he lodgeth; afterwards marrieth himself to the Kitchin Maid, a very pleasant device.  several Commodities; and you have enough of them in England , better known by conversing with them, then by description of them. I shall therefore say this onely of them, that they have the most voluble Tongues of any Nation under Heaven, especially the Females, that you may sooner want ears, then they words; and as they are infinite in chat, so are they regardless of the company they speak in, be he friend or stranger; though indeed no man is a stranger to them. In small time, they are extreamly familiar, full of laughter, and toying, and lascivious Songs. This made me, for I had now been two moneths here, as free as they; and in praising their Beauties, their Voices, and good Parts, I spent all the time that I was in their company. Insomuch, that I always spent Dinner and Supper time in the greatest merriment imaginable, for we were onely three, the two Maids and I; the one was indeed a French beauty, fair, adorned with blackness of Hair, strait bodied, her hands long and slender; the other of the common mould. So that one appeared the Offspring of day, the other of night. And I had enough to do to please the fair without displeasing the foul, and to content the foul, without making the fair one jealous. Nevertheless I let slip no occasion to the effecting of both. After Dinner (as I informed you before) my Master, the Widow, and her Children, commonly walked to the Fountain in the Garden, the Kitchin-maid returned to her work, which gave a spare hour to me, and the Chamber-maid. But because kissing openly in France , is not the fashion so much, as in other Countreys, and the Women are very sparing to receive such kindnesses, I perceived that the wanton desires which all Maids are subject too, did require a more compleat satisfaction. This made me bend my discourse that way, and how happy he were that should enjoy such a Beauty, giving always by my words and actions, manifest signs of my affection. I was at that time also full of the Money I had gained of Laris , and presented her with some small toys; that in conclusion I wrought so upon her, that there was nothing wanting to the perfection of our love, but convenient time. Whilest therefore the Widow entertained my Master at the Fountain, I enjoyed my Lady, but not without promise of marriage, which I valued not, since I never meant to be a man of my word. But after I had enjoyed her so often, that I began to be cloyed, I wanted not a device to free my self from my promise; for I perceived Laris that had tasted the Farmers Daughter was ready for a fresh bit, and had asked me often concerning it. I know not any, said I, of the like nature with the Farmers Daughter: But one I know that is so desperately in love with you, that, because her Fortune is not correspondent to her Beauty; I fear will die for your sake. Laris who knew by his former passion, that it was possible for one to die for love, were she as beautiful, said he smiling, as she is loving; it is not her fortune, since mine is favorable enough, should part us. Give me but a Venus , said he, it matters not whether she be naked or no. Well said I, give me but Twenty Pistols to adorn her, and you shall marry one of the most beautiful, and most vertuous Virgins that ever you saw. There they are, said he, thou hast been faithful to me in my first love; and if thou canst bring me but the Jewel thou hast promised, thou shalt not want thy reward. So the next time I met my love, I proferred her a new, and one of the best Garments then in fashion, as a reward of her kindness, she thankfully received it; and indeed, excepting that Epidemical Disease, that she, as well as all her sex, had been subject too; she was a sweet Creature, and thus adorned a Grace. Now said I to her, it is true, I have promised you Marriage, but I am a stranger in this place, and not able to keep you at that rate I love you, I do intend therefore to match thee to a young and rich Gentleman, a friend of mine, who wants nothing but such beauty to crown his happiness. In fine, I acquainted her with the Plot, nor was she averse from my Propositions, since the thing would be so much for her advantage: Therefore I brought her to Laris , to whom she appeared so far beyond what she ever had done, that she blinded his eyes, and he knew her not. It were tedious to rehearse the Discourses that passed between them, but I brought it to pass at last, that within a weeks time she and Laris should be married at a Tenants House of his, in the Valley of Montmorencie . Which to give it his due praise, is one of the places which Nature seemeth prodigally to have blest, both with Wine and Corn; that by a contrary, their Love would needs succeed, as Sine Cerere & Baccho friget Venus. I promised to procure a Priest, and send him thither, desiring to be excused at Dinner, least by my absence, our house might suspect the truth. Laris therefore that day he went to the appointed place. Here are my Keys, said he, go to my Cabinet, and take out what Money you want, to take up a Lodging for us, against night, in Paris , and to provide what ever else you shall think fitting. I came to the Cabinet, and my curious eye would not be contented with one Bag, but I pried into every Drawer; and when I saw so much Gold and Silver, I was at a stand, whether I should then rob him of all, or no. Nevertheless I left it for a better opportunity,  & took no more then at present was needful, and finding the Priests habit in the Chamber that was not yet sent home, I put it on and disguised my self the best I could; for I was resolved to loose nothing that might be got, no not so much as the Priests wages. Thus I met, married them, and returned undiscovered; but though in the morning early. I stole out of our house, and escaped the eyes of all, I could not do it so cautiously in the Evening, but the Kitchin-maid saw me go up Stairs; yet being we were Lodgers, and many came in and out without examination, I passed undiscovered who I was. I soon slipped of my Priests Garment, and came down into the Kitchin, to see if we were not discovered by the Houshold; but by reason that Laris was used to be out a Hunting sometimes a day or two, and the Chamber-maid and I had leave, we were not in the least suspected. The Kitchin-maid onely was something jealous of me, for I had always shewed her much kindness, and as Women in such matters are commonly better nosed then Men, smelt something of a Plot. For I no sooner came near her, but I wish you joy, said she, of your new Bride, I perceive you are married to day; for I saw the Priest go up just now to your Chamber. I was, I confess, much supprised at her words, and was scarce at the instant able to make a good apology, she had assaulted me so unawares. Nevertheless, resolving now to drive the Nail to the Head. There was indeed, said I, a Priest of my acquaintance with me, even now, and is above still writing some Prayers for me, but where the Bride is, I cannot tell except it be your self. No said she, there is some body you love better in the house then I; and since I have hitherto been ashamed to discover my love to you, I shall henceforth never tell you I love you. Well said I, embracing her, I cannot blame thy jealousie, my dear; and since I see thou doest really love me; I will now free thee from all suspition that I love any one else. The Priest is now above writing for me, as I told thee; and if thou art willing, he shall immediately marry us. But least your Mistress call you, or my Master call me in the mean time, and discover our intentions, you shall stay here below, and I shall be above; and the Priest shall come down and ask thee what is requisit on thy part, and me on my part; for so small distance of place shall never cause us to be less lawfully joyned, then if we were both together; and if your Mistress or her Daughter see the Priest with you, an excuse will not be wanting, Either that he is your friend, or that he stayeth for me. The poor Wench all inflamed, and so far beyond her self, that she might easily have been perswaded to stranger and more incredible things then this. I would willingly, my dear, said she, consent to this; but I would have some small time to make me ready, that the Priest see me not thus. Well said I, that matters not much, since he is a most intimate Friend of mine, nevertheless make all the haste you can to put on some clean Linnen, and in the mean time, I shall acquaint my friend with our design; then embracing her, I went up to my Chamber to send the Priest; and she to hers, to dress her. The desire she had to be married, soon made her ready; and my negligence was never so great as to let the Priest tarry long after: For I had now married Laris twice, and was expert in the Art. Putting on therefore my Priests habit, and altering the colour of my face with a swarthy powder, I had used before for the same purpose, and a patch on my face, I came down to her in the Kitchin; but certainly it would have made a Dog laugh, that had been as conscious as I, to see what countenance she bore at this Marriage. Nevertheless, my strong resolution had so setled my Diaphragm, that I did not so much as smile at the conceit that would have made another burst with laughter. And when I had performed the duty of the Priest, returned to my Chamber, and laid aside my disguise, my colour, and patch, I came down to do the part of a Husband. So that night I had my Bed-fellow, as well as Laris ; for she failed not, when all were in Bed, to come to me; and indeed so imployed me, that I could not spare one minute more to my Muse, then just to acknowledge my good Fortune in this Hexastick.  Darkness that equals all, hath made my Bride As fair as Laris Bed-fellow. Then tell, What matters, whether foul or fair? Beside I was the first, he's second at the Well. Virginities I crop, but he gets none, And's forc'd when I have done to pick the Bone. But the next Morning I found so much leisure, as to add these few Lines.  In Black Apparel hitherto I lie Secure, the colour of my Knavery. No one suspects the Robes of Holy Men, And when the Devil's like an Angel, then 'Tis on some great design you'll say, for he That openly can work so cunningly, Would never hide himself from Mortals view, Unless he fear'd we knew him by his hew.

With a strange adventure that hapned to him in the way.  desired to see our Faces, he darted a Ray into my Eyes, through the Window, and forced me to acknowledge Day, and part with my Dalila for fear we should be discovered. But she was no sooner gone, then a light slumber overwhelmed my Senses, and I dreamed as followeth. I Went , I thought, in an instant of time, and passed over many Green Groves and Meadows adorned with the verdure of a Fruitful Spring, till at length I came to a fair House, through which I passed into a Pleasant Garden; and of all the rarities that I saw, for they were more then my memory could comprehend, I remembred this onely, That I saw upon a large Vine a White Dove, sitting on a fair Vine; and whilest I looked upon her, there came a strange Bird that courted her, and no sooner had trodden her, but fell down, and I could no more see him. After he was vanished, I thought it grew Night, and by the Light of the Moon, I discovered, That I was near a City, where I saw the same Bird, I had before seen to vanish, rise again out of the Ground, but his Feathers were off, and he ran as conscious of his nakedness to hide himself; but there came an innumerable company of other Fowl about him, and all pluckt some of their Feathers off, and stuck them on his Back, till at length he flew away with them; and I, that even now, thought I had been near a City, found my self in a Church yard, where a Crow was picking a hole in the Ground; whence on a sudden, the Bird I had seen before, flew out with a Golden Bell on his foot; making a noise with it, and rejoycing at his escape; and at the Rising Sun, which I thought appeared so bright, that it dazled my Eyes, and so I awoke. This Dream was so lively in my thoughts, that I could scarce banish it thence; nevertheless, my mind ran so on Laris Cabinet, that I could not rest till I had resolved to make my self Master of it. This made me rise at Seven, for my Master seldom rose till Ten, and go into the City, and buy me a disguise at the Brokers; which having done, I came home and packt up the Treasure; and as my ambition was always too great to be controuled by another mans will, I took this opportunity to set my self free, both from my Master, and the ill consequences that might follow the wickedness I had committed under the colour of a Priest. And thus I took my leave of Paris , till coming into a convenient place, I stript myself, and threw my old Cloaths with a great Stone into the River; then putting on those I had newly bought, I took the way to Orleans , and having no other company, then my thoughts, I made these short reflexions on what was past.  Paris, 'tis true, I came to drive a trade, As many other Citizens have done, Within thy Walls; but when to break afraid They are, how soon like Phanthasms they are gone. Thus, least my credit crack, I run away With others Money, richer far then they.  The Woolf unto his Kennel by the light Of Cynthia's Beams, and shew'd him all his food, Horse-flesh, and Bullocks Livers, fresh and good, A Kennel large, clean Straw, and this to try If he would be of the same Family.

But when he saw the Coller hanging by, Farewel, said he, I'd rather starve and die In Liberty, then to be chain'd and have The greatest Plenty, being but a Slave. Nomine mutato narratur fabula de te / me  But while I was thus musing, on a sudden the Clouds gathered to such a thickness, the Wind blew so vehemently, and the Rain fell so impetuously, That I began to fear it proceeded from some extraordinary cause, rather then the common operation of Nature, as Virgil said in his Geor. I.  Agricola, & fragili jam stringeret bordea culmo, Omnia ventorum concurrere praelia vidi, Quae gravidam late segetem ab radicibus imis Sublime expulsam eruerent, ita turbine nigro Ferret hyems culmumque levem, stipulasque volantes. Saepe etiam immensum coelo venit agmen aquarum, Et foedam glomerant tempestatem imbribus atris Collectae ex alto nubes, ruit arduus aether, Et pluvia ingenti sata laeta boumque labores Diluit, implentur fessae, & cava flumina crescunt Cum sonitu, fervetque fretis spirantibus aequor.

So vehement was the Storm at last, and the Waters fell in so great abundance, that had it not been for the shelter the Trees afforded me, I had there perished according to my deserts. There came at length a Man with two Horses, almost drowned, as he seemed to be, to the same place for shelter. How far friend, said I, have I to Montliherrie , a league, said he, and better; and though you have time enough to go thither, if the weather were fair, yet I fear you will meet so many Washes by the way, that you cannot pass on foot. If it be so, said I, (for I knew not whether he were a robber or no, and would not in any wise give him reason to suspect I had store of Money about me) and you are pleased to lend me the Horse you lead; though I have not Money here at present, yet when I come to Montliherrie , where my Friends live, I shall give you a Crown, and greater satisfaction, if that be not sufficient. It is agreed, said he, and put the Bridle in my hand, let us go, I see the Wind ceaseth, the Rain is stopt, and the Air cleareth. He had no sooner said it, but the day was in an excellent mediocrity of temper, not in the least disposed to a Cloud, and the gentle Wind rather fanned then disturbed the Air: So I mounted my Horse, who needed no Spurs to set him forwards; for as soon as ever I was upon his Back, his Master led the way, and I followed in so full a carrear, that I knew not how I went, till just at the end of the Town Montliherrie , which is a place old and ruinous, he stopped as instantly, so that I fell at least three yards from him; and before I could recover my self, followed his Master, who swift as the Wind was returning back to the place, where first I met him. This made me conceive, he could be no other then one of the D aemones Montani: For I remembred I had heard a story to the same purpose, very elegantly expressed in these words.  Vangionum longe non ea distat humo: Nescio qui. Nemetes hanc incolaisse feruntur, Sunt ubi Francorum busta quaterna ducum. Caesareis sedes fuit illa cohortibus olim, Nomen ob id Grajum spira vocat a tenet. Hic humili modicis a stirpe cohortibus olim Exiguae quidam Navita puppis erat: Qui calamo pisces linoque madente solebat Fallere, jam radios sole tegente suos.

He goes to Estampes , where three accidents befall him in one night.  made me take Inn at Montliherrie that night, but the next morning as soon as day, I set forth on my journey towards Orleans , and at length came to Estampes , where at a distance I could perceive an infinite company of People in a fair green Medow; but what the occasion of so great a concourse might be, I could not imagine, till at length approaching nearer, I perceived they were people of all Ages and Sexes, and of all conditions, dancing and making merry in several companies. Old Wives I saw which could not set foot to ground without a Crutch in the Streets, had here taught their feet to Amble: and others were so ragged, that a swift Galliard would almost have shaked them into nakedness; but leaving these wrinkled Brows, I proceeded farther to a company of fresh Beauties, and indeed I saw such, that they forced me to stay some days longer then I intended before I came to it; I took my Lodging in one of the best Inns, and the next day furnished my self both with good Apparel and a Horse, for I resolved never to accept of any in the road again for Old Nick's sake. The next morning I took my Horse and rode out to see the Town, which seemeth to have been of great importance, there being five Walls and Gates in a length, one before another, so that it appeareth to be rather a continuation of many Towns together, then simply one; and whilst I was gazing up and down wheresoever curiosity led me, I espied at last a Woman very fair and of most aimable parts, this made me look too long upon her, being the handsomest object that ever I had seen; Insomuch that she took notice at length of me as she looked out of the window, and perceiving by my Curiosity and Gallantry, that I was both a stranger and no mean person, she beckoned to me to goe to her door, and went her self from the window to meet me at the door; where she no sooner came, but you are welcome my friend, said she, if you please to light off your Horse and come in, and although you may wonder that being a Woman and a stranger to you, I offer such kindness, yet your admiration shall cease when I acquaint you with the reason of it. I did indeed much wonder at the civility of this Woman, and the grace wherewith she uttered each word, but above all, her comely Personage was such, as it made her appear to my Eyes rather a Goddess then any humane Creature; therefore partly moved with her desires, partly with my own curiosity, to see the end of this adventure, I made this reply unto her. Madam, I know not any thing in me that deserveth any such kindness at your hands, being both a stranger to the place, yet since it is your Command that I stay, and there is no denial to be made to so much Beauty, I am willing to do your pleasure . Then she called one of her servants, and giving him charge to look well to my Horse, she conducted me through a spacious Hall into a fair Appartment richly adorned with Pictures, and scented with Perfumes. Now, Sir, said she, I shall in few words tell you the reason of my boldness and the cause of my importunity to make you stay. My Husband belated one night as he returned from Hunting, came to a poor mans Cottage, and desired a Lodging if it were possible for him and his two men, (for the Roads were then filled with Robbers, and he was a man that never went out without Money and good Horses) the poor Man who lived there with his Wife and two Sons and one Daughter the most contented life in the World, free from the griping Cares and tumultuous noise of the City, busying his thoughts onely to enjoy, not encrease his Estate. Gentle stranger, said he, you are welcome to my poor Farme, and to what ever in it can make you so, and if you are pleased to accept my proffer, you may for the time you are here, think your self Lord of the House, and Command me as your Servant: Mr. Beauto (for so was my Husbands name) admiring much the civility of the stranger, and knowing there was no better answer to be made to so generous a person, then the accepting of his proffers, I am exceedingly obliged to you, said he, if you should lend me but the meanest part of your House to shelter my self and my two men this night, for as much as the Roads are full of Robbers, and I owe my life to your kindness. But since you proffer me your service, which I do in no wise merit, nor can by any means requite, I shall certainly for ever hold you as a person to whom I am most indebted and obliged. In short, he was conducted in, and the Table was spread, not with the superfluous composures that Art hath found out for Luxury, but the good and wholsome Food that Nature hath provided for us. This put me in mind of that pleasant Story of Philemon and Baucis when they entertained the Gods, according to the Poets words.  Ponitur hic bicolor sincerae bacca Minervae, Conditaque in liquida corna autumnalia fece, Intybaque & radix & lactis massa coacti, Ovaque non acri leviter versata favilla, Prunaque & in patulis redolentia mala canistris, Hic nux, hic mixta est rugosis carica palmis, Et de purpureis collectae vitibus uvae. Omnia fictilibus nitide.  They on the Table set Minerva's Fruit; The double coloured Olive: Endive Root, Radish and Cheese, and to the Board there came A Dish of Eggs near roasted by the flame. Next they had Nuts, course Dats, and Lenten Figs, And Apples from a Basket made with Twigs. And Plumbs and Grapes cut newly from the Tree, All serv'd in Earthen Dishes Huswifery.) She continued her Story farther, that her Husband was so extreamly contented with that kind of food, that he had often made mention of the happiness that poor Man enjoyed; nay, that even on his death-bed, when he could scarce remember any thing, he called her to him, and embracing her, My dear Wife , said he, I am now departing into another World, and ought to have little thought of this; yet the civilities of that poor man do so run in my mind, that I desire of thee, and I hope thou wilt perform it when I am dead, being the last Petition I am like to make; That if ever stranger, whether poor or rich come near thy habitation , thou entertain for my sake . He would have said more, but Death tied his Tongue. Now this is my reason, said she, that hath made me so bold as to desire you to stay in my house, and I hope you will, if your occasions permit, lodge here this Night, and receive the civilities that my Husband, whom, of all Men, I loved most dearly, hath obliged me by his last words, to shew unto you. Madam, said I, though I ought not to think my self worthy of the least of these favors you have already done, and consequently by no means, be so bold as to receive new ones from you; yet if the Prayers of your dying Husband, who was so dear unto you, and the love you bare him, command me to stay in this place to Night, I must of necessity consent, or be the unworthiest Man in the World. In conclusion I was entertained all that day with the greatest civilities imaginable, and at Supper, in the same manner, till it grew late, then was I conducted into a fair Bed-chamber, and soon after the Lady took her leave of me, leaving onely a Lackey in the room with me to wait upon me. Ever since Supper I found my Body something looser then ordinary, and therefore desired the youth to show me, if there were any Privy near the place (for I feared I might have occasion in the Night) so he shewed me a Private Closet there by, in which was a Close-stool placed at the farther-end; so I dismissed the youth, and went to my Bed, meditating on what was past, but little dreaming on what was to come: For her relation seemed so probable, and she uttered it with so much passion, That I could not believe any Woman in the World could have acted a part so well. Sometimes I thought on the Knight of Pavia's entertaining the Cyprian Merchants, sometime the good fortune he met with in Saladines Pallace came into my mind, sometimes the accident that befel me by the way; for the Night was very hot, and the multiplicity of my thoughts disturbed my rest so long, till at last I began to slumber rather then sleep; and I thought I saw before my eyes, the same Bird I dreamed of that morning I left Paris , naked and coming out of the ground, as before he had appeared, but something I had eaten at Supper not agreeing with my stomach, interrupted the continuation of my dream, and forced me to rise. The Moon was then up, and with the brightness of her light equaled the splendor almost of him that gave it. So I easily found my way to my Closet, yet not without stumbling for all that, that it seemed an ill omen to me of some future accident that should befal me; nevertheless, my necessity pressed me on, and I went in, but scarce were both Feet within the Threshold, when touching upon a Trap door, I fell up to the middle in a Privy, advantageous onely in this, That the softness kept me from bruising my Limbs, notwithstanding I fell two stories. Now did I begin to curse woman, and her whole Sex, that before I always adored, angry with my self, that I had never thought it was true that the Poet said of them.  Trust not the thing call'd Woman, for she's worse Then all ingredients clap'd into a curse. Were she but ugly, peevish, proud, a whore, Perjur'd, or painted; so she were no more, I could forgive her, and connive at this, Alleaging still that she a Woman is: But she's far worse, and will in time forestal The Devil, and be the damning of us all. But it was no time now to complain in such terms, and the present danger I was in, drew off my mind from such thoughts, to consult for my safety. I groped on every side to try if I could find any way of evasion, I found at last a small cranny in the Boards, which being somewhat rotted with the moisture of the place, I broke so big till I had good hold for both hands, then with all my strength (and men in such danger, are certainly more valid then at other times) I broke down a large Plank, and beating down the Dirt with it, I made a passage enough for my whole Body; but when I was out, I was at as great a stand as before, and knew not whether it were better to return and die secretly, then put my self to an open shame. Nevertheless, since the Stars and Moon alone were conscious to my miseries hitherto, I resolved to go wash my self at some Pump or Well, and then I might forge an excuse in the Morning, that I had been robbed of my Cloaths in the Night: So I went towards the Street, for I found my self on the backside of the Town, and I had seen many Pumps and Wells the day before, as I viewed each Street. So I came at length into the great Street, but as I was searching for some Water, I perceived Five or six men in a company coming towards me; so I ran to hide my self in an Entery thereby, till such time they were gone past; but it hapned then being about Twelve and one of the Clock, that the Watch were coming their round. And this knot of Theeves (for such they were) to shelter themselves from their Discoverers took Harbor in the same place. I crouded my self behinde the door as near as possible to the Corner, the rest did the like. But, I think, he fared best that was farthest off from me, for the next to me was almost in as bad a case as my self. But they all being well nosed, began to smell the perfume, each accusing one another; so that when I saw I could lie hid no longer, Gentlemen said I, and told them in order what had hapned to me, adding many lies, and leaving out much of the truth. You see in what a case I am, and if you will but conduct me to a place where I may finde some Water, or give me any Cloaths that you can spare, I may prove profitable to you in your designs, for I am in a desperate condition, and there is nothing so difficult or perilous to be attempted, that I would not readily do to raise my fortune. They were much surprised at my words, and finding by the Passion that I feigned, I was a resolute person, and that my necessity would make me prove faithfull: swear, said they, by thy head; for if thou shrinkest from us, thou losest it, and by the head of our Captain: For if thou art as one of us, thou must serve him in all his commands, and we shall not onely save thy life; but according to thy valor and witty designs, thou shalt share in our Booties. So I swore according to their solemnity, and they conducted me to a Well thereby, and let me down in the Bucket to cleanse my self; but before I could cleanse my self, for I was like the Blackamoor to be washed white, from the extremity of Nastiness, a good part of the Night was spent, and the Watch was returning, so they fled to secure themselves, and left me in the Well. Then came into my mind the Fable of the Fox and the Goat that went down into the Well, and when the Fox had climbed over the Goats back, he laughed heartily at the Goats simplicity, that had descended before she knew how she should ascend again. But at length it so fell out (for as I before told you, the Nights were very hot, it being then the middle of Summer) that some of the Watch were dry, and Water here was the common drink of all those, whose Purses could not bear the strength of Wine; so that they came to this Well to drink, and one beginning to turn the Winch, I think, said he, the Devil is in the Well, for the Bucket is so heavy I can scarce move it; then the rest began to help him, and so drew it up. I was no sooner at the top, but I leaped out amongst them, and they were all so frighted to see a naked man in white, or rather a spirit come out of the Well, that he thought himself the safest and wisest, that quitted the place fastest. They flew away as fast as people in such a case are used, nay, beyond the common swiftness. For  Pedibus timor addidit alas. So I remained in the place alone, and my companions seeing all that had passed, knew the Watch was dispersed and frighted enough that night, and soon returned to me, one gave me Breeches, another an old Coat and Stockings, another Shooes, whether they were their own, or they had stoln them I examined not, but thanked them and put them on: well, said they amongst themselves, we have gained nothing this night worth our pains hitherto; it is now the dead time of the night, the Watch is disturbed and broke, the Moon favoureth, and we may easily attempt something both to initiate the strangers, and to benefit our selves. Gentlemen, said I, if you will take the advice of a stranger, and consent to what I shall propose, being willing to revenge my loss, I shall lead you to the house where this accident befel me; I know the passages of it, that it may easily be forced open, and that we shall gain a considerable booty therein, and I, hope in this service I shall so behave my self as your Captain shall not think ill that you have admitted me to your society: they agreed to follow my advice, so we took our way directly to the House (for there were not many streets, and I easily found it out) and having examined all parts, we broke in at the weakest, which was under a window, there being nothing but a thin wall of Plaister and Laths, the rest of the House was Stone according to the French manner of building, and very strong. Now Gentlemen, said I, I know these Chambers, do you disperse your selves over the outer parts of the house, so shall we soon make an end of the business: one went this way, another that, but I went directly to my own chamber and packt up my own Clothes, and whatsoever else was portable, then I turned to her Apartment (for it was near, and I had observed it the day before) and broke open the door; the noise awaked the wicked woman, and she asked who was there, but I made no other answer, then you shall soon know, thou most unworthy of thy Sexe, and ran to her Bed, she thought of nothing but death, the reward of her wickedness, and was not able to speak one word in her justification; so I dragged her from her Bed where she lay, with my sword in my hand, threatening present death if she offered to cry out, and brought her to the Trap she had prepared for others, take, said I, the reward of thy crime, for though I should have thought it impossible for so much Beauty to have harbored so much inhumanity, yet since my experience make me certain of it, though thou deserv'st a thousand deaths, yet in pity of thy Sexe, and according to justice, I shall inflict no more on thee then thou preparedst for me then I threw her down without staying for her Answer or Apologie.  \------Nec Lex est justior ulla Quam necis artifices arte perire sua. Then I went into her chamber and took the spoils of my enemy, and going down I found them all ready to depart; thence they conducted me down the great street, and brought me at last to an out-house at the end of the Town, where we no sooner knock'd but we were let in; it was then about four in the morning, and we found a Table ready spread with good Cheer and Wine, there we all sate down, and every one related his good success, and what he had taken; not long after our Captain rose, a Man of the biggest size that ever I saw any, and since his courage was answerable to his stature, I was very glad I had Listed my self under him; they related to him the whole adventure, and how I came into their company, and how I behaved my self in the attempt. My misfortune gave every one cause of mirth, so that we passed the forepart of the morning very merrily, and the Captain welcomed me with a full Bowl and many generous expressions (for he was indeed as I learned afterwards a Lords Son in France , but his Father for some treasonable words lost both his Life and Estate, and left him behind to play upon the Subjects what his Father could not act on the King) thou art welcome stranger, said he, to our Club, and if our kind of life agree with thy humour, I shall in few words shew thee thy Trade, and instruct thee in what thou art to do: If thou canst procure so much Money as to buy thy self a Horse, and Pistols, and other furniture for the Road, thou shalt immediately this day be of my company, if not, have but a little patience, as these have. You see how they fare, they live merrily, and want nothing, till such time as Fortune provide thee one; for we are here of two sorts, Horsmen, and Foot-men; not that there is any distinction amongst us, or that one Face is better then another, but because those that are but newly driven to take up this kind of life, by some sad accident or other, seldom have Money enough to furnish themselves with Horses at first. Sir, said I, I shall wholly devote my self to this service, and since I am wholly indebted to these Gentlemen for my life, I am no less beholding to you for your kind reception of me into the company. I shall this day provide me with a Horse, and other Accoutrements for the Field: For I will tell you a good reason, said I, why I will never borrow that Beast, and thereupon told them what hapned me in the way, which caused great mirth to all the hearers. Whilest we were thus discoursing there came in at the back door two Horsmen with a great Cloak-bag, which I suppose was newly taken in the Road; they saluted me with no less civility, then the rest had done, and were very much contented with the relation of my adventures. After every one had drunk and eaten what he pleased, the Cloth was removed, and instead of it, was brought the Cloak-bag first, being a more noble prize taken upon the Road. What it contained, was distributed amongst the company; but the Captain had three parts, the Horsmen two, and the rest a single part onely; so that my share was very inconsiderable. Then were brought all the Packets, each of us had brought out of the House, that we broke open which was more considerable, for we were in all Fifteen Persons that were to have shares; the Captain, and five other Horsmen, and nine Footmen; and yet I had four Pistols and odd Money for my share, besides the Cloaths, and other things of value, which were to be sent beyond Sea, and sold in a strange place, and afterwards to be divided. My own Cloaths were amongst the rest, and the Captain was so generous, that for all they were part of the Booty, and might lawfully have been sent away amongst the rest, he gave me them, saying,  Shitten luck is good luck. It being then about Noon, every one departed to his own Lodgings, some in the Town, others there, with order to return to the same place at Eight in the Evening: Then I put on my Cloaths and went to my Inn; for my Cloak-bag was there, and a Hundred Crowns I had left in it, besides Jewels and Precious Stones. Here I began to consider what had passed, and to clear my self of all fear, since my ill Dream was now come, which you may read in the Twentieth Chapter. The Dove was the Lady, the Bird that courted her, was my self. He seemed to rise out of the Ground without his Feathers, that represented my nakedness when I came out of the Privy. Other Fowls cloathed him, such were the Thieves that lent me their Garments. He came out of the Hole that the Crow had pricked in the Church-yard; that is, by the means of my Companions, whose deeds are the deeds of darkness, and represent the colour of the Crow, I was freed from all fear of Death, and came flying out with a Bell; that is, with my Booty, rejoycing at his good fortune, and the Morning Light; and that was the time we returned from our Robbery, to our Club, and were so merry concerning our good success. Thus many times by Dreams, are we forewarned of the future according to the Poets,  Somnia pondus habent, Ovid.

He entereth into the Society of Theeves at Estampes . Their manner of life.  keep any Man from extravagancy, and the abominable crime of being a Theif. But alas, it was as hard for me to live soberly, and out of action, as it was for the prudentest of Men to do otherwise. For the crooked Branch can scarce be made straight, no more then the straight one crooked, and  Quo semel est imbuta recens servabit Odorem Testa diu. Thus though I wanted for nothing, I entered my self into the Society of Thieves , a thing few would embrace, though driven to it by necessity. I bought me a Horse, the best I could get; Pistols, Boots, and all the other Accoutrements of War, and at the hour appointed, which was Eight of the Clock that Evening, we all met. Then did I understand all the Ceremonies of the Trade. First, I was kindly welcomed by all, and after some short discourse, and that we had drunken freely of the best Wines, I swore to these Articles. 1.  To obey the Captains commands in all things. 2\. To be faithful to the rest in all Designs and Attempts. 3\. To be always present at the Meetings, that the Captain should appoint, either in that, or in any other place, without his leave to do the contrary. 4\. To be ready at all hours, by Day and by Night upon Call. 5\. Never to desert the Company to the last breath. 6\. Never to flie from an equal number of Adversaries. 7\. To withhold nothing privately of a Booty taken. 8\. To help one another, whether Imprisoned, or in any other Distress. 9\. Never to leave their Friends Body, whether Wounded or Dead, in the Enemies power. 10\. To confess nothing of the rest, though apprehended and put to the Rack. 11\. That if enriched by these means, I desired to serue the Society, I should leave my accoutrements likewise, as Horse, Boots, and Pistols to the Captain, and never confess of the rest. 12\. That in case any person of the company did otherwise, I would at all opportunities, whether by my self or with any of my companions, punish him with present death. After I had sworn to these twelve Articles, they made me understand the rest of their Orders. That the Horsemen took the Office of the Captain upon them, every one for a moneths space in their Order. He had a trebble share, two parts as he was a Horseman and had his Beast to feed, and a third part which he should lay out in Wine and Meat for the use of the company, and give an account of it publickly before the rest at the months end. During the time his Office lasted, he went out no oftner then he pleased, but rather commanded the rest then accompanied them, and in case he neglected to prepare them Wine and Meat ready against their return, he lost all his part in that nights booty. The Horsemen had a double part because of their Beast, and in case any one were wounded and could not be present, nor officiate, he had his portion nevertheless, and the next officiated for him. The Footman had but a single share, as well because he had no Beast to maintain, as that he was new come and had undergone least danger of his life; and amongst them every night one in his turn stay'd up to let in the rest, either at the back or fore-door, as need required, that when they came all things might be in readiness for their reception, and if pursued they might be housed in an instant. This House had been bought out-right on the publick Charge formerly and so was another at Orleans , where in time of danger we might be sheltred: and every moneth at our Captains appointment two of our company kept it by turns, one Horseman and another Footman, they had their shares as well as the rest, and their business was onely to find our bootles, to give intelligence of passengers to the rest, and keep a clear correspondence from Town to City; we had half-way-houses likewise, though not so large as these, and had a Bill ready always to put on any of their doors in case they were to be searcht on any Suspition, and their Furniture was so small, that it was impossible any one could guess it a shelter for so many as we were in company upon the Roads. Nevertheless we had in each a large Vault under the ground, and a door to it that was not easily discernable; here in the greatest danger that could be, we might securely drink our Wine, that was so much the better by how much it was kept the cooler; here could we bury a dead friends body with the greatest secresie, and then wash down the sorrow: to which purpose and to take away all fear of death, we had a Cup made out of a dead-mans Scull, that at every meeting went round the Table. Not unlike the old  Ægyptian custom that the Graecian Historian Herodotus mentioneth: How that at their greatest Feasts, and when there was greatest cause of mirth, a Skeleton was brought round the Table, and the bearer cry'd, Drink and be merry, for you see what you must be . These were the Ceremonies of the Society, and the Mysteries of our Iniquity; 'twould be tedious to relate the rest, being of smaller moment and inconsiderable: I shall add therefore but two or three lines more, and then proceed to my first adventure.  Since all that breath are subject to the pow'r Of death, and all expect the fatal hour, What matter is't whither early or late I die, since I am sure to bend to fate. And this I know, of all the lives that be, The Thieve's the best, none lives so merrily. Perhaps you'll say we're true and honest men, And in our calling so are we, what then? Nay this by my experience I find, That Thieves of all men bear the truest mind. You Tradesmen fall upon and at each other, But we live friends as Brother doth to Brother.  His first adventure upon the Road after he was entered in the Society of Thieves at Estampes, one of his companions is wounded, but at length they come off with victory.  morning, three betwixt Estampes and Angerville , and the like number between Angerville and Orleans , for Angerville is about six Leagues distant from Estampes , and standeth in the middle between it and Orleans . For our Captain was advised by our Scouts at Orleans , that a Gentleman set forth thence towards Paris betimes that morning with a great sum of Money; but because I was newly come and knew not well the Roads, was allotted that I should be with two it more between Estampes and Angerville , and three of our best experienced Blades should lie next Orleans , according to this Order we went to our several stations, but they that lay next Orleans missed of their booty, for the Gentleman had taken a private road. The morning was fair and clear, and several companies of passengers went by unmolested, till at length the coast was clear, and there appeared a Gentleman onely, and his Man; we knew not but this might be the man, and therefore changed our intention of going in equal number, and resolved all three to set upon him: The Gentleman perceiving three well mounted to ride towards him, and that it were a shame to fly from us upon suspition onely, came manfully towards us, speaking something to his Man, whether to give him notice of his suspition, I know not, or to incourage him if any danger should befal. But so it fell out, that as soon as we met and put them to a stand, the Gentleman drew forth a Pistol ready charged and cock'd, and fired it at us, the Bullet fell low and wounded one of my companions in the Thigh, which gave us no time to talk longer; so I closed in to prevent further mischief, and as he drew forth the other Pistol, I gave him such a weighty blow upon his Shoulder with my Sword, that by weakening his Muscles I frustrated his intentions, and forced him to leave it in its Case for me, then I drew it, whilst another laid hold on the Man, and secured the Cloak-bag. Sir, said I, if your Life be dearer to you then your Money (and certainly though Money may, yet Life can never be recovered) presume not to resist any longer to your own destruction. He seemed extremely angred at these words, and by his looks plainly shewed he had rather part with his Blood then his Money, had not the wound in his right arm prevented him to make use of his sword. If I die, said he, I shall be cured both of this wound, and delivered from all the other evils that are incident to Humane Nature; but to lie wounded in a strange place without Friends and Money, is a misery far exceeding the pains and pangs of death. You shall find, said I (for I had compassion on his misery, and was not yet hardned in the Trade) Friends and Money where you expect none, and thereupon out of his own Cloak-bag I gave him six Pistols, and out of my pocket a Plaister (for we were always furnished with them for our own use.)  Sanus Achillea remedavit Telephus hasta. So Achilles healed Telephus with the same weapon that wounded him, and thus we left him, and came off with our booty, which amounted to the value of One hundred and threescore pounds, for the Man was a Jeweller at Orleans , and was going to Paris to buy Rings and Precious Stones. This good success gave all our company leisure for two or three days to rest themselves; and after we had made merry and divided the spoil, every one praising my Noble behaviour in the adventure; we drunk our Captains health round in our Scull, and so were dismissed for two days.

I would not change, if happy in my Love, My state with the Olympus -shaker Jove . The great esteem I had already for her, grew greater and greater, and every action of hers seemed in my eyes a new perfection; that after Mass, I could not but look after her, nay, unknown to my self which way I went, my feet carried me to her door; the envious Walls parted us.  Invide dicebam paries, quid amantibus obstas? And I was forced to return without speaking to her, but not without thinking of her: For these hinderances set me the more on fire.  Sic ego torrentem, qua nil obstabat eunti, Lenius, & modico strepitu decurrere vidi: At quacunque trabes, obstructaque saxa jacebant, Spumeus & fervens & ab obice savior ibat. A thousand thoughts came in to my Head, but they thrust so fast, one upon the other, that they were all imperfect. Sometimes I thought to try, if I could take a Lodging in the House, but it was a private family, and admitted none. Sometimes to court her under the name of a Merchant; but I was not well skilled in Traffick; in Navigation, or in the Situation and Commodities of Countreys, and might soon be found out to be an Imposture. Then again, she had many Suters already, and she was in a Guardians hands that deprived her of Liberty, since so many desired a share in her. At last I enquired what I could of her Friends, her Estate, and Condition, amongst the Neighborhood, and found she was a rich Citizens Daughter of Paris , and lived there with her Uncle, at his Countrey-house, who hindred her from the presence of her lovers, though she favored many. That she was a Gentlewoman extreamly civil to all that came to her, and that hated to be confined to her Uncles house, but was forced to it by the commands of her Friends, that would otherwise dis-inherite her, being their onely Child. Having gained this intelligence, but above all, that her Uncle was a Lawyer, I went as gallant as my Industry could make me, to desire his advice in a Case, I pretended I had at Paris . It was then very early in the morning, and the old Man was not up, nor the Lady, but onely a youth that waited on them, who understanding my business, and thinking by my outward appearance, I was some person of quality, brought me in to a fair Parlor, desiring me to stay till he acquainted his Master. Here in the mean time I viewed several pieces of great rarity, amongst the rest, there was one Picture that I was highly taken with: The subject was a Pedler, supposed to be sleeping under a large Tree, in a Countrey full of Monkeys, with his Packet by him. The Monkeys that came from every part to see their new guest, were painted in the pleasantest postures imaginable; some were peeping under his Hat to see his Face, some opening his Codpiece, some untying his Shooes, some harkening to the noise he made in his Throat, being soundly asleep and weary; but an Innumerable company were gotten about his Packet, and had opened it. Every one was running away with some thing, some drew Ribbons after them of one colour, some of another; some took Pins, some Thred, some Laces, some rode on Hobby-horses; some adorned the Trees with these varieties of colours, others drew on Gloves, and amongst the rest, one that had drawn on a Pan of Gloves upon his Fore-feet in a Tree, and then was pulling out some Ribbond, so intangled himself therein, that he fell from the Boughs a good distance, and hung by the Ribbond, making strange gestures with his Face, and his Feet. In short, there was nothing wanting from this piece that Invention could add, to make it more perfect; many others I saw, the effects of an admirable ingenuity, till the youth returned, and told me, his Master was rising, if I pleased to have patience a little longer. It was not long after before he came, and after some short discourse, I clapped Four Pistols into his hands, desiring his best advice in the matter I should acquaint him with this old and covetous mind, was something refreshed with the fee, and dilated it self so far, as to call for a Bottle of Wine for our Mornings draught. So we sate down, and I related my matter thus. I have, said I, loved a young Lady long, and she hath been pleased to favor me with the like kindness, and there is now nothing wanting to compleat our felicity, but the will of her Parents; this we dare not ask, by reason of the inequallity of our fortunes: For though my Father was a Merchant, and hath left me an estate sufficient, yet she being onely Child, is likely to have as much, as was divided between me and eight more Brothers and Sisters. Nevertheless we have resolved, Whether her friends frown or not, since I have Means enough to maintain her, to be married privately, hoping, that time and the impossibility of separating us after marriage, will by degrees reconcile us to her friends. Now Sir, this is the matter wherein I desire your secrecy and counsel; for I am come from Paris hither to you for this purpose onely, being unwilling that the least fame of this should be spred, till such time all things are consummated according to our desires; and if you are pleased to help me with your advice, you shall find me as thankful, as you are obliging in all things. The Old Man gave good attention to my relation, but though he were able to have satisfied me then with an answer, yet for the desire he had to another fee, deferred the matter till another time. It is a hard matter, said he, to determine what is best to be done in such a case, whereon depends a mans perpetual welfare; for it must of necessity be a great trouble to you, as long as you shall live, if her friends respect her not, notwithstanding your Means may be sufficient to maintain you. We will therefore defer it for two or three days ( ![](/images/inline/Dgk.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/phgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/tgr.gif)  [illeg.] ![](/images/inline/igr.gif)  ) till I have considered the inconveniencies that may arise on this side, and the conveniencies on that, and gathered the conclusion from both what is best to be done. So I took my leave of him for that time, and returned to expect our Captains commands.  He robs a young Gallant upon the Road, with two other pleasant adventures of his companions that same day.  intelligence given of any particular Booty, and the day was likely to be clear and fair; bestow your time, Gentlemen, said our Captain, according to your own pleasure to morrow, when and where you please. For by accident it oft falls out, that by wandring to and fro, we find out Pearls or Rings, or Money, and such like things, which our greatest care and study could never conduct us to. Remember onely to behave your selves like men, and Fortune crown your Labours with Success; so we parted, intending the next morning to set out according to our own pleasures severally; but because I was not well skill'd in the Roads, our Captain honoured me with his Company, whom I perceived to be the most subtil and valiant amongst the rest: so we went out that night and lay in an Inn at La Beauss , where we saw most passengers goe in; amongst the rest we saw there a young Gallant that seemed to command more in the place, though he was a stranger to it, then the Master himself, all his words were full of vain boastings and Pride that argued onely, that he was either of little Wit or Courage that spoke them, and had been too much indulged in his Youth. So we took all occasions to speak to him, and complying with his humour, we gained so far upon him as to have his company at Supper, pretending we were to goe the same way that he did, for we had got out of him that he was to goe to Orleans to buy Wines: we supped in the Chamber wherein he was to lie, and thither he had brought up a fair Case of Pistols from his Saddle. I took not much notice of them before him, though indeed they were very rich and of very good work, lest he might suspect any thing: but when he was gone out of the Chamber, with a Worme that I had in my pocket, I drew out both the Bullets, and so left them in the place where he had put them. My companion was hugely pleased with this device, and said, I deserved rather to be Captain then himself, and that he would willingly be led by such a Projector. Perhaps, said I---but he came in and disturbed our discourse, so we fell to our Supper, and being he was a mad Gallant, our Debonaire humours suted to his so well, that we spent the most part of the night in Merriment; and amongst the rest of our discourses, sometimes I talkt of our journey as if I were a stranger to the place, and that having a small charge of Money about me, yet more then I was willing to lose, I should be extremely glad of his company the next morning: he could not contain his vain boastings at these words, but I have Pistols for the Rogues, said he; they shall find me better prepared then formerly they did when I was robbed between Angerville and Orleans , and yet then for ten Pistols the Rogues took from me, I think they received as many cuts: nay, I would gladly meet with two or three of them now to revenge my self of the injury they did me then. Our Captain could not but laugh at his expressions, for as he told me afterwards, he was one that took the ten Pistols from him, and that never man delivered up and parted with his Money more easily then he: do you laugh, said he, to our Captain because the Rogues paid so dear for the small booty they obtained: truly I did laugh my self when I saw four men fly wounded from me, as so many Mice would have done from a Cat, but what would you say when you shall hear hereafter that I have slain some of these Rogues, wounded others, prosecuted the rest, and cleared the Roads of the whole gang? Truly said I, you shall much oblige France in so doing, and deserve both the general Praise and the publick Reward of this whole Countrey; and to shew how much this generous action of yours meriteth of all honest men; I would willingly venture my life with yours in taking of them, that are so great a plague, and like so many thorns in the feet of the Traveller. Well said he, with his tongue running before his Wit, we will goe on purpose either behind the Company, or in some by Roads to meet these Rogues: this extravagant and foolish discourse of his afforded us too much pastime all that night. The next morning as soon as the Sun sent out his first Rays, we prepared our selves for our journey, setting out by our selves, then did I desire the Captain to let us two goe before, halfe a League, for I had a desire to try his valour by my self; he readily consented to it, and pretending he waited for something, stay'd behind, but with intention to come after us the same way: so we jogged on lovingly together for a good space, till finding my opportunity. Sir, said I, you have spoken so much ill of those Gentlemen who use the Roads, that I am sure you doe truly hate them, and I could now wish we might meet some of them, to punish their insolencies, for though we are but two yet I am glad of it, for the other person you saw with me I met with by chance, and doe not know but he is of those Rogues that infest these Roads, and might have brought us into extreme danger. Then did he begin afresh to boast, as if he desired nothing more then that they would come: nay, had his Words been as pernitious as the Wounds he talked of, he had already slain all the Robbers in the World.  I thought there never could be such another, But now I find Don Quixote had a Brother. He spoke Gigantick words at such a rate, As though the wind had turn'd his windmilpate. Well, said I, to give him a little breath, I cannot prophesie, but if Thieves should come, would you not like the Man in the Fable that call'd for death, make an excuse when he came: Yes, said he, I would make an excuse in defiance of him with my weapon and not my tongue, for I am not desirous to live longer then worthy of life, nor so afraid of death, as not to dare to look danger in the face: then here it is, said I, drawing my sword, and unless thou deliver up all thy Money, and renounce what ever thou hast said against the Lords of the Roads, thy life shall pay for the injurious speeches thou hast pronounced against them: the sight of the sword calmed his blustering words, and he began to say in milder terms, now I have gotten such a companion, I am able to subdue a multitude; that is not the answer, said I, that is expected from you; will you or no deliver your Money and renounce all you have said: ah brave companion, said he, we two need fear no Thieves, that are both so well prepared and so resolute. Your delay is troublesome said I, and since my words avail nothing with you, give up your Money to this; so I cut him over the pate, and was ready to have discharged another blow upon his Shoulder; this was enough to have admonished any rational man of the danger he was in: you act the Thief too rashly, said he; and I remember I have seen in such a Play, him that acted a Rival, really to have wounded his adversary, and then he began to tell me the whole substance of the Play. I was much pleased at this humour above all the rest, till such time I had found sport enough with his relation. But to return to my purpose, come come, said I, deliver your Money, and gave my Gallant a good slash over the Shoulder, it was driven so home that the smart made him sensible of the truth that I was in earnest. I hope, Sir, said he, I have given you no cause to be angry with me, but if you are not well pleased in that I have spoken too largely against the Lords of the Road, that shall cause no difference between us, and as it began in an Inn, so it shall end at the next Town we come in a glass of Wine: I shall willingly renounce what I have said rather then loose your good company. Then said I, one part of the business you have already dispatched, the other is as easie, and I know you are as liberal as valiant, and you will not refuse to part with a little Money; therefore deliver it: You give me cause said he, to suspect you are one of them whose part you take, I protest unless you be more civil, this Pistol, (clapping his hand on the Case) shall requite you the two blows you have given me. I was now weary with his folly and delays, and began to charge him with such blows on his Shoulders, Arms, and Thighs (for I was unwilling to kill the poor fool) that the Gentleman began to set Spurs to his Horse, not that he had hope of escape, for he saw my Horse was better then his, but out of fear, and the desire he had to be as far from me as he might possibly; But I followed him too close to let him run far; and when he could flie no farther, like the bruised Worm he turned, though to but little purpose; and drawing forth one of his Pistols, he discharged the Powder onely, for I had before drawn out the Bullet; but seeing there was no harm done to me, and terrified with the death I threatned, he delivered to me about Fifty Crowns of Money: So I left him and returned towards the place whence I came; then I met our Captain, for purposely he kept a good distance from us, and told him all that had hapned. He was so mightily pleased with the adventure, that he resolved to follow him, and have some discourse with him, as a person ignorant of all that had hapned. He soon overtook him, by reason of the goodness of his Horse: Good God, Sir, said he to him, what is befaln your Companion, I met him posting back so fast! Hang him, said he (for that will be his end) he is a Rogue, and offered me violence, and would have robbed me; but I have sent him away with a Bullet in his Breech, and I suppose that makes him post back so fast, to get remedy for his wound. I wish he had staid a little longer, then might the other Bullet have cleared this Road of one Lord, for so he termed himself. Here our Captain could not but laugh, (for he was indeed by Birth a Lord, though Fortune had taken away all his Titles, except that of the Road;) but said he, should the resolute Man have taken my Purse, I am not so foolish as to carry all Money where Thieves may find it. Perhaps he might have taken my Silver, yet first he must have reduced me to that weakness, that I could not make resistance. Put the case, I say, he had taken my Silver, I have Gold in a better place. Have you so, said our Captain, Can there be any place which these Rogues leave unsearched about a Man? Yes replied he, I will tell you what place, between the Soals of your Boots. I have carried Gold several times undiscovered there. Yes, but said our Captain, do you think your self, that if any of the Thieves had seen it, they would not have taken it? Assuredly, said he, when they had wounded me, so that I could make no resistance; for since they are a sort of people that live like Kites by Rapine, though their common food be course, and they are accustomed to it; yet if they see a Chicken in their way, they must have a snatch at it. Now hast thou spoken truth, said our Captain, of the Lords of the Road, they were very foolish indeed, if they did let slip any such Booty, when the owner himself gives them intelligence of it; and therefore you must part with some of your Gold. Yes indeed, said he, the Wine is as dear at Orleans , as it is good; and I fear I shall have very little left before I have made my Market there. I can save you the trouble, said our Captain, of going to Orleans , I am a Wine Merchant: How much Money have you to bestow, for I have Wines of several Prizes? The value, said he, of an Hundred Crowns; then you shall have a taste, said our Captain, of my best Wine; and thereupon gave him a cut with his Sword, so vehemently, that the Blood gushed out. See, there is the Wine, said he, and if you deliver not all your Gold, I shall broach the Vessel in a thousand places more. The poor gallant having found by experience before, that it was in vain to flie, drew forth the other Pistol and discharged it with the same effect, for the Bullet was drawn out: But our Captain delivered his blows so thick upon him, that the fear he had of death, made him soon unrip the Soals of his Boots, and render his Gold. Our Captain in compassion of his folly, seeing him to be a person that could not any ways shift for himself, gave him something back, and so left him. Then we met at our Club, where every one was much delighted with the adventure, nay, every one almost brought in some small booty that day, and amongst the rest, one of our Footmen walking up and down the Town, found a little Packet of Letters, which amongst the other Booties were laid upon the Table; and after the Money was divided, they were read to this purpose.  Mr. Monsieur , heretofore, makes me presume once more to desire your help and assistance in gaining Madam Nourice, for since she will not be favorable to my love, I am resolved to take her by force: To the effecting of which, here is a fair opportunity offereth it self. Her Father hath sent for, her to Paris, and she goes on Horsback from her Uncles House next Tuesday, I know her retinue will be small and weak, and we shall easily carry her away. Therefore, if you do provide your self with a Horse, and are ready for the attempt that Morning of the appointed day, you make me Your Perpetual Friend and Servant J. Loret .  This they threw by, but I took it up, and put it into my Pocket; for I knew the Person that was to be forced, could be no other then the Lady I desired to serve  Ad quam per centum Scyllas, per Mille Charybdes Tranarem laturus opem: For  Quisquis amat, servit, sequitur captivus amatam Fert domita cervice jugum, fert verbera tergo Dulcia, fert stimulos, trabit & bovis instar aratrum. says the Poet. There was nothing difficult that I would not attempt for her sake, Love had made me so bold; yet I concealed my Passion as much as possibly I could in their presence, till such time the Club broke up, and we were all dismissed.  By a subtil devise he gaineth the Uncles consent to marry his Neece.  Intentions; and since the time was so short before she went to Paris , I went the very next day to desire her Uncles answer to my case. He was very glad at my arrival, and that I might prevail the better upon him, I gave him the other fee, this produced another Bottle of Wine; but what was far beyond my expectation, the Lady her self brought it in, for the man was out of the House. Then did I really think some Goddess was presenting a Cup of Nectar to me, and I was so much surprized with her sight, that I had almost missed the taking of the Glass: But recovering my self before the old Man could take notice (though her eye was so quick as to perceive something I thought, and to blush) I drank to the Lady; she pledged, as Modesty useth by kissing the Glass, and left us. Then I began to put the old Man in mind of my Cause, desiring his counsel in the matter: I see, said he, but one way to the effecting your desire, that is, by marrying her as soon as possible, privately; and when you have done that, fear not, but I shall find out means to reconcile you both to her Friends. I perceived he was still desirous I should come again to him, and told me no more then what I knew before. Nevertheless I made answer, I approved of his counsel very well, but thought it would be a difficult thing to find a Priest that would marry us so privately, since, for my part I knew none. You shall not need to take much care for that, said he, there is a friend of mine at la Beauss that is come thither lately from Paris to see his Lands, and he shall marry you, In this, said I, you oblige me beyond measure; and if all things succeed well, you shall be well required for your prudent advice. There remains onely, that you would write me a small Note to that Holy Man of your acquaintance, that we are a couple of your Friends that may be lawfully married, and the like; so shall the matter be brought to pass easily, without trouble or suspition: And since I must trouble you to write your self, pray accept of this Pair of Gloves (putting two Pistols more in his hand) not as the reward, but a small acknowledgment of your favor. Thus induced by my words and money to favor my design, he write me a Letter to the Priest, and after another Glass of Wine or two, I took my leave of him.  He goes to Orleans with the Captain of the Rogues; the nature of the place, and what befel them there.  rendezvous, and after some orders given, he told the company he had a mind to go to Orleans , as well to see our House there, as to show me the Roads and the City, hoping, notwithstanding, that we might meet some prize in the way. So the rest were left to their own disposing, and we set forward in our journey. Orleans is a place that hath a very liberal portion of all Fruits, but especially of Grapes, insomuch, that Andre du Chesne calleth it the prime Cellar of Paris, Est une pars , saith he, si heureuse & si fecunde sur tout in vins quon la pent dice l'unde premiers celiers de Paris. And he hath not said amiss of it, for the Vines wherein he maketh it to be so happy, deserve no less commendation then he hath given them, as yielding the best Wines in all the Kingdom. Here is an University, and a Seat of Justice; for this Town is one of the Sieges Presidiaux , Seats of Justice: But that which rendreth the City extreamly pleasant is, Its situation in respect of the Air, and the Walks about it; one being very pleasant under a Rank of Palm-trees; the second which is near the Bridge, hath the Water running by it on both sides; the third on the East side of the City, is the Palle Malle . Here in the Evening come the Ladies of Pleasure, nor doth any Monsieur walk here single, but he quickly finds a mate. Women and Wine , saith the Poet are parallel ; and since the Wine was so good, my Companion perswaded me to taste the Women. If therefore there were found more Children that year in the Town then Fathers, they were beholding to us for two of them. There is yet another Walk l'Estappe , principally frequented with Merchants: This we often visited, to see if we could find out any thing to our purpose; we inquired after many strange persons, and the price of several Commodities: And amongst other news, this story was then hot in the mouth of the People. Commodities, who having found the lightness of some of the Italian Dames fell into discourse of their Wives, each one commending and extolling the Chastity of his own: Upon this, one of them who was both subtil, and a proper man withal, Friend, said he, I would wage willingly with any Man Five hundred Crowns, that I could prevail against the chastest Woman upon Earth. It is done replied the other, before these Gentlemen, Five hundred Crowns shall be the Wager; and so many I will lay, That you seduce not my Wife by any means, to comply with your unlawful desires. The Wager was laid, and not long after the Merchant posted to France , there by the means of an old Woman his friend, that dwelt with the other Merchants Wife, he got a Chest of his to be kept in the Ladies Chamber for a day or two; in this he inclosed himself, and in the night, when the Moon shone, and the Lady was fast asleep, he came out of his Chest and viewed all the Pictures, the Bed, and all the furniture of the Room; but finding nothing he could carry away, and fearing these were not manifest tokens enough, he went to the Bed side. The Weather was hot, and the Curtains were not very close, beside the Lady lay with her Brest naked out of the Bed, so that he could easily perceive by the light of the Moon, that she had a Mold beneath her Right Brest, and some few small Hairs upon it. Then did he return to his Chest, and the next day was carried out of the House in it undiscovered by all. And not long after went back to Spain , and having called the same company that were witnesses to the Wager, he related how he had enjoyed her, in such a Bed, such a Room adorned with such Pictures, such Hangings, such Furniture; but above all, That she had a Mold under her Right Brest, with some Hairs upon it. The other convinced by so many manifest tokens, was forced to pay the Wager. But incensed by the loss of his Money, by his disgrace, and the infidelity of his Wife, he went immediately to Paris , to a Neighboring Village, and thither he sent for his Wives man, that had always proved very faithful unto him, and swearing him to Secrecy; You must, said he, carry out your Mistress to walk, or the like, into the Woods, and there slay her. I shall leave thee sole Heir of all my Estate for it, and whilest I live, thou shalt share with me; for she is the wickedest Woman in the World. This great reward spurred on the youth, who was of poor parentage, to the murder. And not long after walking out with his Mistress in the Fields. Mistress, said he, you ought now to prepare your self for the other world, for my Master hath this day appointed me to take away your life, for the great wickedness you have committed, against him. Good James , said she (for so was the Mans name) you know I never offended him in any thing, and how lovingly we parted; nor can this arise, but upon some mistake; which when discovered, will bring both of you to the extreamity of torture. Forbear therefore, and spare my life; and if your Master have by any threats or promise of reward, constrained you to act such wickedness; and that he hath resolved, he will see my face no more, desist but till to morrow, and give me some of thy old Cloaths, so will I leave France ; and thou shalt tell thy Master, That thou hast killed me, and the Woolfs have eaten me. The youth moved with her words and tears, and afraid to stain his hands with her Blood, consented to what she said. Then told his Master he had slain her, received his reward, and then travelled from Paris with him. Here they accidentally met with the other Merchant at Orleans , the Wife was there likewise in Mans Cloaths, and as a stranger accuseth her Husband of Murder, he accuseth the other of Adultery. But at length it was concluded by the Law, the Husband should be freed and agree with his Wife that had been so faithful; the other onely suffered death, that by his deceit had been the cause of all the evil. We spent two days at Orleans thus amongst the Merchants, but could gain no intelligence of any that was to go our way. Nevertheless, I earnestly intreated our Captain to return; so that he easily perceived there was some extraordinary occasion that called me back. And as we were very familiar with one another, our Humors and our Years being the same. There is something, said he you design, you are unwilling I should know; and I am very sorry, since we are not onely of the same Profession, but Friends and Companions, that I may not be likewise a partaker of your cares. You have judged right, answered I, but though I have no reason to suspect any infidelity in any Man, much less in you, that I esteem and find faithful above all men; nevertheless I shall oblige you, before I tell you my concerns, by swearing my self your perpetual Friend; that you will be the like to me, and assist me in my present occasions, as I promise to assist you to my last breath in all your affairs. Then embracing me, Let these Arms, said he, perish, when they deny what they can give to my Friend. And in this manner did we two tye an inviolable knot of Friendship. Afterwards I related all that had passed between me, and the Lady, and her Uncle, and concerning the Letters that one of our men had found, of my Rivals Intentions; and how I intended to take occasion thence to serve her, to rescue her from those Villains, and thence conduct her to the Priests house, which her Uncle had sent me to; and showing her his consent under his own hand, to marry her. My Companion was highly astonished at the contrivance of the Plot, and in discoursing concerning it, we spent the best part of our journey, till we were come within a League of Estampes . It was then duskish, and we overtook a Gentlewoman on foot upon the Road, whom by the little light we had, we could easily perceive to be a person of no mean quality. Then considering the way she had to go, and pittying her nature, I proffered her the use of my Horse, she accepted of my proffer with thanks, and promising to carry her to our Inn, I brought her to our Club; there by the Captains order we had a little Table prepared for us three, and after we were refreshed from the weariness our journey had caused in us. We desired the Stranger to tell the reason of her Travels, for she was a person truly beautiful, and that ought to have been respected by all Men. as I walked two days ago in the Palle Malle at Orleans , I perceived two young men both of comely stature, coming towards me: They appeared both like Angels to me; but the first I saw, so employed my eyes, that I had no time to view the other. He had already conquered me at a distance, and had no need to attempt it again; nevertheless he came to me, and desired me, nay, forced me by his charming words to yeild to his will: A thing that all the World shall never force from me again, though they rack me to death, excepting him that hath done it. It is for his sake, that I have stoln away from my Friends, who are able Citizens of Orleans , dis-inherited my self of all I can expect from them, either to find him out that hath stoln away my heart, or to free my self from the shame that must necessarily fall upon me, if this matter be known. Here her tears stopt her words, but they added a luster to her Beauty. And though for modesty, all the while she made this relation she had fixed her eyes upon the ground, and could not know the Captains face; yet he soon remembred hers, and that she was the person he enjoyed at Orleans ; and not able to contain himself, her Beauty was so great, and his pitty no less, he ran, and embracing her. I am the man, said he, that you seek, that have been the cause of your misfortune: And since you have given me so manifest a sign, that you are a vertuous Woman, I shall to morrow make thee my Wife, and afterwards we will go and visit thy Friends. Then he bid her forget her sorrow, for he gave her manifest tokens that he was the Man. And now she began to know him by his Speech and Visage, though in the way her sorrow had blinded her eyes, and stopt her ears. So he took care for a good Chamber for her in the Town that night, and after much content on all sides she for her good Fortune, our Captain for his Beautiful Spouse, and all the company by reason of our several Adventures, parted well satisfied with that days events.  He rescues his Lady from the Rival, then Marrieth her himself, and afterwards by a stratagem reconciles himself to her Parents.   Hoc animi tam triste, bonum tam dulce venenum. Quotidie crudele magis crescebat in horas, Ut calor. And by so much the more was I inflamed, because I saw my companion so happy in his fair Mistriss, and my self onely crossed by a base and villainous Rival, this Rage augmented my valour, and set all my Faculties to work how I might frustrate his designs, and the next morning was no sooner come, but I went to my companions; I have, said I, a small business in hand, my Friends, but since it concerns my private interest alone, and there is no publick benefit arising from it, if you are willing to help me in it, I shall give you a good Feast and a Tearse of Claret to make merry; by my promise, and by the Captains Commands, who understood the whole matter I intended; for I acquainted him with it as we came from Orleans , and by the propension every one had to help his Companion in any thing that might concur to his welfare; they all unanimously consented to be ready on Tuesday morning by break of day. In the mean time I prepared all things ready for our Marriage; I visited the Priest, and entertained him nobly at a Banquet; telling him how by her Unkles consent he was desired to marry me to his Neece the next morning, and shewed him the Note written with her Unkles hand, he knew it, and wished me all happiness: so I desired him it might be done with all possible hast and secresie as soon as we came, which would be early in the morning, and then took my leave. The light no sooner broke into our Horizon the next morning, but we were already seven in number on horseback; so we marched towards La Beause , there we stay'd in an Inn till such times the Lady came by, she was accompanied onely with the Lawyers man that rid before; we let her pass a good way, and then we set out afterwards, till coming to a place more eminent then the rest, we had a full view of all the subjacent declivity. Here we watched what would become of her, and presently there passed by us in great speed four Horsemen, these I supposed my Rivals, but willing to let her understand I was her servant; and that she should be an eye-witness of it, I let them pass, in small time they had overtaken the Lady, dismounted her by force, and notwithstanding her Tears and Cries, were carrying her away. It was now no time to delay, for we were almost halfe a Leagues distance from them; nevertheless the goodness of our Horses soon got ground of them, and in a quarter of an hours time, notwithstanding the speed they made to be gone, we overtook them. My anger gave me no leisure to speak, but I ran so furiously on them before they were aware, that I dismounted two of them, but not intending to dispute it with the hindmost, I proceeded to him that had the Lady; Sir, said I, deliver up this Lady that so wrongfully you have forced and are now carrying away, or your Life shall pay for your Treachery, he was surprized so extremely at our arrival and my words, that he could not make a ready answer, and I was so impatient as not to expect it; but unwilling to kill him before her face, for fear to fright her, and incur her displeasure, I alighted and helped her from her Horse, she was no sooner down, and I on foot, but the coward taking this advantage, came upon me as he was on horseback with his sword in his hand, and if our Captain who was as forward in the assault for my sake, as I was my self, had not defended the blow, my life had been in great danger; in short, our Number, our Courage, and our Cause, soon gave us the victory, and after a few blows we put our enemies to flight: the tumult thus appeased; Noble Sir, said the Lady, for this act assureth me you are such, give me leave to know to what worthy person I am obliged for this succor, for next to my Parents that gave me life, I am most indebted to you that have defended it so well. Madam, said I, I should want some of that worth which you impute, if I should deny your Request; know then I am one of those that have been so happy as to love you secretly without daring to reveal my passion, till such times I had merited your Favour by some Noble service, and have ever been since the first time I saw you, as studious for your welfare as my own, which made me, when by a Letter that was found and brought to me, I understood the danger you were like to incur in your journey to Paris , engage these my friends on your behalf, and that you may be certified of the truth, see, here is the Letter of the treacherous Loret which he writ to his Confederate Moneur , and here is another of your Unkles own writing: she perused the first with a great deal of anger towards Loret and his Companions, the latter with a great deal of astonishment, and modest blushes, till satisfied at last with the truth, and by several circumstances concurring, thinking it a thing ordained by Fate, that she should marry the preserver of her Honour; she consented to goe with us to La Beauss , there were we married, and having passed away the day in great merriment, I lay there that night.  Ingremio dulcia sinu niveisque Lacertis. Caetera quis nescit? lassi requievimus ambo.  He is reconciled to his Wives friends; the Captain marrieth his own Spouse, they both leave the Society of Thieves, one departeth to Orleans, the other to Paris .  Spouse from Estampes , and was married to her by the same Priest, which caused us to stay there one day longer: afterwards I made my Feast that I had promised to my Companions, and before them all declared, that I was desirous for the present to leave the Society; but because my Horse, Pistols, and Boots, and the like, which according to our Laws were to be left for the publick good, would be serviceable to me in my journey to Paris . I desired they would take the value of them in Money; so they were valued, and I laid down the price; our Captain who was driven to the Trade more by Necessity then any natural Inclination, did the like, then did we bring in our Ladies, and after much Mirth and Joy we all parted, the Captain with his Lady to Orleans to her Friends, the rest to their Club at Estampes , and I with my Wife to Paris . Her friends at first were much astonished and incensed at the Marriage, but understanding at last how I had saved her Honour, and appeased by the Mediation of her Friends and the Damsels Tears, whose Heart I had already wonne, and knowing it was impossible now to part us, considering likewise that she was their onely Child and Heir to their Honour and Estate, and what Disgrace would come upon them if they rejected her, they caused a great feast to be made, and calling many of the chief Citizens their Friends together, they celebrated our Marriage-Feast with the greatest Solemnity imaginable, and afterward gave their Daughter a Portion suitable to her great Beauty.  Sit licet in natos facies austera Parentum, Æqua tamen semper mens est, & amica voluntas. And with a Glorious Branch adorn his Brow. For now he has overcome, and in the Breast Of his Beloved takes a gentle rest. So when the Marriage is concluded, all The Play is done, the Curtains are let fall.
