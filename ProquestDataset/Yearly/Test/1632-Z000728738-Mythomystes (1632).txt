 Looke not generous Reader (for such I write to) for more in the few following leaues, than a plaine and simple verity; vnadorned at all with eloquution, or Rhetoricall phrase; glosses fitter perhaps to be set vpon silken and thinne paradoxicall semblances, than appertaining to the care of who desires to lay downe a naked  & vnmasked Trueth. Nor expect heere an Encomium or praise of any such thing as the world ordinarily takes Poesy for; That same thing beeing (as I conceiue) a superficiall meere outside of Sence, or gaye barke only (without the body) of Reason; witnesse so many excellent witts that haue taken so much paines in these times to defend her; which sure they would not haue done, if what is generally received now a dayes for Poesy, were not meerely a faculty, or occupation of so little consequence, as by the louers thereof rather to be (in their owne fauour) excused, than for any good in the thing it selfe, to be commended. Nor must thou heere expect thy solution, if thy curiosity inuite thee to a satisfaction in any the vnder- Accidents, but in meerely the Essentiall Forme, of true Poesy: Such I call the Accidents or appendixes thereto, as conduce somewhat to the Matter, aud End, nothing to the reall Forme and Essence thereof. And these accidents (as I call them) our commenders & defenders of Poesy haue chiefely, and indeed sufficiently insisted, and dilated vpon; and are first, those floures (as they are called) of Rhetorick, consisting of their Anaphoras, Epistrophes, Metaphors, Metonymyes, Synecdoches and those their other potent Tropes and Figures; helpes, (if at all of vse to furnish out expressions with,) much properer sure, and more fitly belonging to Po esy than Oratory; yet such helpes, as if Nature haue not beforehand in his byrth, giuen a Poet, all such forced Art will come behind as lame to the businesse, and deficient, as the best-taught countrey Morris dauncer with all his bells and napkins, will ill deserue to be in an Inne of Courte at Christmas, tearmed the thing they call a fine reueller. The other Accidents of Poesy, and that are the greater part of the appurtenances thereof, in the accoumpt of our Poets of these times, are also heere vtterly vnmencioned, such as are, what sort of Poeme may admit the blanke verse, what requires exacte rime; where the strong line (as they call it) where the gentle, sortes best; what subject must haue the verse of so many feete, what of other; where the masculine rime, where the feminine, and where the threesillabled (which the Italians call their rime sdrucciole ) are to be used. These (I say) and the like Adjuncts of Poesy, (elsewhere amply discoursed of by many curious witts) are not heere mencioned. Only what I conceiued fit to speake (and with what breuity I could) of the Auncient Po ets in generall, and of the Forme and reall Essence of true Poesy, considered meerely in it owne worth and validity, without extrinsick and suppeditatiue ornament at all, together with the paralell of their foyle (our Moderne Poets and Poesyes,) I haue, (to the end to redeeme in some parte, and vindicate that excellent Art from the iniury it suffers in the worlds generall misprizion and misconstruction thereof,) heere touched, and but touched; the rather to awake some abler vnderstanding than my owne, to the pursute (if they please) of a theame (I conceiue) well worthy a greater industry, and happyer leisures than I my selfe possesse. WHEREIN A SHORT SVRVAY IS TAKEN OF THE NATVRE AND VALVE OF TRVE Poesie, and depth of the Ancients aboue our Moderne Poets. world is decrepit, and out of its age  & doating estate, subiect to all the imperfections that are inseparable from that wracke and maime of Nature, that the young behold with horror, and the sufferers thereof lye vnder with murmur and languishmet. Euen the generall Soule of this great Creature, whereof euery one of ours is a seuerall peece, seemes bedrid, as vpon her deathbed, and neere the time of her dissolution to a second better estate, and being: the yeares of her strength are past; and she is now nothing but disease for the Soules health is no other than meerely the knowledge of the Truth of things. Which health, the worlds youth inioyed; and hath now  1 exchanged for it, all the diseases of all errors, heresies, and different sects and schismes of opinions and vnderstandings in all matter of Arts, Sciences, and Learnings whatsoeuer. To helpe on these diseases to incurability, what age hath euer beene so fruitfull of liberty in all kindes, and of all permission and allowance for this reason of ours, to runne wildely all her owne hurtfullest wayes without bridle, bound, or limit at all? For instance; what bookes haue wee of what euer knowledge, or in what mysteries soeuer, wisely by our Auncients (for auoiding of this present malady the world is now falne into) couched, and carefully infoulded, but must bee by euery illiterate person without exception, deflowred and broke open, or broke in pieces, because beyond his skill to vnlocke the? Or what Law haue we that prouides for the restraint of these myriads of hot-headed wranglers, & ignorant writers and teachers, which, out of the bare priuiledge of perhaps but puny graduate in some Vniuersity, will venter vpon all, euen the most remoued and most abstruse knowledges, as perfect vnderstanders and expounders of them, vpon the single warrant of their owne braine; or inuenters of better themselues, than all Antiquity could deliuer downe to them; out of the treasonous mint of their owne imaginations? What hauocke, what mischiefe to all learnings, and how great a multiplicity of poysonous errours and heresies must not of necessity hence ensue, and ouerspread the face of all Truths whatsoeuer? Among these heresies (to omit those in matter of Diuinity, or the right forme of worshipping God, which the Doctors of his Church are fitter to make the subiects of their tongues and pens, than I, a Layman, and all-vnworthy the taske,) among, I say, these, (if I may so call them) heresies, or ridiculous absurdities in matter of humane letters, and their professors in these times, I find none so grosse, nor indeed any so great scandall, or maime to humane learning, as in the almost generall abuse, and violence offered to the excellent art of Poesye, first, by those learned (as they thinke themselues) of our dayes, who call themselues Poets; and next, by such as out of their ignorance, heede not how much they prophane that high and sacred title in calling them so. From the number of these first mentioned, (for, for the last, I will not mention them; nor yet say as a graue Father, and holy one too, of certaine obstinate heretikes said; Decipiantur in nomine diaboli ; but charitably wish their reformation, and cure of their blindnesse;) from the multitude (I say) of the common rimers in these our moderne times, and moderne tongues, I will exempt some few, as of a better ranke and condition than the rest. And first to beginne with Spaine . I will say it may iustly boast to haue afforded (but many Ages since) excellent Poets, as Seneca , the Tragedian, Lucan , and Martiall the Epigrammatist, with others; and in these latter times, as diuerse in Prose, some good Theologians also in Rime, but for other Poesies in their (now spoke) tongue, of any great name, (not to extoll their trifling, though extolled Celestina , nor the second part of their Diana de Monte Major , better much than the first; and these but poeticke prosers neither,) I cannot say it affords many, if any at all: The inclination of that people being to spend much more wit, and more happily in those prose Romances they abound in, such as their Lazarillo, Don Quixote, Guzman, and those kind of Cuenta's of their Picaro's , and Gitanillas , than in Rime. The French likewise, more than for a Ronsart , or Des-Portes , but chiefly their Salust , (who may passe among the best of our modernes,) I can say little of Italy hath in all times, as in all abilities of the mind besides, been much fertiler than either of these, in Poets. Among whom, (to omit a Petrarch , who though he was an excellent rimer in his owne tongue, and for his Latine Africa iustly deserued the lawrell that was giuen him; yet was a much excellenter Philosopher in prose; and with him, a Bembo, Dante, Ang: Politiano, Caporale, Pietro Aretino, Sannazaro, Guarini , and diuers others, men of rare fancy all) I must preferre chiefely three; as the graue and learned Tasso , in his Sette giorni , (a diuine worke) and his Gierusalem liberata , so farre as an excellent pile of meerely Morall Philosophy may deserue. than, Ariosto , for the artfull woofe of his ingenious, though vnmeaning fables; the best, perhaps, haue in that kind beene sung since Ouid . And lastly, that smoothwrit Adonis of Marino , full of various conception, and diuersity of learning. The Douche I cannot mention, being a stranger to their minds, and manners; therefore I will returne home to my Countrey-men, and mother tongue: And heere, exempt from the rest, a Chaucer , for some of his po ems; chiefely his Troylus and Cresside . than the generous and ingenious Sidney , for his smooth and artfull Arcadia (and who I could wish had choze rather to haue left vs of his pen, an Encomiasticke Poeme in honour, than prose-Apology in defence, of his fauorite, the excellent Art of Poesy.) Next, I must approue the learned Spencer , in the rest of his Po ems, no lesse than his Fairy Queene , an exact body of the Ethicke doctrine: though some good iudgments haue wisht (and perhaps not without cause) that he had therein beene a little freer of his fiction, and not so close riuetted to his Morall; no lesse than many doe to Daniells Ciuile warrs , that it were (though otherwise a commendable worke) yet somwhat more than a true Chronicle history in rime; who, in other lesse laboured things, may haue indeed more happily, (how euer, alwayes cleerely and smoothly) written. Wee haue among vs a late- writ Polyolbion also, and an Agincourte , wherin I will only blame their honest Authours ill fate, in not hauing laid him out some happier Clime, to haue giuen honour and life to, in some happier language. After these, (besides some late dead) there are others now liuing, drammaticke and liricke writers, that I must deseruedly commend for those parts of fancy and imagination they possesse, and should much more, could wee see them somewhat more, force those gifts, and liberall graces of Nature, to the end shee gaue them; and therewith, worke and constantly tire vpon sollid knowledges; the which hauing from the rich fountes of our reuerend Auncients, drawne with vnwearied, and wholsomely imploied industries; they might in no lesse pleasing and profitable fictions than they haue done (the very fittest conduit-pipes) deriue downe to vs the vnderstanding of things euen farthest remooued from vs, and most worthy our speculation, and knowledge. But alas, such children of obedience, I must take leaue to say, the most of our ordinary pretenders to Poesy now a dayes, are to their owne, and the diseased times ill habits, as the racke will not bee able to make the most aduised among twenty of them confesse, to haue farther inquired, or attended to more, in the best of their Authours they haue chosen to read and study, than meerely his stile, phrase, and manner of expression; or scarce suffered themselues to looke beyond the dimension of their owne braine, for any better counsaile or instruction elsewhere. What can wee expect than of the Poems they write? Or what can a man mee thinks liken them more fitly to, than to Ixion's issue? for hee that with meerely a naturall veine, (and a little vanity of nature, which I can be content to allow a Poet) writes without other grounds of sollid learning, than the best of these vngrounded rimers vnderstad or aime at, what does he more than imbrace assembled cloudes with Ixion , and beget only Monsters? This might yet be borne with, did not these people as cofidently vsurpe to themselues the title of Schollers, and learned men, as if they possest the knowledges of all the Magi , the wise East did euer breed; when, let me demand but a reason for security of my iudgement in allowing them for such, they straite giue mee to know they vnderstand the Greeke , and Latine ; and in conclusion, I discouer, the compleate crowne of all their ambition is but to be stiled by others a good Latinist or Grecian , and than they stile themselues good Schollers. So would I too, had I not before hand beene taught to say: Non quia Gr aecascias, vel calles verba Latina, Doctus es aut sapiens, sed quia vera vides ; & besides, hapned to know a late trauailing Odcombian among vs; that became (I know not for what mortaller sinne than his variety of language) the common scorne, and contempt of all the abusiue witts of the time; yet possest both those languages in great perfection; as his eloquent orations in both toungs; (and vttered vpon his owne  2 head without prompting) haue euer sufficiently testified. Now, finding this to be the greater part of the Schollership these our Poets indeauour to haue, and which many of them also haue; I find with all, they sit downe as satisfied, as if their vnfurnisht brests contained each one the learning and wisdome of an Orpheus, Virgil, Hesiod, Pindarus , and Homer altogether. When as, what haue they else but the barke and cloathing meerely wherein their high and profound doctrines lay? Neuer looking farther into those their golden fictions for any higher sence, or any thing diuiner in them infoulded  & hid from the vulgar, but lulled with the meruellous expression & artfull contexture of their fables--- tanquam parui pueri (as one saies) per brumam ad ignem sessitantes, aniles nugas fabell asque de Poetis imbibunt, cum interim de vtiliore sanctior eque sententia minime sunt solliciti . I haue staid longer, and rubde harder mee thinkes than needes, vpon the sore of our now a day Poets. Let mee leaue them, and looke backe to the neuer-enough honoured Auncients; and set them before our eyes, who no lesse deseruedly wore the name of Prophets, and Priuy-counsellors of the Gods (to vse their owne  3 phrase, or Sonnes of the Gods, as Plato 4 calls them) than Poets. To the end wee may, if in this declining state of the world we cannot rectify our oblique one, by their perfect and strait line, yet indeauour it: and in the meane time giue the awefull reuerence due to them, for the many regions of distance between their knowledges and ours. And this that wee may the better doe, let vs paralell them with the Poets (if I may so call them) of our times, in three things only, and so carry along together their strait and our crooked line; for our better knowledge of them, and reformation of our selues. In the first place than, let vs take a suruay of their naturall inclination and propensenesse to the acquisitio of the knowledge of truth, by what is deliuered to vs of them; as also, of their willing neglect, and auersion from all worldly businesse and cogitations that might be hindrances in the way to their desired end. 1\. It is in humane experience found, as well as by all writers determined, that the powerfullest of al the affects of the minde is Loue, and therefore the diuine Plato 5 sayes, it is iustly called Roma ; which among the Greeks, is force, potency, or vehemence. Of this Loue there be two kinds; Celestiall or Intellectuall; or else Carnall or Vulgar. Of both these kinds Salomon hath spoken excellently; of the Vulgar, in his Prouerbes as a Morall, and in his Ecclesiastes as a Naturall Philosopher; and diuine-like of the diuine and Intellectuall Loue in his Canticle; for which it is called among all the rest of the holy Scripture Canticum canticorum , as the most sacred and diuine. The obiect of this Celestiall or Intellectuall Loue, (for the other, or vulgar Loue it concernes mee not to mention,) is the excellency of the Beauty of Supernall and Intellectuall thinges: To the contemplation whereof, rationall and wise Spirits are forcibly raised and lifted aloft; yea lifted oftentimes so far (sayes Plato )  6 aboue mortality, as euen-in Deum transeunt , and so full fraught with the delight and abondance of the pleasure they feele in those their eleuations, raptures, and mentall alienations (wherin the soule remaines for a time quite seperated as it were from the body) do no only sing with the ingenious Ouid ---Est Deus in nobis, agitante calescimus illo , But in an Extaticke manner, and to vse Plato's 7 phrase) diuino afflatu cocitati , cry out with the intraunced Zoroaster--- Ope thine eyes, ope them wide; raise and lift them aloft . And of this, the excellent Prince Io: Picus-Mirandula , (in a discourse of his vpon the doctrine of Plato ) giues the reason; saying: Such, whose vnderstanding (being by Philosophicall studie refined and illuminated) knowes this sensible Beauty to bee but the image of another more pure and excellent, leauing the loue of this, desire to see the other; and perseuering in this eleuation of the minde, arriue at last to that celestiall loue; which although it liues in the vnderstanding of the soule of euery man, yet they only (sayes he) make vse of it, and they are but few, who separating themselues wholy from the care of the body, seeme thance oftentimes extaticke, and as it were quite rauisht and exalted aboue the earth and all earthly amusements . And farther, in another place of that Treatise, adds that many with the feruent loue of the beauty and excellence of intellectuall things, haue beene so raized aboue all earthly considerations, as they haue lost the vse of their corporall eyes. Homer (sayes he) with seeing the ghost of Achilles, which inspired him with that Poeticke fury, that who with vnderstanding reades, shall find to containe in it all intellectuall contemplation, was thereby depriued (or faigned to bee depriued) of his corporall eye-sight , as one that seeing all things aboue, could not attend to the heeding of triuiall and meaner things below. And such rapture of the spirit, is exprest (saies he) in the fable of Tyresias that Calimacus sings; who for hauing seene Pallas naked (which signifies no other than that Ideall beauty, whence proceeds all sincere wisdome, and not cloathed or couered with corporall matter) became sodainly blind, and was by the same Pallas made a Prophet; so as that which blinded his corporall eyes, opened to him the eyes of his vnderstanding; by which he saw not only all things past, but also all that were to come . Loe, these, and such Spirits as these the learned Picus speakes of, such were those of those Auncient Fathers of all learning, and Tyresia like Prophets, as Poets: such their neglect of the body, and businesse of the world! Such their blindnesse to all things of triuiall and inferiour condition; And such lastly were those extaticke eleuations; or that truly- diuinus furor of theirs, which Plato speaking of  8 sayes it is- a thing so sacred, as-non sine maximo fauore Dei comparari queat ; cannot bee attained to without the wonderfull fauour of God. And which selfe thing themselues ment in their fable of that beautifull Ganimede , they sing of, (which interpreted, is the Contemplation of the Soule, or the Rationall part of Man) so deare to the God of gods and men, as that he raiseth it vp to heauen, there to powre out to him (as they make him his cupbearer) the soueraigne Nectar of Sapience and wisdome, the liquor he is onely best pleased and delighted with. These were those fathers (as I lately called them) and fountes of knowledge and learning; or nurses of wisdome, from whose pregnant brests the whole world hath suckt the best part of all the humane knowledge it hath; And from whose wise and excellent fables (as  9 one of our late Mythologians truely notes) All those were after them called Philosophers tooke their grounds and first initia Philosophandi ; adding, that their Philosophy was no other than meerely- fabularum sensa ab inuolucris exuuijlsque fabularum explicata -the senses and meanings of fables taken out and seperated from their huskes and inuoluements. With whom the excellent Io: Picus (or rather Ph aenix as wisemen  10 haue named him) consenting, sayes in his Apologia (speaking of the Poesies of Zoroaster and Orpheus)-Orpheus apud Gr aecos ferme integer; Zoroaster apud eos mancus, apud Caldaeos absolutior legitur. Ambo (sayes he) prisc ae Sapientiae patres & authores . Both of them fathers and authors of the auncient Wisdome. With these also the most autenticke Iamblicus , the Caldean , who writes- Pythagoras had- Orphicam Theologiam tanquam exemplar, ad quam ipse suam effingeret formaretque philosophiam ; the Theology of Orpheus as his coppy and patterne, by which hee formed and fashioned his philosophy. I will ad a word more of the before-cited Picus ; who thus far farther of Orpheus in particular  11 sayes- Secreta de Numeris doctrina, & quicquid magnum sublimeque habuit Gr aeca philosophia, ab Orphei institutis vt a primo fonte manauit ; the mysticall doctrine of Numbers, and what euer the Greeke philosophy had in it great and high, flowed all from the Institutions of Orpheus , as from their first fount. And of the rest of his ranke and fraternity, those- Sapienti ae partes, ac duces (as Plato 12 calls those old excellent Poets), I will conclude in generall, with the testimony of first, the now-mentioned Plato ; who sayes likewise elsewhere 13 Nihil aliud sunt qu am deorum interpretes; they are no other than the Interpreters of the gods, And in another place  14 that-their pr aeclara poemata non hominum sunt inuenta, sed caelestia munera . Their excellent Poems are not the inuentions of men, but gifts and graces of heauen. And lastly with Farra the learned Alexandrian , who speaking likewise  15 of the old Poets, sayes- Their fables are all full of most high Mysteries; and haue in them that splendor that is shed into the fancy and intellect, rauisht, and inflamed with diuine fury . And in the same Treatise makes this particular mention of some of them- and in those times flourished Linus, Orpheus, Museus, Homer, Hesiod, and all the other most famous of that truly golden age . Now to apply this short view we haue taken of these auncient Poets; whether there appeares ought in any our students, or writers of our times, be they Poets or Philosophers (I put them together, as who are, or should be both professors of but one, and the same learning, though by the one receiued and deliuered in the apparell of verse, the other of prose,) that may in any degree of coherence suffer a paralell with either the Inclinations or Abilities of such as these before mentioned, I wish we could see cause to grant. but rather, that there is in them (for ought appeares) no such inclination to the loue or search of any great or high truthes (for the Truthes sake, meerely) nor the like neglect of the world and blindnesse to the vanities thereof, in respect of it, nor lastly, any fruites from them, sauouring of the like Industry, or bearing any shadow scarce of similitude with that of theirs, wee may positiuely affirme; as a truth no lesse obuious to euery mans eye, than the lamentable cause and occasion thereof is to euery mans vnderstading; which is the meane accoumpt, or rather contempt and scorne that in these dayes, all vngaining Sciences,  & that conduce not immediately to worldly profit, or popular eminence, are held in. the Poet especially. Qual vaghezza di lauro, qual di mirto ? Pouera, e nuda vai filosofia, Dice la turba al vil guadagno intesa. Whence it is, that much time spent in sollid contemplatiue studies is held vaine and vnnecessary; and these slight flashes of vngrouded fancy, (ingenious Nothings,  & meere imbroideries vpo copwebbs) that the world swarmes with, (like sophisticate alchimy gold that will not abide the first touch, yet glitters more in the eye than the sadd weightyer true gold), are only laboured for and attended too; because they take best, and most please the corrupt tast and false appetite of the sordid and barbarous times wee liue in. And yet to speake a troth, I cannot herein blame the diseased world so much, as I do the infelicity of that sacred Art of Poesy; which like the soueraigne prescriptions of a Galen or Hypocrates , ordered and dispensed by illiterate Empyricks or dogleeches, must needes (as the best phisicks ill handled) proue but so much variety of poyson instead of cure. And such are the mont'ibanke Rimers of the time, and so faulty, that haue so much abused their profession, and the world; and stucke so generall a scandall vpon that excellent Physicke of the minde; with the poyson of their meritricious flatteries, and base seruile fawnings at the heeles of worldly wealth and greatnesse, as makes it abhorred of all men; and most, of those that are of most vnderstanding. For indeed what can bee more contemptible, or breed a greater indignation in wise, and vnderstanding minds, than to see the study of Wisdome made not only a mercinary, but vitious occupation. And that same Pudicam Palladem , (as a wise Author from the like resentment aptly saies) deorum munere inter homines diuersantem eijci, explodi, exibilari, Non habere qui amet, qui faueat, nisi ipsa quasi prostans, & praefloratae virginitatis accepta mercedula, maleparatum aes in amatoris arculam referat. 2\. The second great disparity, that I find betweene those auncient Fathers of learning, and our moderne writers, is in the price and estimation they held their knowledges in. Which appeares in the care they tooke to conceale them from the vnworthy vulgar; and which doth no lesse commend their wisdome, than conclude (by their contrary course) our Modernes, empty, and barren of any thing rare and pretious in them; who in all probability would not prostitute all they know to the rape and spoile of euery illiterate reader, were they not conscious to themselues their treasor deserues not many locks to guard it vnder. But that I may not conclude vpon a- non concessum , for I remember I haue heard it affirmed, (and by some too that the time calls Schollers), that the Auncients certainely spoke their meanings as plaine as they could, and were the honester men for doing so; and there may be more birds beside, of the same feather with these; therefore I will in charity speake a word or two for these peoples instruction; and in the meane betweene the whining Heraclite , and ouer rigid Democritus (as much as in me lyes) comiter erranti monstrare viam . Let such than as are to learne whither to conceale their knowledges, was the intent and studied purpose of the Auncient Poets all, and most of the auncient Philosophers also; let such I say, know, that, when in the worlds youth  & capabler estate, those old wise Æ gyptian Priests beganne to search out the Misteries of Nature, (which was at first the whole worlds only diuinity) they deuized, to the end to retaine among themselues what they had found, (lest it should be abused and vilefied by being deliuered to the vulgar) certaine marks, and characters of things, vnder which all the precepts of their wisdome were contained; which markes they called Hieroglyphicks or sacred grauings. And more than thus, they deliuered little: or what euer it was, yet alwaies dissimulanter , and in Enigma's and mysticall riddles, as their following disciples also did. And this prouizo of theirs, those Images of Sphynx they placed before all their Temples did insinuate; and which they set for admonitions, that high and Mysticall matters should by riddles and enigmaticall knotts be kept inuiolate from the prophane Multitude. I will giue instance of one or two of them. The authantike testimony late cited (to other purpose) by mee of Orpheus , and his learning, (viz. That he was one of the prisc ae sapientiae patres , and that the Secreta de numeris doctrina and what euer the Greeke Philosophy had in it- Magnum & sublime , did from his Institutions, vt a primo fonte manare ,) hath these words immediately following- Sed qui erat veterum mos philosophorum, ita Orpheus suorum dogmatum mysteria fabularum intexit inuolucris, & poetico velamento dissimulauit; vt si quis legat illos Hymnos nihil subesse credat praeter fabellas nug asque meracissimas -but as it was the manner of the Auncient Philosophers, so Orpheus within the foults and inuoluements of fables, hid the misteries of his doctrine; and dissembled the vnder a poeticke maske; so as who reades those hymnes of his, will not beleeue any thing to bee included vnder them, but meere tales and trifles. In Homer likewise, by the same mouth positiuely auerred to haue included in his two Poems of Iliads and Odisses-all intellectuall contemplation ; and which are called the Sun and Moone of the Earth, for the light they beare (as one well notes) before all Learning; (and of which Democritus speaking, (as Farra 16 the Alexandrian obserues) sayes- it was impossible but Homer, to haue composed so wonderfull workes, must haue been indued with a diuine and inspired nature; who vnder a curious, and pleasing vaile of fable, hath taught the world how great and excellent the beauty of true wisdome is . no lesse than Ang: Politianus who sayes  17 \- Omnia in his, & ab his sunt omnia. ) yet what appeares (I say) in these workes of Homer to the meere; or ignorant reader, at all of doctrine or document, or more, than two fictious impossible tales, or lyes of many men that neuer were, and thousands of deedes that neuer were done? Nor lesse cautious than these, were most of the Auncient Philosophers also. The diuine Plato writing to a friend of his de supremis substantijs- Per aenigmata (sayes he) dicendum est: ne si epistola fort e ad aliorum peruenerit manus, quae tibi scribimus, ab alijs intellig antur -we must write in enigma's and riddles; lest if it come to other hands, what wee write to thee, be vnderstood by others. Aristotle of those his books, wherein he treates of Supernaturall things, sayes (as Aulus Gellius testifies)  18 that- they were-editi, & non editi ; as much as to say, Mystically or enigmatically written; adding farther- cognobiles ijs tantum erunt qui nos audiunt -they shall be only knowne to our hearers or disciples. and this closenesse Pythagoras also hauing learned of those his Masters, and taught it his disciples, he was made the Master of Silence. And who, as all the doctrines hee deliuered were (after the manner of the Hebrewes, Ægyptians , and most auncient Poets,) layd downe in enigmaticall and figuratiue notions, so one among other of his is this- Giue not readily thy right hand to euery one , by which Precept (sayes the profound Iamblicus 19 that great Master aduertiseth that wee ought not to communicate to vnworthy mindes, and not yet practized in the vnderstanding of occulte doctrines, those misterious instructions that are only to bee opened (sayes he) and taught to sacred and sublime wits, and such as haue bin a long time exercised and versed in them. Now, from this meanes that the first auncients vsed, of deliuering their knowledges thus among themselues by word of mouth; and by successiue reception from them downe to after ages, That Art of mysticall writing by Numbers, wherein they couched vnder a fabulous attire, those their verball Instructions, was after, called Scientia Cabal ae , or the Science of reception: Cabala among the Hebrews signifying no other than the Latine receptio : A learning by the auncients held in high estimation and reuerence and not without great reason; for if God (as the excellent Io: Picus 20 rehearses) nihil casu, sed omnia per suam sapientiam vt in pondere & mensura, ita in numero disposuit ; did nothing by chance, but through his wisdome disposed all things as in weight and measure, so likewise in number; (and which taught the ingenious Saluste to say,  21 that,--- \------Sacred harmony And law of Number did accompany Th'allmighty most, when first his ordinace Appointed Earth to rest, and Heauen to daunce ) Well might Plato 22 consequently affirme that- among all liberall Arts, and contemplatiue Sciences, the chiefest and most diuine was the-Scientia numerandi . and who likewise questioning why Man was the wisest of Animalls, answers himselfe againe (as Aristotle in his Problemes obserues)--- quia numerare nouit -because hee could number. no lesse than Auenzoar the Babylonian , whose frequent word by Albuniazars report (as Picus Mirandula 23 notes) was- eum emnia nosse qui nouerat numerare \- that hee knowes all things that knowes number. But howsoeuer an Art thus highly cried vp by the Auncients; Yet a Learning (I say) now more than halfe lost; or at least by such as possesse any limbe of it, rather talked of, than taught. Rabanus a great Doctor of the Christian Church only excepted, who hath writ a particular booke- de Numerorum virtutibus . by diuerse others, as Ambrose, Nazianzen, Origine, Augustine , and many more, (as the learned Io: Picus at large in his Apology showes) reuerendly mentioned, but neuer published in their writings. And I am fully of opinion (which till I find reason to recant, I will not bee ashamed to owne) that the Ignorance of this Art, and the worlds mayme in the want, or not vnderstanding of it, is insinuated in the Poets generally-sung fable of Orpheus : whom they faigne to haue recouered his Euridice from Hell, with his Musick; that is Truth and Equity, from darkenesse of Barbarisme and Ignorance, with his profound and excellent Doctrines; but, that in the thicke caliginous way to the vpper-earth, she was lost againe; and remaines lost to vs, that read and vnderstand him not, for want, meerely of the knowledge of that Art of Numbers that should vnlocke and explane his Mysticall meanings to vs. This Learning of the Æ gyptians (thus concealed by them, as I haue shewed) being transferred from them to the Greekes ; was by them from hand to hand deliuered still in fabulous riddles among them; and thance downe to the Latines . Of which beades, the ingenious Ouid has made a curious and excellent chaine; though perhaps hee vnderstood not their depth; as our wisest Naturalists doubt not to affirme, his other Contreymen Lucretius , and that more learned Scholler (I meane Imitater) of Hesiod , the singular Virgil , did; and which are the sinewes and marrow, no lesse than starres and ornaments of his incomparable Poems: And still by them, as by their masters before them, preserued with equall care, from the mischiefe of diuulgation, or Prophanation: a vice by the Auncients in generall, no lesse than by Moses particularly, in the deliuering of the Law (according to the opinions of the most learned, both Christian Diuines, and Iewish Rabines) with singular caution prouided against and auoided. Write (said the Angell to Esdras ) 24 all these things that thou hast seene, in a booke, and hide them, and teach them only to the wise of the people, whose heartes thou knowest may comprehend and keep these secrets . And since I late mentioned that great Secretary of God, Moses , to whose sacred pen as we cannot attribute too much, so, that wee may giue the greater reuerence to him, and consequently the greater credit to the authority of those Auncient followers and imitaters of his, or (that I may righter say, and not vnreuerently) those iointrunners with him in the same example of closenesse, and care to conceale, I will speake a word or two of him. And vpon the warrant of greater vnderstandings than my owne, auerre, That it is the firme opinion of all ancient writers, which (as an indubitable troth), they do all with one mouth confirme, that the full and entire knowledge of all wisdome both diuine  & humane, is included in the five bookes of the Mosaicke law- dissimulata autem, & occultata (as the excellent Io: Picus in his learned 25 exposition vpon him sayes) in literis ipsis, quibus dictiones legis context ae sunt- But hidden and disguized euen in the letters themselues that forme the precepts of the Law. And the same Picus , in  26 another discourse of his vpon the bookes of Moses more at large to the same purpose sayes- Scribunt non modo celebres Hebr aeoru doctores (whom afterwards he names,  27 as) Rabi Eliazar, Rabi Moysis de Ægypto, Rabi SimeonBen Lagis, Rabi Ismahel, Rabi Iodam, & Rabi Nachinan; sed ex nostris quoque Esdras, Hilarius, & Origines, Mosem non legem modo, quam quinque exaratam libris posteris reliquit, sed secretirem quoque, & veram legis enarrationem in monte diuinitus accepisse. Praeceptum autem ei a Deo, vt legem quidem populo publicaret, legis autem interpretationem nec traderet literis nec inuulgaret, sed ipse Iesu Naue tantum; tum ille, alijs deinceps sacerdotum primoribus, magna silentij religione reuelaret the most renowned and authetique not only among the Hebrew Doctors, as Rabi Eliazar, Rabi Moysis de Ægypto, Rabi Symeon &c . but among ours also, Esdras, Hillary , and Origine , doe write that Moses receiued from God vpon the mount not the Law only, which he hath left in fiue bookes exactly deliuered to posterity, but the more hidden also, and true explanation of the Law: But with all, was warned and commaunded, by God, that as he should publish the Law to the People, so the interpretation thereof, he should neither commit to letters nor diuulge; but he to Iosua only and Iosua to the other succeeding primaries among the Priests; and that, vnder a great religion of secrecy. and concludes- Et merito quidem; Nam satis erat vulgaribus, & per simplicem historiam nunc Dei potentiam, nunc in improbos iram, in bonos clementiam, in omnes iustitiam agnoscere, & per diuina salutariaque praecepta, ad bene beateque viuendum & cultum relligionis institui; at misteria secretiora, & sub cortice legis rudique verborum pr aetextu latitantia altissiae diuinitatis arcana plebi palam facere, quid erat aliud quam dare sanctum canibus, & inter porcos spargere margaritas ; and not without great reason; for it was enough for the multitude to be by meerely the simple story, taught and made to know, now the Power of God, now his Wrath against the wicked, Clemency towards the good, and Iustice to all; and by diuine and wholesome precepts instructed in the wayes of religion, and holy life. But those secreter Mysteries, and abstrusities of most high diuinity, hidden and concealed vnder the barke, and rude couer of the words, to haue diuulged and layd these open to the vulgar; what had it been other than to giue holy things to dogs, and cast pearles among swine? So he. And this little that I haue heere rehearsed (for in a thing so knowne to all that are knowers, mee thinkes I haue said rather too much than otherwise) shall serue for instance of Moses his mysticall manner of writing. Which I haue the rather done for instruction of some ignorant, though stiffe opposers of this truth, that I haue lately met with; but chiefely in iustification of those other wise Auncients, of his, and succeeding times, Poets, and Philosophers, that were no lesse carefull than Moses was, not to giue- Sanctum canibus , (as before said) nor inter porcos spargere margaritas . Now to go about to examine whither it appeares our Modernes (Poets especially, for I will exempt diuerse late prose-writers), haue any the like closenesse as before mentioned; were a worke sure as vaine and vnnecessary, as it is a truth firme and vnquestionable, that they possesse the knowledge of no such mysteries as deserue the vse of any art at all for their concealing. 3\. The last, and greatest disparity, and wherein aboue all others, the grossest defect and maime appeares, in our Modernes (and especially Poets) in respect of the Auncients; is their generall ignorace, euen throughout all of them, in any the mysteries and hidden properties of Nature; which as an vnconcerning Inquisition it appeares not in their writings they haue at all troubled their heads with. Poets I said especially (and indeed only) for we haue many Prose men excellent naturall Philosophers in these late times; and that obserue strictly that closenesse of their wise Masters the reuerend Auncients; So as now a dayes our Philosophers are all our Poets, or what our Poets should bee; and our Poesies growne to bee little better than fardles of such small ware as those Marchants the French call pedlers, carry vp and downe to sell; whissles, painted rattles, and such like Bartholomew -babyes. for what other are our common vninstructing fabulous rimes, than amusements for fooles and children? But our Rimes (say they) are full of Morall doctrine. be it so. But why not deliuered than in plaine prose, and as openly to euery mans vnderstanding, as it deserues to be taught, and commonly knowne by euery one. The Auncients (say they) were Authors of Fables, which they sung in measured numbers, as we in imitation of them do. True: but sure enough their meanings were of more high nature, and more difficult to be found out, than any booke of Manners wee shall readily meete withall, affoordes; else they had not writ them so obscurely or we should find them out more easily, and make some vse of them: whereas not vnderstanding nor seeking to vnderstand them, we make none at all. Wee liue in a myste, blind and benighted; and since our first fathers disobedience poysoned himselfe and his posterity, Man is become the imperfectest and most deficient Animall of all the field: for than he lost that Instinct that the Beast retaines; though with him the beast, and with it the whole vegitable and generall Terrene nature also suffered, and still groanes vnder the losse of their first purity, occasioned by his fall. What concernes him now so neerely as to attend to the cultiuating or refining,  & thereby aduancing of his rationall part, to the purchase & regaining of his first lost felicity? And what meanes to conduce to this purchase, can there bee, but the knowledge first, and loue next (for none can loue but what hee first knowes) of his Maker, for whose loue and seruice he was only made? And how can this blind, lame, and vtterly imperfect Man, with so great a lode to boote of originall and actuall offence vpon his back, hope to approach this supreme altitude, and immensity, which \------ In quella inaccessibil luce, Quasi in alta caligine s'asconde, (as an excellent Poetesse  28 discribes the inscrutable Beeing of God) but by two meanes only: the one, by laying his burden on him that on his Crosse bore the burthan of all our defectes, and interpositions betweene vs and the hope of the vision of his blessed Essence face to face heereafter; and the other, by carefull searche of him here in this life (according to Saint Paules instruction), in his works; who telles vs  29 \- those inuisible things of God are cleerely seene, being understood by the things that are made ; or by the workes of his blessed hands? So as, betweene these two mayne and only meanes of acquiring here the knowledge, and hereafter the vision of him wherein all our present and future happinesse consists, what middle place (to descend to my former discourse) can these mens Morall Philosophy (trow we) challenge? which in its first Masters and teachers time, before there was any better diuinity knowne, might well enough passe for a course kind of diunity; but howeuer, such as one, as (with the leaue of our Poets) needes no fiction to clothe or conceale it in. And therefore vtterly vnfit to bee the Subiect of Poems: since it containes in it but the obuious restraints or impulsions of the Humane Sence and will, to or from what it ynly before-hand (without extrinsicke force or law) feeles and knowes it ought to shunne, or imbrace. The other two more remooued and harder lessons do certainely more in the affaire both of soule and body, concerne vs. And these (if we be wise enough to loue our selues so well), wee must seeke and take from the hands of their fittest teachers. As, in the first, we need goe no farther (though learned  & wise Writers haue made mention, and to high purpose, of a Theologia Philosophica , as they call some of the doctrines of the auncient Poets), than to the Doctors, and Doctrines of that Church that God dyed to plant, and which shall liue till the worlds death. And for instruction in our next necessary Lesson, to wit, the Misteries of Nature, we must, if we will follow Plato's aduice- inquire of those (and by them be directed) who liued neerest to the time of the gods ; meaning the old wise Ethnicks: among whom, the best Masters were certainly most, if not all of them, Poets; and from whose fires (as I haue formerly touched) the greatest part of all humane knowledges haue taken their first light. Among these, I say, and not elsewhere (excepting the sacred Old Law only) must we search for the knowledge of the wise, and hidden wayes  & workings of our great Gods handmaid, Nature. But alas who findes, or who seekes now adayes to finde them? Nay (what is more strange) there want not of these learned of our times, that will not bee intreated to admit those excellent Masters of knowledge to meane (if they allow them any meaning) scarce other at all, than meerely Morall doctrine. I haue knowne Latine and Greeke Interpreters of them in these times; men otherwise of much art, and such as able to render their Authors phrase to the height of their good, in our worse language; yet aske the most, as I haue some of them, and I feare they will answere, as one (and the best) of our Greeke translators hath ingenuously confest to mee, that for more than matter of Morality, hee hath discouered little in his Authors meanings. Yet my old good friend as well as I wish him, (and very well I wish him for those parts of Fancy, Industry, and meritorious Ability that are in him) must pardon mee that I affirme, it is not truer that there euer was such a thing as a Mus aeus , or Hesiod , or Homer , whom he has taught to speake excellent English; than it is, that the least part of the Doctrine (or their wisest expositors abuse mee, and other Ignorants with mee) that they meant to lay downe in those their wise, though impossible fables, was matter of Manners, but chiefely Nature: No lesse than in the rest of those few before, and many after them, whom all Antiquity has cried vp for excellent Poets, and called their works perfect Poems. For proofe of which Truth; wee will first mention two or three of the best of them; and to omit the multiplicity of lesse autentike testimonies, that all Authors are full of, alledge only the beforecited Mirandula , who speaking of that- Magia naturalis , or naturall wisdome, or as he defines it  30 exacta & absoluta cognitio omnium rerum natur alium -the exact and absolute knowledge of all naturall things (which the Auncients were Masters of) sayes, 31 that in that Art (among some others he mentions) Pr aestitit Homerus , Homer excelled; and who- vt omnes alias sapientias, ita hanc quoq; sub sui Vlyxis erroribus dissimulauit -as all other knowledge;, so hath hiddenly layd downe this also in his Ulysses his trauailes. As likewise of Orpheus 32 Nihil efficacius Hymnis Orphei in naturali Magia, si debita musica, animi intentio, & coeterae circumstantiae quas norunt sapientes fuerint adhibitae : There is nothing of greater efficacy than the hymnes of Orpheus in naturall Magick, if the fitting musick, intention of the minde, and other circumstances which are knowne to the wise, bee considered and applyed. And againe  33 \- that they are of no lesse power in naturall magick , or to the vnderstanding thereof, than the Psalmes of Dauid are in the Caball , or to vnderstand the Cabalistick Science by. And lastly, Zoroaster ; who that he was a possessor likewise of that- absoluta cognitio rerum Naturalium before metioned, no lesse than of that Theologicall Philosophy his expounders find in him, may appeare by that Doctrine of his (in particular) of the- Scala a Tartaro ad primum ignem , which the learned Io: Picus interprets  34 \- Seriem naturarum vniuersi a non gradu materiae, ad eum qui est super omnem gradum graduate protensum -the series or concatenation of the vniuersall Natures, from a no degree (as he speakes) of matter, to him that is aboue or beyond all degree graduately extended; no lesse than by that Attribute (in generall) giuen him by all the learned of all Ages; viz : that he was one of the greatest (as first) of Naturall Magicians, or Masters of the absolute knowledge of all Nature. To omit (as I said) the Testimonies of an infinity of other Authors in confirmation of the before-affirmed troth; who knowes not, that most, if not all of those fables in all the rest of the Auncients, of their gods and goddesses especially, with the affinities, entercourses, and commerces betweene themselues, and with others; (of which, as Homer , that Greeke Oracle is abudantly full, so the rest, as a Hesiod, Linus the Master, and Mus aeus the Scoller of Orpheus , and (as we haue said) Zoroaster , and Orpheus himselfe, and all those most auncient, (if we may beleeue their best expounders and relaters of most we haue of them) made the maine grounds and Subjects of their writings;) who knowes not (I say) that most, if not all, of those their fables of this kinde, and which haue of all learned, in all ages, been chiefely tearmed Poetick,  & fittest matter for Poesy; haue neuer been by any wise expounder made to meane other than meerely the Generation of the Elements, with their Vertues, and Changes; the Courses of the Starres, with their Powers, and Influences; and all the most important Secrets of Nature, hanging necessarily vpon the knowledge of These; which could not suffer so simple a Relation as the Ethick doctrine requires; because by the vulgarity of Those, much mischiefe must in all reason ensue; being (also) of those tenderer things, that are soonest prophaned & vilefied by their cheapnesse; & This, cannot for the generall benefit of mankinde be among the plainest of lessons too commonly knowne and openly diuulged to euery body. I will not deny but the Auncients mingled much doctrine of Morality (yea, high Diuinity also) with their Naturall Philosophy; as the late mentioned Zoroaster first; who hath diuinely sung of the Essence and attributes of God. and was (as the learned Farra auouches)  35 \- the first Author of that Religious Philosophy, or Philosophicall Religion, that was after followed & amplified by Mercurius Trismegistus, Orpheus, Aglaophemus, Pythagoras, Eudoxus, Socrates, Plato, &c . And Orpheus next; who, as he writt particular bookes; of Astrology, first (as Lucian 36 tells vs) of any man; as also of diseases and their cures; of the natures and qualities of the Elements; of the force of Loue or agreemet in Naturall things; and many more that we read of, besides his Hymnes which are perhaps the greatest part of what now remaines of him heere among vs: so his expounders likewise find in him that Theologia Philosophica as they call it, which they giue to Zoroaster . Witnesse Pausanias , who reports  37 \- Orpheus multa human ae politic aeque vitae vtilia inuenit: & vniuersam Theologiam primus aperuit, & nefariorum facirorum expiationes excogitauit, &c. But let vs heare how himselfe  38 sings; and which is by Eusebius Pamphilus , in his honour rehearsed  39 . O you that vertue follow, to my sense Bend your attentiue minds: Prophane ones hence. And thou Mus aeus, who alone the shine Highly contemplat'st of the formes diuine, Learne my notes; which with thinward eye behold, And vntouch'd in thy sacred bosome hold. Incline thee by my safe-aduizing verse To the high Author of this Vniuerse. One only, all immortall, such is he; Whose Being I discouer thus to thee; This alone-perfect, this eternall King Rais'd aboue all, created eu'ry thing, And all things gouernes. with the Spirit alone (Not otherwise) to be beheld, or knowne. From him no ill springs. there's no god but he. Thinke now, and looke about thee prudently; And better to discouer him, loe I His tracts and footsteps vpon earth, and high Strong hand behold, but canot him descrie; Who (to an vnimaginable height Rais'd) in darke clouds conceals him from my sight. Only a Caldean 40 saw him; and the grace Hath now aloft to view him face to face. His sacred right hand graspes the Ocean; and Touch'd with it, the proud mountaines trembling stand Eu'n from the deep rootes to their vtmost height: Nor feeles at all th'immensnesse of their weight, He, who aboue the heau'n doth dwell, yet guides And gouernes all that vnder heau'n abides. O're all, through all doth his vast power extend; Of th'Vniuerse beginning, midds, & end. And as these two diuine Authors in particular, so likewise among the rest of the Auncient Poets in generall, I will graunt they haue in their Poesies (as I haue said) mingled much Morality with their Ethick doctrines. As in their Hercules, Theseus, Vlysses, Æneas , and other their Heroes they haue giuen example of all vertues; and punisht all vices; as pride and ambition, in their Giants and Titanes, &c . Contempt of the gods, in their Niobe, Arachne, Casseiope, Medusa, Amphion, Marsyas , the Mineides, &c. murder, lust, couetise, and the rest, in their Lycaon, Ixion, Sisyphus, Midas, Tantalus, Titius, &c . Yet questionlesse infinite many more of their fables than these, (though euen these and the rest of this kind want not among our best Mythologians their Physick, as well as Ethick meanings,) as all those of their gods and goddesses, with their powers and dignities, and all passage of affinity and commerce betweene themselues, and betweene them and others, were (as I haue said before) made to meane meere matter of Nature; and in no possibility of Sense to bee wrested to the doctrine of Manners, vnlesse a man will (withall) bee so inhumane as to allow all those riotts, rapes, murders, adulteries, incestes, and those nefaria and nefanda , vnnaturally-seeming vices that they tell of them, to bee (litterally or Morally taken) fit examples of Manners, or wholesome instructions for the liues of men to be leuelled and directed by. Whereas, on the contrary side, (that I may instance some of them) who can make that Rape of Proserpine , whom her mother Ceres (that vnder the Species of Corne might include as well the whole Genus of the Vegetable nature) sought so long for in the earth, to meane other, than the putrefaction, and succeeding generation of the Seedes we commit to Pluto , or the earth? whome they make the God of wealth, calling him also Dis quasi diues (the same in Latine that Pluto is in Greeke) rich, or wealthy, because all things haue their originall from the earth, and returne to the earth againe. Or what can Iupiters blasting of his beloued Semele , after his hauing defloured her, and the wrapping of his sonne he got on her ( Bacchus , or wine) in his thigh after his production, meane other than the necessity of the Ayres heate to his birth, in the generation; and (after a violent pressure and dilaceration of his mother the Grape) the like close imprisoning of him also, in a fit vessell, till he gaine his full maturity, and come to be fit aliment? After these two particular scandalous fables, and which I will call but inferiour speculations, yet necessary documents, because, of the Natures of Corne, and Wine, the Sustentacula vit ae ; (To omit the Adultery of Mars and Venus , by which the Chymists will haue meant the inseperability of those two Metals that carry their names; witnesse that exuberance of Uenus -or copper which wee call Vitriole , that is seldome or neuer found without some mixture more or lesse of Mars or iron in it; as her husband Uulcan , or materiall fire findes and shewes the practitioners in Chymistry. And with this, other also of the like obuiouser kinde of truths in Nature; as Hebe's stumbling and falling with the Nectar bowle in her hand, and thereby discouering her hidden parts to the gods, as she serued them at their boord; meaning the nakednesse of the trees and plants in Autumne, when all their leaues are falne from them by the downefall or departure of the Spring , which their Hebe , or goddesse of youth as the Auncients called her (because the Spring renewes and makes young all things) meanes. And with these, the Inceste of Mirrha with her father; meaning the Myrrh-tree, which the Sun (father of Plants) inflames, and making ouertures in it, there flowes thance that odorous Sab aean gumme wee call Myrrhe, (meant by her child Adonis , which interpreted is sweet, pleasant, or delightfull.) To omit (I say) these, and the like triuialler (though true) obseruations in Nature; and that carry also so foule a face to the eye; I would aske who can make those fights and contentions that the wise Homer faignes betweene his Gods and Goddesses to meane other than the naturall Contrariety of the Elements: and especially of the Fire and Water; which as they are tempered and reconciled by the aire, so Iuno (which signifies the  aeery region) reconciles, & accords the warring Gods and next, what in generall those frequent, and no lesse scandalous brawles betweene Iupiter and (his wife and sister) Iuno , can be made to meane other, than those Meteors occasioned by the vpper and lower Region of the Ayres differing temperatures; Or what all those his vnlawfull loues, his compressing so many Dryads, Nayads , and Nereiads (woodnymphes, and waternymphes) and the rest, can meane other than meerely the Fires power vpon the Earth, and waters; (a study of a higher nature and vaster extente than the first alledged) and which Iupiters Inceste with his sister Ceres likewise meanes; and is the same with the tale of the contention of Pha eton which is Incendium , with the sonne of Isis which is Terra . A Theame too infinite to pursue; and no lesse a fault heere, than (perhaps) a folly at all to mencion: For (besides the beeing a subiect vtterly vnfit to suffer a mixture with a discourse of so light a nature as this of mine, where a slight touch at the generall mistake and abuse of Poesy in our times, was only intended) suppose a man should (whereas I haue heere layd downe the faire sense of but two or three of the foulest of them) be at the paines of running through all the Fables of the Auncients, and out of them shew the reader, and leade him by the fingar as it were (who yet can discouer nothing but matter of Manners in them) to the speculation of the entire Secret of our great God of Nature, in his miraculous fabrick of this World, (which, their god Pan , or the vniuersall simple bodyes, and seedes of all Nature, gotten by Mercury or the diuine Will, by which all things came to bee created, meanes;) And (beginning with Moses ) shew him how the Spirit of God first moouing vpon the waters (a Mystery perhaps by few of our duller Modernes vnderstood, though a Thales Milesius , or Heraclius the Ephesian, two Heathans, could instruct them) they faigne him vnder the name of Iupiter , by compressing Latona (meaning the shades or darkenesse of the first Ch aos ) to haue begot on her, Apollo and Diana , which is the Sun and Moone, when he said- fiat lux, & lux fuit , and carry him along from this beginning to the end and compleate knowledge of all Nature, which as Moses darkely, they no lesse darkely deliuered;) Suppose (I say) a man should take this taske vpon him, I would faine know who they are that would be perhaps, at least, that were, fit readers now a dayes of such a Treatise? Because what one of a million of our Scollers or writers among vs, vnderstands, or cares to be made vnderstand scarse the lowest and triuiallest of Natures wayes? much lesse seekes to draw (by wisely obseruing her higher and more hidden workings) any profitabler vse or benefit from them, for their owne, or the publike good, than perhaps to make an Almanack, or a diuing-bote to take butts or crabs vnder water with; or else some Douch water-bellowes, by rarefying water into a comprest ayre to blow the fire withall? Whenas if they could, but from that poore step, learne the way to get a little higher vp the right scale of Nature, and really indeed accord, and make a firme peace and agreement betweene all the discordant Elements; and (as the Fable of Cupids wrassle with Pan , and ouercomming him, teaches them the beginning of all Natures productions are loue and strife,) indeauour to irritate also, and force this Pan , or Simple Matter of things, to his fit procreatiue ability, by an industrious and wise strife and colluctation with him; than they might perhaps do somewhat in Philosophy not vnworth the talking of. No lesse than our common practitioners in Physick might better deserue their names than most of them do; (for to be a Physitian, what is it but to be a generall Naturalist, not meere transcriber and applyer of particular booke- recipes ?) if they would but practise, by that Rule and Base of Nature the world was built vpon, to make likewise and establish that Equality and concord betweene those warring Elements (which are the Complexions) in Mans body, that one exceed not an other in their Qualities: Or if they could but giue better instance of their acquaintance with the wayes of Phylosophy, than in burdning and oppressing nature, rather than otherwise, as most of them doe, with their crude Vegetable and Minerall Physicks, for not vnderstanding the necessity, (or though they did, yet not the Art) of exalting and bettering their natures, by correcting or remoouing their in-bred imperfections, with that fit preparation that Nature teaches them. The hidden workings of which wise mistresse, could wee fully in all her wayes comprehend, how much would it cleare, and how infinitely ennoble our blind and groueling conditions, by exalting our vnderstandings to the sight (as I haue before toucht) of God, or- those inuisible things of God (to vse S. Pauls words once againe) which are cleerely seene, being vnderstood by the things that are made ; and thance instructing vs, not sawcily to leap, but by the linkes of that golden chaine of Homer , that reaches from the foote of Iupiters throne to the Earthe, more knowingly, and consesequently more humbly climbe vp to him, who ought to bee indeed the only end and period of all our knowledge, and vnderstanding the which in vs though but a small fainte beame of that our great blessed Sun , yet is that breath of life that he breathed into vs, to draw vs thereby ( fecisti nos Domine propter te ; sayes the holy S. Augustine )  41 neerer to him, than all irrationall Animalls of his making; as a no lesse tenderly louing Father, than immense and omnipotent Creator. To whom as wee cannot giue too much loue and reuerence; so neither can wee with too wary hands approach his sacred Mysteries in Holy Writ. Howbeit I must (to returne home to my former discourse) in honour  & iust praise of the before mentioned wise Auncients (and with the premised befitting caution) not doubt to say, that as his Instructions in the holy Scripture, and especially in the old Law, must of necessity reach as far farther than the bare historicall trueth (though not in the same manner) as extends the difference in our selues betweene Nature alone, and Nature and Grace vnited; so likewise, that one, and a great portion of the doctrine of that part of holy Writ, the wise Ethnicks vndoubtedly possest in all perfection; to wit, the knowledge of all Natures most high and hidden wayes and workings: and though far short in the safer part of wisdome, of their more inlightned successors, yet was the bare light (or rather fire) of nature in them, enough to draw the as high as Reason could help flesh and bloud to reach heauen with. Nay which is more, were it not wide of my purpose (though it contradicts it not) to conster them other than meere children of Nature, I might perhaps gaine fauour of some of our weaker persuaders in their spirituall Cures (if to flanke and strengthan the diuine letter with prophaner Authorities, be in this backward and incredulous age, not irrequisite) by paralelling in the Historicall part I meane chiefely, and as it lies, the Sacred letter and Ethnick Poesyes together to a large extention: And beginning with Moses , shew them, all those- dij maiorum gentium from Saturne to Deucalions deluge, were but names for Adam, Caine, Lamech and the rest of their successors to Noahs floud: Nor that their Rh aea (or Terra , mother of all the Gods) and Uenus , could be other than Moses his Eua and Noema . What other can Hesiod's 42 Pandora-the first and beautifullest of all women, by whome all euils were dispersed and spred vpon the Earth , meane than Moses his Eue ? What can Homers Ate , whom he calls  43 the first daughter of Iupiter , and a woman pernicious and harmefull to all vs mortalls; and in an other place tells how the wisest of men was cosened and deceiued by his wife; what can he I say, meane in these women but Eue ? What was the Poets Bacchus but his Noah , or Noachus , first corrupted to Boachus , and after, by remoouing a letter, to Bacchus ; who, (as Moses tels vs of Noah ,) was the first likewise in their accompt, that planted the vine, and taught men the vse of wines soone after the vniuersall deluge? What can be plainer than that by their Ianus they ment Noah also, whome they giue two faces to, for hauing seene both the old and new world; and which, his name (in Hebrew, Iain , or wine) likewise confirmes; Noah being (as we late alledged Moses for witnesse) the first inuentor of the vse of wines? What could they meane by their Golden-Age , when--- Nulli subigebant arua coloni; \------ Ipsaque tellus Omnia liberius, nullo poscente ferebat; But the state of Man before his Sin? and consequently by their Iron age, but the worlds infelicity, and miseries that succeeded his fall? when--- Luctus, & vltrices posuere cubilia curae; Pallentesque habitant morbi, tristisque senectus, Et metus, & malesuada fames, & turpis egestas. Lastly, (for I haue too much already exceeded my commission) what can Adonis horti among the Poets meane other than Moses his Eden , or terrestriall Paradise? the Hebrew Eden being Voluptas or Deliti ae , whence the Greeke ![](/images/inline/rbeegr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/eeacgr.gif)  (or pleasure) seemes necessarily deriued: The Cald aeans and Persians (so I am tould) called it Pardeis , the Greeks, ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , the Latines altered the Greeke name to Paradisus : which as Eden , is (as,  44 Aulus Gellius defines it) Locus am aenissimus, & voluptatis plenissimus ; the which selfe thing the auncient both Poets and Philosophers certainly ment by their- horti Hesperidum likewise. Now though we reuerence Moses more (as we ought to doe) than these his condisciples, because inspired so far aboue them with the immediate spirit of Almighty God; yet ought we neuerthelesse to reuerence them, and the wisdome of their fables, howeuer not vnderstood by euery body: his condisciples I call them, because they read bothe vnder their Æ gyptian teachers one lesson; & were (as Moses of himselfe sayes) expert in the learning of the Æ gyptians : yea many of them (and Poets all) were (to speake fitlyer) the teachers of that Learning themselues, and Masters therein no lesse than Moses . How can We than indeed attribute too much to their knowledges, though deliuered out of wise consideration in riddles and fictious tales? But alas (with shame enough may we speake it) so far are we now adayes from giuing the due to them they deserue, as those their learned and excellent fables seeme rather read to be abused, than studyed in these times; and euen by people too that are, or would be accompted profound men. What child of learning or louer of Truth could abide to see great pretenders to learning among vs, that doubt, and obstinately too, whether the pretious treasure of that wisdome of the Auncients, so carefully by them left sealed vp to the vse of their true Heires (the wise and worthy of their posterity) be any more indeed than a legacy of meere old wiues tales to poyson the world with. If we will call this but ignorance, let vs go farther; and suppose that a man (nor vnlearned one neither) shall haue taken paines in foure or fiue fables of the Auncients to vnfould and deliuer vs much doctrine and high meanings in them, which he calls their wisdome; and yet the same man in another Treatise of his, shall say of those auncient Fables.- I thinke they were first made, and their expositions deuised afterward : and a little after- Of Homer himselfe, notwithstanding he was made a kind of Scripture by the latter Scooles of the Gr aecians, yet I should without any difficulty pronounce his fables had in his owne meaning no such inwardnesse, &c . What shall we make of such willing contradictios, when a man to vent a few fancies of his owne, shall tell vs first, they are the wisdome of the Auncients; and next, that those Auncient fables were but meere fables, and without wisdom or meaning, til their expositours gaue them a meaning; & than, scornefully and contemptuously (as if all Poetry were but Play-vanity) shut vp that discourse of his of Poetry, with- It is not good to stay too long in the Theater . But let me not stick too long neither in this myre; nor seeme ouer-sensible of wrong to what can suffer none; for- Veritas (sayes the holy writ) magna est, & praeualebit : and such are (nor lesse great and preuailing than truth it selfe) those before mentioned Arcana of our wise Auncients; which no Barbarisme I know can efface; nor all the dampes and thick fogs by dull  & durty Ignorance breathed on them, darken at all, or hide from the quick eye of select and happier vnderstandings; who know full well, the ripest friutes of knowledge grow euer highest; while the lower-hanging boughs (for euery ones gripe) are either barren, or their fruite too sowre to be worth the gathering. And among such may they euer rest, safe wrapt vp in their huskes, and inuoluements: And let our writers write (if it can bee no better) and Rimers rime still after their accustomed and most accepted manner, and still captiuate and rauish their like hearers. Though in my owne inclination, I could with much iuster alacrety, than in person of the Roman Poet, with his- Uilia miretur vulgus ; or Roman Orator, with his- Similes habent sua labra lactucas (while he laught to see a greedy Asse at his sutable thissles,) wish we might each one, according to the measure of his illumination, and by the direction of Gods two great bookes, that of his law first, and that of the Creature next, (wherein, to vse the excellent Io: Picus his phrase  45 \- leguntur magnalia Dei -the wonderfull things of God are read) run on together in a safe and firme rode of Trueth: to the end that vindicating some part of our lost Heritage and Beatitude heere, we may thance (an aduantage the holy Maximus Tyrius 46 sayes the more happy spirits haue ouer others) arriue the lesse Aliens and strangers in the Land of our eternall Heritage, and Beatitude heereafter. The before-written Treatise of the dignity of the ould Poets and their Poesies, falling into the view of some not iniudicious eyes; Among them, there arose question, how it could be, that Plato , so great a louer and honorer of the Auncient Poets in generall, and of Homer (one of the best of them) in particular; should exclude and banish him neuerthelesse out of his Common- wealth : To which is easily and briefely answered, that, as there is no Citty, corporation, or common-wealth in the world, but differs from all others, if not in all, at least in some particular lawes, institutions, or customes; so, most reasonable is it, that such a Common-wealth as Plato formes, should more than any other, be differing from all others, in new Lawes, rules, and institutions: His intention being to frame an assembly of men, or republike, which consisting onely of Reason, was rather the Id aea of what a perfect common-wealth should be, than as eyther being, or easy or possible to bee put into Act. Hee formes all his Cittizens, diuine, heroique, and perfectly Philosophick and wise spirits, and such as are already arriued to the summe of all intellectuall height, and perfection of vertue and Sapience; And therefore can haue no need of a Homer or his instructions, to shew them the way to bee, or make them what they are already made: In all other Common-wealthes, the case is differing; where Homers, Hesiods, Orpheusses , and those Fathers of knowledge and learning, are euer necessary, to allure with the sweetnesse and pleasure of their fictions, the mindes of men to the loue and knowledge of vertue and wisdome: So as, out of this respect meerly, and not that he was at all the lesse worthy of honour and admiration, (in his fit place of vse) was Homer exempt, and shut out from Plato's imaginary assembly, and excellent republike. And therefore I will conclude with Maximus Tyrius , who sayes (as Farra Alexandrinus obserues  47 )- We ought to give honour to Plato; but yet so, as we rob not the great Homer, nor scante him of his due and deserued prayses. FINIS.
