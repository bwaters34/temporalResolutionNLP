Shewing the wholesome Uses drawn from recording the Atchievements of those wonderful Productions of Nature called Great Men . which are laid, conducted, and brought to Perfection by the utmost Force of human Invention and Art, should be managed by great and eminent Men, so the Lives of such may be justly and properly styled the Quintessence of History.  In these, when delivered to us by sensible Writers, we are not only most agreeably entertained, but usefully instructed; for besides the attaining hence a consummate Knowledge of human Nature in general; its secret Springs, various Windings, and perplexed Mazes; we have here before our Eyes, lively Examples of whatever is amiable or detestable, worthy of Admiration or Abhorrence, and are consequently taught in a Manner infinitely more effectual than by Precept, what we are eagerly to imitate or carefully to avoid. Picture, the true Beauty of Virtue, and Deformity of Vice, we may moreover learn from Plutarch, Nepos, Suetonius, and other Biographers this useful Lesson, not too hastily nor in the Gross to bestow either our Praise or Censure:  Since we shall often find such a Mixture of Good and Evil in the same Character, that it may require a very accurate Judgment and elaborate Inquiry to determine which Side the Ballance turns: for tho' we sometimes meet with an Aristides or a Brutus, a Lysander or a Nero, yet far the greater Number are of the mixt Kind; neither totally good nor bad; their greatest Virtues being obscured and allayed by their Vices, and those again softened and coloured over by their Virtues. undertake; who, as he was embellished with many of the greatest and noblest Endowments, so these could not well be said to be absolutely pure and without Allay. If we view one Side of his Character only, he must be acknowledged equal, if not superior to most of the Heroes of Antiquity: But if we turn the Reverse, it must be confessed our Admiration will be a little abated, and his Character will savour rather of the Weakness of modern than the uniform Greatness of ancient Heroes. or consummate Pattern of human Virtue; but rather by faithfully recording the little Imperfections which somewhat darkened the Lustre of his great Qualities, to teach the Lesson we have above mentioned, and induce our Reader with us to lament the Frailty of human Nature, and to convince him that no Mortal, after a thorough Scrutiny, can be a proper Object of our Adoration. Errors of Opinion which Mankind have by the Disingenuity of Writers contracted: For those from their Fear of attacking or contradicting the obsolete Doctrines of a Set of simple Fellows called, in Derision, Sages or Philosophers, have endeavoured as much as possible, to confound the Ideas of Greatness and Goodness, whereas no two Things can possibly be more distinct from each other.  For Greatness consists in bringing all Manner of Mischief on Mankind, and Goodness in removing it from them.  Now, tho' the Writer, if he will confine himself to Truth, is obliged to draw a perfect Picture of the former in all the Actions which he records of his Hero, yet to reconcile his Work with those absurd Doctrines abovementioned, he is ever guilty of interspersing Reflections in Reality to the Disadvantage of that great Perfection, Uniformity of Character; for Instance, in the Histories of Alexander and C aesar, we are frequently reminded of their Benevolence and Generosity. When the former had with Fire and Sword overrun a whole Empire, and destroyed the Lives of Millions of innocent People, we are told as an Example of his Benevolence, that he did not cut the Throat of an old Woman, and ravish her Daughters whom he had before undone:  And when the mighty C aesar had with wonderful Greatness of Mind destroyed the Liberties of his Country, and gotten all the Power into his own Hands, we receive, as an Evidence of his Generosity, his Largesses to his Followers and Tools, by whose Means he had accomplished his Purpose, and by whose Assistance he was to establish it. be bewailed as Imperfections than admired as Ornaments in those Great Men, rather obscuring their Glory and holding them back in their Race to Greatness, and unworthy the End for which they seem to have come into the World, viz. of perpetrating vast and mighty Mischief? confounding Ideas in the following Pages, in which, as we are to record the Actions of a Great Man, so we have no where mentioned any spark of Goodness which hath discovered itself either faintly in him, or more glaringly in any other Person, but as a Meanness and Imperfection, disqualifying them for Undertakings which lead to Honour and Esteem among Men. indeed only enough to make him Partaker of the Imperfection of Humanity, and not the Perfection of D aemonism, we have ventured to call him the Great ; nor do we doubt but our Reader will, when he hath perused his Story, concur with us in allowing him that Title. Giving an Account of as many of our Hero's Ancestors as can be gathered out of the Rubbish of Antiquity, which hath been carefully sifted for that Purpose. Method of spelling his Name) was descended from the Great Wolfstan Wild, who came over with Hengist, and distinguished himself very eminently at that famous Festival where the Britons were so treacherously murdered by the Saxons ; for when the Word was given, i. e. Nemet eour Saxes, Take out your Swords, this Gentleman being a little hard of hearing, mistook the Sound for Nemet her Sacs, Take out their Purses ; instead therefore of applying to the Throat, he immediately applied to the Pocket of his Guest, and contented himself with taking all that he had, without attempting his Life. surnamed Langfanger or Longfinger . He flourished in the Reign of Henry III. and was strictly attached to Hubert de Burgh, whose Friendship he was recommended to by his great Excellence in an Art, of which Hubert was himself the Inventor: He could, without the Knowledge of the Proprietor, with great Ease and Dexterity draw forth a Man's Purse from any Part of his Garment where it was deposited, and hence he derived his Surname. This Gentleman was the first of his Family who had the Honour to suffer for the Good of his Country: On whom a Wit of that Time made the following Epitaph.  O Shame o'Justice, Wild is hang'd, For that'n hath a Pocket fang'd, While safe old Hubert, and his Gang, Doth the Pocket of the Nation fang. the Art for which he himself was so famous. This Edward served as a Voluntier under the famous Sir John Falstaffe, and by his gallant Demeanor so recommended himself to his Captain, that he would have certainly been promoted by him, had Harry the Fifth kept his Word with his old Companion. the Reign of Charles the First, when James Wild distinguished himself on both Sides the Question in the Civil Wars, passing from one to t'other, as Heaven seemed to declare itself in Favour of either Party.  At the End of the Wars, James, not being rewarded according to his Merits, as is usually the Case of such impartial Persons, he associated himself with a brave Man of those Times, whose Name was Hind, and declared open War with both Parties.  He was successful in several Actions, and spoiled many of the Enemy; till at length, being over-powered and taken, he was, contrary to the Law of Arms, put basely and cowardly to death, by a Combination between twelve Men of the Enemy's Party, who after some Consultation unanimously agreed on the said Murder. John Hind Esq; by whom he had Issue John, Edward, Thomas and Jonathan, and three Daughters, namely, Grace, Charity and Honour . John followed the Fortunes of his Father, and suffering with him, left no Issue. Edward was so remarkable for his compassionate Temper, that he spent his Life in soliciting the Causes of the distressed Captives in Newgate, and is reported to have held a strict Friendship with an eminent Divine, who solicited the spiritual Causes of the said Captives.  He married Editha Daughter and Coheiress of Geoffry Snap Gent. who long enjoyed an Office under the High Sheriff of London and Middlesex, by which with great Reputation he acquired a handsome Fortune; by her he had no Issue. Thomas went very young abroad to one of our American Colonies, and hath not been since heard of. As for the Daughters, Grace was married to a Gentleman of Yorkshire, who dealt in Horses. Charity took to Husband an eminent Broker of Change-Alley : And Honour the youngest, died unmarried. She lived many Years in this Town, was a great frequenter of Plays, and used to be remarkable for distributing Oranges to all who would accept of them. Jonathan married Elizabeth Daughter of Ralph Hollow Esq; and by her had Jonathan, who is the illustrious Subject of these Memoirs. The Birth, Parentage, and Education of Mr. Jonathan Wild the Great. act a notable Part on the Stage of Life, but she gives some Warning of her Intention; and as the dramatic Poet generally prepares the Entry of every considerable Character, with a solemn Narrative, or at least a great Flourish of Drums and Trumpets; so doth this our Alma Mater by some shrewd Hints, pre-admonish us of her Intention. Thus Astyages, who was the Grandfather of Cyrus, dreamed that his Daughter was brought to Bed of a Vine whose Branches over-spread all Asia ; and Hecuba, while big with Paris, dreamed that she was delivered of a Firebrand that set all Troy in Flames; so did the Mother of our Great Man, while she was with child of him, dream that she was enjoyed in the Night by the Gods Mercury, and Priapus .  This Dream puzzled all the learned Astrologers of her Time, seeming to imply in it a Contradiction; Mercury being the God of Ingenuity, and Priapus the Terror of those who practised it.  What made this Dream the more wonderful, and perhaps the true Cause of its being remembred, was a very extraordinary Circumstance, sufficiently denoting something preter-natural in it; for tho' she had never heard even the Name of either of these Gods, she repeated these very Words in the Morning, with only a small Mistake of the Quantity of the latter, which she chose to call Priapus 1 instead of Priapus ;  2 and her Husband swore that tho' he might possibly have named Mercury to her, for he had heard of such an Heathen God, he never in his Life could have any wise put her in Mind of that other Deity, with whom he had no Acquaintance. constantly longed for every thing she saw; nor could be satisfied with her Wish unless she injoyed it clandestinely; and as Nature by true and accurate Observers is remarked to give us no Appetites without furnishing us with the Means of gratifying them; so had she at this Time a most marvellous glutinous Quality attending her Fingers, to which as to Birdlime, every thing closely adhered that she handled. Superstition, we proceed to the Birth of our Hero, who made his first Appearance on this Great Theatre, the very Day when the Plague first broke out in 1665. Some say his Mother was delivered of him in an House of an orbicular or round Form in Covent-Garden ; but of this we are not certain. He was some Years afterwards baptized by the famous Mr. Titus Oates . Letters Th are the most difficult of Pronunciation, and the last which a Child attains to the Utterance of, so they were the first that came with any Readiness from young Master Wild .  Nor must we omit the early Indications which he gave of the Sweetness of his Temper; for tho' he was by no Means to be terrified into Compliance, yet might he by a Sugar-plumb be brought to your Purpose:  Indeed, to say the Truth, he was to be bribed to any thing, which made many say, he was certainly born to be a Great Man. aspiring Temper; and was regarded by all his School-Fellows with that Deference which Men generally pay to those superior Genius's who will exact it of them. If an Orchard was to be robb'd, Wild was consulted, and tho' he was himself seldom concerned in the Execution of the Design, yet was he always Concerter of it, and Treasurer of the Booty; some little Part of which he would now and then, with wonderful Generosity, bestow on those who took it; he was generally very secret on these Occasions:  But if any offered to plunder of his own Head, without acquainting Master Wild and making a Deposite of the Booty, he was sure to have an Information against him lodged with the School-Master, and to be severely punished for his Pains. was a very wise and worthy Man, soon gave over all Care and Trouble on this Account, and acquainting his Parents that their Son proceeded extremely well in his Studies, he permitted his Pupil to follow his own Inclinations; perceiving they led him to nobler Pursuits than the Sciences, which are generally acknowledged to be a very unprofitable Study, and greatly to hinder the Advancement of Men in the World: But tho' Master Wild was not esteemed the readiest at making his Exercise, he was universally allowed to be the most dextrous at stealing it of all his School-Fellows:  Being never detected in such furtive Compositions, nor indeed in any other Exercitations of his great Talents, which all inclined the same Way, but once, when he had laid violent Hands on a Book called Gradus ad Parnassum i. e. A Step towards Parnassus ; on which Account his Master, who was a Man of most wonderful Wit and Sagacity, is said to have told him, he wished it might not prove in the Event, Gradus ad Patibulum, i. e. A Step towards the Gallows . competent sufficiency in the learned Languages, yet did he readily listen with Attention to others, especially when they translated the Classical Authors to him; nor was he in the least backward at all such Times, to express his Approbation. He was wonderfully pleased with that Passage in the Eleventh Iliad, where Achilles is said to have bound two Sons of Priam upon a Mountain, and afterwards released them for a Sum of Money. This was, he said, alone sufficient to refute those who affected a Contempt for the Wisdom of the Ancients, and an undeniable Testimony of the great Antiquity of ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 3 Priggism . He was ravished with the Account which Nestor gives in the same Book, of the rich Booty which he bore off ( i. e. stole) from the Eleans . He was desirous of having this often repeated to him, and at the End of every Repetition, he constantly fetched a deep Sigh, and said, It was a glorious Booty . generously pitied the unhappy Fate of that Great Man, to whom he thought Hercules much too severe: One of his School-Fellows commending the Dexterity of drawing the Oxen backward by their Tails into his Den, he smiled, and with some Disdain said, He could have taught him a better Way . between whom and the late King of Sweden he would frequently draw Parallels. He was much delighted with the Accounts of the Czar's Retreat from the latter, who carried off the Inhabitants of great Cities to people his own Country. This, he said, was not once thought of by Alexander; but, added, perhaps he did not want them . Happy had it been for him, if he had confined himself to this Sphere; but his chief, if not only Blemish, was that he would sometimes, from an Humility in his Nature, too pernicious to true Greatness, condescend to an Intimacy with inferior Things and Persons.  Thus the Spanish Rogue was his favourite Book, and the Cheats of Scapin his favourite Play. foolish Prejudice to our Universities, and out of a false, as well as excessive Regard to his Morals, brought his Son to Town, where he resided with him till he was of an Age to travel. Whilst he was here, all imaginable Care was taken of his Instruction, his Father endeavouring his utmost to inculcate Principles of Honour and Gentility into his Son. Mr. Wild's first Entrance into the World. His Acquaintance with Count La Ruse . him his whole Labour on this Head, and provided Master Wild a better Tutor than any Care or Expence could have furnished him with. The old Gentleman, it seems, was a Follower of the Fortunes of Mr. Snap, Son of Mr. Geoffry Snap, whom we have before mentioned to have enjoyed a reputable Office under the Sheriff of London and Middlesex, whose Daughter, the Sister of this Gentleman, had inter-married with the Wilds .  Mr. Snap, being thereto well warranted, had laid violent Hands on, or, as the Vulgar express it, arrested one Count La Ruse, a Man of considerable Figure in those Days, and had confined him to his own House, till he could find two Seconds who would in a formal Manner give their Words that the Count should, at a certain Day and Place appointed, answer all that one Thomas Thimble a Taylor had to say to him; which Thomas Thimble, it seems, alledged that the Count had, according to the Law of the Realm, made over his Body to him as a Security for some Suits of Cloaths to him delivered by the said Thomas Thimble .  Now, as the Count, tho' perfectly a Man of Honour, could not immediately find these Seconds, he was obliged for some Time to reside at Mr. Snap's House; for it seems the Law of the Land is, that whoever owes another 10 l. may be on the Oath of that Person, immediately taken up and carried away from his own House and Family, and kept abroad till he is made to owe 50 l. whether he will or no; for which he is, perhaps, afterwards obliged to lie in Gaol; and all this without any Trial had, or any other Evidence of the Debt than the abovesaid Oath, which if untrue, as it often happens, you have no Remedy against the Perjurer; he was, forsooth! mistaken. was obliged) discharge the Count on his Parole; yet did he not (as by the strict Rules of Law he was enabled) confine him to his Chamber. The Count had his Liberty of the whole House, and Mr. Snap using only the Precaution of keeping his Doors well lock'd and barr'd, took his Prisoner's Word that he would not go out. of their Youth and Beauty. These young Ladies, like Damsels in Romance, compassionated the captive Count, and endeavoured by all Means to make his Confinement less irksome to him; which, tho' they were both very beautiful, they could not attain by any other Way so effectually, as by engaging with him at Cards, in which Contentions, as will appear hereafter, the Count was greatly skilful. As Whisk and Swabbers was the Game then in the chief Vogue, they were oblig'd to look for a fourth Person, in order to make up their Parties. Mr. Snap himself would sometimes relax his Mind, from the violent Fatigues of his Employment, by these Recreations; and sometimes a neighbouring young Gentleman, or Lady, came in to their Assistance: But the most frequent Guest was young Master Wild, who had been educated from his Infancy with the Miss Snaps, and was, by all the Neighbours, allotted for the Husband of Miss Tishy, or L aetitia, the younger of the two; for though, being his Cousin- German, she was perhaps, in the Eye of a strict Conscience, somewhat too nearly related to him; yet the old People on both Sides, tho' sufficiently scrupulous in nice Matters, agreed to overlook this Objection. was therefore no Wonder that the Count soon conceived an Inclination to an Intimacy with our young Hero, whose vast Abilities could not be concealed from one of the Count's Discernment; for though this latter was so expert at his Cards, that he was proverbially said, to play the whole Game, he was no Match for Master Wild, who, inexperienced as he was, notwithstanding all the Art, the Dexterity, and often the Fortune of his Adversary, never failed to send him away from the Table with less in his Pocket than he brought to it; for indeed Langfanger himself could not have extracted a Purse with more Ingenuity than our young Hero. had entertained any Suspicion of him, imputing the several Losses he sustained rather to the innocent and sprightly Frolick of Miss Doshy, with which, as she indulged him with little innocent Freedoms about her Person in Return, he thought himself obliged to be contented; but one Night, when Wild imagined the Count asleep, he made so unguarded an Attack upon him, that the other caught him in the Fact:  However, he did not think proper to acquaint him with the Discovery he had made; but, preventing him from any Booty at that Time, he only took Care for the future to button his Pockets, and pack the Cards with double Industry. So far was this Detection from causing any Quarrel between these two Prigs, that these and many other such Instances of his Ingenuity, operated so violently on the Count, that, notwithstanding the Disparity which Age, Title, and above all Dress, had set between them, he resolved to enter into an Acquaintance, which soon produced a perfect Intimacy, and that a Friendship which had a longer Duration than is common to that Passion between Persons, who only propose to themselves the common Advantage of eating, drinking, whoring, or borrowing Money; which Ends as they soon fail, so doth the Friendship founded upon them. A Dialogue between young Master Wild and Count La Ruse, which, having extended to the Rejoinder, had a very quiet, easy, and natural Conclusion. addressed himself to young Wild : "You cannot, I apprehend, Mr. Wild, be such a Stranger to your own great Capacity, as to be surprized when I tell you, I have often viewed, with a Mixture of Astonishment and Concern, your shining Qualities confined to a Sphere, where they can never reach the Eyes of those who would introduce them properly into the World, and raise you to an Eminence, where you may blaze out to the Admiration of all Men.  I assure you I am pleased with my Captivity, when I reflect, I am likely to owe to it an Acquaintance, and I hope Friendship, with the greatest Genius of my Age; and, what is still more, when I indulge my Vanity with a Prospect of drawing from Obscurity (pardon the Expression) such Talents as were, I believe, never before like to have been buried in it; for I make no Question, but, at my Discharge from Confinement, which will now soon happen, I shall be able to introduce you into Company, where you may reap the Advantage of your superior Parts. "I will bring you acquainted, Sir, with those, who, as they are capable of setting a true Value on such Qualifications, so they will have it both in their Power and Inclination to prefer you for them. Such an Introduction is the only Advantage you want, without which your Merit might be your Misfortune; for those Abilities which would entitle you to Honour and Profit in a superior Station, may render you only obnoxious to Danger and Disgrace in a lower." as well for the overvalue you have set on my small Abilities, as the Kindness you express in offering to introduce me among my Superiours. I must own, my Father hath often persuaded me to push myself into the Company of my betters; but to say the Truth, I have an aukward Pride in my Nature, which is better pleased with being at the Head of the lowest Class, than at the bottom of the highest. Permit me to say, tho' the Idea may be somewhat coarse, I had rather stand on the Summit of a Dunghil, than at the bottom of a Hill in Paradise; I have always thought it signifies little into what Rank of Life I am thrown, provided I make a great Figure therein; and should be as well satisfied with exerting my Talents well at the Head of a small Party or Gang, as in the Command of a mighty Army; for I am far from agreeing with you, that great Parts are often buried in Oblivion; on the contrary, I am convinced it is impossible they should be so.  I have often persuaded myself that there were not fewer than a thousand in Alexander's Troops capable of performing what Alexander himself did. " But because such Spirits were not elected or destined to an Imperial Command, are we therefore to imagine they came off without a Booty? Or that they contented themselves with the Share in common with their Comrades? Surely no. In Civil Life, doubtless, the same Genius, the same Inducements have often composed the Statesman and the Prig, for so we call what the Vulgar name a Thief . The same Parts, the same Actions often promote Men to the Head of superior Societies, which raise them to the Head of lower; and where is the essential Difference if the one ends on Tower-Hill, and the other at Tyburn ? Hath the Block any Preference to the Gallows, or the Ax to the Halter, but what is given them by the ill-guided Judgment of Men?  You will pardon me therefore if I am not so hastily enflamed with the common Out-side of things, nor join the general Opinion in preferring one State to another.  A Guinea is as valuable in a Leathern as in an embroidered Purse; and a Codshead is a Codshead still, whether in a Pewter or a Silver Dish." Idea of your Capacity; but confirms my Opinion of the ill Effects of bad and low Company. Can any Man doubt, whether it is better to be a prime Minister, or a common Thief? I have often heard that the Devil used to say, where, or to whom, I know not, that it was better to reign in Hell, than be a Valet de Chambre in Heaven, and perhaps he was in the right; but sure if he had had the Choice of both, he would have chosen better. The Truth therefore is, that, by low Conversation, we contract a greater Awe for high Things than they deserve. We decline great Pursuits not from Contempt, but Despair.  The Man who prefers the Highroad to a more reputable Way of making his Fortune, doth it because he imagines the one easier than the other:  But you yourself have asserted, and with undoubted Truth, that the same Abilities qualify you for undertaking, and the same Means will bring you to your End in both Journies; as, in Musick, it is the same Tune whether you play it in a higher or a lower Key. To instance in some Particulars: Is it not the same Qualification which enables this Man to hire himself as a Servant, and get into the Confidence and Secrets of his Master, in order to rob him, and that to undertake Trusts of the highest Nature with a Design to break and betray them? Is it less difficult, by false Tokens, to deceive a Shopkeeper into the Delivery of his Goods, which you afterwards run away with, than to impose upon him by outward Splendour and the Appearance of Fortune, into a Credit, by which you gain, and he loses twenty times as much.  Doth it not require more Dexterity in the Fingers to draw out a Man's Purse from his Pocket, or to take a Lady's Watch from her Side, without being perceived of any, an Excellence in which, without Flattery, I am persuaded you have no Superior, than to cog a Die, or shuffle a Pack of Cards?  Is not as much Art, as many excellent Qualities, required to make a pimping Porter at a common Bawdy-House, as would enable a Man to prostitute his own or his Friend's Wife or Child? Doth it not ask as good a Memory, as nimble an Invention, as steady a Countenance, to forswear yourself in Westminster- Hall, as would furnish out a complete Ministerial Tool, or perhaps a prime Minister himself? It is needless to particularize every Instance; in all we shall find, that there is a nearer Connection between high and low Life than is generally imagined, and that a Highwayman is entitled to more Favour with the Great than he usually meets with. If therefore, as I think I have proved, the same Parts which qualify a Man for Eminence in a low Sphere, qualify him likewise for Eminence in a higher, sure it can be no Doubt in which he should chuse to exert them.  Ambition, without which no one can be a great Man, will immediately instruct him, in your own Phrase, to prefer a Hill in Paradise to a Dunghil; nay, even Fear, a Passion the most repugnant to Greatness, will shew him how much more safely he may indulge himself in the full and free Exertion of his mighty Abilities in the higher, than the lower Rank:  Since Experience teaches him, that there is a Crowd oftner in one Year at Tyburn, than on Tower-Hill in a Century." Mr. Wild rejoined: That same Capacity which qualifies a  a 4 Mill-hen, a  b 5 Bridle-cull, or a  c 6 Buttock and File, to arrive at any Degree of Eminence in his Profession, would likewise raise a Man in what the World esteem a more honourable Calling, I do not deny; nay, in many of your Instances it is evident, that more Ingenuity, more Art are necessary to the lower, than the higher Proficients. If therefore you had only contended, that every Prig might might be a Statesman if he pleased, I had readily agreed to it; but when you conclude, that it is his Interest to be so, that Ambition would bid him take that Alternative; in a Word, that a Statesman is greater or happier than a Prig, I must deny my Assent.  But, in comparing these two together, we must carefully avoid being misled by the vulgar erroneous Estimation of Things; for Mankind err in Disquisitions of this Nature, as Physicians do, who, in considering the Operations of a Disease, have not a due Regard to the Age and Complexion of the Patient. The same Degree of Heat which is common in this Constitution, may be a Fever in that; in the same manner, that which may be Riches or Honour to me, may be Poverty or Disgrace to another; for all these things are to be estimated by Relation to the Person who possesses them. A Booty of 10 l. looks as great in the Eye of a Bridle-cull, and gives as much real Happiness to his Fancy, as that of as many thousands to the Statesman; and doth not the former lay out his Acquisitions in Whores and Fiddles, with much greater Joy and Mirth, than the latter in Palaces and Pictures?  What are the Flattery, the false Compliments of his Gang to the Statesman, when he himself must condemn his own Blunders, and is obliged against his Will to give Fortune the whole Honour of his Success; what is the Pride resulting from such sham Applause, compared to the secret Satisfaction which a Prig enjoys in his Mind, in reflecting on a well-contrived and well- executed Scheme. Perhaps indeed the greater Danger is on the Prig's Side; but then you must remember, that the greater Honour is so too. When I mention Honour, I mean that which is paid them by their Gang; for that weak Part of the World, which is vulgarly called THE WISE, see both in a disadvantageous and disgraceful Light:  And as the Prig enjoys (and merits too) the greater Degree of Honour from his Gang, so doth he suffer the less Disgrace from the World, who think his Misdeeds, as they call them, sufficiently at least punished with a Halter, which at once puts an End to his Pain and Infamy; whereas the other is not only hated in Power, but detested and contemned at the Scaffold; and future Ages vent their Malice on his Fame, while the other sleeps quiet and forgotten.  Besides, let us a little consider the secret Quiet of their Consciences; how easy is the Reflection of having taken a few Shillings or Pounds from a Stranger, without any Breach of Confidence, or perhaps any great Harm to the Person who loses it, compared to that of having betrayed a publick Trust, and ruined the Fortunes of thousands. How much braver is an Attack on the Highway, than at a Gaming-Table; and how much innocenter the Character of a B---y-House than a C ---t-Pimp?" He was eagerly proceeding when, casting his Eyes on the Count, he perceived him to be fast asleep, wherefore having gently jogged him, in order to take his Leave, and promised to return to him the next Morning to Breakfast, they separated; the Count retired to Rest, and Master Wild to a Night-Cellar. Farther Conferences between the Count and Master Wild, with other Matters of the GREAT Kind. the whole of his Friend's Doctrine, was, however, highly pleased with his Argument) began to bewail the Misfortune of his Captivity, and the Backwardness of Friends to assist each other in their Necessities; but what vexed him, he said, most, was the Cruelty of the Fair; for he entrusted Wild with the Secret of his having had an Intrigue with Miss Theodosia, the eldest of the Miss Snaps, ever since his Confinement, but could not prevail with her to set him at Liberty. Wild answered, with a Smile: "It was no Wonder a Woman should wish to confine her Lover, where she might be sure of having him entirely to herself; but added, he believed he could tell him a Method of certainly procuring his Escape."  The Count eagerly besought him to acquaint him with it.  Wild told him: "Bribery was the surest Means, and advised him to apply to the Maid." The Count thanked him, but returned: "That he had not a Farthing left besides one Guinea, which he had then given her to change." To which Wild said: "He must make it up with Promises, which he supposed he was Courtier enough to know how to put off." The Count greatly applauded the Advice, and said, he hoped he should be able in Time to persuade him to condescend to be a Great Man, for which he was so perfectly well qualified. Circumstance which I should not have mentioned but for the sake of observing the prodigious Force of Habit; for, though the Count knew, if he won never so much of Mr. Wild, he should not receive a Shilling, yet could he not refrain from packing the Cards; nor could Wild keep his Hands out of his Friend's Pockets, though he knew there was nothing in them. he had, and promised Mountains in futuro ; but all in vain, the Maid's Honesty was impregnable. She said, "She would not break her Trust for the World; no, not if she could gain a Million of Money by it." Upon which Wild stepping up, and telling her:  "She need not fear losing her Place, for it would never be found out; that they could throw a Pair of Sheets into the Street, by which it might appear he got out at Window; that he himself would swear he saw him descending; that the Money would be so much Gains in her Pocket; that, besides his Promises, which he might depend on being performed, she would receive from him twenty Shillings and Nine-pence in ready Money, (for she had only laid out Three-pence in plain Spanish ) and that besides his Honour, the Count should leave a Pair of Gold Buttons (which afterwards turned out to be Brass) of great Value in her Hands as a farther Pawn; and, lastly, that he himself would lend his Friend Eighteen pence, being all he had about him, to deposite in pr aesenti ." Reputation of a very honest Servant; and she promised faithfully in the Evening to open the Door to the Count. care to do without a Fee, but his Money too, Eighteen pence, a Sum which many a good Man would have made eighteen Excuses before he would have parted with to his Friend, and procured him his Liberty. should the Reader imagine he lent such a Sum as eighteen pence to a Friend without the least View of serving himself.  As, therefore, he may easily account for it in a manner more advantageous to our Hero's Reputation, by concluding that he had some interested View in the Count's Enlargement, we hope he will judge with Charity, especially as the Sequel makes it not only reasonable but necessary to suppose he had some such View. who, being by the Advice of the Count dressed in good Cloaths, was by him introduced into the best Company. They constantly frequented the Assemblies, Auctions, Gaming-Tables, and Play-Houses; at which last they saw two Acts every Night, and then retired without paying, being it seems an immemorial Privilege which the Beaus of the Town prescribe for to themselves. This, however, did not suit Wild's Temper who called it a Cheat, and objected against it, as requiring no Dexterity but what every Blockhead might put in Execution. He said it was a Custom very much savouring of the Sneaking- Budge, but neither so honourable nor so ingenious. Fortune in the Funds.  Women of Quality treated him with great Familiarity, young Ladies began to spread their Charms for him, when an Accident happened that put a Stop to his Continuance in a Way of Life too insipid and inactive to afford Employment for those great Talents, which were designed to make a much more considerable Figure in the World, than attends the Character of a Beau or a pretty Gentleman. Master Wild sets out on his Travels, and returns home again. A very short Chapter, containing infinitely more Time and less Matter than any other in the whole Story. perfect Account of this Accident; but as there are such various Accounts, one of which only can be true, and possibly, and indeed probably, none; instead of following the general Method of Historians, who in such Cases set down the various Reports, and leave to your own Conjecture which you will chuse, we shall pass them all over. Father to send his Son immediately abroad, for seven Years; and, which may seem somewhat remarkable, to his Majesty's Plantations in America . That Part of the World being, as he said, freer from Vices than the Courts and Cities of Europe, and consequently less dangerous to corrupt a young Man's Morals. And as for the Advantages, the old Gentleman thought they were equal there with those attained in the politer Climates; for travelling, he said, was travelling in one Part of the World as well as another:  It consisted in being such a Time from home, and in traversing so many Leagues; and appealed to Experience, whether most of our Travellers in France and Italy, did not prove at their Return, that they might have been sent as profitably to Norway and Greenland ? aboard a Ship, and with a great deal of good Company set out for the American Hemisphere. The exact Time of his Stay is somewhat uncertain; most probably longer than was intended: But howsoever long his Abode there was, it must be a Blank in this History; as the whole Story contains not one Adventure worthy the Reader's Notice; being indeed, a continued Scene of whoring, drinking, and removing from one Place to another. that we would have done a Violence to our History, and have inserted an Adventure or two of some other Traveller: To which Purpose we borrowed the Journals of several young Gentlemen who have lately made the Tour of Europe ; but to our great Sorrow could not extract a single Incident strong enough to justify the Theft to our Consciences. History of no less than eight Years, our only comfort is, that the History of some Mens lives, and perhaps of some Men who have made a Noise in the World, are in Reality as absolute Blanks as the Travels of our Hero. As, therefore, we shall make sufficient Amends in the Sequel for this Inanity, we shall hasten on to Matters of true Importance, and immense Greatness. At present we content ourselves with setting down our Hero where we took him up, after acquainting our Reader that he went abroad, staid seven Years, and then came home again. An Adventure where Wild, in the Division of the Booty, exhibits an astonishing Instance of Greatness . who was just returned from his Travels, was then present; as was likewise a young Gentleman whose Name was Bob Bagshot, an Acquaintance of Mr. Wild's, and of whom he entertained a great Opinion; taking therefore Mr. Bagshot aside, he advised him to provide himself (if he had them not about him) with a Case of Pistols, and to attack the Count, in his Way home, promising to plant himself near with the same Arms, as a Corps de Reserve, and to come up on Occasion.  This was accordingly executed, and the Count obliged to surrender to savage Force what he had in so genteel and civil a Manner taken at Play. never comes alone, the Count had hardly passed the Examination of Mr. Bagshot, when he fell into the Hands of Mr. Snap, who, in Company with Mr. Wild the elder, and one or two more Gentlemen, being it seems thereto well warranted, laid hold of the unfortunate Count, and conveyed him back to the same House from which, by the Assistance of his good Friend he had formerly escaped. Bagshot, generously (as he thought) offered to share the Booty, and having divided the Money into two unequal Heaps, and added a golden Snuff-Box to the lesser Heap, he desired Mr. Wild to take his Choice. Pocket, according to an excellent Maxim of his: "First secure what Share you can, before you wrangle for the rest:" And then, turning to his Companion, he asked him, with a stern Countenance, whether he intended to keep all that Sum to himself? Mr. Bagshot answered, with some Surprize, that he thought Mr. Wild had no Reason to complain; for it was surely fair, at least on his Part, to content himself with an equal Share of the Booty, who had taken the whole. I grant you took it, replied Wild, "but, pray who proposed or counselled the taking it?  Can you say, that you have done more than executed my Scheme, and might not I, if I had pleased, have employed another? since you well know there was not a Gentleman in the Room but would have taken the Money, if he had known how conveniently and safely to do it.  That is very true (returned Bagshot ) but did not I execute the Scheme, did not I run the whole Risque? Should not I have suffered the whole Punishment if I had been taken, and is not the Labourer worthy of his Hire? Doubtless (says Jonathan ) he is so, and your Hire I shall not refuse you, which is all that the Labourer is entituled to, or ever enjoys. I remember when I was at School to have heard some Verses, which for the Excellence of their Doctrine, made an Impression on me, purporting that the Birds of the Air, and the Beasts of the Field, work not for themselves. It is true, the Farmer allows Fodder to his Oxen, and Pasture to his Sheep; but it is for his own Service, not theirs.  In the same Manner the Plowman, the Shepherd, the Weaver, the Builder and the Soldier, work not for themselves but others; they are contented with a poor Pittance (the Labourer's Hire) and permit us the Great to enjoy the Fruits of their Labours.  Aristotle, as my Master told us, hath plainly proved, in the first Book of his Politicks, that the low, mean, useful Part of Mankind, are born Slaves to the Wills, and for the Use of their Superiors, as well as the Cattle. It is well said of us, the higher Order of Mortals, that we are born only to devour the Fruits of the Earth; and it may be as well said of the lower Class, that they are born only to produce them for us. Is not the Battle gained by the Sweat and Danger of the common Soldier, is not the Honour and Fruit of the Victory the General's who laid the Scheme? Is not the House built by the Labour of the Carpenter, and the Bricklayer? Is it not built for the Profit only of the Architect, and for the Use of the Inhabitant, who could not easily have placed one Brick upon another?  Is not the Cloth, the Silk, wrought into its Form, and variegated with all the Beauty of Colours, by those who are forced to content themselves with the coarsest and vilest Part of their Work, while the Profit and Enjoyment of their Labours fall to the Share of others.  Cast your Eye abroad, and see who is it lives in the most magnificent Buildings, feasts his Palate with the most luxurious Dainties, his Eyes with the most beautiful Sculptures and delicate Paintings, and cloathes himself in the finest and richest Apparel; and tell me if all these do not fall to his Lot, who had not any the least Share in producing all these Conveniencies, nor the least Ability so to do? Why then should the State of a Prig differ from all others? Or why should you, who are the Labourer only, the Executor of my Scheme, expect a Share in the Profit. Be advised, therefore, deliver the whole Booty to me, and trust to my Bounty for your Reward." Mr. Bagshot was some Time silent, and looked like a Man Thunder-struck: But at last recovering himself from his Surprize, he thus began.  "If you think, Mr. Wild, by the Force of your Arguments to get the Money out of my Pocket, you are greatly mistaken.  What is all this Stuff to me? D---n me, I am a Man of Honour, and tho' I can't talk as well as you, by G--- you shall not make a Fool of me and if you take me for one, I must tell you, you are a Rascal." At which Words, he laid his Hand to his Sword. Wild, perceiving the little Success the great Strength of his Arguments had met with, and the hasty Temper of his Friend, gave over his Design for the present, and told Bagshot, he was only in Jest. But this Coolness had rather the Effect of Oil than Water thrown on the Flames of the other, who replied, in a Rage, "D---n me, I don't like such Jests; I see you are a pitiful Rascal, and a Scoundrel." Wild, with a Philosophy worthy of great Admiration, returned. "As for your Abuse, I have no Regard to it; but to convince you, I am not afraid of you, let us lay the whole Booty on the Table, and let the Conqueror take it all."  And having so said, he drew out his shining Sword, whose glittering so dazzled the Eyes of Bagshot, that in a Tone entirely altered, he said, "No, he was contented with what he had already; that it was mighty ridiculous in them to quarrel among themselves; that they had common Enemies enough abroad, against whom they should unite their common Force; that if he had mistaken Wild, he was sorry for it, and as for a Jest, he could take a Jest as well as another." Wild, who had a wonderful Knack of discovering and applying to the Passions of Men, beginning now to have a little Insight into his Friend, and to conceive what Arguments would make the quickest Impression on him, cried out in a loud Voice, "That he had bullied him into drawing his Sword, and since it was out, he would not put it up without Satisfaction. What Satisfaction would you have, (answered the other) your Money or the Sword, said Wild . Why lookye Mr. Wild (said Bagshot ) if you want to borrow a little of my Part, since I know you to be a Man of Honour, I don't care if I lend you: \---For tho' I am not afraid of any Man living, yet rather than break with a Friend, and as it may be necessary for your Occasions."  \--- Wild, who often declared that he looked upon borrowing to be as good a Way of taking as any, and as he called it, the genteelest Kind of Sneaking-Budge, putting up his Sword, and shaking his Friend by the Hand, told him, he had hit the Nail on the Head; it was really his present Necessity only that prevailed with him against his Will; for that his Honour was concerned to pay a considerable Sum the next Morning.  Upon which, contenting himself with one Half of Bagshot's Share, so that he had three Parts in four of the whole, he took leave of his Companion, and retired to rest. Wild pays a Visit to Miss L aetitia Snap . A Description of that lovely young Creature, and the successless Issue of Mr. Wild's Addresses. Miss Tishy Snap ; for tho' she was really a Woman of Merit, and great Generosity, yet Mr. Wild found a Present was ever most welcome to her, as being a Token of Respect in her Lover. He therefore went directly to a Toy- Shop, and there purchased a genteel Snuff-Box, with which he waited upon his Mistress; whom he found in the most beautiful Deshabille.  Her lovely Hair hung wantonly over her Forehead, being neither white with, nor yet free from Powder; a neat double Clout which seemed to have been worn a few Times only, was pinned under her Chin; some Remains of that Art which Ladies improve Nature with, shone on her Cheeks.  Her Body was loosely attired, without Stays or Jumps; so that her Breasts had uncontroulled Liberty to display their beauteous Orbs, which they did as low as her Girdle, a thin Covering of a rumpled Muzlin Handkerchief almost hid them from the Eyes, save in a few Parts where a good-natured Hole gave Opportunity to the naked Breast to appear, and put us in Mind by its Whiteness of the Fault in the Handkerchief, which might have otherwise past unobserved. Her Gown was a Sattin of a whitish Colour, with about a dozen little Silver Spots upon it, so artificially interwoven, that they looked as if they had fallen there by Chance. This flying open, discovered a fine white Petticoat beautifully edged round the Bottom with a narrow Piece of half Gold-Lace, beneath this appeared another Petticoat stiffened with Whalebone, vulgarly called a Hoop, which was six Inches at least below the other; and under this again appeared a red Stuff. She likewise displayed two pretty Feet covered with Silk, and adorned with Lace, and tied the right with a handsome Piece of blue Ribband; the left, as more unworthy, with a Piece of red Stuff, which seemed to have been a Strip of her Under-Petticoat.  Such was the lovely Creature whom Mr. Wild attended. She received him at first with some Coldness, which Women of strict Virtue by a commendable, tho' sometimes painful Restraint, enjoin themselves to their Lovers. The Snuff-Box being produced, was at first civilly, and indeed, gently refused: But on a second Application accepted.  The Tea-Table was soon called for, at which a Discourse passed between these young Lovers, which could we set down with any Accuracy, would be very edifying as well as entertaining to our Reader; let it suffice then that the Wit, together with the Beauty of this young Creature, so inflamed the Passion of Wild, which, tho' an honourable Sort of a Passion, was at the same Time so extremely violent, that it transported him to Freedoms too offensive to the nice Chastity of L aetitia, who was, to confess the Truth, more indebted to her own Strength for the Preservation of her Virtue, than to the awful Respect or Backwardness of her Lover; for he was indeed so very urgent in his Addresses, that had he not with many Oaths promised her Marriage, we could scarce have been justified in calling his Passion strictly honourable; but he was so remarkably attached to Decency, that he never offered any Violence to a young Lady without the most earnest Promises of that kind, being, he said, a Ceremonial due to their Modesty, and which was so easily performed, that the Omission could arise from nothing but the mere Wantonness of Brutality.  The lovely L aetitia, either out of Prudence, or perhaps Religion, of which she was a liberal Professor, was deaf to all his Promises, and luckily invincible by his Force; for though she had not learnt the vulgar Art of clenching her Fist, Nature had not, however, left her defenceless; for at the Ends of her Fingers she wore Arms, which she used with such admirable Dexterity, that the hot Blood of Mr. Wild soon began to appear in several little Spots on his Face, and his full-blown Cheeks to resemble that Part which Modesty forbids a Boy to turn up any where but in publick School, after some Pedagogue, strong of Arm, hath exercised his Talents thereon.  Wild now retreated from the Conflict, and the victorious L aetitia, with becoming Triumph and noble Spirit, cried out, "D---n you, if this be your Way of shewing your Love, I'll warrant I give you enough on't." She then proceeded to talk of her Virtue, which Wild bid her carry to the Devil with her; and thus our Lovers parted. A Discovery of some Matters concerning the chaste L aetitia, which must wonderfully surprize, and perhaps affect our Reader. Door of a Closet, called forth a young Gentleman, whom she had there enclosed at the Approach of the other. The Name of this Gallant was Tom Smirk .  He was Apprentice to a Tallow-Chandler, and was indeed the greatest Beau, and the greatest Favourite of the Ladies, at the End of the Town where he lived.  As we take Dress to be the Characteristic or efficient Quality of a Beau, we shall, instead of giving any Character of this young Gentleman, content ourselves with describing his Dress only to our Readers. He wore, then, a Pair of white Stockings on his Legs, and Pumps on his Feet; his Buckles were a large Piece of Pinchbeck Plate, which almost covered his whole Foot. His Breeches were of red Plush, which hardly reached his Knees; his Wastecoat was a white Dimity richly embroidered with yellow Silk, over which he wore a blue Plush coat with Metal Buttons, a smart Sleeve, and a Cape reaching half way down his Back. His Wig was of a brown Colour, covering almost half his Pate, on which was hung on one Side a little laced Hat, but cocked with great Smartness. Such was the accomplished Smirk, who, at his issuing forth from the Closet, was received with open Arms by the amiable L aetitia .  She addressed him by the tender Name of Dear Tommy ; and told him she had dismist the odious Creature whom her Father intended for her Husband, and had now nothing to interrupt her Happiness with him. Capriciousness of Nature in forming this charming Part of the Creation, designed to complete the Happiness of Man; with their soft Innocence to allay his Ferocity, with their Sprightliness to sooth his Cares, and with their constant Friendship to relieve all the Troubles and Disappointments which can happen to him. Seeing, then, that this is universally certain, that these are the Blessings chiefly sought after, and generally found in every Wife, how must we lament that Disposition in these lovely Creatures, which leads them to prefer in their Favour those Individuals of the other Sex, who do not seem intended by Nature as her greatest Master-piece.  For surely, however useful they may be in the Creation, as we are taught, that nothing, not even a Louse, is made in vain; yet these Beaus, even that most splendid and honoured Part, which, in this our Island, Nature loves to distinguish in Red, are not, as some think, the noblest Part of the Creation.  For my own Part, let any Man chuse to himself two Beaus, let them be Captains or Colonels, as well dressed Men as ever lived, really as fine Men, I would venture to oppose a single Sir Isaac Newton, a Shakespear, a Milton, or perhaps some few others to both these Beaus; nay, and I very much doubt, whether it had not been better for the World in general, that neither of these Beaus had ever been born, than that it should have wanted the Benefit arising to it from the Labour of any one of those Persons. Beau, especially if he have but half a Yard of Ribbon in his Hat, shall weigh heavier, in the Scales of female Affection, than twenty Sir Isaac Newtons . How must our Reader, who perhaps had wisely accounted for the Resistance which the chaste L aetitia had made to the violent Addresses of the ravished (or rather ravishing) Wild from that Lady's impregnable Virtue, how must he blush, I say, to perceive her quit the Strictness of her Carriage, and abandon herself to those loose Freedoms which she indulged to Smirk .  But, alas! when we discover all, as, to preserve the Fidelity of our History, we must, when we relate that every Familiarity had past between them, and that the FAIR L aetitia (for we must, in this single Instance, imitate Virgil, where he drops the pius and the pater, and drop our favourite Epithet of chaste ) the FAIR L aetitia had, I say, made Smirk as happy as Wild desired to be, what must then be our Reader's Confusion? We will, therefore, draw a Curtain over this Scene, from that Philogyny which is in us, and proceed to Matters, which, instead of dishonouring the human Species, will greatly raise and ennoble it. Containing as great and as noble Instances of human Greatness as are to be met with in ancient or modern History. Concluding with some wholesome Hints to the gay Part of Mankind. that his Friend the Count was returned to his Lodgings in the same House, he resolved to visit him; for he was none of those half-bred Fellows, who are ashamed to see their Friends when they have plundered and betrayed them: From which base and pitiful Temper many monstrous Cruelties have been transacted by Men, who have sometimes carried their Modesty so far as to the Murther, or utter Ruin of those against whom their Consciences have suggested to them, that they have committed some small Trespass, either by the debauching a Wife or Daughter, belying or betraying, or some other such trifling Instance.  In our Hero there was nothing not truly GREAT: He could, without the least Abashment, drink a Bottle with the Man who knew he had the Moment before picked his Pocket; and, when he had stript him of every thing he had, never desired to do him any farther Mischief; for he carried Good-nature to that wonderful and uncommon Height, that he never did a single Injury to Man or Woman, by which he himself did not expect to reap some Advantage. abandoning himself to Despair, but, with due Resignation, employing himself in preparing several Packs of Cards for future Exploits. The Count, little suspecting that Wild had been the sole Contriver of the Misfortune which had befallen him, rose up, and eagerly embraced him; and Wild, who well knew the whole, returned his Embrace with equal Warmth.  They were no sooner seated than Wild took an Occasion, from seeing the Cards lying on the Table, to inveigh against Gaming, and, with an usual and highly commendable Freedom, after first exaggerating the distrest Circumstances in which the Count was then involved, imputed all his Misfortunes to that cursed Itch of Play, which he said, he concluded had brought his present Confinement upon him, and must unavoidably end in his Destruction.  The other, with great Alacrity, defended his favourite Amusement (or rather Employment) and having told him the great Success he had after his unluckily quitting the Room, acquainted him with the Accident which followed, and which the Reader, as well as Mr. Wild, hath had some Intimation of before; adding, however, one Circumstance not hitherto mentioned, viz. that he had defended his Money with the utmost Bravery, and had dangerously wounded at least two of the three Men who had attacked him.  This Behaviour Wild, who not only knew the extreme Readiness with which the Booty had been delivered, but also the constant Frigidity of the Count's Courage, highly applauded, and wished he had been present to assist him.  The Count then proceeded to animadvert on the Carelesness of the Watch, and the Scandal it was to the Laws, that People could not walk the Streets in Safety, and, after expatiating some Time on that Subject, he asked Mr. Wild if he ever saw so prodigious a Run of Luck (for so he chose to call his Winning, though he knew Wild was well acquainted with his having loaded Dice in his Pocket) the other answered, it was indeed prodigious, and almost sufficient to justify any Person, who did not know him better, in suspecting his fair Play. No Man, I believe, dares call that in Question, replied he. No surely, says Wild, you are well known to be a Man of more Honour: But pray, Sir, continued he, did the Rascals rob you of all? Every Shilling, cries the other with an Oath; they did not leave me a single Stake. followed him, introduced Mr. Bagshot into the Company.  It seems Mr. Bagshot, immediately after his Separation from Mr. Wild, returned to the Gaming-Table, where, he having trusted to Fortune that Treasure which he had procured by his Industry, the faithless Goddess committed a Breach of Trust, and sent Mr. Bagshot away with as empty Pockets as are to be found in any laced Coat in the Kingdom. Now as that Gentleman was walking to a certain reputable House or Shed in Covent-Garden Market, he fortuned to meet with Mr. Snap, who had just returned from conveying the Count to his Lodgings, and was then walking to and fro before the Gaming-House Door; for you are to know, my good Reader, if you have never been a Man of Wit and Pleasure about Town, that as the voracious Pike lieth snug under some Weed before the Mouth of any of those little Streams which discharge themselves into a large River, waiting for the small Fry which issue thereout; so hourly before the Door or Mouth of these Gaming- Houses doth Mr. Snap, or some other Gentleman of his Occupation, attend the issuing forth of the small Fry of young Gentlemen, to whom they deliver little Slips of Parchment, containing Invitations of the said Gentlemen to their Houses, together with one Mr. John Doe, a Person whose Company is in great Request.  Mr. Snap, among many others of these Billets, happened to have one directed to Mr. Bagshot, being at the Suit or Solicitation of one Mrs. Anne Sample, Spinster, at whose House the said Bagshot had lodged several Months, and whence he had inadvertently departed without taking a formal Leave; on which Account Mrs. Anne had taken this Method of speaking with him. introduce Mr. Bagshot into the Count's Apartment, it being, as he said, the only Chamber he had to lock up in. Mr. Wild no sooner saw his Friend than he ran to embrace him, and immediately presented him to the Count, who received him with great Civility. Further Particulars relating to Miss Tishy, which perhaps may not greatly surprize after the former. The Description of a very fine Gentleman. And a Dialogue between Wild and the Count, in which public Virtue is just hinted at, with &c. Family called Mr. Bagshot out of the Room, telling him, there was a Person below who desired to speak with him; and this was no other than Miss L aetitia Snap, whose Admirer Mr. Bagshot had long been, and in whose tender Breast his Passion had raised a more ardent Flame than that of any of his Rivals had been able to raise.  Indeed she was so extremely fond of this Youth, that she often confessed to her female Confidents, if she could ever have listened to the Thought of living with any one Man, Mr. Bagshot was he.  Nor was she singular in this Inclination, many other young Ladies being her Rivals in this Lover, who had all the great and noble Qualifications necessary to form a true Gallant, and which Nature is seldom so extremely bountiful as to indulge to any one Person. We will endeavour, however, to describe them all with as much Exactness as possible. He was then six Feet high, had large Calves, broad Shoulders, a ruddy Complexion, with brown curled Hair, a modest Assurance, and clean Linen. He had indeed, it must be confest, some small Deficiencies to counterbalance these heroic Qualities, for he was the silliest Fellow in the World, could neither write nor read, nor had he a single Grain or Spark of Honour, Honesty, or Good-nature in his whole Composition. the Hand, told him he had something to communicate to him of very great Importance; he then proceeded to inform him, he was very well convinced that Bagshot was the Person who robbed him.  Wild started with great seeming Amazement as this Discovery, and told the Count with a most serious Countenance, he advised him to take Care how he cast any such Reflections on a Man of Mr. Bagshot's nice Honour; for he was certain he would not bear it. D---n his Honour, quoth the enraged Count, nor can I bear being robbed; I will apply to a Justice of Peace. Wild replied with great Indignation, since he durst entertain such a Suspicion against his Friend, he would henceforth disclaim all Acquaintance with him; that he knew Mr. Bagshot was a Man of Honour, and his Friend, and consequently it was impossible he should be guilty of a bad Action; with much more to the same purpose, which had not the expected Weight with the Count; for the latter seemed still certain as to the Person, and resolute in applying for Justice, which, he said, he thought he owed to the Public, as well as to himself. Wild then changed his Countenance into a kind of Derision, and spoke as follows:  "Suppose it should be possible that Mr. Bagshot had, in a Frolic, (for I will call it no other) taken this Method of borrowing your Money, what will you get by prosecuting him?  Not your Money again; for you hear he was stript at the Gaming-Table;" (of which Bagshot had, during their short Confabulation, informed them) "you will get then an Opportunity of being still more out of Pocket by the Prosecution. Another Advantage you may promise yourself is the being blown up at every Gaming-House in Town, for that I will assure you of; and then much Good may it do you to sit down with the Satisfaction of having discharged what it seems you owe the Public. I am ashamed of my own Discernment, when I mistook you for a great Man.  Would it not be better for you to receive Part (perhaps all) of your Money again by a wise Concealment; for however seedy Mr. Bagshot may be now, if he has really plaid this Frolic with you, you may believe he will play it with others, and when he is in Cash, you may depend on a Restoration; the Law will be always in your Power, and that is the last Remedy which a brave or a wise Man would resort to.  Leave the Affair therefore to me; I will examine Bagshot, and if I find he hath plaid you this Trick, I will engage my own Honour, you shall in the End be no Loser." The Count answered: "If I was sure to be no Loser, Mr. Wild, I apprehend you have a better Opinion of my Understanding than to imagine I would prosecute a Gentleman for the sake of the Public. These are foolish Words of Course, which we learn a ridiculous Habit of speaking, and will often break from us without any Design or Meaning. I assure you all I desire is a Reimbursement, and if I can, by your Means, obtain that, the Public may ---" concluding with a Phrase too coarse to be inserted in a History of this kind. below Stairs, whither the Reader may, if he please, attend these Gentlemen. Daughters, Mr. Wild the elder, Mr. Wild the younger, the Count, Mr. Bagshot, and a grave Gentleman, who had formerly had the Honour of carrying Arms in a Regiment of Foot, and now engaged in the Office (perhaps a more reputable one) of assisting or following Mr. Snap in the Execution of the Laws of his Country. polite Company) rolled chiefly on what they were then eating, and what they had lately eaten. In which the military Gentleman, who had served in Ireland, gave them a very particular Account of a new manner of roasting Potatoes, and others gave an Account of other Dishes. In short, an indifferent By-stander would have concluded from their Discourse, that they had all come into this World for no other purpose, than to fill their Bellies; and indeed if this was not the chief, it is probable it was the most innocent Design Nature had in their Formation. As soon as the Dish was removed, and the Ladies retired, the Count proposed a Game at Hazard, which was immediately assented to by the whole Company, and the Dice being immediately brought in, the Count took up the Box, and demanded who would set him: To which no one made any Answer, imagining perhaps the Count's Pockets to be more empty than they were; for, in Reality, that Gentleman (notwithstanding what he had heartily swore to Mr. Wild ) had since his Arrival at Mr. Snap's, conveyed a Piece of Plate to pawn, by which Means he had furnished himself with ten Guineas. The Count, therefore, perceiving this Backwardness in his Friends, and probably somewhat guessing at the Cause of it, took the said Guineas out of his Pocket, and threw them on the Table; when lo! (such is the Force of Example) all the rest began to produce their Funds, and immediately a considerable Sum glittering in their Eyes, the Game began. A Chapter, of which we are extremely vain, and which indeed we look on as our Chef d'Oeuvre, containing a wonderful Story concerning the Devil, and as nice a Scene of Honour as ever happened. exact Relation of every Man's Success; let it suffice then that they played till the whole Money vanished from the Table; and whether the Devil himself carried it away, I will not determine; but very surprizing it was, that every Person protested he had lost, nor could any one guess who, but the Devil, had won. Booty, it is likely he had not all; Mr. Bagshot being imagined to be a considerable Winner, notwithstanding his Assertions to the contrary; for he was seen by several to convey Money often into his Pocket, and what is still a little stronger Presumption is, that the grave Gentleman whom we have mentioned to have served his Country in two honourable Capacities, not being willing to trust alone to the Evidence of his Eyes, had frequently dived into the said Bagshot's Pocket, whence tho' he might extract a few Pieces, he was very sensible he had left many behind. Bagshot, in the Heat of Gaming, had perceived him: But as he was now leaving off Play, he discovered this ingenious Feat of Dexterity; upon which, leaping up from his Chair in a violent Passion, he cried out, "I thought I had been among Gentlemen, and Men of Honour, but, d---n me, I find we have a Pickpocket in Company."  The scandalous Sound of this Word extremely alarmed the whole Board, nor did they all shew less Surprize than the Conv---n (whose not sitting of late is much lamented) would express at hearing there was an Atheist in the Room:  But it more particularly affected the Gentleman; who likewise started from his Chair, and with a fierce Countenance and Accent, said, "Do you mean Me? D---n your Eyes, you are a Rascal and a Scoundrel." Those Words would have been immediately succeeded by Blows, had not the Company interposed, and with strong Arm witheld the two Antagonists from each other. It was, however, a long Time before they could be prevailed on to sit down, which being at last happily brought about, Mr. Wild the elder, who was a well disposed old Man, advised them to shake Hands and be Friends; but the Gentleman, who had received the first Affront, absolutely refused it, and swore, He would have the Villain's Blood .  Mr. Snap highly applauded the Resolution, and affirmed that the Affront was by no Means to be put up by any who bore the Name of a Gentleman, and that unless his Friend resented it properly, he would never execute another Warrant in his Company; that he had always looked upon him as a Man of Honour, and doubted not but he would prove himself so; and that if it was his own Case, nothing should persuade him to put up such an Affront without proper Satisfaction. The Count likewise spoke on the same Side, and the Parties themselves muttered several short Sentences, purporting their Intentions. At last, Mr. Wild our Hero, rising slowly from his Seat, and having fixed the Attention of all present, began as follows. "I have heard, with infinite Pleasure, every Thing which the two Gentlemen who spoke last have said, with Relation to Honour, nor can any Man possibly entertain a higher and nobler Sense of that Word, nor a greater Esteem of its inestimable Value than myself. If we have no Name to express it by in our Cant Dictionary, it were well to be wished we had. It is indeed, the essential Quality of a Gentleman, and which no Man who ever was great in the Field, or on the Road (as others express it) can possibly be without.  But alas! Gentlemen, What Pity is it, that a Word of such sovereign Use and Virtue should have so uncertain and various an Application, that scarce two People mean the same Thing by it.  Do not some by Honour mean Good-Nature and Humanity, which weak Minds call Virtues? How then! Must we deny it to the Great, the Brave, the Noble, to the Sackers of Towns, the Plunderers of Provinces, and the Conquerors of Kingdoms? Were not these Men of Honour? And yet they scorned those pitiful Qualities I have mentioned. Again, some few (or I am mistaken) include the Idea of Honesty in their Honour. And shall we then say, that no Man who witholds from another what Law or Justice perhaps calls his own, or who GREATLY and boldly deprives him of such Property, is a Man of Honour? G--- forbid I should say so in this, or indeed, in any other good Company. Is Honour Truth? No. It is not in the Lie's going from us, but in its coming to us our Honour is injured. Doth it then consist in what the Vulgar call Cardinal Virtues? It would be an Affront to your Understandings to suppose it, since we see every Day so many Men of Honour without any. In what then doth the Word Honour consist?  Why in itself alone. A Man of Honour is he that is called a Man of Honour; and while he is so called, he so remains, and no longer. Think not any Thing a Man commits can forfeit his Honour. Look abroad into the World, the Prig while he flourishes is a Man of Honour; when in Gaol, at the Bar, or the Tree, he is so no longer. And why is this Distinction? Not from his Actions; for those are often as well known in his flourishing Estate, as they are afterwards; but because Men call him a Man of Honour in the former, and cease to call him so in the latter Condition. Let us see then, how hath Mr. Bagshot injured the Gentleman's Honour? Why, he hath called him a Pick-pocket, and that probably, by a severe Construction and a long round about Way of Reasoning, may seem a little to derogate from his Honour, if considered in a very nice Sense.  Admitting it, therefore, for Argument's Sake, to be some small Imputation on his Honour, let Mr. Bagshot give him Satisfaction; let him doubly and triply repair this oblique Injury by directly asserting, that he believes he is a Man of Honour."  The Gentleman answered, he was content to refer it to Mr. Wild, and whatever Satisfaction he thought sufficient, he would accept. Let him give me my Money again first, said Bagshot, and then I will call him a Man of Honour with all my Heart. The Gentleman then protested he had not any, which Snap seconded, declaring he had his Eyes on him all the while; but Bagshot remained still unsatisfied, till Wild, rapping out a hearty Oath, swore he had not taken a single Farthing, adding that whoever asserted the contrary gave him the Lie, and he would resent it. And now, such was the Ascendency of this great Man, that Bagshot immediately acquiesced, and performed the Ceremonies required: And thus, by the exquisite Address of our Hero, this Quarrel, which had so fatal an Aspect, and which between two Persons so extremely jealous of their Honour, would most certainly have produced very dreadful Consequences, was happily concluded. had set the Gentleman to work, and had received the greatest Part of the Booty, and as to Mr. Snap's Deposition in his Favour, it was the usual Height to which the Ardour of that worthy Person's Friendship too frequently hurried him. It was his constant Maxim, That he was a pitiful Fellow who would stick at a little ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 7 Rapping for his Friend. In which the History of Greatness is continued. hinted, the Company proceeded to drink about with the utmost Chearfulness and Friendship, drinking Healths, shaking Hands, and professing the most perfect Affection for each other.  All which were not in the least interrupted by some Designs which they then agitated in their Minds, and which they intended to execute as soon as the Liquor had prevailed over some of their Understandings.  Bagshot and the Gentleman intending to rob each other; Mr. Snap and Mr. Wild the elder, meditating what other Creditors they could find out, to charge the Gentlemen then in Custody with; the Count hoping to renew the Play, and Wild our Hero, laying a Design to put Bagshot out of the Way, or as the Vulgar express it, to hang him with the first Opportunity. But none of these great Designs could at present be put in Execution, for Mr. Snap being soon after summoned abroad on Business of great Moment, which required likewise the Assistance of Mr. Wild the elder and his other Friend, and as he did not care to trust to the Nimbleness of the Count's Heels, of which he had already had some Experience, he declared he must lock up for that Evening. And now, Reader, if thou pleasest, as we are in no great Haste, we will stop and make a Simile.  As when their Lap is finished, the cautious Huntsman to their Kennel gathers the nimblefooted Hounds, they with lank Ears and Tails slouch sullenly on, whilst he with his Whippers-in, follows close at their Heels, regardless of their dogged Humour, till having seen them safe within the Door, he turns the Key, and then retires to whatever Business or Pleasure calls him thence:  So with louring Countenance, and reluctant Steps mounted the Count and Bagshot to their Chamber, or rather Kennel, whither they were attended by Snap, and those who followed him, and where Snap having seen them deposited, very contentedly locked the Door and departed. And now, Reader, if you please we will, in Imitation of the truly laudable Custom of the World, leave these our good Friends to deliver themselves as they can, and pursue the thriving Fortunes of Wild our Hero, who with that great Aversion to Satisfaction and Content, which is inseparably incident to GREAT Minds, began to enlarge his Views with his Prosperity:  For this restless amiable Disposition, this noble Avidity which encreases with Feeding, is the first Principle or constituent Quality of these our great Men, to whom, in their Passage on to Greatness, it happens as to a Traveller over the Alps, or if this be a too far fetched Simile, to one who travels over the Hills near Bath, were the Simile was indeed made.  He sees not the End of his Journey at once; but passing on from Scheme to Scheme, and from Hill to Hill, with noble Constancy, resolving still to attain the Summit on which he hath fixed his Eye, however dirty the Roads may be through which he struggles, he at length arrives at---some vile Inn, where he finds no Kind of Entertainment nor Conveniency for Repose. I fancy, Reader, if thou hast ever travelled in these Roads, one Part of my Simile is sufficiently apparent, (and indeed, in all these Illustrations one Side is generally much more apparent than the other) but believe me, if the other doth not so evidently appear to thy Satisfaction, it is from no other Reason than because thou art unacquainted with these great Men, and hast not had sufficient Instruction, Leisure, or Opportunity to consider what happens to those who pursue what is generally understood by Greatness :  For surely if thou hadst animadverted not only on the many Perils to which great Men are daily liable while they are in their Progress, but hadst discerned as it were through a Microscope (for it is invisible to the naked Eye) that diminutive Speck of Happiness which they attain even in the Consummation of their Wishes, thou wouldst lament with me, the unhappy Fate of these great Genius's on whom Nature hath set so superior a Mark, that the rest of Mankind are born for their Use and Emolument only, and be apt to cry out, "It is Pity that Those for whose Pleasure and Profit Mankind are to labour and sweat, to be hacked and hewed, to be pillaged, plundered, and every Way destroyed, should reap so LITTLE Advantage from all the Miseries they occasion to others."  For my Part, I own myself of that humble Kind of Mortals who consider themselves born for the Behoof of some GREAT Man or other, and could I behold his Happiness carved out of the Labour and Ruin of a thousand such Reptiles as myself, I might with Satisfaction exclaim, Sic, sic juvat : But when I behold one great Man starving with Hunger and freezing with Cold in the Midst of fifty thousand, who are suffering the same Evils for his Diversion; when I see another whose own Mind is a more abject Slave to his own Greatness, and is more tortured and wrecked by it than those of all his Vassals:  Lastly, when I consider whole Nations extirpated only to bring Tears into the Eyes of a almost inclined to wish that Nature had spared us this her Master-piece, and that no great Man had ever been born into the World. Lessons and more instructive than any we can preach: Wild was no sooner retired to a Night-Cellar, than he began to reflect on the Sweets he had that Day enjoyed from the Labours of others, viz. First, from Mr. Bagshot, who had for his Use robbed the Count; and Secondly, from the Gentleman, who for the same good Purpose had picked the Pocket of Bagshot . He then proceeded to reason thus with himself.  "The Art of Policy, is the Art of Multiplication; the Degrees of Greatness being constituted by those two little Words More and Less .  Mankind are first properly to be considered under two grand Divisions, those that use their Hands, and those who employ Hands. The Former are the Base and Rabble; the latter, the genteel Part of the Creation. The mercantile Part of the World, therefore, wisely uses the Term Employing of Hands, and justly prefer each other, as they emply more or fewer; for thus one Merchant says he is greater than another, because he employs more Hands. And now indeed the Merchant should seem to challenge some Character of those who employ Hands for the Use of the Community in which they live, and of those who employ Hands merely for their own Use, without any Regard to the Benefit of Society. Of the former Sort are the Yeoman, the Manufacturer, the Merchant, and, perhaps, the Gentleman.  The first of these being to manure and cultivate his native Soil, and to employ Hands to produce the Fruits of the Earth.  The second being to improve them by employing Hands likewise, and to produce from them those useful Commodities, which serve as well for the Conveniencies as Necessaries of Life. The third is to employ Hands for the Exportation of the Redundance of our own Commodities, and to exchange them with the Redundancies of foreign Nations, that thus every Soil and every Climate may enjoy the Fruits of the whole Earth. The Gentleman is, by employing Hands likewise, to embellish his Country with the Improvement of Arts and Sciences, with the making and executing good and wholesome Laws for the Preservation of Property and the Distribution of Justice, and in several other Manners to be useful to Society. Now we come to the second Part of this Division, viz. Of those who employ Hands for their own Use only: And this is that noble own and GREAT Part, who are generally distinguished into Conquerors, absolute Princes, Prime Ministers, and Prigs .  Now all these differ from each other in Greatness only, as they employ more or fewer Hands.  And Alexander the Great was only greater than a Captain of one of the Tartarian or Arabian Hords, as he was at the Head of a larger Number. In what then is a single Prig inferior to any other GREAT Man, but because he employs his own Hands only; for he is not on that Account to be levelled with the base and vulgar, because he employs his Hands for his own Use only. Now, suppose a Prig had as many Tools as any Prime Minister ever had, would he not be as GREAT as any Prime Minister whatsoever? Undoubtedly he would. What then have I to do in the Pursuit of Greatness, but to procure a Gang, and to make the Use of this Gang center in myself.  This Gang shall rob for me only, receiving very moderate Rewards for their Actions; out of this Gang I will prefer to my Favour the boldest and most iniquitous (as the Vulgar express it;) the rest I will, from Time to Time, as I see Occasion, transport and hang at my Pleasure; and thus (which I take to be the highest Excellence of a Prig ) convert those Laws which are made for the Benefit and Protection of Society, to my single Use." immediate Execution, but that which is indeed the Beginning as well as End of all human Devices: I mean Money. Of which Commodity he was possessed of no more than sixty-five Guineas, being all that remained from the double Benefits he had made of Bagshot, and which did not seem sufficient to furnish his House, and every other Convenience necessary for so grand an Undertaking. He resolved therefore to go immediately to the Gaming-House, which was then sitting, not so much with an Intention of trusting to Fortune, as to play the surer Card of attacking the Winner in his Way home. On his Arrival, however, he thought he might as well try his Success at the Dice, and reserve the other Recourse as his last Expedient.  He accordingly sat down to play, and as Fortune no more than others of her Sex, is observed to distribute her Favours with strict Regard to great mental Endowments, so our Hero lost every Farthing in his Pocket.  He then resolved to have immediate Recourse to his surer Stratagem; and casting his Eyes round the Room, he soon perceived a Gentleman sitting in a disconsolate Posture, who seemed a proper Instrument or Tool for his Purpose. In short (to be as concise as possible in these least shining Parts of our History) he accosted him, sounded him, sound him fit to execute, proposed the Matter, received a ready Assent, and having fixed on the Person who seemed that Evening the greatest Favourite of Fortune, they posted themselves in the most proper Place to surprize the Enemy as he was retiring to his Quarters, where he was soon attacked, subdued and plundered, but indeed of no considerable Booty; for it seems this Gentleman played on a common Stock, and had deposited his Winnings at the Scene of Action. as no doubt it will the Reader; that, as it must disqualify us both from proceeding any farther at present, we will now take a little Breath; and therefore we shall here close this Book. THE HISTORY OF THE LIFE of the late Mr. Jonathan Wild the Great. BOOK II. Characters of silly People, with the proper Uses for which such are designed. Chapter, was that we are now obliged to produce two Characters of a Stamp entirely different from what we have hitherto dealt in.  These Persons are of that pitiful Order of Mortals, who are in Contempt called Good-natured ; being indeed sent into the World by Nature, with the same Design as Men put little Fish into a Pike-Pond, in order to be devoured by that voracious Water-Hero. the same Manner as before, i. e. taken three Fourths of it, amounting to eighteen Pence, was now retiring to rest, in no very happy Mood, when by Accident he met a young Fellow, who had formerly been his School-Fellow. This Person had a Regard for our Hero, as he had more than once, for a small Reward, taken a Fault on himself, for which the other, who had more Regard for his Skin than Wild, was to have been whipp'd. He therefore accosted Wild in the most friendly Manner, and invited him home with him to Breakfast, it being now near Nine in the Morning, which our Hero, with no great Difficulty consented to.  This young Man, who was about Wild's Age, had some Time before set up in the Trade of a Jeweller, in the Materials or Stock for which, he had laid out the greatest Part of a little Fortune, and had married a very agreeable Woman for Love, by whom he then had two Children.  As our Reader is to be more acquainted with this Person, it may not be improper to open somewhat of his Character, especially as it will serve as a Kind of Foil to the noble and GREAT Disposition of our Hero, and as the one seems sent into this World as a proper Object on which the GREAT Talents of the other were to be displayed with a proper and just Success. open Disposition. He was of that Sort of Men, whom Experience only, and not their own Natures, must inform that there are such things as Deceit and Hypocrisy in the World; and who, consequently, are not at five and twenty as difficult to be imposed upon as the oldest and most subtile. He was possessed of several great Weaknesses of Mind; being good-natured, friendly, and generous to a great Excess.  He had indeed too little Regard to common Justice, for he had forgiven some Debts to his Acquaintance, only because they could not pay him; and had entrusted a Bankrupt on his setting up a second time, from having been convinced, that he had dealt in his Bankruptcy with a fair and honest Heart, and that it was owing to Misfortune, and not to Neglect or Imposture.  He was withal so silly a Fellow that he never took the least Advantage of the Ignorance of his Customers, and contented himself with very moderate Gains on his Goods; which he was the better enabled to do, notwithstanding his Generosity, because his Life was extremely temperate, his Expences being solely confined to the cheerful Entertainment of his Friends at Home, and now and then a moderate Glass of Wine, in which he indulged himself in the Company of his Wife, who was a mean-spirited, poor, domestic, low-bred Animal, who confined herself mostly to the Care of her Family, placed her Happiness in her Husband and her Children; followed no expensive Fashions or Diversions, and indeed rarely went abroad, unless to return the Visits of a few plain Neighbours, and twice a Year at farthest afforded herself in Company with her Husband the Diversion of a Play, where she never sat in a higher Place than the Pit. To this silly Woman did this silly Fellow introduce the GREAT WILD, informing her at the same Time of their former Acquaintance, and the Obligations he had received from him; for, as it often happens, that he who confers the Obligation, forgets the Price paid for it, so it sometimes, but very seldom, falls out with him who receives it.  This simple Woman no sooner heard her Husband had been obliged to her Guest, than her Eyes sparkled on him with a Benevolence which is an Emanation from the Heart, and of which GREAT and noble Minds, whose Hearts never swell but with an Injury, can have no very adequate Idea; it is therefore no Wonder that our Hero should misconstrue as he did, the poor, innocent, and simple Affection of Mrs. Heartfree towards her Husband's Friend, for that great and generous Passion, which fires the Eyes of a modern Heroine, when the Colonel is so kind as to indulge his City Creditor with partaking of his Table to Day, and of his Bed to Morrow.  Wild therefore instantly returned the Compliment, as he understood it, with his Eyes, and presently after bestowed many Encomiums on her Beauty, with which perhaps she, who was a Woman, though a good one, and misapprehended the Design, was not displeased any more than the Husband. Wild, who had a quick Discernment into the Weaknesses of Men, and who, besides the Knowledge of his good (or foolish) Disposition when a Boy, had now discovered several Sparks of Goodness, Friendship, and Generosity in his Friend, began to discourse over the Accidents which had happened in their Childhood, and took frequent Occasions of reminding him of those Favours which we have before mentioned his having conferred on him; he then proceeded to the most vehement Profession of Friendship, and to the most ardent Expressions of Joy in this Renewal of their Acquaintance.  He at last told him with great seeming Pleasure, that he believed he had an Opportunity of serving him by the Recommendation of a Gentleman to his Custom, who was then on the Brink of Marriage, and, if not already engaged, I will, says he, endeavour to prevail on him to furnish his Lady with Jewels at your Shop. Solicitations to Dinner, which were refused, they parted for the first Time. (an Accident which sometimes happens in Histories of this kind) how Mr. Wild the elder, in his present Capacity, should have been able to maintain his Son at a reputable School, as this appears to have been, it may be necessary to inform him, that Mr. Wild himself was then a Tradesman in good Business; but, by Misfortunes in the World, to wit, Extravagance and Gaming, he had reduced himself to that honourable Occupation which we have formerly mentioned. repaired to the Count, and having first settled preliminary Articles concerning Distributions, he acquainted him with the Scheme which he had formed against Heartfree ; and after consulting proper Methods to put it in Execution, they began to concert Measures for the Enlargement of the Count; on which the first and indeed only Point to be considered, was to raise Money, not to pay his Debts, for that would have required an immense Sum, and was contrary to his Inclination, or Intention, but to procure him Bail; for as to his Escape, Mr. Snap had taken such Precautions that it appeared absolutely impossible. Great Examples of Greatness in Wild, shewn as well by his Behaviour to Bagshot, as in a Scheme laid first to impose on Heartfree by Means of the Count, and then to cheat the Count of the Booty. notwithstanding the Depredations made on him, had carried off a pretty considerable Booty from their Engagement at Dice the preceding Day.  He found Mr. Bagshot in Expectation of his Bail, and, with a Countenance full of Concern, which he could at any Time, with wonderful Art, put on, told him, that all was discovered; that the Count knew him, and intended to prosecute him for the Robbery, had not I exerted, said he, my utmost Interest, and with great Difficulty prevailed on him in Case you refund the Money---"Refund the Money, cry'd Bagshot, that is in your Power; for you know what an inconsiderable Part of it fell to my Share. How! reply'd Wild, is this your Gratitude to me for saving your Life? For your own Conscience must convince you of your Guilt, and with how much Certainty the Gentleman can give Evidence against you. Marry come up, quoth Bagshot, I believe my Life alone will not be in Danger. I know those who are as guilty as myself. Do you tell me of Conscience? \---Yes, Sirrah! answered our Hero, taking him by the Collar, and since you dare threaten me, I will shew you the Difference between committing a Robbery, and conniving at it, which is all I can charge myself with. I own indeed I suspected when you shewed me a Sum of Money, that you had not come honestly by it. How, says Bagshot, frightened out of one half of his Wits, and amazed out of the other, can you deny?  \---Yes, you Rascal, answered Wild, I do deny every thing, and do you find a Witness to prove it; and, to shew you how little Apprehension I have of your Power to hurt me, I will have you apprehended this Moment."  \---At which Words he offered to break from him; but Bagshot laid hold of his Skirts, and, with an altered Tone and Manner, begged him not to be so impatient. "Refund then, Sirrah, cries Wild, and perhaps I may take pity on you. What must I refund, answered Bagshot : Every Farthing in your Pocket, replied Wild ; then I may have some Compassion on you, and not only save your Life, but, out of an Excess of Generosity, may return you something." At which Words Bagshot seeming to hesitate, Wild pretended to make to the Door, and rapt out an Oath of Vengeance with so violent an Emphasis, that his Friend no longer presumed to ballance, but suffered Wild to search his Pockets, and draw forth all he found, to the Amount of twenty one Guineas and an half, which last Piece our generous Hero returned him again; telling him, he might now sleep secure, but advised him for the future never to threaten his Friends. imaginable, by Means of those transcendent Qualities which Nature had indulged him with, viz. a bold Heart, a thundering Voice, and a steddy Countenance. Guineas of Bagshot ; for with great and commendable Prudence, he sunk the other eleven in his own Pocket; and told him with that Money he would procure him Bail, which he after prevailed on his Father and another Gentleman of the same Occupation to become for two Guineas each; so that he made lawful Prize of six more; for such were his great Abilities, and so vast the Compass of his Understanding, that he never made any Bargain without over-reaching (or, in the vulgar Phrase, cheating) the Person with whom he dealt. order to procure Credit from Tradesmen, was the taking a handsome House ready furnished in one of the new Streets, in which, as soon as the Count was settled, they proceeded to furnish him with Servants and Equipage, and all the Insignia of a large Estate proper to impose on poor Heartfree .  These being all obtained, Wild made a second Visit to his Friend, and, with much Joy in his Countenance, acquainted him that he had succeeded in his Endeavours, and that the Gentleman had promised to deal with him for the Jewels which he intended to present his Bride, and which were designed to be very splendid and costly; he therefore appointed him to go to the Count the next Morning, and bring with him a Set of the richest and most beautiful Jewels he had, giving him at the same Time some Hints of the Count's Ignorance of that Commodity, and that he might extort what Price of him he pleased; but Heartfree told him, not without some Disdain, that he scorned to take any such Advantage; and, after expressing much Gratitude to his Friend for his Recommendation, he promised to carry the Jewels at the Hour, and to the Place appointed. that he will be very little concerned at any Misfortunes which befal him in the sequel; for, to have no Suspicion that an old School-fellow, with whom he had, in his tenderest Years, contracted a Friendship, and who, on the accidental renewing their Acquaintance, had professed the most passionate Regard for him, should be very ready to impose on him; in short, to conceive that a Friend should, of his own Accord, without any View to his own Interest, endeavour to do him a Service; must argue such Weakness of Mind, such Ignorance of the World, and such an artless, simple, undesigning Heart, as must render the Person possessed of it the lowest Creature, and the properest Object of Contempt imaginable, in the Eyes of every Man of Understanding and Discernment. Wild remembered that his Friend Heartfree's Faults were rather in his Heart than his Head; that tho' he was an abject mean Fellow, and never capable of laying a Design to injure any human Creature, yet was he by no Means a Fool, nor liable to any gross Imposition, unless where his Heart betrayed him.  He therefore instructed the Count to take only one of his Jewels at the first Interview, and to reject the rest as not fine enough, and order him to provide some richer. He said, this Management would prevent Heartfree from expecting ready Money for the Jewel he brought with him, which the Count was presently to dispose of, and by Means of that Money, and his great Abilities at Cards and Dice, to get together as large a Sum as possible, which he was to pay down to Heartfree at the Delivery of the Set of Jewels, who would be thus void of all manner of Suspicion, and would not fail to give him Credit for the residue. propose to make the Imposition on Heartfree, who was (hitherto) void of all Suspicion, but to rob the Count himself of this Sum; this double Method of cheating the very Tools who are their Instruments to cheat others, is the superlative Degree of can carry it, falling very little short of D aemonism itself.

Wild had covenanted with the Count to receive three-fourths of the Booty, and had, at the same time, covenanted with himself to secure the other fourth Part likewise, for which he had formed a very GREAT and noble Design; but he now saw with Concern, that Sum, which was to be received in Hand by Heartfree, in Danger of being absolutely lost.  In order, therefore, to possess himself of that likewise, he contrived, that the Jewels should be brought in the Afternoon, and that Heartfree should be detained before the Count could see him; that the Night should overtake him in his Return, where two of his Gang were ordered to attack and plunder him. Containing Scenes of Softness, Love, and Honour, all in the GREAT Style. by Dexterity, raised to a thousand Pounds; and that Sum he paid down to Heartfree, promising him the rest within a Month.  His House, his Equipage, his Appearance, but, above all, a certain Plausibility in his Voice and Behaviour would have deceived any but one whose GREAT and wise Heart had dictated to him something within, which would have secured him from any Danger of Imposition. Heartfree therefore did not in the least scruple giving him Credit, but as he had, in Reality, procured those Jewels of another, his own little Stock not being able to furnish any thing so valuable, he begged the Count would be so kind to give his Note for the Money, payable at the time he mentioned, which that Gentleman did not in the least scruple; so he paid him the thousand Pound in Specie, and gave his Note for four thousand five hundred Pounds more to Heartfree, who burnt with Gratitude to Wild, for the noble Customer he had recommended to him. As soon as Heartfree was departed, Wild, who waited in another Room, came in, and received the Casket from the Count, it having been agreed between them, that it should be deposited in his Hands, as he was the original Contriver of the Scheme, and was to have the largest Share.  Wild having recived the Casket, offered to meet the Count late that Evening to come to a Division; but such was the latter's Confidence in the Honour of our Hero, that, he said, if it was any Inconvenience to him, the next Morning would do altogether as well. This was more agreeable to Wild, and accordingly an Appointment being made for that purpose, he set out in haste to pursue Heartfree to the Place where the two Gentlemen were ordered to meet and attack him. Those Gentlemen, with noble Resolution, executed their Purpose; they attacked and spoiled the Enemy of the whole Sum he had received from the Count. As soon as the Engagement was over and Heartfree left sprawling on the Ground, our Hero, who wisely declined trusting the Booty in his Friends Hands, tho' he had good Experience of their Honour, made off after the Conquerors; at length they being all at a Place of Safety, Wild, according to a previous Agreement, received nine Tenths of the Booty; the subordinate Heroes did indeed profess some little unwillingness (perhaps more than was strictly consistent with Honour) to perform their Contract; but Wild, partly by Argument, but more by Oaths and Threatnings, prevailed with them to fulfil their Promise. glorious Action to a happy Conclusion, resolved to relax his Mind after his Fatigue, in the Conversation of the Fair. He therefore set forwards to his lovely L aetitia ; but in his Way, accidentally met with a young Lady of his Acquaintance, Miss Molly Straddle, who was taking the Air in Bridges- Street . Miss Molly seeing Mr. Wild, stopp'd him, and with a Familiarity peculiar to a genteel Town Education, tapp'd or rather slapp'd him on the Back, and asked him to treat her with a Pint of Wine, at a neighbouring Tavern.  The Hero, tho' he loved the chaste L aetitia with excessive Tenderness, was not of that low sniveling Breed of Mortals who, as it is generally expressed, tie themselves to a Woman's Apron-Strings ; in a Word, who are tainted with that mean, base, low Vice, of Constancy; he therefore immediately consented, and attended her to a Tavern famous for excellent Wine, known by the Name of the Rummer and Horshoe, where they retired to a Room by themselves.  Wild was very vehement in his Addresses, but to no Purpose; the young Lady declared she would grant no Favour till he had made her a Present; this was immediately complied with, and the Lover made as happy as he could desire. would not suffer him to waste any considerable Time with Miss Straddle . Notwithstanding, therefore, of all the Endearments and Caresses of that young Lady, he soon made an Excuse to go down Stairs, and thence immediately set forward to L aetitia, without taking any formal Leave of Miss Straddle, or indeed of the Drawer, with whom the Lady was afterwards obliged to come to an Account for the Reckoning. home; that young Lady being employed alone, in Imitation of Penelope, with her Thread or Worsted; only with this Difference, that whereas Penelope unravelled by Night what she had knit, or wove, or spun by Day, so what our young Heroine unravelled by Day, she knit again by Night. In short, she was mending a Pair of blue Stockings with red Clocks; a Circumstance which, perhaps, we might have omitted, had it not served to shew that there are still some Ladies of this Age, who imitate the Simplicity of the Ancients. at Home. He then enquired, where she was to be found, and declared, he would not depart till he had seen her; nay, not till he had married her; for, indeed, his Passion for her was truly honourable, in other Words, he had so ungovernable a Desire for her Person, that he would go any Lengths to satisfy it.  He then pulled out the Casket, which he swore was full of the finest Jewels, and that he would give them all to her, with other Promises; which so prevailed on Miss Doshy, who had not the common Failure of Sisters in envying, and often endeavouring to disappoint each other's Happiness; that she desired Mr. Wild to sit down a few Minutes, whilst she endeavoured to find her Sister, and to bring her to him.  The Lover thanked her, and promised to stay till her Return; and Miss Doshy, leaving Mr. Wild to his Meditations, fastened him in the Kitchen by barring the Door (for most of the Doors in this Mansion were made to be bolted on the outside) and then slapping to the Door of the House with great Violence, without going out at it, she stole softly up Stairs, where Miss L aetitia was engaged in close Conference with Mr. Bagshot . Miss Letty, being informed by her Sister in a Whisper of what Mr. Wild had said, and what he had produced, told Mr. Bagshot, that a young Lady was below to visit her, whom she would dispatch with all imaginable Haste, and return to him.  She desired him therefore to stay with Patience for her in the mean Time, and that she would leave the Door unlocked, tho' her Papa would never forgive her if he should discover it.  Bagshot promised on his Honour, not to step without his Chamber; and the two young Ladies went softly down Stairs; when pretending first to make their Entry into the House, they repaired to the Kitchen, where not even the Presence of the chaste L aetitia could restore that Harmony to the Countenance of her Lover, which Miss Theodosia had left him possessed of; for during her Absence he had discovered the Absence of that Purse which had been taken from Mr. Heartfree, and which, indeed, Miss Straddle had in the Warmth of his amorous Caresses, unperceived, drawn from him. However, as he had that perfect Mastery of his Temper, or rather of his Muscles, which is as necessary to form a GREAT Character as to personate it on the Stage, he soon conveyed a Smile into his Countenance, and concealing as well his Misfortune as his Chagrin at it, began to pay honourable Addresses to Miss Letty .  This young Lady, amongst many other good Ingredients, had three very predominant Passions, to wit, Vanity, Wantonness, and Avarice.  To satisfy the first of these, she applied Mr. Smith and Comp. to the second, Mr. Bagshot and Comp. and our Hero had the Honour and Happiness of solely engrossing the third. Now, these three Sorts of Lovers she had very different Ways of entertaining. With the first, she was all gay and coquette; with the second, all fond and rampant; and with the last, all cold and reserved. She, therefore, told Mr. Wild, with a most composed Aspect, that she was glad he had repented of his Manner of treating her at their last Interview, where his Behaviour was so monstrous, that she had resolved never to see him any more; that she was afraid her own Sex would hardly pardon her the Weakness she was guilty of in receding from that Resolution, which she was persuaded she never should have prevailed with herself to do, had not her Sister, who was there to confirm what she said, (as she did with many Oaths) betrayed her into his Company, by pretending it was another Person to visit her:  But however, as he now thought proper to give her more convincing Proofs of his Affection (for he had now the Casket in his Hand) and since she perceived his Designs were no longer against her Virtue, but were such as a Woman of Honour might listen to, she must own---and then she feign'd an Hesitation, when Theodosia began.  "Nay, Sister, I am resolved you shall counterfeit no longer. I assure you, Mr. Wild, she hath the most violent Passion for you in the World; and if you offer to go back, since I plainly see Mr. Wild's Designs are honourable, I will betray all you have ever said. \---How, Sister, (answered L aetitia ) I protest you will drive me out of the Room: I did not expect this Usage from you." Wild then fell on his Knees, and taking hold of her Hand, repeated a Speech which, as the Reader may easily suggest it to himself, I shall not here minutely set down. He then offered her the Casket, but she gently rejected it; and on a second Offer, with a modest Countenance and Voice, desired to know what it contained.  Wild then open'd it, and took forth, (with Sorrow I write it, and with Sorrow will it be read) one of those beautiful Necklaces, with which at the Fair of Bartholomew, they deck the well whitened Neck of Thalestris Queen of the Amazons, Anna Bullen, Queen Elizabeth, or some other High Princess in Drollic Story.  It was indeed composed of that Paste, which Derd aeus Magnus, an ingenious Toyman, doth at a very moderate Price dispose of to the second Rate Beaus of the Metropolis. For, to open a Truth, which we ask our Reader's Pardon for having concealed from him so long; the sagacious Count, wisely fearing, lest some Accident might prevent Mr. Wild's Return at the appointed Time, had carefully conveyed the Jewels which Mr. Heartfree had brought with him, into his own Pocket; and in their Stead had placed in the Casket these artificial Stones, which, tho' of equal Value to a Philosopher, and perhaps of a much greater to a true Admirer of the Compositions of Art, had not however the same Charms in the Eyes of Miss Letty ; who had indeed some Knowledge of Jewels:  For Mr. Snap, with great Reason considering how valuable a Part of a young Lady's Education it would be to have his Daughter instructed in these Things, in an Age when young Ladies learn little more than how to dress themselves, had in her youth, placed Miss Letty as the Handmaid (or House-maid, as the Vulgar call it) of an eminent Pawn-broker.  The lightning, therefore, which should have flashed from the Jewels, flashed from her Eyes, and thunder immediately followed from her Voice. She be-knaved, be-rascalled, be-rogued the unhappy Hero, who stood silent, confounded with Astonishment, but more with Shame and Indignation, at being thus out-witted and over-reached. At length, he recovered his Spirits, and throwing down the Casket in a Rage, he snatched the Key from the Table; and without making any Answer to the Ladies, who both very plentifully open'd upon him, or taking any leave of them, he flew out at the Door, and repaired with the utmost Expedition to the Count's Habitation. In which Wild, after many fruitless Endeavours to discover his Friend, moralizes on his Misfortune in a Speech, which may be of Use (if rightly understood) to some other considerable Speech-Makers. with more Impetuosity, than Wild did at the Count's Door, which was immediately opened by a well-drest Livery Man, who answered, his Master was not at Home. Wild, not satisfied with this, searched the House, but to no purpose; he then ransacked all the Gaming-Houses in Town, but found no Count: Indeed that Gentleman had taken Leave of his House the same Instant Mr. Wild had turned his Back, and, equipping himself with Boots and a Post-horse, without taking with him either Servant, Clothes, or any Necessaries, for the Journey of a great Man, made such mighty Expedition that he was now upwards of twenty Miles on his Way to Harwich . WILD, finding his Search ineffectual, resolved to give it over for that Night; he then retired to his Seat of Contemplation, a Night-Cellar, where, without a single Farthing in his Pocket, he called for a Sneaker of Punch, and, placing himself on a Bench by himself, he softly vented the following Soliloquy: "How vain is human Greatness ! What avail superiour Abilities, and a noble Defiance of those narrow Rules and Bounds which confine the Vulgar; when our best concerted Schemes are liable to be defeated! How unhappy is the State of every Circumvention! It is even as a Game of Chess, where, while the Rook, or Knight, or Bishop, is busied in forecasting some great Enterprize, a worthless Pawn interposes, and disconcerts his Scheme.  Better had it been for me to have observed the simple Laws of Friendship and Morality, than thus to ruin my Friend for the Benefit of others.  I might have commanded his Purse to any degree of Moderation, I have now disabled him from the Power of serving me. Well! but that was not my Design. If I cannot arraign my own Conduct, why should I, like a Woman or a Child, sit down and lament the Disappointment of Chance! But can I acquit myself of all Neglect? Did I not misbehave in putting it into the Power of others to outwit me? But that is impossible to be avoided. In this a Prig is more unhappy than any other: A cautious Man may, in a Crowd, preserve his own Pockets by keeping his Hands in them; but while he employs his Hands in another's Pocket, how shall he be able to defend his own? Indeed in this Light what can be imagined more miserable than a Prig ? How dangerous are his Acquisitions! how unsafe, how unquiet his Possessions! Why then should any Man wish to be a Prig, or where is his Greatness ? I answer, in his Mind:  'Tis the inward Glory, the secret Consciousness of doing great and wonderful Actions, which can alone support the truly GREAT Man, whether he be a Conqueror, a the private Curse and public Imprecation, and while he is hated and detested by all Mankind, must make him inwardly satisfied with himself. For what but some such inward Satisfaction as this could inspire Men possessed of Wealth, of Power, of every human Blessing, which Pride, Avarice, or Luxury could desire, to forsake their Homes, abandon Ease and Repose, and, at the Expence of Riches, Pleasures, at the Price of Labour and Hardship, and at the Hazard of all that Fortune hath liberally given them, could send them at the Head of a Multitude of Prigs, called an Army, to molest their Neighbours; to introduce Rape, Rapine, Bloodshed, and every kind of Misery on their own Species?  What but some such glorious Appetite of Mind could inflame Princes, endowed with the greatest Honours, and enriched with the most plentiful Revenues, to desire maliciously to rob those Subjects, who are content to sweat for their Luxury, and to bow down their Knees to their Pride, of their Liberties, and to reduce them to an absolute Dependence on their own Wills, and those of their brutal Successors!  What other Motive could seduce a Subject, possest of great Property in his Community, to betray the Interest of his Fellow- Subjects, of his Brethren, and his Posterity, to the wanton Disposition of such Princes! Lastly, what less Inducement could persuade the Prig to forsake the Methods of acquiring a safe, an honest, and a plentiful Livelihood, and, at the Hazard of even Life itself and what is mistakenly called Dishonour, to break openly and bravely through the Laws of his Country, for uncertain, unsteddy, and unsafe Gain! Let me then hold myself contented with this Reflection, that I have been wise, though unsuccessful, and am a GREAT, though an unhappy Man. His Soliloquy and his Punch concluded together; for he had at every Pause comforted himself with a Sip. And now it came first into his Head, that it would be more difficult to pay for it, than it was to swallow it, when, to his great Pleasure, he beheld, at another Corner of the Room, one of the Gentlemen whom he had employed in the Attack on Heartfree, and who, he doubted not, would readily lend him a Guinea or two; but he had the Mortification, on applying to him, to hear that the Gaming-Table had stript him of all the Booty which his own Generosity had left in his Possession. He was therefore obliged to pursue his usual Method on such Occasions; so, cocking his Hat fiercely, he marched out of the Room without making any Excuse, or any one daring to make the least Demand. Containing many surprizing Adventures, which our Hero, with great Greatness, atchieved. Snap's, where, at Wild's Departure, the fair Theodosia had again betaken herself to her Stocking, and Miss Letty had retired up Stairs to Mr. Bagshot ; but that Gentleman had broken his Parole, and, having conveyed himself below Stairs behind a Door, he took the Opportunity of Wild's Sally to make his Escape. We shall only observe, that Miss Letty's Surprize was the greater, as she had, notwithstanding her Promise to the contrary, taken the Precaution to turn the Key; but, in her Hurry, she did it ineffectually. How wretched must have been the Situation of this young Creature, who had not only lost a Lover, on whom she perfectly doated, but was exposed to the Rage of an injured Father, tenderly jealous of his Honour, which was deeply engaged to the Sheriff of London and Middlesex, for the safe Custody of the said Bagshot, and for which two very good responsible Friends had given not only their Words but their Bonds. Hero, who, after a successless Search for Miss Straddle, with wonderful Morning to visit his Friend Heartfree, at a Time when the common Herd of Friends would have forsaken and avoided him. He entered the Room with a chearful Air, which he presently changed into Surprize on seeing his Friend in a Night-Gown, with his wounded Head bound about with Linen, and looking extremely pale from a great Profusion of Blood. When Wild was informed by Heartfree what had happened, he first expressed great Sorrow, and afterwards suffered as violent Agonies of Rage against the Robbers to burst from him. This latter, in Compassion to the deep Impressions his Misfortune seemed to make on his Friend, endeavoured to lessen it as much as possible, at the same Time exaggerating the Obligation he owed to Wild, in which his Wife likewise seconded him; and they breakfasted with more Comfort than was reasonably to be expected after such an Accident.  Heartfree expressing great Satisfaction that he had put the four thousand Pound Note in another Pocket-Book, adding, that such a Loss would have been fatal to him; "for, to confess the Truth to you, my dear Friend, said he, I have had some Losses lately, which have greatly perplexed my Affairs, and though I have many Debts due to me from People of great Fashion, I assure you I know not where to be certain of getting a Shilling." Wild greatly felicitated him on the lucky Accident of preserving his Note, and then proceeded, with much Acrimony, to inveigh against the Barbarity of People of Fashion, who kept Tradesmen out of their Money. meditating within himself whether he should borrow or steal from his Friend, or indeed whether he could not effect both, the Apprentice brought a Bank-Note in to Heartfree, which, he said, a Gentlewoman in the Shop, who had been looking at some Jewels, desired him to exchange.  Heartfree looking at the Back of it, immediately perceived the Count's Endorsement, and presently recollected it to be one of those he had been robbed of. With this Discovery he acquainted Wild, who, with the notable Presence of Mind, and unchanged Complexion, so essential to a GREAT Character, advised him to proceed cautiously; and offered, (as Mr. Heartfree himself was, he said, too much flustered to examine the Woman with sufficient Art) to take her into a Room in his House alone. He would, he said, personate the Master of the Shop, would pretend to shew her some Jewels, and would undertake to get sufficient Information out of her to secure the Rogues, and most probably all their Booty. This Proposal was readily and thankfully accepted by Heartfree .  Wild went immediately up Stairs into the Room appointed, whither the Apprentice, according to Appointment, conducted the Lady. Room; and Wild, having shut the Door, approached her with great Ferocity in his Looks, and began to expatiate on the complicated Baseness of the Crime she had been guilty of; but though he uttered many good Lessons of Morality, as we doubt whether from a particular Reason they may work any very good Effect on our Reader, we shall omit his Speech, and only mention his Conclusion, which was by asking her, what Mercy she could now expect from him? The young Lady, who had had a good Education, and had been more than once present at the Old Baily, very confidently denied the whole Charge, and said, she had receiv'd the Note from a Friend.  Wild then, raising his Voice, told her, she should be immediately committed, and she might depend on being convicted; "but," added he, changing his Tone, "as I have a violent Affection for thee, my dear Straddle, if you will follow my Advice, I promise you on my Honour, to forgive you, nor shall you be ever called in Question on this Account.  Why, what would you have me to do, Mr. Wild, replied the young Lady, with a pleasanter Aspect. You must know then, said Wild, the Money you picked out of my Pocket; (nay, by G---d you did, and if you offer to flinch, you shall be convicted of it,) I won at Play of a Fellow who, it seems, robbed my Friend of it; you must, therefore, give an Information on Oath against one Thomas Fierce, and say, that you received the Note from him, and leave the rest to me. I am certain, Molly, you must be sensible of your Obligations to me, who return Good for Evil to you in this manner." The Lady readily consented; and Mr. Wild and she embraced and kissed each other in a very tender and passionate Manner. stay a few Minutes behind him; then returned to his Friend, and acquainted him that he had discovered the whole Roguery, that the Woman had confessed from whom she had received the Note, and had promised to give an Information before a Justice of Peace; adding he was concerned he could not attend him thither, being obliged to go to the other End of the Town to receive thirty Pounds, which he was to pay that Evening.  Heartfree said that should not prevent him of his Company, for he could easily lend him such a Trifle: Which was accordingly done and accepted, and Wild, Heartfree, and the Lady went to the Justice together. who received her Information from Wild of Mr. Fierce's Haunts, he was easily apprehended, and, being confronted with Miss Straddle, who swore positively to him, though she had never seen him before; he was committed to Newgate, where he immediately conveyed an Information to Wild of what had happened, and in the Evening received a Visit from him. WILD affected great Concern for his Friend's Misfortune, and as great Surprize at the Means by which it was brought about.  However, he said, he must certainly be mistaken in that Point, of his having had no Acquaintance with her; that, as for the Note, he had himself paid it away to a Shopkeeper, and would endeavour, by all safe Means, to enquire into the Secrets of the Matter; that he would find out Miss Straddle, and endeavour to take off her Evidence; which, he observed, did not come home enough to endanger him; besides he would secure him Witnesses of an Alib i, and five or six to his Character; so that he need be under no Apprehension, for his Confinement till the Sessions would be his only Punishment. FIERCE, who was greatly comforted by these Assurances of his Friend, returned him many Thanks, and both shaking each other very earnestly by the Hand, with a very hearty Embrace they separated. Straddle would not be sufficient to convict Fierce, whom he resolved to hang, as he was the Person who had principally refused to deliver him the stipulated Share of the Booty; he therefore went in Quest of Mr. James Sly, the Gentleman who had assisted in the Exploit; and found, and acquainted him with the apprehending of Fierce .  Wild then intimating his Fear, lest Fierce should impeach Sly, advised him to be beforehand, and go directly to a Justice of Peace, and offer himself as an Evidence. Sly approved Mr. Wild's Opinion, went directly to a Magistrate, and was by him committed to the Gate-house, with a Promise of being admitted Evidence against his Companion. FIERCE was, in a few Days, brought to his Trial at the Old Baily, when, to his great Confusion, his old Friend Sly appeared against him, as did Miss Straddle . His only Hopes were now in the Assistance which our Hero had promised him. These unhappily failed him:  So that the Evidence being plain against him, and he making no Defence, the Jury convicted him, the Court condemned him, and Mr. Ketch executed him. the Passions of Men, and to set them at Variance with each other, and to work his own Purposes out of those Jealousies and Apprehensions, which he was wonderfully ready at creating, by Means of those great Arts, which the Vulgar call Treachery, Dissembling, Promising, Lying, Falshood, & c. but which are by great Men summed up in the collective Name of Policy, or Politicks, or rather Pollitricks ; an Art of which, as it is the highest Excellence of Human Nature, so perhaps, was our great Man the most eminent Master. Of Hats. Gamesters, ruined Bailiffs, broken Tradesmen, idle Apprentices, and loose and disorderly Youth, who being born to no Fortune, nor bred to no Trade or Profession, were willing to live luxuriously without Labour. As these Persons wore different Principles, i. e. Hats, frequent Dissentions grew among them. There were particularly two Parties, viz. those who wore Hats fiercely cocked, and those who preferr'd the Nab or Trencher Hat, with the Brim flapping over their Eyes; between which, Jars and Animosities almost perpetually arose.  Wild, therefore, having assembled them all at an Alehouse on the Night after Fierce's Execution, and perceiving evident Marks of their Misunderstanding, from their Behaviour to each other, addressed them in the following gentle, but forcible Manner ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 8 .  "Gentlemen, I am ashamed to see Men embarked in so GREAT and glorious an Undertaking, as that of robbing the Publick, so foolishly and weakly dissenting among themselves.  Do you think the first Inventors of Hats, or at least of those Distinctions between them, really conceived that one Form of Hats should inspire a Man with Divinity, another with Law, another with Learning, or another with Bravery? No, they meant no more by these outward Signs, than to impose on the Vulgar, and instead of putting great Men to the Trouble of acquiring or maintaining the Substance, to make it sufficient that they condescend to wear the Type or Shadow of it. You do wisely, therefore, when in a Crowd, to amuse the Mob by Quarrels on such Accounts, that while they are listening to your Jargon, you may with the greater Ease and Safety, pick their Pockets: But surely to be in earnest, and privately to keep up such a ridiculous Contention among yourselves, must argue the highest Folly and Absurdity.  When you know you are all Prigs, what Difference can a broad or a narrow Brim create?  Is a Prig less a Prig in one Hat than in another? If the Public should be weak enough to interest themselves in your Quarrels, and to prefer one Pack to the other, while both are aiming at their Purses; it is your Business to laugh at, not imitate their Folly. What can be more ridiculous than for Gentlemen to quarrel about Hats, when there is not one among you, whose Hat is worth a Farthing. What is the Use of a Hat, farther than to keep the Head warm, or to hide a bald Crown from the Public? It is the Mark of a Gentleman to move his Hat on every Occasion; and in Courts and noble Assemblies, no man ever wears one. Let me hear no more therefore of this Childish Disagreement, but all toss up your Hats together with one Accord, and consider that Hat as the best, which will contain the largest Booty." He thus ended his Speech, which was followed by a murmuring Applause, and immediately all present tossed their Hats together, as he had commanded them. Shewing the Consequences which attended Heartfree's Adventures with Wild ; all natural, and common enough to little Wretches who deal with great Men ; together with some Precedents of Letters, being the different Methods of answering a Dun. hundred Pound which he had paid away, was returned, with an Account that the Acceptor was not to be found, and that on enquiring after him, they had heard he was run away, and consequently the Money was now demanded of the Endorser. The Apprehension of such a Loss would have affected any Man of Business, but much more one whose unavoidable Ruin it must prove.  He expressed so much Concern and Confusion on this Occasion, that the Proprietor of the Note was frightned, and resolved to lose no Time in securing what he could. So that in the Afternoon of the same Day, Mr. Snap was commissioned to pay Heartfree a Visit, which he did with his usual Formality, and conveyed him to his own House. Husband, than she raved like one distracted; but after she had vented the first Agonies of her Passion in Tears and Lamentations, she applied herself to all possible Means to procure her Husband's Liberty. She hastened to beg her Neighbours to secure Bail for him. But as the News had arrived at their Houses before her, she found none of them at home, except an honest Quaker, whose Servants durst not tell a Lie. However, she succeeded no better with him, for unluckily he had made an Affirmation the Day before, that he would never be Bail for any Man. After many fruitless Efforts of this Kind, she repaired to her Husband to comfort him, at least with her Presence.  She found him sealing the last of several Letters, which he had dispatched to his Friends and Creditors.  The Moment he saw her, a sudden Joy sparkled in his Eyes, which, however, had a very short Duration; for Despair soon clouded them again; nor could he help bursting into some passionate Expressions of Concern for her and the little Family; which she, on her Part, did her utmost to lessen, by endeavouring to mitigate the Loss, and raise in him Hopes from the Count, who might, she said, be possibly, only gone into the Country. She comforted him likewise, with the Expectation of Favour from his Acquaintance, especially those whom he had in a particular Manner obliged and served. Lastly, she conjured him, by all the Value and Esteem he professed for her, not to endanger his Health, on which alone depended her Happiness, by too great an Indulgence of Grief; assuring him that no State of Life could appear unhappy to her with him, unless his own Sorrow or Discontent made it so. Husband's Pains, which it would have rather become her to aggravate, by not only painting out his Misery in the liveliest Colours imaginable, but by upbraiding him with that Folly and Confidence which had occasioned it, and by lamenting her own hard Fate, in being obliged to share his Sufferings. warmest Gratitude, and they past an Hour in a Scene of Tenderness, too low and contemptible to be recounted to our GREAT Readers. We shall therefore omit all such Relations, as they tend only to make human Nature low and ridiculous. We shall here copy a few of them, as they may serve for Precedents to others who have an Occasion, which happens commonly enough in genteel Life, to answer the Impertinence of a Dun. Assurance in asking for Money, which you know hath been so little while due; however, as he intends to deal no longer at your Shop, he hath ordered me to pay you as soon as I shall have Cash in Hand, which, considering many Disbursements for Bills long due, & c. can't possibly promise any Time, & c. at present. And am your humble Servant, am at present incapable of paying a Farthing; but as I doubt not, very shortly, not only to content that small Bill, but likewise to lay out very considerable further Sums at your House, hope you will meet with no Inconvenience by this short Delay in, dear Sir, Your most sincere humble Servant for as I know you to be a very good natured Man, I will trust you with a Secret; he gave me the Money long since, to discharge it, which I had the ill Luck to lose at play. You may be assured I will satisfy you the first Opportunity, and am, Sir, Your very humble Servant Please to present my Service to Mrs. Heartfree. Your humble Servant Request, especially after so many Obligations received on my Side, of which I shall always entertain the most grateful Memory. I am very greatly concerned at your Misfortunes, and would have waited upon you in Person, but am not at present very well, and besides, am obliged to go this Evening to Vaux-hall . I am, Sir, Your most obliged humble Servant our Reader a Taste only. Of all these, the last was infinitely the most grating to poor Heartfree, as it came from one to whom, when in Distress, he had himself lent a considerable Sum, and of whose present flourishing Circumstances he was well assured. In which our Hero carries Greatness to an immoderate Height. Ingratitude, and present the much more agreeable Portrait of that Assurance to which the French very properly annex the Epithet of Good .  Heartfree had scarce done reading his Letters, when our Hero appeared before his Eyes, not with that Aspect with which a pitiful Parson meets his Patron, after having opposed him at an Election, or which a Doctor wears, when sneaking away from a Door, where he is informed of his Patient's Death; not with that down-cast Countenance which betrays the Man, who, after a strong Conflict between Virtue and Vice, hath surrendered his Mind to the latter, and is discovered in his first Treachery; but with that noble, bold, GREAT Confidence with which a Prime Minister assures his Dependent, that the Place he promised him was disposed of before.  And such Concern and Uneasiness as he expresses in his Looks on those Occasions did Wild testify on the first Meeting of his Friend. And as the said Prime Minister chides you for Neglect of your Interest, in no having asked in Time, so did our Hero attack Heartfree for his giving Credit to the Count, and without suffering him to answer a Word, proceeded in a Torrent of Words to overwhelm him with Abuse; which, however friendly its Intention might be, was scarce to be outdone by an Enemy.  By these Means Heartfree, who might perhaps otherwise have vented some little Concern for that Recommendation which Wild had given him to the Count, was totally prevented from any such Endeavour, and, like an invading Prince, when attacked in his own Dominions, forced to recall his whole Strength to defend himself at home.  This indeed he did so well by insisting on the Figure and outward Appearance of the Count and his Equipage, that Wild at length grew a little more gentle, confessing that he had the least Reason of all Mankind to censure another for an Imprudence of this Nature, as he was himself the most easily to be imposed upon, and indeed had been so by this Count, who, if he was insolvent, had, he said, cheated him of five hundred Pounds. "But, for my own Part, said he, I will not yet despair, nor would I have you. Many Men have found it convenient to retire, or abscond for a while, and afterwards have paid their Debts, or at least handsomely compounded them.  This I am certain of, should a Composition take place, which is the worst can be apprehended, I shall be the only Loser; for I shall think myself obliged in Honour to repair your Loss, even though you must confess it was principally owing to your own Folly.  Z---ds! had I imagined it necessary, I would have cautioned you; but I thought the Part of the Town where he lived, sufficient Caution not to trust him. \---And such a Sum--- The Devil must have been in you certainly!" Wild, was now thoroughly satisfied of his Innocence, and begged him not to insist any longer on what he perceived so deeply affected her Husband. She said, Trade could not be carried on without Credit, and surely he was sufficiently justified in giving it to such a Person as the Count appeared to be. Besides, she said, Reflections on what was past and irretrievable would be of little Service; that their present Business was to consider how to prevent the evil Consequences which threatened, and first to endeavour to procure her Husband his Liberty. Why doth he not procure Bail? said Wild . Alas! Sir, said she, we have applied to many of our Acquaintance in vain; we have met with Excuses even where we could least expect them.  "Not Bail! answered Wild, in a Passion, he shall have Bail, if there is any in the World.  It is now very late, but trust me to procure him Bail to Morrow Morning." was a Friend indeed. She then proposed to stay that Evening with her Husband; but he would not permit her, on account of his little Family, whom he would not agree to trust to the Care of Servants in this Time of Confusion. A Hackney Coach was then sent for, but without Success; for these, like Hackney Friends, always offer themselves in the Sun-shine, but are never to be found when you want them. And as for a Chair, Mr. Snap lived in a Part of the Town which Chairmen very little frequent. The good Woman was therefore obliged to walk home, whither the gallant Wild offered to attend her as a Protector.  This Favour was thankfully accepted, and the Husband and Wife having taken a tender Leave of each other, the former was locked in, and the latter lock'd out by the Hands of Mr. Snap himself. As this Visit of Mr. Wild's to Heartfree may seem one of those Passages in History, which Writers, Drawcansir -like, introduce only because they dare ; indeed as it may seem somewhat contradictory to the Greatness of our Hero, and may tend to blemish his Character with an Imputation of that kind of Friendship, which favours too much of Weakness and Imprudence; it may be necessary therefore to account for this Visit, especially to our more sagacious Readers, whose Satisfaction we shall always consult in the most especial Manner.  They are to know then, that at the first Interview with Mrs. Heartfree, Mr. Wild had conceived that Passion, or Affection, or Friendship, or Desire for that handsome Creature, which the Gentlemen of this our Age agree to call LOVE; and which is indeed no other than that Friendship which, after the Exercise of the Dominical Day is over, a lusty Divine is apt to conceive for the well-drest Sirloin, or handsome Buttock, which the well- edified 'Squire, in Gratitude, sets before him, and which, so violent is his Love, he is desirous to devour.  Not less ardent was the hungry Passion of our Hero, who, from the Moment he had cast his Eyes on that charming Dish, cast about in his Mind by what Method he might come at it. This, as he perceived, might most easily be effected after the Ruin of Heartfree, which, for other Considerations, he had intended. So he postponed all Endeavours for this purpose, till he had first effected what, by Order of Time, was particularly to precede this latter Design; with such Regularity and true Greatness did this our Hero conduct all his Schemes, and so truly superiour was he to all the Efforts of Passion, which so often disconcert and disappoint the noblest Views of others. More Greatness in Wild . A low Scene between Mrs. Heartfree and her Children, and a Scheme of our Hero, worthy the highest Admiration, and even Astonishment. Metaphor) from the Proprietor, he had projected a Design of conveying her to one of those Eating-Houses in Covent-Garden, where female Flesh is deliciously drest, and served up to the greedy Appetites of young Gentlemen; but fearing lest she should not come readily enough into his Wishes, and that, by too eager and hasty a Pursuit, he should frustrate his future Expectations, and luckily at the same Time a noble Hint suggesting itself to him, by which he might almost inevitably secure his Pleasure, together with his Profit, he contented himself with waiting on Mrs. Heartfree home, and, after many Protestations of Friendship and Service to her Husband, took his Leave, and promised to visit her early in the Morning, and conduct her back to Mr. Snap's . WILD now retired to a Night-Cellar, where he found several of his Acquaintance, with whom he spent the remaining Part of the Night in revelling; nor did the least Compassion for Heartfree's Misfortunes disturb the Pleasure of his Cups. So truly GREAT was his Soul, that it was absolutely composed, save that an Apprehension of Miss Tishy's making some Discovery (as she was then in no good Temper towards him) a little ruffled and disquieted the perfect Serenity he would otherwise have enjoyed. As he had, therefore, no Opportunity of seeing her that Evening, he wrote her a Letter full of ten thousand Protestations of honourable Love, and (which he more depended on) containing as many Promises, in order to bring the young Lady into good Humour, without acquainting her in the least with his Suspicion, or giving her any Caution:  For it was his constant Maxim, Never to put it into any one's Head to do you a Mischief, by acquainting them that it is in their Power. great Agonies and Horrour for the Absence of her Husband, as a fine well-bred Woman would feel at the Return of her's from a long Voyage or Journey. In the Morning the Children being brought to her, the eldest asked where dear Papa was ? At which she could not refrain from bursting into Tears. The Child perciving it, said, Don't cry, Mamma, I am sure Papa would not stay abroad, if he could help it . At which Words she caught the Child in her Arms, and throwing herself into the Chair, in an Agony of Passion, cried out, No, my Child, nor shall all the Malice of Hell keep us long asunder . seven Readers only, have inserted, had they not served to shew, that there are Weaknesses in vulgar Life, which are commonly called Tenderness ; to which great Minds are so entirely Strangers, that they have not even an Idea of them; and, secondly, by exposing the Folly of this low Creature, to set off and elevate that Greatness, which we endeavour to draw a true Portrait of in this History. WILD entering the Room, found the Mother with one Child in her Arms, and the other at her Knee. After paying her his Compliments, he desired her to dismiss the Children and Servant, for that he had something of GREAT Moment to impart to her. him with great Eagerness if he had succeeded in his Intentions of procuring the Bail. He answered, he had not endeavoured at it yet; for a Scheme had entered into his Head, by which she might certainly preserve her Husband, herself, and her Family.  In order to which he advised her instantly to remove with the most valuable Jewels she had to Holland, before any Statute of Bankruptcy issued to prevent her; that he would himself attend her thither, and place her in Safety, and then return to deliver her Husband, who would be easily able to satisfy his Creditors.  He added, that he was that Instant come from Snap's, where he had communicated the Scheme to Heartfree, who had greatly approved it, and desired her to put it in Execution without Delay, concluding that a Moment was not to be lost. Woman's Breast, she only desired a Moment's Time to pay him a Visit, in order to take her Leave. But Wild peremptorily refused; he said by every Moment's Delay she risqued the Ruin of her Family; that she would be absent only a few Days from him; adding, that if she had not Resolution enough to execute the Commands he brought her from her Husband, his Ruin would lie at her Door, and, for his own Part, he must give up any farther meddling in his Affairs. permit it, saying, they would only retard their Flight, and that it would be properer for her Husband to bring them. He at length absolutely prevailed on this poor Woman, who immediately packed up the most valuable Effects she could find, and, after taking a tender Leave of her Infants, earnestly commended them to the Care of a very faithful Servant. Then they called a Hackney-Coach, which conveyed them to an Inn, where they were furnished with a Chariot and six, in which they set forward for Harwich . WILD rode with an exulting Heart; secure, as he now thought himself, of the Possession of that lovely Woman, together with a rich Cargo. In short, he enjoyed in his Mind all the Happiness which unbridled Lust and rapacious Avarice could promise him. As to the poor Creature, who was to satisfy these Passions, her whole Soul was employed in reflecting on the Condition of her Husband and Children. A single Word scarce escaped her Lips; while a Flood of Tears gushed from her brilliant Eyes, which, if I may use a coarse Expression, served only as delicious Sauce to heighten the Appetite of Wild . Sea-Adventures very new and surprizing. there, just ready to depart for Rotterdam . So they went immediately on Board, and sailed with a fair Wind; but they had hardly proceeded out of Sight of Land, when a sudden and violent Storm arose, and drove them to the South West; so that the Captain apprehended it impossible to avoid the Goodwin Sands, and he and all his Crew gave themselves for lost.  Mrs. Heartfree, who had no other Apprehensions from Death, but those of leaving her dear Husband and Children, fell on her Knees to beseech the Almighty's Favour, when Wild, with a Contempt of Danger truly GREAT, took a Resolution as worthy to be admired perhaps as any recorded of the bravest Hero, ancient or modern.  He saw the Tyrant Death ready to rescue from him his intended Prey, which he had yet devoured only in Imagination. He therefore swore he would prevent him, and immediately attacked the poor Wretch, who was in the utmost Agonies of Despair, first with Solicitation, and afterwards with Force. present Temper of Mind, and in the Opinion she held of him, she did not immediately, rejected him with all the Repulses which Indignation and Horrour could animate: But when he attempted Violence, she filled the Cabin with her Shrieks, which were so vehement, that they reached the Ears of the Captain, the Storm at this Time luckily abating.  This Man, who was a Brute rather from his Education, and the Element he inhabited, than from Nature, ran hastily down to her Assistance, and finding her struggling on the Ground with our Hero, he presently rescued her from her intended Ravisher; who was soon obliged to quit the Woman, in order to engage with her lusty Champion, who spared neither Pains nor Blows in the Assistance of his said Passenger. powered with Numbers, who came down on their Captain's Side, would have been victorious; the Captain rapped out a hearty Oath, and asked Wild, If he had no more Christianity in him than to ravish a Woman in a Storm ! To which the other GREATLY and sullenly answered: "It was very well; but d---n him, if he had not Satisfaction the Moment they came on Shore." The Captain replied, Kiss \--- & c. and then, turning Wild out of the Cabin, he, at Mrs Heartfree's Request, locked her into it, and returned to the Care of his Ship. ruffling of the Sea after it, when one of the Sailors spied a Sail at a Distance, which the Captain wisely apprehended might be a Privateer (for we were then engaged in a War with France ) and immediately ordered all the Sail possible to be crowded; but his Caution was in vain; for the little Wind which then blew, was directly adverse; so that the Ship bore down upon them, and soon appeared to be what the Captain had feared, a French Privateer. He was in no Condition of Resistance, and immediately struck on her firing the first Gun. The Captain of the Frenchman, with several of his Hands, came on Board the English Vessel; which they rifled of every thing valuable, and, amongst the rest, poor Mrs. Heartfree's whole Cargo, and then taking the Crew, together with the two Passengers, aboard his own Ship, he determined as the other would be only a Burthen to him, to sink her, she being very old and leaky, and not worth going back with to Dunkirk .  He preserved, therefore, nothing but the Boat, as his own was none of the best, and then pouring a Broad-side into her, he sent her to the bottom. was presently enamoured to no small Degree with his beautiful Captive; and imagining Wild, from some Words he dropt, to be her Husband, notwithstanding the ill Affection towards him which appeared in her Looks, he asked her, if she understood French ? She answered in the Affirmative, for indeed she did perfectly well. He then asked her, how long she and that Gentleman (pointing to Wild ) had been married? She answered with a deep Sigh, and many Tears, that she was married indeed, but not to that Villain, who was the sole Cause of all her Misfortunes. That Appellation raised a Curiosity in the Captain, and he importuned her in so pressing, but gentle a manner to acquaint him with the Injuries she complained of, that she was at last prevailed on to recount to him the whole History of her Afflictions.  This so moved the Captain, who had too little Notions of Greatness, and so incensed him against our Hero, that he resolved to punish him; and, without Regard to the Laws of War, he immediately ordered out his shattered Long-boat, and, making Wild a Present of half-a-dozen Biscuits to prolong his Misery, he put them therein, and then committing him to the Mercy of the Sea, proceeded on his Cruize. The GREAT and wonderful Behaviour of our Hero in the Boat. Captive, or rather Conqueror, had no little Share in promoting this extraordinary Act of illegal Justice; for he had conceived the same Sort of Passion, or Hunger, which Wild himself had felt, and was as much resolved, by some Means or other, to satisfy it.  We will leave him, however, at present, in the Pursuit of his Wishes, and attend our Hero in his Boat; since it is in Circumstances of Distress, that true Greatness appears most wonderful.  For, that a Prince in the midst of his Courtiers, all ready to compliment him with his favourite Character, or Title; or that a Conqueror, at the Head of an hundred thousand Men, all prepared to execute his Will, how ambitious, wanton, or cruel soever, should, in the Giddiness of his Pride, elevate himself many Degrees above those his Tools, seems not difficult to be imagined, or indeed accounted for. But that a Man in Chains, in Prisons, nay, in the vilest Dungeon, should with persevering Pride and obstinate Dignity, discover that vast Superiority in his own Nature over the rest of Mankind, who, to a vulgar Eye, seem much happier than himself; nay, that he should discover Heaven and Providence (whose peculiar Care, it seems, he is) at that very Time at work for him; this is among the Arcana of Greatness, to be perfectly understood only by an Adept in that Science. this Season, floating in a little Boat on the open Seas, without Oar, without Sail, and at the Mercy of the first Wave to overwhelm him; which was indeed a much more eligible Fate than that alternative, which threatened him with almost unavoidable Certainty, viz. Starving with Hunger, the sure Consequence of a Continuance of the Calm. Blasphemies, which the Reader, without being over pious, might be offended at seeing repeated. He then accused the whole Female Sex, and the Passion of Love (as he called it) particularly that which he bore to Mrs. Heartfree, as the unhappy Occasion of his present Sufferings. At length, finding himself descending too much into the Language of Meanness and Complaint, he stopp'd short, and soon after broke forth as follows. "D---n it, a Man can die but once, what signifies it!  Every Man must die, and when it is over it is over.  I never was afraid of any thing yet, nor I won't begin now; no, d---n me, won't I. What signifies Fear? I shall die whether I am afraid or no: Who's afraid then, d---n me?" At which Words he looked extremely fierce, but recollecting that no one was present to see him, he abated the Terror of his Countenance, and pausing a little, repeated the Word, D---n! "Suppose I should be d---ned at last, when I never thought a Syllable of the Matter. I have often laughed and made a Jest about it, and yet it may be so, for any Thing which I know to the contrary. If there should be another World it will go hard with me, that is certain. I shall never escape for what I have done to Heartfree . The Devil must have me for that undoubtedly. The Devil! Pshaw! I am not such a Fool to be frightned at him neither. No, no; when a Man's dead, there is an End of him. I wish I was certainly satisfied of it tho'; for there are some Men of Learning of a different Opinion.  It is but a bad Chance methinks I stand.  If there be no other World, why I shall be in no worse Condition than a Block or a Stone: But if there should,---D---n me, I will think no longer about it. \---Let a Pack of cowardly Rascals be afraid of Death, I dare look him in the Face. But shall I stay and be starved! \---No, I will eat up the Biscuits the French Son of a Whore bestowed on me, and then leap into the Sea for Drink, since the unconscionable Dog hath not allowed me a single Dram." Having thus said, he proceeded immediately to put his Purpose in Execution, and as his Resolution never failed him, he had no sooner dispatched the small Quantity of Provision, which his Enemy had with no vast Liberality presented him, than he cast himself headlong into the Sea. Of Proverbs . A Chapter full of very cunning and curious Learning. Usefulness of that Learning, which is to be collected from those Funds of Knowledge, called PROVERBS: Being short Aphorisms, in which Men of Great Genius have wrapt up some egregious Discovery, either in Nature or Science, making it thus easily portable for the Memory, which is apt to fail under the Burthen of voluminous Erudition. Next, therefore, to the Merit of those Sages who first drop'd these inestimable Pearls, are we obliged to their Care and Industry, who have collected them together.  And here, as it would be needless to add to the Encomiums given to Erasmus on this Occasion, I shall pass on to the incomparable Publisher of Joe Miller's Jests; whether he be the lamentable Elijah Jenkins Esq; or the facetious Edmundus de Crull Esq; is not very material.  In these, as the learned Lord Bacon says of the Proverbs of Solomon, We see not a few profound and excellent Cautions, Precepts, Positions, extending to much Variety of Occasions, whereupon we will stay a while offering to Consideration some Number of Examples.

ARGUMENTS among Men are like Bones among Dogs; serve to set them together by the Ears. Ergo, an Argument is called a Bone of Contention. THE Chimney and the Garret are related, and therefore Taylors and Chimney- Sweepers are Cousin-Germans. This is not to be understood literally but metaphorically. Taylors are in very great Contempt among the English, nine of them being said to make only one Man; and in the Play-House the Public express their Contempt of your Judgment by calling you a Taylor. Some imagine this to proceed from the ancient Britons going naked, and consequently never using this Mechanic: But I rather apprehend the Reason to be from the Moderns using him so much that they are never out of his Books.

Here are five excellent Things brought together in the Compass of two or three Lines. DEBAUCHING a Member of the House of Commons from his Principles, and creating him a Peer, is not much better than making a Woman a Whore, and afterwards marrying her. Here a Member of the House of Commons is set forth in the lovely State of virgin Simplicity and Innocence, and it is insinuated that if you first debauch him from that State of Purity and make him a Rogue, he remains a Rogue still, notwithstanding a subsequent Peerage; as a Woman who is debauched remains a Whore still, notwithstanding a subsequent Marriage. And this the Proverb would say farther, notwithstanding the World calls the former Right Honourable, and the latter an HONEST Woman. somewhat longer on these Sentences than is agreeable to the Proportion of an Example, and perhaps offended some, who will direct the Force of this Chapter (if it have any) where it was little meant; I now return to our Hero, who, to the Surprise, I apprehend, of the Reader, exemplified the Truth of one Proverb, viz. He that is born to be hang'd will never be drowned ; which, as Shakespear phrases it, may be somewhat musty ; but I am convinced never had so pregnant an Example of its Veracity before. The strange and yet natural Escape of our Hero. Sea, as we have mentioned, was miraculously within two Minutes after replaced in his Boat; and this without the Assistance of a Dolphin or Sea-Horse, or any other Fish or Animal, who are always as ready at Hand when a Poet or Historian pleases to call for them to carry a Hero through a Sea; as any Chairman at a Coffee-House Door near St. James's, to convey a Beau over a Street, and preserve his white Stockings.  The Truth is, we do not chuse to have any Recourse to Miracles, from the strict Observance we pay to that Rule of Horace,  Nec Deus intersit nisi dignus vindice nodus. The Meaning of which is, Do not bring in a supernatural Agent when you can do without him ; and indeed, we are much deeper read in natural than supernatural Causes. We will therefore endeavour to account for this extraordinary Event from the former of these; and in doing this it will be necessary to disclose some profound Secrets to our Reader, extremely well worth his knowing, and which may serve him to account for many Occurrences of the Ph aenomenous Kind which have lately appeared in this our Hemisphere. Females the most obstinate, and tenacious of her Purpose. So true is that Observation,  Naturam expellas furca licet, usque recurret. Which I need not render in English, it being to be found in a Book which most fine Gentlemen read. Whatever Nature, therefore, purposes to herself, she never suffers any Reason, Design or Accident, to frustrate. Now, tho' it may seem to a shallow Observer, that some Persons were designed by Nature for no Use or Purpose whatever; yet certain it is, that no Man is born into the World without his particular Allotment; viz. some to be Kings, some Statesmen, some Embassadors, some Bishops, some Generals, and so on. Of these there be two Kinds, those to whom Nature is so generous to give some Endowment, qualifying them for the Parts she intends them afterwards to act on this Stage; and those whom she uses as Instances of her unlimited Power; and for whose Preferment to such and such Stations, Solomon himself could have invented no other Reason than that Nature designed them so.  These latter some great Philosophers have, to shew them to be the Favourites of Nature, distinguished by the honourable Appellation of Naturals .  Indeed the true Reason of the general Ignorance of Mankind on this Head seems to be this; That as Nature chuses to execute these her Purposes by certain second Causes or Tools, and as many of these second Causes seem so totally foreign to her Design, the Wit of Man, which like his Eye, sees best directly forward and very little and imperfectly, what is oblique, is not able to discern the End by the Means. Thus, how a handsome Wife or Daughter should contribute to execute her original Designation of a General; or how Flattery should denote a Judge, or Impiety and Atheism, a Bishop, he is not capable of comprehending. And indeed, we ourselves, wise as we are, are forced to reason ab effectu, and if we were asked what Nature had intended such Men for, before she herself had by the Event demonstrated her Purpose, it is possible we might be sometimes puzzled to declare; for it must be confessed, that at first Sight, and to a Man uninspired, great Fortitude of Mind with a vast Capacity and Knowledge, might induce a Belief in the Beholder, that such Endowments were by Nature designed for Power and Honour rather than the reverse; whereas daily Experience convinces us of the contrary, and drives us as it were into the Opinion I have here disclosed. Now, Nature having originally intended our great Man for that final Exaltation, which as it is the most proper and becoming End of all great Men, it were heartily to be wished they might all arrive at; would by no Means be diverted from her Purpose. She therefore no sooner spied him in the Water, then she softly whispered in his Ear to attempt the Recovery of his Boat; which Call he immediately obeyed, and being a good Swimmer with great Facility accomplished it. is very naturally accounted for; and our Relation rescued from the Prodigious which, tho' it often occurs in Biography, is not to be encouraged nor much commended on any Occasion, unless when absolutely necessary to prevent the History's being at an End. Secondly, We hope our Hero is justified from that Imputation of want of Resolution, which must be fatal to the Greatness of his Character. The Conclusion of the Boat Adventure, and the End of the second Book. in a Condition not much to be envied by any Passion of the human Mind, unless by Ambition; which, provided it can only entertain itself with the most distant Music of Fame's Trumpet, can disdain all the Pleasures of the Sensualist, and those more solemn, tho' quieter Comforts, which a good Conscience suggests to a Christian Philosopher. cursing, and sometimes singing and whistling.  At last, when Cold and Hunger had almost subdued his native Fierceness, it being a good deal past Midnight, and extremely dark, he thought he beheld a Light at a Distance, which the Cloudiness of the Sky prevented his mistaking for a Star; This Light, however, did not seem to approach him, at least by such imperceptible Degrees, that it gave him very little Comfort, and at length totally forsook him.  He then renewed his Contemplation as before, in which he continued till the Day began to break; when, to his inexpressible Delight, he beheld a Sail at a very little Distance, and which luckily seemed to be making towards him. He was likewise soon espied by those in the Vessel, who wanted no Signals to inform them of his Distress, and as it was almost a Calm, and their Course lay within five hundred Yards of him, they hoisted out their Boat and fetched him aboard. Norway, and had been extremely shattered in the late Storm.  This Captain was of that kind of Men, who are actuated by a general Humanity, and whose Compassion can be raised by the Distress of a Fellow- Creature, though of a Nation whose King had quarrelled with the Monarch of their own.  He therefore commiserating the Circumstances of Wild, who had drest up a Story proper to impose on such a silly Fellow; told him, that, as himself well knew, he must be a Prisoner on his Arrival in France, but that he would endeavour to procure his Redemption; for which our Hero greatly thanked him. But as they were making very slow Sail (for they had lost their Main-mast in the Storm) Wild saw a little Vessel at a Distance, they being within a few Legues of the English Shore, which, on Enquiry, he was informed was probably an English Fishing-Boat. And, it being then perfectly calm, he promised, that if they would accommodate him with an Oar, he could get within Reach of the Boat, at least near enough to make Signals to her; and he preferred any Risque to the certain Fate of being a Prisoner.  As his Courage was somewhat restored by the Provisions (especially Brandy) with which the Frenchman had supplied him, he was so earnest in his Entreaties, that the Captain, after many Persuasions, at length complied; and he was furnished with an Oar, with some Bread, Pork, and a Bottle of Brandy.  Then, taking Leave of his Preservers, he again betook himself to his Boat, and rowed so heartily, that he soon came within the Sight of the Fisherman, who immediately made towards him, and took him aboard. No sooner was Wild got safe on Board the Fisherman, than he begged him to make the utmost Speed into Deal ; for that the Vessel, which was still in Sight, was a distressed Frenchman, bound for Havre de Grace, and might easily be made a Prize, if there was any Ship ready to go in Pursuit of her. So nobly and GREATLY did our Hero neglect all Obligations conferred on him by the Enemies of his Country, that he would have contributed all he could to the taking his Benefactor, to whom he owed both his Life and his Liberty. Reader will, I doubt not, be as much concerned as Wild was, that there was not a single Ship prepared to go on the Expedition. at some Distance from that City where Men of Ingenuity can most easily supply their Wants without the Assistance of Money. However, as his Talents were superiour to every Difficulty, he framed so dextrous an Account of his being a Merchant, having been taken and plundered by the Enemy, and of his great Effects in London, that he was not only heartily regaled by the Fisherman at his House; but made so handsome a Booty by way of Borrowing, a Method of taking which we have before mentioned, to have his Approbation, that he was enabled to provide himself with a Place in the Stage-Coach; which (as God permitted it to perform the Journey) brought him, at the appointed time, to an Inn in the Metropolis. Glory, we will a little look back on the Fortunes of Mr. Heartfree, whom we left in no very pleasant Situation, especially as the Behaviour of this poor Wretch will considerably serve to set off the GREAT and exemplary Conduct of our Hero; but of this we shall treat in the next Book. THE HISTORY OF THE LIFE of the late Mr. Jonathan Wild the Great. BOOK III. The low and pitiful Behaviour of Heartfree ; and the foolish Conduct of his Apprentice. Eyes. On the contrary, he slept several Hours the first Night of his Confinement.  However, he perhaps paid too severely dear both for his Repose, and for a sweet Dream which accompanied it, and represented his little Family in one of those tender Scenes, which had frequently past in the Days of his Happiness and Prosperity, when the Provision they were making for the future Fortunes of their Children used to be one of the most agreeable Topics of Discourse, with which he and his Wife entertained themselves.  The Pleasantness of this Vision, therefore, served only, on his awakening, to set forth his present Misery with additional Horrour, and to heighten the dreadful Ideas which now crowded on his Mind. which he had, without undressing, thrown himself, and now began to wonder at Mrs. Heartfree's long Absence; but as Men are apt (and perhaps wisely too) to draw comfortable Conclusions from malign Events; so he hoped the longer her Stay was, the more certain was his Deliverance.  At length his Impatience prevailed, and he was just going to dispatch a Messenger to his own House, when his Apprentice came to pay him a Visit, and, on his Enquiry, informed him, that his Wife had departed in Company with Mr. Wild many Hours before, and had carried all his most valuable Effects with her; adding at the same time, that she had acquainted him she had her Husband's Orders for so doing. the human Soul with more Attention than our young Physicians generally bestow on that of the Body; that great and violent Surprize hath a different Effect from that which is wrought in a good Housewife by perceiving any Disorders in her Kitchen; who, on such Occasions, commonly spreads the Disorder, not only over her whole Family, but the Neighbourhood.  Now, these great Calamities, especially when sudden, tend to stifle and deaden all the Faculties, instead of elevating them; and accordingly one Herodotus tells us a Story of Croesus, King of Lydia, who, on beholding his Servants and Courtiers led captive, wept bitterly; but when he saw his Wife and Children in that Condition, stood stupid and motionless; so stood poor Heartfree on this Relation of his Apprentice, nothing moving but his Colour, which entirely forsook his Countenance. Mistress, perceiving the Surprize which too visibly appeared in his Master, became speechless likewise, and both remained silent some Minutes, gazing with Astonishment and Horrour at each other. At last Heartfree cry'd out in an Agony: "My Wife deserted me in my Misfortunes!" God forbid, Sir, answered the other. "And what is become of my poor Children, replied Heartfree ?" They are at home, Sir, said the Apprentice. " God be praised, she hath forsaken them too, cries Heartfree : Fetch them hither this Instant. Go, my dear Jack, bring hither my little all which remains now: Fly, Child, if thou dost not intend likewise to forsake me in my Afflictions."  The Youth answered he would die sooner than entertain such a Thought, and, begging his Master to be comforted, instantly obeyed his Orders. in an Agony of Despair; but, recollecting himself after he had vented the first Sallies of his Passion, he began to question the Infidelity of his Wife, as a Matter impossible. He ran over in his Thoughts the uninterrupted Tenderness which she had alway shewn him, and, for a Minute, blamed the Rashness of his Belief against her; 'till the many Circumstances of her having left him so long, and neither writ nor sent to him since her Departure with all his Effects, and with Wild, of whom he was not before without Suspicion; and lastly and chiefly, her false Pretence to his Commands, entirely turned the Scale, and convinced him of her Disloyalty. used the utmost Expedition, brought his Children to him.  He embraced them with the most passionate Fondness, and imprinted numberless Kisses on their little Lips.  The little Girl flew to him with almost as much Eagerness as he himself exprest at her Sight, and cry'd out: "O Papa, why did you not come home to poor Mamma all this while; I thought you would not have left your little Nanny so long." After which he asked for her Mother, and was told she had kiss'd them in the Morning, and cried very much for his Absence. All which brought a Flood of Tears into the Eyes of this weak, silly Man, who had not Greatness sufficient to conquer these low Efforts of Tenderness and Humanity. she knew no more than that her Mistress had taken Leave of her Children in the Morning with many Tears and Kisses, and had recommended them in the most earnest manner to her Care; which, she said, she had promised faithfully to do, and would, while they were entrusted to her, fulfil.  For which Profession Heartfree expressed much Gratitude to her; and, after indulging himself with some little Fondnesses, which we shall not relate, he delivered his Children into the good Woman's Hands, and dismissed her. A Soliloquy of Heartfree's full of low and base Ideas, without a Syllable of the following Soliloquy: " What shall I do? Shall I abandon myself to a dispirited Despair, or fly in the Face of the Almighty! Surely both are unworthy of a wise Man; for what can be more vain than weakly to lament my Fortune, if irretrievable, or, if Hope remains, to offend that Being, who can most strongly support it: But are my Passions then voluntary?  Am I so absolutely their Master, that I can resolve with myself, so far only will I grieve ?  Certainly no. Reason, however we flatter ourselves, hath not such despotic Empire in our Minds, that it can, with imperial Voice, hush all our Sorrow in a Moment. Where then is its Use? for either it is an empty Sound, and we are deceived in thinking we have Reason, or it is given us to some End, and hath a Part assigned it by the All-wise Creator. Why, what can its Office be, other than justly to weigh the Worth of all Things, and to direct us to that Perfection of human Wisdom, which proportions our Esteem of every Object by its real Merit, and prevents us from over or undervaluing whatever we hope for, we enjoy, or we lose. It doth not foolishly say to us, be not glad, or be not sorry, which would be as vain and idle, as to bid the purling River cease to run, or the raging Wind to blow. It prevents us only from exulting, like Children, when we receive a Toy, or from lamenting when we are deprived of it.  Suppose then I have lost the Enjoyments of this World, and my Expectation of future Pleasure and Profit is for ever disappointed; what Relief can my Reason afford!  What, unless it can shew me I had fixed my Affections on a Toy; that what I desired was not, by a wise Man, eagerly to be affected, nor its Loss violently deplored; for there are Toys adapted to all Ages, from the Rattle to the Throne. And perhaps the Value of all is equal to their several Possessors; for if the Rattle pleases the Ears of the Infant, what can the Flattery of Sycophants do more to the Prince. The latter is as far from examining into the Reality and Source of his Pleasure as the former; for if both did, they must both equally despise it. And surely if we consider them seriously, and compare them together, we shall be forced to conclude all those Pomps and Pleasures, of which Men are so fond, and which, through so much Danger and Difficulty, with such Violence and Villany they pursue, to be as worthless Trifles as any exposed to Sale in a Toyshop. I have often noted my little Girl viewing, with eager Eyes, a jointed Baby; I have marked the Pains and Solicitations she hath used, till I have been prevailed on to indulge her with it.  At her first obtaining it, what Joy hath sparkled in her Countenance! with what Raptures hath she taken the Possession; but how little Satisfaction hath she found in it! What Pains to work out her Amusement from it! Its Dress must be varied; the Tinsel Ornaments which first caught her Eyes, produce no longer Pleasure; she endeavours to make it stand and walk in vain, and is constrained herself to supply it with Conversation. In a Day's time it is thrown by and neglected, and some less costly Toy preferred to it. How like the Situation of this Child is that of every Man! What Difficulties in the Pursuit of his Desires! What Inanity in the Possession of most, and Satiety in those which seem more real and substantial! The Delights of most Men are as childish and as superficial as that of my little Girl; a Feather or a Fiddle are their Pursuits and their Pleasures through Life, even to their ripest Years, if such Men may be said to attain any Ripeness at all.  But let us survey those whose Understandings are of a more elevated and refined Temper, how empty do they soon find the World of Enjoyments worth their Desire or attaining! How soon do they retreat to Solitude and Contemplation, to Gardening and Planting, and such rural Amusements, where their Trees and they enjoy the Air and the Sun in common, and both vegetate with very little Difference between them. But suppose (which neither Honesty nor Wisdom will allow) we could admit something more valuable and substantial in those Blessings, would not the Uncertainty of their Possession be alone sufficient to lower their Price. How mean a Tenure is that at the Will of Fortune, which Chance, Fraud, and Rapine are every Day so likely to deprive us of, and the more likely, by how much the greater Worth our Possessions are of! Is it not to place our Affections on a Bubble in the Water, or a Picture in the Clouds! What Mad-man would build a fine House, or frame a beautiful Garden on Land in which he held so uncertain an Interest.  But again, was all this less undeniable, did Fortune, like the Lady of a Manor, lease to us for our Lives; of how little Consideration must even this Term appear? For admitting that these Pleasures were not liable to be torn from us; how certainly must we be torn from them! Perhaps To-morrow, ---Nay or even sooner: For as the excellent Poet says, "Where is To-morrow?---In the other World. "To thousands this is true, and the Reverse "Is sure to none. "But if I have no further Hope in this World, can I have none beyond it. Surely those laborious Writers, who have taken such infinite Pains to destroy or weaken all the Proofs of Futurity, have not so far succeeded as to exclude us from Hope. That active Principle in Man, which with such Boldness pushes on through every Labour and Difficulty, to attain the most distant and most improbable Event in this World, will not surely deny us a little flattering Prospect; which, if it could be chimerical, must be allowed the loveliest which can entertain the Eye of Man; and which, if we understand the Road rightly, hath so little Labour and Fatigue, so few Thorns and Briers in its Way.  If the Proofs of a supreme Being be as strong as I imagine them, surely enough may be deduced from that Ground only to comfort and support the most miserable Man in his Afflictions. And this I think my Reason tells me, that if the Professors and Propagators of Infidelity are in the right, the Losses which Death brings to the Virtuous are not worth their lamenting; but if they are, as certainly they seem, in the wrong, the Blessings it procures them are not sufficiently to be coveted and rejoiced at. "On my own Account then, I have no cause for Sorrow, but on my Children's. Why, the same Being to whose Goodness and Power I entrust my own Happiness, is likewise as able and as willing to procure theirs.  Nor matters it what State of Life they are allotted, whether to procure Bread with their own Labour, or to eat it at the Sweat of others. Perhaps, if we consider the Case with proper Attention, or resolve it with due Sincerity; the former is the sweetest. The Hind may be more happy than the Lord; for his Desires are fewer, and those such as are attended with more Hope and less Fear. I will do my utmost to lay the Foundations of their Happiness, I will carefully avoid educating them in a Station superior to their Fortune, and for the Event trust to that Being in whom whoever rightly confides, must be superior to all worldly Sorrows." worked himself up into an Enthusiasm, which by Degrees soon became invulnerable to every human Attack; so that when Mr. Snap acquainted him with the Return of the Writ, and that he must carry him to Newgate, he received the Message as Socrates did the News of the Ship's Arrival, and that he was to prepare for Death. Wherein our Hero proceeds in the Road to Greatness . doubtless as impatient as the Audience at the Theatre, till the principal Figure returns on the Stage; we will therefore indulge his Inclination, and pursue the Actions of the great Wild . from Dover, a certain young Gentleman who had sold an Estate in Kent, and was going to London to receive the Money. There was likewise a handsome young Woman who had left her Parents at Canterbury, and was proceeding to the same City, in order (as she informed her Fellow Travellers) to make her Fortune.  With this Girl the young Spark was so much enamoured, that he publickly acquainted her with the Purpose of his Journey, and offered her a considerable Sum in Hand and a Settlement, if she would consent to return with him into the Country, where she would be at a safe Distance from her Relations.  Whether she accepted this Proposal or no, we are not able with any tolerable Certainty to deliver: But Wild, the Moment he heard of this Money, began to cast about in his Mind by what Means he might become Master of it. He entred into a long Harangue about the Methods of carrying Money safely on the Road, and said, he had at that Time two Bank Bills of a hundred Pounds each sowed in his Stock; which, added he, is so safe a Way, that if I met never so many Highwaymen it is almost impossible I should be in any Danger of being robbed. Wild's Ingenuity, and thanking him for his Information, declared he would follow his Example when he returned into the Country: By which Means he proposed to save the Premium commonly taken for the Remittance. Wild had then no more to do but to inform himself rightly of the Time of the Gentleman's Journey, which he did with great Certainty, before they separated. resolute of his Gang for this Enterprize; and accordingly having summoned the principal or most desperate, as he imagined him of these two (for he never chose to communicate within the Presence of more than one) he proposed to him the robbing and murthering this Gentleman. readily agreed to the Robbery; but he hesitated at the Murther.  He said, as to Robbery, he had, on much weighing and considering the Matter, very well reconciled his Conscience to it; for tho' that noble Kind of Robbery which was executed on the Highway, was from the Cowardice of Mankind less frequent, yet the baser and meaner Species sometimes called Cheating, but more commonly known by the Name of Robbery within the Law, was in a Manner universal.  He did not therefore pretend to the Reputation of being so much honester than other People; but could by no Means satisfy himself in the Commission of Murther, which was a Sin of the most heinous Nature, and so immediately prosecuted by God's Judgment, that it never passed undiscovered or unpunished. "Art thou he whom I have selected out of my whole Gang for this glorious Undertaking, and dost thou cant of God's Revenge against Murther. You have, it seems, reconciled your Conscience (a pretty Word) to Robbery from its being so common. Is it then the Novelty of Murther which deters you? Do you imagine that Guns, and Pistols, and Swords, and Knives, are the only Instruments of Death?  Look into the World and see the Numbers whom broken Fortunes and broken Hearts, bring untimely to the Grave.  To omit those glorious Heroes, who, to their immortal Honour, have massacred whole Nations, what think you of private Persecution, Treachery, and Slander, by which the very Souls of Men are in a Manner torn from their Bodies? Is it not more generous, nay, more Good-natured to send a Man to his rest; than after having plundered him of all he hath, or from Malice or Malevolence deprived him of his Character, to punish him with a languishing Death, or what is worse, a languishing Life? Murther, therefore, is not so uncommon as you weakly conceive it, tho', as you said of Robbery, that more noble Kind, which lies within the Paw of the Law, may be so. But this is the most innocent in him who doth it, and the most eligible to him who is to suffer it. Believe me, Lad, the Tongue of a Viper is less hurtful than that of a Slanderer, and the gilded Scales of a Rattle-Snake less dreadful than the Purse of the Oppressor. Let me therefore hear no more of your Scruples; but consent to my Proposal without further Hesitation, unless like a Woman you are afraid of blooding your Cloaths, or like a Fool are terrified with the Apprehensions of being hanged in Chains.  Take my Word for it, you had better be an honest Man than half a Rogue. Do not think of continuing in my Gang without abandoning yourself absolutely to my Pleasure; for no Man shall ever receive a Favour at my Hands, who sticks at any thing, or is guided by any other Law than that of my Will." : He agreed to the Robbery, but would not undertake the Murther, as Wild (who feared that by Marybone's demanding to search the Gentleman's Neck, he might hazard Suspicion himself) insisted. Marybone was immediately entered by Wild in his Black-Book, and was presently after impeached and executed, as a Fellow on whom his Leader could not place sufficient Dependence. In which a young Hero, of wonderful good Promise, makes his first Appearance, with many other great Matters . received his Orders, and instead of hesitating at a single Murther, asked if he should blow out the Brains of all the Passengers, Coachman and all. But Wild, whose Moderation we have before noted, would not permit him; and therefore having given him an exact Description of the devoted Person, with his other necessary Instructions, he dismissed him, with strictest Orders to avoid, if possible, doing hurt to any other Person. History, being the Achates of our Æ neas, or rather the H aephestion of our Alexander was Fireblood . He had every Qualification to make a Second-Rate great Man ; or in other Words, he was completely equipped for the Tool of a Real or First-Rate great Man . We shall therefore (which is the properest Way of dealing with this Kind of Greatness ) describe him negatively, and content ourselves with telling our Reader what Qualities he had not: In which Number were Humanity, Modesty, and Fear, not one Grain of any of which was mingled in his whole Composition. whole Gang, and whom Wild often declared to be one of the prettiest Lads he had ever seen, of which Opinion, indeed, were most other People of his Acquaintance; we will however leave him at his Entrance on this Enterprize, and keep our Attention fixed on our Hero, whom we shall observe taking large Strides towards the Summit of human Glory. aetitia Snap ; for he had that Weakness of suffering himself to be enslaved by Women, so naturally incident to Men of Heroic Disposition; to say the Truth, it might more properly be called a Slavery to his own Appetite; for could he have satisfied that, he had not cared three Farthings what had become of the little Tyrant for whom he profest so violent a Regard. Here he was informed that Mr. Heartfree had been conveyed to Newgate the Day before, the Writ being then returnable. He was somewhat concerned at this News; not from any Compassion for the Misfortunes of Heartfree, whom he hated with such Inveteracy, that one would have imagined he had suffered the same Injuries from him which he had done towards him. His Concern therefore had another Motive:  In Fact, he was uneasy at the Place of Mr. Heartfree's Confinement, as it was to be the Scene of his future Glory, and where consequently he should be frequently obliged to see a Face which Hatred and not Shame, made him detest the Sight of. At first, he thought of removing him out of the Way by the ordinary Method of Murther, which he doubted not but Fireblood would be very ready to execute; for that Youth had at their last Interview, sworn, D---n his Eyes, he thought there was no better Pastime than blowing a Man's Brains out . But besides the Danger of this Method, it did not look horrible nor barbarous enough for the last Mischief which he should do to Heartfree . Considering, therefore, a little farther with himself, he at length came to a Resolution to hang him if possible, the very next Sessions. Now, tho' the Observation, How apt Men are to hate those they injure, or how unforgiving they are of the Injuries they do themselves, be common enough, yet I do not remember to have ever seen the Reason of this strange Ph aenomenon, as at first it appears. Know therefore, Reader, that with much and severe Scrutiny we have discovered this Hatred to be founded on the Passion of Fear, and to arise from an Apprehension that the Person whom we have ourselves greatly injured, will use all possible Endeavours to revenge and retaliate the Injuries we have done him.  An Opinion so firmly established in bad and Great Minds (and those who confer Injuries on others, have seldom very good, or mean ones) that no Benevolence nor even Beneficence on the injured Side, can eradicate it. On the contrary they refer all these Acts of Kindness to Imposture and Design of lulling their Suspicion, till an Opportunity offers of striking a surer and severer Blow; and thus while the good Man who hath received it, hath truly forgotten the Injury, the evil Mind which did it, hath it in lively and fresh Remembrance. As we scorn to keep any such Discoveries secret from our Readers, whose Instruction as well as Diversion, we have greatly considered in this History, we have here digressed somewhat to communicate the following short Lesson to those who are simple, and well inclined; Tho' as a Christian thou art obliged, and we advise thee to forgive thy Enemy ; never trust the Man who hath Reason to suspect that you know he hath injured you . More and more Greatness, unparallelled in History or Romance. of Wild had contrived, the first necessary Step seemed to regain the Confidence of Heartfree . He determined therefore to undertake it, how impossible soever it appeared. The chief Requisite on this Occasion, was that steady Countenance in which he was superior to all Mankind.  He went to Newgate, and burst resolutely into the Presence of Heartfree, whom he eagerly embraced and kissed; and then, first arraigning his own Rashness, and afterwards lamenting his unfortunate want of Success, he acquainted him with the Particulars of what had happened; concealing only that single Incident of his Attack on the other's Wife, the Lies he had told her concerning her Husband's Commands; and his Motive to the Undertaking, which he assured Heartfree was a Desire to preserve his Effects from a Statute of Bankruptcy. The frank Openness of this Declaration, with the Composure of Countenance with which it was delivered; his seeming only ruffled by the Concern for his Friend's Misfortune; the Probability of Truth attending it, joined to the Boldness and disinterested Appearance of this Visit, together with his many Professions of immediate Service, at a Time when he could not have the least visible Motive from Self-Love; and above all, his offering him Money, the last and surest Token of Friendship, rushed with such united Force on the well- disposed Heart, as it is vulgarly called, of this simple Man, that they instantly staggered and soon subverted all the Determination he had before made in Prejudice of Wild :  Who perceiving the Ballance to be turning in his Favour, presently threw in a hundred Imprecations on his own Folly and ill-advised Forwardness to serve his Friend, which had thus unhappily produced his Ruin; he added as many Curses on the Count, whom he vowed to pursue with Revenge all over Europe :  Lastly, he cast in some Grains of Comfort, assuring Heartfree that his Wife was fallen into the gentlest Hands, that she would be carried no farther than Dunkirk, whence she might be very easily redeemed. Heartfree, to whom the lightest Presumption of his Wife's Fidelity would have been more delicious than the absolute Restoration of all his Jewels, and who, indeed, had with the utmost Difficulty been brought to entertain the slightest Suspicion of her Inconstancy, immediately abandoned all Distrust of both her and his Friend, whose Sincerity (luckily for Wild's Purpose) seemed to him to depend on the same Evidence.  He then embraced our Hero, who had in his Countenance all the Symptoms of the deepest Concern, and begged him to be comforted; saying, that the Intentions rather than the Actions of Men conferred Obligations; that as to the Event of human Affairs, it was governed either by Chance or some superior Agent, that Friendship was concerned only in the Direction of it.  And suppose it failed of Success, or produced an Event never so contrary to its Design, the Merit of a good Intention was not in the least lessened, but was rather entitled to Compassion. first Step, began to discourse on the Badness of the World; and particularly to blame the Severity of Creditors, who seldom or never attended to any unfortunate Circumstances, but without Mercy inflicted Confinement on the Debtor, whose Body the Law, with very unjustifiable Rigour, delivered into their Power. He added, that for his Part, he looked on this Restraint to be as heavy a Punishment as any appointed by Law for the greatest Offenders.  That the Loss of Liberty was, in his Opinion, equal to, if not worse, than the Loss of Life; that he had always determined, if by any Accident or Misfortune he had been subjected to the former, he would run the greatest Risque of the latter to rescue himself from it; which he said, if Men did not want Resolution, was always easy enough to do; for that it was ridiculous to conceive that two or three Men could confine two or three hundred, unless the Prisoners were either Fools or Cowards, especially when they were neither chained nor fettered.  He went on in this Manner, till perceiving the utmost Attention in Heartfree, he ventured to propose to him an Endeavour to make his escape, which he said might easily be executed; that he would himself raise a Party in the Prison, and that, if a Murther or two should happen in the Attempt, he ( Heartfree ) might keep free from any Share either in the Guilt or in the Danger. viz. That in order to carry them into Execution, they are obliged in proposing their Purpose to their Tools, to discover themselves to be of that Disposition, in which certain little Writers have advised Mankind to place no Confidence: An Advice which hath been sometimes taken. Indeed many Inconveniencies arise to the said great Men from these Scriblers publishing without Restraint their Hints or Alarms to Society; and many great and glorious Schemes have been thus frustrated; wherefore it were to be wished that in all well regulated Governments, such Liberty should be by some wholesome Laws restrained; and all Writers inhibited from venting any other Instructions to the People than what should be first approved and licensed by the said great Men, or their proper Instruments or Tools; by which Means nothing would ever be published but what made for the advancing their most noble Projects. Wild with inconceivable Disdain, spoke as follows. "There is one thing, the Loss of which I should deplore infinitely beyond that of Liberty and of Life also, I mean that of a good Conscience.  A Blessing which he who possesses can never be thoroughly unhappy; for the bitterest Potion of Life is by this so sweetned, that it soon becomes palatable; whereas without it, the most delicate Enjoyments quickly lose all their Relish, and Life itself grows insipid, or rather nauseous to us.  Would you then lessen my Misfortunes by robbing me of what hath been my only Comfort under them, and on which I place my Dependence of being relieved from them? I have read that Socrates refused to save his Life by breaking the Laws of his Country, and departing from his Prison, when it was open. Perhaps my Virtue would not go so far; but God forbid Liberty should have such Charms, to tempt me to the Perpetration of so horrid a Crime as Murther. As to the poor Evasion of committing it by other Hands, it might be useful indeed to those who seek only the Escape from temporal Punishment; but can be of no Service to excuse me to that Being whom I chiefly fear offending; nay, it would greatly aggravate my Guilt by so impudent an Endeavour to impose upon him, and by so wickedly involving others in my Crime.  Give me therefore no more Advice of this Kind; for this is my great Comfort in all my Afflictions, that it is in the Power of no Enemy to rob me of my Conscience, nor will I ever be so much my own Enemy to destroy it." Answer; but endeavoured to evade his Proposal as much as possible, and promising to use all honest Means for his Service, since he was so scrupulous, he took his Leave of his Friend for the present. Heartfree, having indulged himself an Hour with his Children, repaired to Rest, which he enjoyed quiet and undisturbed; whilst Wild, disdaining Repose, sat up all Night, consulting how he might bring about the final Destruction of his Friend, without being beholden to any Assistance from himself; which he now despaired of procuring. With the Result of these Consultations we shall acquaint our Reader in good time; but at present we have Matters of much more Consequence to relate to him. The Event of Fireblood's Adventure, and a Treaty of Marriage, which might have been concluded either at Smithfield or St. James's . happened to go home another Way than he had intended; so that the whole Design miscarried. Fireblood had indeed robbed the Coach, and wantonly discharged a Pistol into it, which slightly wounded one of the Passengers in the Arm. The Booty he met with was not very considerable, and much less than that with which he acquainted Wild ; for, of eleven Pounds in Money, two Silver- watches, and a Wedding-Ring, he produced no more than two Guineas and the Ring, which he protested with numberless Oaths was his whole Booty.  However, when an Advertisement of the Robbery was published, with a Reward promised for the Ring and the Watches, Fireblood was obliged to confess the whole, and to acquaint our Hero where he had pawned the latter; which he, taking the full Value of them for his Pains, restored to the right Owner. was sorry to see any of his Gang guilty of a Breach of Honour; that without Honour Priggery was at an End; that if a Prig had but Honour, he would overlook every Vice in the World. But, nevertheless, he said, he would forgive him this time, as he was a hopeful Lad, and wished never afterwards to find him delinquent in this grand Point. Wild had now brought his Gang to great Regularity: He was obeyed and feared by them all. He had likewise established an Office where all Men, who were robbed, paying the Value only, (or a little more) of their Goods might have them again.  This was of notable Use to several Persons who had lost Pieces of Plate they had received from their Grandmothers; to others who had a particular Value for certain Rings, Watches, Heads of Canes, Snuff-Boxes, & c. for which they would not have taken twenty times as much as they were worth, either because they had them a long time, or that somebody else had had them before, or from some other such excellent Reason, which often stamps a greater Value on a Toy, than the great Bubble-boy himself would have the Impudence to set upon it. was regarded in so thriving a Light by all the Gentlemen of his Acquaintance, as by the Keeper and Turnkeys of Newgate, by Mr. Snap, and others of his Occupation; that Mr. Snap one Day, taking Mr. Wild the elder aside, very seriously proposed what they had often lightly talked over, a strict Union between their Families, by marrying his Daughter Tishy to our Hero. This Proposal was very readily accepted by the old Gentleman, who promised to acquaint his Son with it. dreaming of the Happiness which, of its own Accord, was advancing so near towards him, had called Fireblood to him, and, after informing him of the Violence of his Passion for the young Lady, and assuring him what Confidence he reposed in him and his Honour, to which the other answered, he would be sure to discharge whatever he entrusted to him, with the utmost Fidelity; he dispatched him to Miss Tishy with the the following Letter, which we here insert, not only as we take it to be extremely curious, but to be a much better Pattern for that Epistolary kind of Writing, which is generally called which we challenge all the Beaus of our Time to equal either in Matter or Spelling. "Most Deivine and adwhorable Creture, Flam in my Hart, have likewise the Faculty of seeing it.  It would be the hiest Preassumption to imagin you eggnorant of my Loav. No, Maddam, I sollemly purtest, that, of all the Butys in the unaversal Glob, there is none kapable of hateracting my IIs like you. Corts and Pallaces would be to me Deserts without your Kumpany, and with it a Wilderness would have more Charms than Haven itself. For I hop you will beleve me when I sware every Place in the Univarse is a Haven with you. I am konvinced you must be sinsibel of my violent Passion for you, which, if I endevored to hid it, would be as impossible as for you, or the Son to hide your Butys. I assure you I have not slept a Wink since I had the Hapness of seeing you last; therefore hop you will, out of Kumpassion, let me have the Honour of seeing you this Afternoon; for I am, with the greatest Adwhoration, "Most Deivine Creeture, Iour most pessionate Amirer, Adwhorer, and Slave, Reader will be pleased to remember, that such a Defect might be worthy of Censure in a low and and scholastic Character; but can be no Blemish in that sublime Greatness, of which we endeavour to raise a complete Idea in this History. In which kind of Composition, Spelling, or indeed any kind of human Literature, hath never been thought a necessay Ingredient; for if these sort of GREAT Personages can but complot and contrive their noble Schemes, and hack and hew Mankind sufficiently, there will never be wanting fit and able Persons who can spell, to record their Praises.  Again, if it should be observed that the Style of this Letter doth not exactly correspond with that of our Hero's Speeches, which we have here recorded, we answer, it is sufficient if in these the Historian adheres faithfully to the Matter, though he embellishes the Diction with some Flourishes of his own Eloquence, without which the excellent Speeches recorded in ancient Historians (particularly in Sallust ) would have scarce been found in their Writings.  Nay, even amongst the Moderns, famous as they are for Elocution (it may be doubted whether those inimitable Harangues, published in the Monthly Magazines ) came literally from the Mouths of the suppose some Historian of great Eloquence hath borrowed the Matter only, and adorned it with those Rhetorical Flowers for which many of the said Matters preliminary to the Marriage between Mr. Jonathan Wild and the chaste L aetitia . and promised on his Honour, as we have before hinted, to discharge his Embassy faithfully, went to visit the fair L aetitia .  Having opened the Letter, and read it, she put on an Air of Disdain, and told Mr. Fireblood, she could not conceive what Mr. Wild meant by troubling her with his Impertinence; she begged him to carry the Letter back again, saying, had she known from whom it came, she would have been d---d before she had opened it. Moreover, she said she was not angry with him, nay, she was sorry so pretty a young Man should be employed in such an Errand. She accompanied these Words with so tender an Accent, and so wanton a Leer, that Fireblood, who was no backward Youth, began to take her by the Hand, and proceeded so warmly, that, to imitate his Actions with the Rapidity of our Narration, he in a few Minutes ravished this fair Creature, or at least would have ravished her, if she had not, by a timely Compliance, prevented him. FIREBLOOD, after he had ravished as much as he could, returned to Wild, and acquainted him as far as any wise Man would, with what had past; concluding with many Praises of the young Lady's Beauty, with whom, he said, if his Honour would have permitted him, he should himself have fallen in Love; but, d---n him, if he would not sooner be torn in Pieces by wild Horses, than even think of injuring his Friend.  And if he could be of any Service, he might command him to go to L aetitia when, and as often as he pleased. brought him Mr. Snap's Proposal. The Reader must know very little of Love, or indeed of any thing else, if he requires any Information concerning the Reception which this Proposal met with. Not guilty never sounded sweeter in the Ears of Culprit, nor a Reprieve to the Prisoner condemned, than did every Word of the old Gentleman in the Ears of our Hero. He gave his Father full Power to treat in his Name, and desired nothing more than Expedition. of the violent Passion of her Lover, endeavoured to improve it to the best Advantage, and would have not only declined giving her any Fortune himself, but attempted to cheat her of what she owed to the Liberality of her Relations, particularly of a Pint Silver Caudle Cup, the Gift of her Grandmother.  However, the young Lady herself afterwards took Care to prevent him. As to the old Mr. Wild, he did not sufficiently attend to all the Designs of Snap, as his Faculties were busily employed in Designs of his own, to over-reach (or, as others express it, to cheat) the said Mr. Snap, by pretending to give his Son a whole Number for a Chair, when in Reality he was intitled to a third only. agreed to admit Mr. Wild's Visits. And, by Degrees, began to entertain him with all the Shew of Affection, which the great natural Reserve of her Temper, and the greater artificial Reserve of her Education would permit.  At length every thing being agreed between their Parents, Settlements made, and the Lady's Fortune (to wit, Seventeen Pounds and nine Shillings in Money and Goods) paid down, the Day for their Nuptials was fixed, and they were celebrated accordingly. the Poet both concluding they have done enough for their Hero when they have married him; or intimating rather, that the rest of his Life must be a dull Calm of Happiness, very delightful indeed to pass through, but somewhat insipid to relate: And Matrimony in general must, I believe, without any Dispute, be allowed to be this State of tranquil Felicity, so little concerned with Variety, that, like Salisbury Plain, it affords only one Prospect, a very pleasant one it must be confest, but the same. proved of such happy Note, both from the great Accomplishments of the young Lady, and the truly ardent Passion of Mr. Wild ; but whether it was that Nature and Fortune had great Designs for him to execute, and would not suffer his vast Abilities to be lost and sunk in the Arms of a Wife, or whether neither Nature nor Fortune had any Hand in the Matter, is a Point I will not determine.  Certain it is that this Match did not produce that serene State we have mentioned above, but resembled the most turbulent and ruffled, rather than calm Sea. I cannot here omit a Conjecture ingenious enough of a Friend of mine, who had a long Intimacy in the Wild Family. He hath often told me he fancied one Reason of the Dissatisfactions which afterwards fell out between Wild and his Lady, arose from the Number of Gallants, to whom she had before Marriage granted Favours; for says he, and indeed very probable it is too, the Lady might expect from her Husband, what she had before received from several, and being angry not to find one Man as good as ten, she had, from that Indignation, taken those Steps which we cannot perfectly justify. he had overheard, and taken down verbatim . It passed on the Day Fortnight after they were married. A Dialogue matrimonial, which passed between Jonathan Wild, Esquire, and Nuptials were celebrated; which concluded more amicably than those Debates generally do. I don't know what Sir John doth so often at my House.  I assure you I am uneasy at it; for though I have no Suspicion of your Virtue, yet it may injure your Reputation in the Opinion of my Neighbours. I don't trouble my Head about my Neighbours; and they shall no more tell me what Company I am to keep than my Husband shall. A good Wife would keep no Company which made her Husband uneasy. You might have found one of those good Wives, Sir, if you had pleased, I had no Objection to it. I thought I had found one in you. You did! I am very much obliged to you for thinking me so poor-spirited a Creature; but I hope to convince you to the contrary.  What, I suppose you took me for a raw, senseless Girl, who knew nothing what other married Women do! No Matter what I took you for: I have taken you for better and worse. And at your own Desire too? For, I am sure, you never had mine. I should not have broken my Heart if Mr. Wild had thought proper to bestow himself on any other more happy Woman. \----Ha, ha. I hope, Madam, you don't imagine that was not in my Power, or that I married you out of any kind of Necessity. O no, Sir, I am convinced there are silly Women enough. And far be it from me to accuse you of any Necessity for a Wife, I believe you could have very well been contented with the State of a Batchelor; but that, you know, a Woman cannot tell beforehand. I can't guess what you would insinuate; for I believe no Woman had ever less Reason to complain of her Husband's Want of Fondness. give for them. \---But I know better things. (These Words to be spoken with a very great Air, and Toss of the Head.) fond.--- \---I wish you were fond! \---I assure you--- I don't know what you would pretend to insinuate of me.  \---I have no Wishes which misbecome a virtuous Woman--- No, nor should not, if I had married for Love.  \---And especially now when no body, I am sure, can suspect me of any such thing.--- I hope, Madam, at least, you will not tell me to my Face, you have made your Convenience of me. I have made nothing of you; nor do I desire the Honour of making any thing of you. No, you made your self so; for I repeat once more, It was not my Desire but your own. La! Sir, you was not so singular in it. I was not in Despair. \---I have had other Offers, and better too. I wish you had accepted them with all my Heart. I must tell you, Mr. Wild, this is a very brutish Manner of treating a Woman, to whom you have such Obligations; but I know how to despise it, and to despise you too for shewing it me. Indeed I am well enough paid for the foolish Preference I gave to you.  I flattered myself that I should at least have been used with good Manners.  I thought I had married a Gentleman; but I find you every way contemptible, and below my Concern. married me for your Convenience only? why should I mention what comes from a Wretch whom I despise. And, to tell you a Truth, I married you for my Convenience likewise, to satisfy a Passion which I have now satisfied, and you may be d---d for any thing I care. I need take very little Pains to acquaint the World what a B---ch you are, your Actions will demonstrate it. me too far; for I can do you a Mischief, and will, if you dare use me so, you Villain! aside the Woman, I will treat you as such no longer; and if the first Blow is yours, I promise you the last shall be mine. again; for, may I be cursed, if ever I enter your Bed more. lay upon me; for, I assure you faithfully, your Person was all I had ever any Regard for; and that I now loath and detest, as much as ever I liked it. your Person; and, as for any other Regard, you must be convinced I never could have any for you. together, suppose we agreed, instead of quarrelling and abusing, to be civil to each other. never live like Man and Wife; that is, never be loving, nor never quarrel. Word to escape you? sweetest you ever gave me. returned it again with equal Abuse, which was continued on both Sides while he was dressing. However, they agreed to continue stedfast in this new Resolution; and the Joy arising on that Occasion at length dismissed them pretty amicably from each other, though L aetitia could not help concluding with the Words, Why B---ch ? Observations on the foregoing Dialogue, together with a base Design on our Hero, which must be detested by every Lover of Greatness . indeed very little Savour of the Sweets of Matrimony in it) produce at last a Resolution more wise than strictly pious, and which, if they could have rigidly adhered to it, might have prevented some unpleasant Moments as well to our Hero as to his Serene Consort; but their Hatred was so very great and unaccountable, that they never could bear to see the least Composure in one another's Countenance, without attempting to ruffle it.  This set them on so many Contrivances to plague and vex one another, that as their Proximity afforded them such frequent Opportunities of executing their malicious Purposes, that they seldom past one easy or quiet Day together. which thou must have observed to disturb the Repose of some married Couples, who mistake implacable Hatred for Indifference; for why should Corvinus, who lives in a Round of Intrigue, and seldom doth, and never willingly would, dally with his Wife, endeavour to prevent her from the Satisfaction of an Intrigue in her Turn? Why doth Camilla refuse a more agreeable Invitation abroad, only to expose her Husband at his own Table at home? In short, to mention no more Instances, whence can all the Quarrels, and Jealousies, and Jars, proceed, in People who have no Love for each other, unless from that noble Passion above-mentioned, that Desire, according to my Lady Betty Modish, of curing each other of a Smile ? of our Hero, the rather to shew him that GREAT with little Men, and that Heroes are really of the same Species with other human Creatures, notwithstanding all the Pains they themselves, or their Flatterers take to assert the contrary; and that they differ chiefly in the Immensity of their Greatness, or as the Vulgar erroneously call it, Villainy.  Now therefore, that we may not dwell too long on low Scenes, in a History of this sublime Kind, we shall return to Actions of a higher Note, and more suitable to our Purpose. of Doors; that is to say, in common Phrase, when the Violence of Mr. Wild's Passion (or rather Appetite) for the chaste L aetitia, began to abate, he returned to visit his Friend Heartfree, who was now in the Liberties of the Fleet, and had appeared to the Commission of Bankruptcy against him, where he met with a less cold Reception than he himself had apprehended. Heartfree had long entertained Suspicions of Wild, but these Suspicions had from time to time been confounded with Circumstances, and principally smothered with that amazing Confidence, which was indeed the most striking Virtue in our Hero.  He was unwilling to condemn him, without certain Evidence, and laid hold on every probable Semblance to acquit him; but the Proposal made at his last Visit had so totally blackned his Character in this poor Man's Opinion, that it entirely fixed the wavering Scale, and he no longer doubted but that our Hero was one of the greatest Villains in the World. with greedy Ears; the Reader therefore cannot wonder that Heartfree, whose Passions were so variously concerned, first for the Fidelity, and secondly for the Safety of his Wife; and lastly, who was so distracted with Doubt concerning the Conduct of his Friend, should at his first Relation pass unobserved the Incident of his being committed to the Boat by the Captain of the Privateer, which he had not at the time of his telling it in the least accounted for; but now when Heartfree came to reflect on the whole, and with a high Prepossession against Wild, the Absurdity of this Fact glared in his Eyes, and struck him in the most sensible Manner.  At length a Thought of great Horror suggested itself to his Imagination, and this was, Whether the whole was not a Fiction, and Wild, who was, as he had learn'd from his own Mouth, equal to any Undertaking how black soever, had not spirited away, robbed and murthered his Wife. examined it carefully in his own Mind, but acquainted young Friendly with it at their next Interview. Friendly, who detested Wild (from that Envy, probably, with which these great Characters naturally inspire low Fellows) encouraged these Suspicions so much, that Heartfree resolved to attach our Hero and carry him before a Magistrate. a Constable had with the utmost Diligence, searched several Days for our Hero; but whether it was that in Compliance with modern Custom, he had retired to spend the Honey-Moon with his Bride, the only Moon indeed in which it is fashionable or customary for the married Parties to have any Affection for each other; or perhaps his Habitation might for particular Reasons be usually kept a Secret: Like those of some few great Men, whom unfortunately the Law hath left out of that reasonable as well as honourable Provision, which it hath made for the Security of most great Men's Persons. Honour, and, tho' no Hero is obliged to answer the Challenge of my Lord Chief Justice, or indeed, of any other Magistrate; but may with unblemished Reputation slide away from it; yet such was the Bravery, such the Greatness, the Magnanimity of Wild, that he appeared in Person to it. namely, that the said Mr. Wild, knew nothing of the said Warrant or Challenge; and as thou may'st be assured, Reader, that the malicious Fury will omit nothing which can any ways fully so great a Character, so she hath endeavoured to account for this second Visit of our Hero to his Friend Heartfree, from a very different Motive than that of asserting his own Innocence. Mr. Wild with unprecedented Generosity visits his Friend Heartfree, and the ungrateful Reception he met with. Examination to find in a certain Spot of human Nature called his own Heart, the least Grain of that pitiful low Quality called Honesty, had resolved, perhaps a little too generally, that there was no such thing.  He therefore imputed the Resolution with which Mr. Heartfree had so positively refused to concern himself in Murther, either to a Fear of bloodying his Hands, or the Apprehension of a Ghost, or lest he should make an additional Example in that excellent Book called, God's Revenge against Murther ; and doubted not but he would (at least in his present Necessity) agree without Scruple to a simple Robbery, especially where any considerable Booty should be proposed, and the Safety of the Attack plausibly made appear; which, if he could prevail on him to undertake, he would immediately afterwards get him impeached, convicted, and hanged.  He no sooner therefore had discharged his Duties to Hymen, and heard that Heartfree had procured himself the Liberties of the Fleet, than he resolved to visit him, and propose a Robbery with all the Allurements of Profit, Ease and Safety. the following Manner. "I might have hoped the Answer which I gave to your former Advice would have prevented me from the Danger of receiving a second Affront of this Kind. An Affront I call it, and surely if it be so to call a Man a Villain, it can be no less to shew him you suppose him one.  Indeed it may be wondered how any Man can arrive at the Boldness, I may say Impudence, of first making such an Overture to another; surely it is seldom done, unless to those who have previously betrayed some Symptoms of their own Baseness.  If I have therefore shewn you any such, these Insults are more pardonable; but I assure you, if such appear, they discharge all their Malignance outwardly, and reflect not even a Shadow within; for to me, Baseness seems inconsistent with this Rule, Of doing no other Person an Injury from any Motive or on any Consideration whatever . This, Sir, is the Rule by which I am determined to walk, nor can that Man justify disbelieving me, who will not own, he walks not by it himself. But whether it be allowed to me or no, or whether I feel the good Effects of its being practised by others, I am resolved to maintain it: For surely no Man can reap a Benefit from my pursuing it equal to the Comfort I myself enjoy: For what a ravishing Thought! how replete with Extasy must the Consideration be, that the Goodness of God is engaged to reward me! How indifferent must such a Persuasion make a Man to all the Occurrences of this Life!  What Trifles must be represent to himself both the Enjoyments and the Afflictions of this World!  How easily must he acquiesce under missing the former, and how patiently will he submit to the latter, who is convinced that his failing of a transitory imperfect Reward here, is a most certain Argument of his obtaining one permanent and complete hereafter! Dost thou think then, thou little, paltry, mean Animal, (with such Language did he treat our truly great Man ) that I will forego such comfortable Expectations for any pitiful Reward which thou canst suggest or promise to me; for that sordid Lucre for which all Pains and Labour are undertaken by the Industrious, and all Barbarities and Iniquities committed by the vile; or a worthless Acquisition which such as thou art can possess, can give or can rob me of?" The former Part of this Speech occasioned much yawning in our Hero, but the latter roused his Anger; and he was collecting his Rage to answer, when Friendly and the Constable, who had been summoned by Heartfree, on Wild's first Appearance, entred the Room, and seized the great Man just as his Wrath was bursting from his Lips. acquainted with the Reason of this rough Treatment, and presently conveyed before a Magistrate. Examination, he insisting that the Proceeding was improper; for that a Writ de Homine Replegiando should issue, and on the Return of that a Capias in Withernam, the Justice inclined to commitment, so that Wild was driven to other Methods for his Defence.  He therefore acquainted the Justice, that there was a young Man likewise with him in the Boat, and begged that he might be sent for, which Request was accordingly granted, and the faithful Achates (Mr. Fireblood ) was soon produced to bear Testimony for his Friend, which he did with so much becoming Zeal, and went through his Examination with such Coherence, (tho' he was forced to collect his Evidence from the Hints given him by Wild in the Presence of the Justice and the Accusers,) that, as here was direct Evidence against mere Presumption, our Hero was most honourably acquitted, and poor Heartfree was charged by the Justice, the Audience, and all others, who afterwards heard the Story, with the blackest Ingratitude, in attempting to take away the Life of a Man, to whom he had such eminent Obligations. violently surprize the Reader in this degenerate Age; it may be proper to inform him, that besides the Ties of Engagement in the same Employ, another nearer and stronger Alliance subsisted between our Hero and this Youth, which latter was just departed from the Arms of the lovely L aetitia, when he received her Husband's Message: An Instance which may also serve to justify those strict Intercourses of Love and Acquaintance, which so commonly subsist in modern History between the Husband and Gallant, displaying the vast Force of Friendship, contracted by this more honourable than legal Alliance, which is thought to be at present one of the strongest Bonds of Amity between great Men, and the most reputable as well as easy Way to Preferment. Affairs had begun to wear a more benign Aspect; but they were a good deal injured by this Attempt on Wild (so dangerous is any Attack on a great Man ) several of his Neighbours, and particularly one or two of his own Trade, industriously endeavouring, from their bitter Animosity against such Kind of Iniquity, to spread and exaggerate his Ingratitude as much as possible; not in the least scrupling, in the violent Ardour of their Indignation, to add some small Circumstances of their own Knowledge of the many Obligations conferred on Heartfree by Wild . To all these Scandals he quietly submitted, comforting himself in the Consciousness of his own Innocence, and confiding in Time, the sure Friend of Justice, to acquit him. A Scheme so deeply laid that it shames all the Politics of this our Age; with Digression and Sub-digression. Injuries he had done him, an additional Spur from this Injury received; (for so it appeared to him, who no more than the most ignorant, considered how truly he deserved it) applied his utmost Industry to accomplish the Ruin of one whose very Name sounded odious in his Ears; when luckily a Scheme arose in his Imagination, which not only promised to effect it securely; but, (which pleased him most) by Means of the Mischief he had already done him; and which would at once load him with the Imputation of having committed what he himself had done for him, and would bring on him the severest Punishment for a Fact, of which he was not only innocent, but had already so greatly suffered by.  And this was no other than to charge him with having conveyed away his Wife, with his most valuable Effects, in order to defraud his Creditors. it in Execution. What remained to consider was only the Quomodo, and the Person or Tool to be employed; for the Stage of the World differs from that in Drury-Lane principally in this; that whereas on the latter, the Hero, or chief Figure, is almost continually before your Eyes, whilst the Under-actors are not seen above once in an Evening; now, on the former, the Hero, or doth any thing in his own Person. He doth indeed, in this grand Drama, rather perform the Part of the Prompter, and instructs the well-drest Figures, who are strutting in public on the Stage, what to say and do.  To say the Truth, a Puppet-show will illustrate our Meaning better, where it is the Master of the Show (the great Man ) who dances and moves every thing; whether it be the King of Muscovy, or whatever other Potentate, alias Puppet, which we behold on the Stage; but he himself wisely keeps out of Sight; for should he once appear, the whole Motion would be at an End.  Not that any one is ignorant of his being there, or supposes that the Puppets are not mere Sticks of Wood, and he himself the sole Mover; but as this (tho' every one knows it) doth not appear visibly, i. e. to their Eyes, no one is ashamed of consenting to be imposed upon; of helping on the Drama, calling the several Sticks or Puppets by the Names which the Master hath allotted to them, and assigning to each the Character which the pleased to move them. in this World, to imagine thou hast never seen some of these Puppet-Shews, which are so frequently acted on the GREAT Stage; but though thou shouldst have resided all thy Days in those remote Parts of this Island, which GREAT Men seldom visit; yet, if thou hast any Penetration, thou must have had some Occasions to admire both the Solemnity of Countenance in the Actor, and the Gravity in the Spectator, while some of those Farces are carried on, which are acted almost daily in every Village in the Kingdom.  He must have a very despicable Opinion of Mankind indeed, who can conceive them to be imposed on as often as they appear to be so. The Truth is, they are in the same Situation with the Readers of Romances ; who, though they know the whole to be one entire Fiction, nevertheless agree to be deceived; and as these find Amusement, so do the others find Ease and Convenience in this Concurrence. But this being a Sub- digression, I return to my Digression. have before said, to his Purposes, and keep himself as much behind the Curtain as possible; and though it must be acknowledged that two very GREAT Men, whose Names will be both recorded in History, did, in former Times, come forth themselves on the Stage; and did hack and hew, and lay each other most cruelly open to the Diversion of the Spectators; yet this must be mentioned rather as an Example of Avoidance, than Imitation, and is to be ascribed to the Number of those Instances which serve to evince the Truth of these Maxims:  Nemo mortalium omnibus horis sapit. Ira furor brevis est, &c. Elogiums on Constables, &c. And new Instances of Friendly's Folly. ready to proceed on its Journey: Fireblood was the Person chosen by Wild for this Service. He had, on the late Occasion, experienced the Talents of this Youth for a good round Perjury.  He immediately, therefore, found him out, and proposed it to him, and, receiving his instant Assent, they consulted together, and soon framed an Evidence, which, being communicated to one of the most bitter and severe Creditors of Heartfree, by him laid before a Magistrate, and attested by the Oath of Fireblood, the Justice granted his Warrant; and Heartfree was accordingly apprehended and brought before him. diverting himself with his little Children, the youngest of whom sat on his Knees, and the eldest was playing at a little Distance from him with Friendly . The Constable, who was a very good sort of a Man, but one very laudably severe in his Office, after acquainting Heartfree with his Errand, bad him come along and be d---d, and leave those little Bastards; for so, he said, he supposed they were, for a Legacy to the Parish. Heartfree was much surprized at hearing there was a Warrant for Felony against him; but he shewed less Concern than Friendly did in his Countenance.  The eldest Daughter, when she saw the Constable lay hold on her Father, immediately quitted her Play, and, running to him, and bursting into Tears, cry'd out:  You shall not hurt poor Papa. One of the other Ruffians offered to take the little one rudely from his Knees; but Heartfree started up, and, catching the Fellow by the Collar, dashed his Head so violently against the Wall, that, had he had any Brains, he might possibly have lost them by the Blow. Adversity, had some Prudence mixt with his Zeal for Justice. Seeing, therefore, this rough Treatment of his Companion, he began to pursue more gentle Methods, and very civilly desired Mr. Heartfree to go with him, seeing he was an Officer, and obliged to execute his Warrant; that he was sorry for his Misfortune, and hoped he would be acquitted.  The other answered, he should patiently submit to the Laws of his Country, and would attend him whither he was ordered to conduct him; then, taking Leave of his Children with a tender Kiss, he recommended them to the Care of Friendly ; who promised to see them safe Home, and then to attend him at the Justice's, whose Name and Abode he had learnt of the Constable. Mittimus against his Friend; for the Evidence of Fireblood was so clear and strong, and the Justice was so incensed against Heartfree, and so convinced of his Guilt, that he would hardly hear him speak in his own Defence, which the Reader perhaps, when he hears the Evidence against him, will be less inclined to censure: For this Witness deposed, "that he had been, by Heartfree himself, employed to carry the Orders of Embezzling to Wild, in order to be delivered to his Wife; that he had been afterwards present with Wild and her at the Inn, when they took Coach for Harwich, where she shewed him the Casket of Jewels, and desired him to tell her Husband, that she had fully executed his Command. no Effect, nor was it any way possible for Heartfree to escape being committed to Newgate, he resolved to accompany him thither: Where, when they arrived, the Keeper would have confined Heartfree (he having no Money) amongst the common Felons; but Friendly would not permit it, and advanced every Shilling he had in his Pocket, to procure a Room in the Press-Yard for his Friend. his Friend, desiring him, after many Thanks for his Fidelity, to be comforted on his Account. "I know not, says he, how far God may permit the Malice of my Enemies to prevail. But whatever my Sufferings are, I am convinced my Innocence will somewhere be rewarded.  If, therefore, any fatal Accident should happen to me, (for he who is in the Hands of Perjury, may apprehend the worst) my dear Friendly, be a Father to my poor Children," at which Words the Tears gushed from his Eyes.  The other begged him not to admit any such Apprehensions; for that he would employ his utmost Diligence in his Service, and doubted not but to subvert any villainous Design laid for his Destruction, and to make his Innocence appear to the World as white as it was in his own Opinion. appear very unnatural and incredible to our Reader; which is, that, notwithstanding the former Character and Behaviour of Heartfree, this Story of his embezzling was so far from surprizing his Neighbours, that many of them declared they expected no better from him. Some were assured he could pay forty Shillings in the Pound, if he would. Others had overheard Hints formerly pass between him and Mrs. Heartfree, which had given them Suspicions.  And, what is most astonishing of all is, that many of those who had before censured him for an extravagant heedless Fool, now no less confidently abused him for a cunning, tricking, avaricious Knave. Something concerning Fireblood, which will surprize; and somewhat touching one of the Miss Snaps, which will greatly concern the Reader. his Misfortunes at home, Heartfree in Newgate enjoyed a quiet, undisturbed Repose; while our Hero, nobly disdaining Rest, lay sleepless all Night; partly from the Apprehensions of Mrs. Heartfree's Return before he had executed his Scheme; and partly from a Suspicion lest Fireblood should betray him; of whole Infidelity he had, nevertheless, no other Cause to maintain any Fear, but from his knowing him to be an accomplished Rascal, as the Vulgar term it, a complete GREAT Man in our Language.  And indeed, to confess the Truth, these Doubts were not without some Foundation; for the very same Thought unluckily entred the Head of that noble Youth, who considered, whether he might not possibly sell himself for some Advantage to the other Side, as he had yet no Promise from Wild ; but this was, by the Sagacity of the latter, prevented in the Morning with a Profusion of Promises, which shewed him to be of the most generous Temper in the World, with which Fireblood was extremely well satisfied; and made use of so many Protestations of his Faithfulness, that he convinced Wild of the Injustice of his Suspicions. our Hero, we cannot avoid relating, as it occasioned great Confusion in his Family, as well as in the Family of Snap . It is indeed a Calamity highly to be lamented, when it stains untainted Blood, and happens to an honourable House. An Injury never to be repaired.  A Blot never to be wiped out.  A Sore never to be healed. To detain my Reader no longer: Miss Theodosia Snap was now safely delivered of a Male-Infant, the Product of an Amour which that beautiful (O that I could say, virtuous) Creature had with the Count. Agonies of Despair both in his Voice and Countenance, brought them this melancholy News. Our Hero, who had (as we have said) wonderful Good-nature when his Greatness or Interest was not concerned, instead of reviling his Sister-in-Law, asked with a Smile: "Who was the Father?" But the chaste L aetitia, we repeat the chaste, for well did she now deserve that Epithet; received it in another Manner. She fell into the utmost Fury at the Relation, reviled her Sister in the bitterest Terms, and vowed she would never see nor speak to her more. Then burst into Tears, and lamented over her Father, that such a Dishonour should ever happen to him and herself.  At length she fell severely on her Husband, for the light Treatment which he gave this fatal Accident.  She told him, he was unworthy of the Honour he enjoyed, of marrying into a chaste Family. That she looked on it as an Affront to her Virtue. That if he had married one of the naughty Hussies of the Town, he could not have behaved to her in a worse Manner. She concluded with desiring her Father to make an Example of the Slut, and turn her out of Doors; for that she would not otherwise enter his House, being resolved never to set her Foot within the same Threshold with the Trollop, whom she detested so much the more, because (which was perhaps true) she was her own Sister. So violent, and indeed so outragious was this chaste Lady's Love of Virtue, that she could not forgive a single Slip (indeed the only one Theodosia had ever made) in her own Sister, in a Sister who loved her, and to whom she owed a thousand Obligations. the Honour of his Family, would have relented, had not the Parish-Officers been extremely pressing on this Occasion, and, for want of Security, conveyed the unhappy young Lady to a Place, the Name of which, for the Honour of the Snaps, to whom our Hero was so nearly allied, we bury in eternal Oblivion; where she suffered so much Correction for her Crime, that the good-natured Reader of the Male kind may be inclined to compassionate her, at least to imagine she was sufficiently punished for a Fault, which, with Submission to the chaste L aetitia, and all other strictly virtuous Ladies, it should be either less criminal in a Woman to commit, or more so in a Man to solicit her to it. human Greatness and Happiness are not always inseparable. He was under a continual Alarm of Frights, and Fears, and Jealousies. He thought every Man he beheld wore a Knife for his Throat, and a Pair of Scissars for his Purse.  As for his own Gang particularly, he was throughly convinced there was not a single Man amongst them, who would not, for the Value of five Shillings, bring him to the Gallows.  These Apprehensions so constantly broke his Rest, and kept him so assiduously on his Guard, to frustrate and circumvent any Designs which might be forming against him; that his Condition, to any other than the glorious Eye of Ambition, might seem rather deplorable, than the Object of Envy or Desire. In which our Hero makes a Speech well worthy to be celebrated; and the Behaviour of one of the Gang perhaps more unnatural than any other Part of this History. trade in dead Oxen, Sheep, & c. in short, what the Vulgar call a Butcher . This Gentleman had two Qualities of a GREAT Man, viz. undaunted Courage, and an absolute Contempt of those ridiculous Distinctions of Meum and Tuum .  The common Forms of exchanging Property by Trade seemed to him too tedious; he therefore resolved to quit the mercantile Profession, and, falling acquainted with some of Mr. Wild's People, he provided himself with Arms, and enlisted of the Gang. In which he behaved for some time with great Decency and Order, and submitted to accept such Share of the Booty with the rest, as our Hero allotted him. before remembered a third heroic Quality, namely, Ambition, which was no inconsiderable Part of his Composition. One Day, therefore, having robbed a Gentleman at Windsor of a Gold-Watch; which, on its being advertised in the News-Paper, with a considerable Reward, was demanded of him by Wild, he peremptorily refused to deliver it. "How, Mr. Blueskin ! says Wild, you will not deliver the Watch? No, Mr. Wild, answered he; I have taken it, and will keep it; or, if I dispose of it, I will dispose of it myself, and keep the Money for which I sell it. Sure, replied Wild, you have not the Assurance to pretend you have any Property or Right in this Watch? I am certain, returned Blueskin, whether I have any Right in it or no, you can prove none. I will undertake, cries the other, to shew I have an absolute Right to it, and that by the Laws of our Gang, of which I am providentially at the Head. I know not who put you at the Head of it, cries Blueskin ; but those who did, certainly did it for their own Good, that you might conduct them the better in their Robberies, inform them of the richest Booties, prevent Surprize, pack Juries, bribe Evidence, and so contribute to their Benefit and Safety; and not to convert all their Labour and Hazard to your own Benefit and Advantage.  You are greatly mistaken, Sir, answered Wild ; you are talking of a legal Society, where the chief Magistrate is always chosen for the public Good, which, as we see in all the legal Societies of the World, he constantly consults, daily contributing, by his superiour Skill, to their Prosperity, and not sacrificing their Good to his own Wealth, or Pleasure, or Humour:  But in an illegal Society or Gang, as this of ours, it is otherwise; for who would be at the Head of a Gang, unless for his own Interest? And without a Head, you know, you cannot subsist. Nothing but a Head, and Obedience to that Head, can preserve a Gang a Moment from Destruction. It is absolutely better for you to content yourselves with a moderate Reward, and enjoy that in Safety at the Disposal of your Chief, than to engross the whole with the Hazard to which you will be liable without my Protection. And surely there is none in the whole Gang, who hath less Reason to complain than you; you have tasted of my Favours; witness that Piece of Ribbon you wear in your Hat, with which I dubbed you Captain. \---Therefore pray, Captain, deliver the Watch.  \---D---n your cajoling, says Blueskin : Do you think I value myself on this Bit of Ribband, which I could have bought myself for six-pence, and wore without your Leave? Do you imagine I think myself a Captain, because you whom I know not empowered to make one, call me so? The Name of Captain is but a Shadow: The Men and the Salary are the Substance: And I am not to be bubbled with a Shadow. I will be called Captain no longer, and he who flatters me by that Name, I shall think affronts me, and I will knock him down, I assure you. \---Did ever Man talk so unreasonably, cries Wild . Are you not respected as a Captain by the whole Gang since my dubbing you so? But it is the Shadow only; it seems, and you will knock a Man down for affronting you, who calls you Captain. Might not a Man as reasonably tell a Minister of State: Sir, you have given me the Shadow only. The Ribbon, or the Bawble, that you give me, implies that I have either signalized myself, by some great Action, for the Benefit and Glory of my Country; or at least that I am descended from those who have done so .  I know myself to be a Scoundrel, and so have been those few Ancestors I can remember, or have ever heard of. Therefore I am resolved to knock the first Man down, who calls me Sir, or Right Honourable. But all GREAT and wise Men think themselves sufficiently repaid by what procures them Honour and Precedence in the Gang, without enquiring into Substance; nay, if a Title, or a Feather, be equal to this Purpose, they are Substance, and not mere Shadows; but I have not Time to argue with you at present, so give me the Watch without any more Deliberation. I am no more a Friend to Deliberation than yourself, answered Blueskin, and so I tell you once for all, By G--- I never will give you the Watch, no, nor will I ever hereafter surrender any Part of my Booty. I won it, and I will wear it.  Take your Pistols yourself, and go out on the Highway, and don't lazily think to fatten yourself with the Dangers and Pains of other People."  At which Words he departed in a fierce Mood, and repaired to the Tavern used by the Gang, where he had appointed to meet some of his Acquaintance, whom he informed of what had passed between him and Wild, and advised them all to follow his Example; which they all readily agreed to, and Mr. Wild's D---tion was the universal Toast: In drinking Bumpers to which, they had finished a large Bowl of Punch, when a Constable, with a numerous Attendance, and Wild at their Head, entered the Room, and seized on Blueskin, whom his Companions, when they saw our Hero, did not dare attempt to rescue. The Watch was found upon him, which, together with Wild's Information, was more than sufficient to commit him to Newgate . Blueskin, met at the Tavern, where nothing was to be seen but the profoundest Submission to their Leader.  They vilified and abused Blueskin as much as they had before abused our Hero, and now repeated the same Toast, only changing the Name of Wild into that of Blueskin .  All agreeing with Wild, that the Watch found in his Pocket, and which must be a fatal Evidence against him, was a just Judgment on his Disobedience and Revolt. directly to the Justice when Blueskin left him) quell one of the most dangerous Conspiracies which could possibly arise in a Gang; and which, had it been permitted one Day's Growth, would inevitably have ended in his Destruction; so much doth it behoove GREAT Men and Prigs to be eternally on their Guard, and expeditious in the Execution of their Purposes; while none but weak and honest Men can indulge themselves in Remissness or Repose. though he had a little too hastily concurred in cursing his Friend, and vowing his Perdition; yet now he saw all that Scheme dissolved, he returned to his Integrity; of which he gave an incontestable Proof, by informing Wild of the Measures which had been concerted against him.  In which, he said, he had pretended to acquiesce, in order the better to betray them; but this, as he afterwards confessed on his Death-Bed, i. e. in the Cart at Tyburn, was only a Copy of his Countenance; for that he was, at that Time, as sincere and hearty in his Opposition to Wild as any of his Companions. as they had seen their Errors, and repented, nothing was more noble than Forgiveness. But though he was pleased modestly to ascribe this to his Lenity, it really arose from much more noble and political Principles.  He considered that it would be dangerous to attempt the Punishment of so many; besides, he flattered himself that Fear would keep them in Order; and indeed he concluded, that Fireblood had told him nothing more than he knew before, viz. that they were all complete Prigs, whom he was to govern by their Fears, and in whom he was to place no more Confidence than was necessary, and to watch them with the utmost Caution and Circumspection; for a Rogue, he wisely said, was like Gunpowder, which, whoever uses, must do it very cautiously, lest it blow up himself, instead of executing his mischievous Purpose against some other Person or Animal. GREAT Men of this History are hastening as fast as possible; and, to confess the Truth, it is a Castle very far from being an improper, or misbecoming Habitation for any GREAT Man whatever. And as this Scene will continue during the Residue of our History, we shall open it with a new Book,; and shall, therefore, take this Opportunity of closing our third. THE HISTORY OF THE LIFE of the late Mr. Jonathan Wild the Great. BOOK IV. A Sentiment of the Ordinary's, worthy to be written in Letters of Gold; a very extraordinary Instance of Folly in Friendly ; and a dreadful Accident which befel our Hero. with his Children, and other Instances of a good Heart, which betrayed themselves in his Actions and Conversation, possessed all about him that he was one of the silliest Fellows in the Universe.  The Ordinary himself, a very sagacious as well as worthy Person, declared that he was a cursed Rogue, but no Conjurer. Opinion in the Ordinary was a wicked Sentiment which Heartfree one Day disclosed in Conversation, and which we, who are truly Orthodox, will not pretend to justify, viz. That he believed a sincere Turk would be saved. To this the good Man, with becoming Zeal and Indignation, answered, I know not what may become of a sincere Turk, but if this be your Persuasion, I pronounce it impossible you should be saved . No, Sir, so far from a sincere Turk's being within the Pale of Salvation, neither will any sincere Presbyterian, Anabaptist, nor Quaker whatever, be saved. Friendly to abandon his old Master.  He spent his whole time with him, except only those Hours when he was absent for his Sake, in procuring Evidence for him against his Trial, which was now shortly to come on.  Indeed this young Man was the only Comfort, besides a clear Conscience, and the Hopes beyond the Grave, which this poor Wretch had; for the Sight of his Children was like one of those alluring Pleasures which Men in some Diseases indulge themselves often fatally in, which at once flatter and heighten their Malady. FRIENDLY being one Day present while Heartfree was, with Tears in his Eyes, embracing his eldest Daughter, and lamenting the hard Fate to which he feared he should be obliged to leave her, spoke to him thus. "I have long observed with Admiration, thou excellent Man, the Magnanimity with which you go thro' your own Misfortunes, and the steady Countenance with which you look on Death.  I have observed that all your Agonies arise from the Thoughts of parting with your Children, and leaving them in a distrest Condition; now, tho' I hope all these Fears will prove ill-grounded, yet, that I may relieve you as much as possible from them, be assured, that as nothing can give me more real Misery, than to observe so tender and loving a Concern in a Master, to whose Goodness I owe so many Obligations, and whom I so sincerely love, so nothing can afford me equal Pleasure with my contributing to lessen or to remove it. Be convinced, therefore, if you can place any Confidence in my Promise, that I will employ my little Fortune, which you know to be not entirely inconsiderable, in the Support of this your little Family. Should any Misfortune, which I pray God avert, happen to you before you have better provided for these little ones, I will be myself their Father, nor shall either of them ever know Distress, if it be any way in my Power to prevent it. Your youngest daughter I will provide for, and as for my little Prattler, your eldest, as I never yet thought of any Woman for a Wife, I will receive her as such at your Hands; nor will I ever relinquish her for another." Heartfree flew to his Friend, and embraced him with Raptures of Acknowledgments. He vowed to him that he had eased every anxious Thought of his Mind but one, and that he must carry with him out of the World. "O Friendly, (cried he) it is my Concern for that best of Women, whom I hate myself for having ever censured in my Opinion. O Friendly, thou didst know her Goodness, yet, sure her perfect Character none but myself was ever acquainted with. She had every perfection both of Mind and Body, which Heaven hath indulged to her whole Sex, and enjoyed all in a higher Excellence than Nature ever suffered another to possess a single Virtue. Can I bear the Loss of such a Woman? Can I bear the Apprehensions of what Mischiefs that Villain may have done to her, of which Death is perhaps the lightest?" Friendly gently interrupted him as soon as he saw any Opportunity, endeavouring to comfort him on this Head likewise, by magnifying every Circumstance which could possibly afford any Hopes of his seeing her again. an Height of Friendship, he had soon obtained in the Castle the Character of as odd and silly a Fellow as his Master. Indeed, they were both the By-word, Laughingstock, and Contempt of the whole Place. Hicks's-Hall had found the Bill of Indictment against Heartfree, and on the second Day of the Sessions he was brought to his Trial; where, notwithstanding the utmost Efforts of Friendly, and of the honest old Female Servant, the Circumstances of the Fact corroborating the Evidence of Fireblood, as well as that of Wild, who counterfeited the most artful Reluctance at appearing against his old Friend Heartfree, the Jury found the Prisoner guilty. certainly unavoidable, seeing that Heartfree was entirely void of Interest with the Great, and was besides convicted on a Statute, the Infringers of which could hope no Pardon. wonderful an Effort of Greatness, that it probably made Fortune envious of her own Darling; but whether it was from this Envy, or only from that known Inconstancy and Weakness so often and judiciously remarked in that Lady's Temper, who frequently lifts Men to the Summit of human Greatness, only  \---Ut Lapsu graviore ruant; certain it is, she now began to meditate Mischief against Wild, who seems to have come to that Period, at which all the Heroes and great Men of Antiquity have arrived, and which she was resolved they never should transcend. In short, there seems to be a certain Measure of Mischief and Iniquity, which every great Man is to fill up, and then Fortune looks on him of no more Use than a Silk-Worm whose Bottom is spun, and deserts him. For Mr. Blueskin being convicted the same Day of Robbery, by our Hero, an Unkindness, which tho' he had drawn on himself and necessitated him to, he took greatly amiss; as Wild was standing near him, with that Disregard and Indifference which great Men are too carelessly inclined to have for those whom they have ruined; Blueskin privily drawing a Knife, thrust the same into the Body of our Hero with such Violence, that all who saw it concluded he had done his Business.  And indeed, had not Fortune, not so much out of Love to our Hero, as from a fixed Resolution to accomplish a certain Purpose of which we have formerly given a Hint, carefully placed his Guts out of the Way, he must have fallen a Sacrifice to the Wrath of his Enemy, which, as he said, he did not deserve; for had he been contented to have robbed and only submitted to give him the Booty, he might have still continued safe and un- impeached in the Gang; but so it was, that the Knife missing those noble Parts (the noblest of many) the Guts, perforated only the hollow of his Belly, and caused no other Harm than an immoderate Effusion of Blood, of which, tho' it at present weakened him, he soon after recovered. For as very few People (those greatest of all Men, absolute Princes, excepted) attempt to cut the Thread of human Life, like the Fatal Sisters, merely out of Wantonness and for their Diversion, but rather by so doing propose to themselves the Acquisition of some future Good, or the avenging some past Evil; and as the former of these Motives did not appear probable, it put inquisitive Persons on examining into the latter.  Now, as the vast Schemes of Wild, when they were discovered, however Great in their Nature, seemed to some persons like the Projects of most other great Men, rather to be calculated for the Glory of the great Man himself, than to redound to the general Good of Society; designs began to be laid by several of those who thought it principally their Duty to put a Stop to the future Progress of our Hero, and a learned Judge particularly, a great Enemy to this kind of of Parliament as a Trap for Wild, which he soon after fell into.  By this Law it was made Capital in a Prig to steal with the Hands of other People. A Law so plainly calculated for the Destruction of all Priggish Greatness, that it was indeed impossible for our Hero to avoid it. A short Hint concerning popular Ingratitude. Mr. Wild's Arrival in the Castle, with other Occurrences to be found in no other History. which so many Writers have observed in all free Governments towards their by raising their own Greatness, in which the whole Body (as the Kingdom of France thinks itself in the Glory of their Grand Monarch) was so deeply concerned, have been sometimes sacrificed by those very People for whose Glory the said great Men were so industriously at work:  And this from a foolish Zeal for a certain ridiculous imaginary Thing called Liberty, to which great Men are observed to have a great Animosity. received from some dutiful Members of the Gang, a valuable Piece of Goods, did, for a Consideration somewhat short of its original Price, re-convey it to the right Owner; for which Fact being ungratefully informed against by the said Owner, he was surprized in his own House, and being over-power'd by Numbers, was hurried before a Magistrate, and by him committed to that Castle, which, suitable as it is to Greatness, we do not chuse to name too often in our History, and where many great Men, at this Time, happened to be assembled. Castle, having been Mr. Wild's old Friend and Acquaintance, made the latter greatly satisfied with the Place of his Confinement, as he promised himself not only a kind Reception and handsome Accommodation there, but even to obtain his Liberty from him, if he thought it necessary to desire it:  But alas! he was deceived, his old Friend knew him no longer, and refusing to see him, ordered the Lieutenant Governor to insist on as high Garnish for Fetters, and as exorbitant a Price for Lodging, as if he had had a fine Gentleman in Custody for Murther, or as if he had received an Intimation from a certain Place to use all the Severity imaginable to his Prisoner. To confess a melancholy Truth, it is a Circumstance much to be lamented; that there is no absolute Dependence on the Friendship of great Men . An Observation which hath been frequently made by those who have lived in Courts or in Newgate, or in any other Place set apart for the Habitation of the said great Men . Visit from his Wife; and much more so, when, instead of a Countenance ready to insult him, the only Motive to which he could ascribe her Presence, he saw the Tears trickling down her lovely Cheeks.  He embraced her with the utmost Marks of Affection, and declared he could hardly regret his Confinement, since it had produced such an Instance of the Happiness he enjoyed in her, whose Fidelity to him on this Occasion, would, he believed, make him the Envy of most Husbands, even in Newgate . He then begged her to dry her Eyes, and be comforted; for that Matters might go better with him than she expected. "No, no, (says she) I am certain you will be found guilty Death . I knew what it would always come to. I told you it was impossible to carry on such a Trade long; but you would not be advised, and now you see the Consequence, now you repent when it is too late. All the Comfort I shall have when you are ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 9 nubbed, is that I gave you good Advice.  If you had always gone out by yourself, as I would have had you, you might have robbed on to the End of the Chapter; but you was wiser than all the World, or rather lazier, and see what your Laziness is come to.  \---To the ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 10 Cheat, for thither you will go now, that's infallible. And a just Judgment on you for following your headstrong Will; I am the only Person to be pitied, poor I, who shall be scandalized for your Fault. There goes she whose Husband was hanged: Methinks I hear them crying so already". At which Words she burst into Tears. He could not then forbear chiding her for this unnecessary Concern on his Account, and begged her not to trouble him any more. She answered with some Spirit, "On your Account, and be d---d to you! No, if the old Cull of a Justice had not sent me here, I believe it would have been long enough before I should have come hither to see after you: D---n me, I am committed for the  11 Filing-Lay, Man, and we shall be both nubbed together.  I faith, my dear, it almost makes me Amends for being nubbed myself, to have the Pleasure of seeing thee nubbed too.  Indeed, my Dear, (answered Wild ) it is what I have always wished for thee; but I do not desire to bear thee Company, and I have still Hopes to have the Pleasure of seeing you go without me; at least I will have the Pleasure to be rid of you now." And so saying, he seized her by the Waste, and with strong Arm flung her out of the Room; but not before she had with her Nails left a bloody Memorial on his Cheek: And thus this fond Couple parted. unwelcome Visit, proceeding from the disagreeable Fondness of his Wife, had thrown him, than the faithful Achates appeared. The Presence of this Youth was indeed a Cordial to his Spirits.  He received him with open Arms, and expressed the utmost Satisfaction in the Fidelity of his Friendship, which so far exceeded the Fashion of the Times, and said many Things, which we have forgot, on the Occasion; but we remember they all tended to the Praise of Fireblood, whose Modesty, at length, put a Stop to the Torrent of Compliments, by asserting he had done no more than his Duty, and that he should have detested himself, could he have forsaken his Friend in his Adversity, and after many Protestations, that he came the Moment he heard of his Misfortune, he asked him if he could be of any Service.  Wild answered, since he had so kindly proposed that Question, he must say he should be obliged to him, if he could lend him a few Guineas; for that he was very seedy . Fireblood replied, that he was greatly unhappy in not having it then in his Power, adding many hearty Oaths, that he had not a Farthing of Money in his Pocket, which was, indeed, strictly true; for he had only a Bank- Note which he had that Evening purloined from a Gentleman in the Playhouse- Passage. He then asked for his Wife, to whom, to speak truly, the Visit was intended, her Confinement being the Misfortune of which he had just heard; for, as for that of Mr. Wild himself, he had known it from the first, without ever intending to trouble him with his Company.  Being informed therefore of the Visit which had lately happened, he reproved Wild for his cruel Treatment of that good Creature; then taking as sudden Leave as he civilly could of the Gentleman, he hastned to comfort his Lady, who received him with great Kindness. Curious Anecdotes relating to the History of Newgate . Johnson, a very great Man, who had long been at the Head of all the Prigs, and had raised Contributions on them. He examined into the Nature of their Defence, procured and instructed their Evidence, and made himself, at least in their Opinions, so necessary to them, that the whole Fate of Newgate seemed entirely to depend upon him. Man. He represented him to the Prigs as a Fellow, who under the plausible Pretence of assisting their Causes, was in Reality undermining the Liberties of Newgate . He at first only threw out certain sly Hints and Insinuations; but having by Degrees formed a Party against Roger, he one Day assembled them together, and spoke to them in the following florid Manner. Friends and Fellow-Citizens. "The Cause which I am to mention to you this Day, is of such mighty Importance, that when I consider my own small Abilities, I tremble with an Apprehension, lest your Safety may be rendered precarious by the Weakness of him who is representing to you your Danger. Gentlemen, the Liberty of Newgate is at Stake: Your Privileges have been long undermined, and are now openly violated by one Man; by one who hath engrossed to himself the whole Conduct of your Trials, under Colour of which, he exacts what Contributions on you he pleases: But are these Sums appropriated to the Uses for which they are raised? Your frequent Convictions at the Old Baily must too sensibly and sorely demonstrate the contrary. What Evidence doth he ever produce for the Prisoner, which he of himself could not have provided, and often better instructed? How many noble Youths have there been lost, when a single Alibi would have saved them! Should I be silent, nay, could your own Injuries want a Tongue to remonstrate, the very Breath, which by his Neglect hath been stopped at the Cheat, would cry out loudly against him. Nor is the Exorbitancy of his Plunders visible only in the dreadful Consequences it hath produced to the Prigs, nor glares it only in the Miseries brought on them: It blazes forth in the more desirable Effects it hath wrought for himself, in the rich Perquisites acquired by it: Witness that Silk Night-Gown, that Robe of Shame, which to his eternal Dishonour he publickly wears; that Gown, which I will not scruple to call the Winding-Sheet of the Liberties of Newgate .  Is there a Prig who hath the Interest and Honour of Newgate so little at Heart, that he can refrain from Blushing when he beholds that Trophy, purchased with the Breath of so many Prigs !  Nor is this all. His Wastecoat embroidered with Silk, and his Velvet Cap, bought with the same Price, are Ensigns of the same Disgrace. Some would think the Rags which covered his Nakedness, when first he was committed hither, well exchanged for these gaudy Trappings; but in my Eye, no Exchange can be profitable when Dishonour is the Condition. If, therefore, Newgate \---" Here the only Copy which we could procure of this Speech breaks off abruptly; however, we can assure the Reader from very authentic Information, that he concluded with advising the Prigs to put their Affairs into other Hands. After which, one of his Party, in a very long Speech, recommended him ( Wild himself) to their Choice. NEWGATE was divided into Parties on this Occasion; the Prigs on each Side writing to one another, and representing their Chief of GREAT Man to be the only Person by whom the Affairs of Newgate could be managed with Safety and Advantage.  The Prigs had indeed very different Interests; for both Parties were permitted by their Leader to have their Share in the Plunder, which the Friends of Johnson had already enjoyed, and which those of Wild expected on his Exaltation; what may seem more remarkable was, that the Debtors, who were entirely unconcerned in the Dispute, and who were the destined Plunder of both Parties, should interest themselves with the utmost Violence, some on Behalf of Wild, and others in Favour of Johnson . So that all Newgate resounded with Wild for ever, Johnson for ever  . And such Quarrels and Animosities happened between them, that they seemed rather the People of two Countries long at War with each other, than the Inhabitants of the same Castle. WILD's Party at length prevailed, and he succeeded to the Place and Power of Johnson, whom he presently stript of all his Finery; but when it was proposed, that he should sell it, and divide the Money for the good of the whole; he waved that Motion, saying, it was not yet Time, that he should find a better Opportunity, that the Clothes wanted cleaning, with many other Pretences, and, within two Days, to the Surprize of many, he appeared in them himself; for which he vouchsafed no other Apology than, that they fitted him much better than they did Johnson, and that they became him in a much more elegant Manner. by whose Means he had been promoted. They grumbled extremely, and vented great Indignation against Wild ; when one Day a very grave Man, and one of much Authority among them, bespoke them as follows: " Nothing sure can be more justly ridiculous than the Conduct of those, who, like Children, lay the Lamb in the Wolf's Way, and then lament his being devoured. What a Wolf is in a Sheepfold, a Great Man is in Society.  Now, when one Wolf is in Possession of a Sheepfold, how little would it avail the simple Flock to expel him, and place another in his stead?  Of the same Benefit to us is the overthrowing one Prig in Favour of another. And for what other Advantage was your Struggle? Did you not all know, that Wild and his Followers were Prigs, as well as Johnson and his? What then could the Contention be among such, but that which you have now discovered it to have been? Perhaps some would say, Is it then our Duty tamely to submit to the Rapine of the Prig who now plunders us, for Fear of an Exchange? Surely No: But I answer, It is better to shake the Plunder off than to exchange the Plunderer. And by what Means can we effect this, but by a total Change in our Manners? Every Prig is a Slave. His own Priggish Desires, which enslave him themselves, betray him to the Tyranny of others. To preserve, therefore, the Liberty of Newgate, is to change the Manners of Newgate .  Let us, therefore, who are confined here for Debt only, separate ourselves entirely from the Prigs ; neither drink with them, nor converse with them.  Let us, at the same time, separate ourselves farther from Priggism itself. Instead of being ready, on every Opportunity, to pillage each other, let us be content with our honest Share of the common Bounty, and with the Acquisition of our own Industry. When we separate from the Prigs, let us enter into a closer Alliance with one another. Let us consider ourselves all as Members of one Community, to the public Good of which we are to sacrifice our private Views; not to give up the Interest of the whole for the least Pleasure or Profit which shall accrue to our selves.  Liberty is consistent with no Degree of Honesty inferiour to this, and the Community where this abounds, no Prig will have the Impudence or Audaciousness to endeavour to enslave; but, while one Man pursues his Ambition, another his Interest, another his Safety; while one hath a Roguery (a Priggism they here call it) to commit, and another a Roguery to defend, they must naturally fly to the Favour and Protection of those, who have Power to give them what they desire, and to defend them from what they fear; nay, in this View it becomes their Interest to promote this Power in their Patrons.  Now, Gentlemen, when we are no longer Prigs, we shall no longer have these Fears or these Desires. What remains, therefore, for us, but to resolve bravely to lay aside our Priggism, our Roguery, in plainer Words, and preserve our Liberty, or to give up the latter in the Preservation and Preference of the former. levy Contributions among the Prisoners, to apply the Garnish to his own Use, and to strut openly in the Ornaments which he had stript from Johnson . To speak sincerely, there was more Bravado than real Use or Advantage in these Trappings. As for the Night-Gown, its Outside indeed made a glittering Tinsel Appearance, but it kept him not warm; nor could the Finery of it do him much Honour, since every one knew it did not properly belong to him, nor indeed suited his Degree:  As to the Wastecoat, it fitted him very ill, being infinitely too big for him; and the Cap was so heavy, that it made his Head ake.  Thus these Clothes, which perhaps (as they presented the Idea of their Misery more sensibly to the People's Eyes) brought him more Envy, Hatred, and Detraction, than all his deeper Impositions, and more real Advantages; afforded very little Use or Honour to the Wearer; nay, could scarce serve to amuse his own Vanity, when it was cool enough to reflect with the least Seriousness. And, should I speak in the Language of a Man who estimated human Happiness without regard to that History, it is probable he never took ( i. e. robbed the Prisoners of) a Shilling, which he himself did not pay too dear for. The Dead-Warrant arrives for Heartfree ; on which Occasion Wild betrays some human Weakness. Execution of Heartfree among the rest of the Prisoners. And here the Reader must excuse us, who profess to draw natural, not perfect Characters, and to record the Truths of History, not the Extravagancies of Romance, while we relate a Weakness in Wild, of which we are ourselves ashamed, and which we would willingly have concealed, could we have preserved at the same Time that strict Attachment to Truth and Impartiality, which we have vowed in recording the Annals of this GREAT Man.  Know then, Reader, that this Dead-Warrant did not not affect Heartfree, who was to suffer a shameful Death by it, with half the Concern it gave Wild, who had been the Occasion of it.  He had been a little struck the Day before, on seeing the Children carried away in Tears from their Father. This Sight brought the Remembrance of some slight Injuries he had done the Father, to his Mind, which he endeavoured, as much as possible, to obliterate; but when one of the Keepers (I should say, Lieutenants of the Castle) repeated Heartfree's Name among those of the Malefactors who were to suffer within a few Days, the Blood forsook his Countenance, and, in a cold still Stream, mov'd heavily to his Heart, which had scarce Strength enough left to return it through his Veins. In short, his Body so visibly demonstrated the Pangs of his Mind, that, to escape Observation, he retired to his Room, where he sullenly gave vent to such bitter Agonies, that even the injured Heartfree had not the Apprehension of what his Wife had suffered shut every Avenue of Compassion, would have pitied him. which the approaching Fate of the poor Wretch, who lay under a Sentence, which he had iniquitously brought upon him, had suggested.  Sleep promised him Relief; but this Promise was, alas! delusive. This certain Friend to the tired Body, is often the severest Enemy to the oppressed Mind. So at least it proved to Wild, adding visionary to real Horrours, and tormenting his Imagination with Fantoms too dreadful to be described. At length starting from these Visions, he no sooner recovered his waking Senses than he cry'd out: "I may yet prevent this Catastrophe. It is not too late to discover the whole." He then paused a Moment: But as it first offered itself to his Mind. He then reasoned thus coolly with himself: "Shall I, like a Child, or a Woman, or one of those mean Wretches, whom I have always despised, be frightened by Dreams and visionary Phantoms, to sully that Honour which I have so difficulty acquired, and so gloriously maintained!  Shall I, to redeem the worthless Life of this silly Fellow, suffer my Reputation to contract a Stain, which the Blood of Millions cannot wipe away!  Was it only that the few, the simple Part of Mankind, should call me a Rogue, perhaps I could submit; but to be for ever contemptible to the PRIGS, as a Wretch who wanted Spirit to execute my Undertaking, can never be digested. What is the Life of a single Man? Have not whole Armies and Nations been sacrificed to the Humour of ONE GREAT MAN ? Nay, to omit that first Class of Greatness, the Conquerors of Mankind, how often have Numbers fallen, by a fictitious Plot, only to satisfy the Spleen, or perhaps exercise the Ingenuity of a Member of that second Order of Greatness the Ministerial ! What have I done then? Why, I have ruined a Family, and brought an innocent Man to the Gallows. I ought rather to weep, with Alexander, that I have ruined no more, than to regret the little I have done."  He at length, therefore, bravely resolved to consign over Heartfree to his Fate, though it cost him more struggling than may easily be believed, utterly to conquer his Reluctance, and to banish away every Degree of Humanity from his Mind, these little Sparks of which composed one of those Weaknesses, which we lamented in the opening of our History. is seldom so kind as those Writers who draw Characters absolutely perfect. She seldom creates any Man so completely GREAT, or completely low, but that some Sparks of Humanity will glimmer in the former, and some Sparks of what the Vulgar call Evil, will dart forth in the latter; utterly to extinguish which will give some Pain and Uneasiness to both; for I apprehend, no Mind was ever yet formed entirely free from Blemish, unless peradventure that of a sanctified Hypocrite, whose Praises a well-fed Flatterer hath gratefully thought proper to sing forth. The Arrival of a Person little expected; with other Matters. Death. Friendly had, in the strongest Manner, confirmed his Assurance of fulfilling his Promise, of becoming a Father to one of his Children, and a Husband to the other. This gave him inexpressible Comfort, and he had, the Evening before, taken his last Leave of the little Wretches, with a Tenderness which drew a Tear from one of the Keepers, joined to a Magnanimity which would have pleased a Stoic . When he was informed that the Coach, which Friendly had provided for him, was ready, and that the rest of the Prisoners were gone, he embraced that faithful Friend with great Passion, and begged that he would leave him here; but the other desired Leave to accompany him to his End; which at last he was forced to comply with.  And now he was proceeding towards the Coach, when he found his Difficulties were not yet over; for now a Friend arrived, of whom he was to take a harder and more tender Leave than he had yet gone through.  This Friend, Reader, was no other than Mrs. Heartfree herself, who ran to him with a Look all wild, staring, and frantic, and, having reached his Arms, fainted away in them without uttering a single Syllable. Heartfree was, with great Difficulty, able to preserve his own Senses in such a Surprize at such a a Season. And indeed our good-natured Reader will be rather inclined to wish this miserable Couple had, by dying in each other's Arms, put a final Period to their Woes, than have survived to taste those bitter Moments which were to be their Portion, and which the unhappy Wife, soon recovering from the short Intermission of Being, now began to suffer. When she became first Mistress of her Voice, she burst forth into the following Accents: "O my Husband! \---Is this the Condition in which I find you after our cruel Separation! Who hath done this? Cruel Heaven! What is the Occasion?  I know thou canst deserve no Ill.  Tell me, some Body who can speak, while I have my Senses left to understand,---What is the Matter?" At which Words several laughed, and one answered: "The Matter! Why no great Matter. \---The Gentleman is not the first, nor won't be the last: The worst of the Matter is, that if we are to stay all the Morning here, I shall lose my Dinner." Heartfree, pausing a Moment, and recollecting himself, cyr'd out: "I will bear all with Patience." And then, addressing himself to the commanding Officer, begged he might only have a few Minutes by himself with his Wife, whom he had not seen before, since his Misfortunes. The GREAT Man answered: "He had Compassion on him, and would do more than he could answer; but he supposed he was too much a Gentleman not to know that something was due for such Civility."  On this hint, Friendly, who was himself half dead, pulled five Guineas out of his Pocket; which the GREAT Man took, and said, he would be so generous to give him ten Minutes; on which one observed, that many a Gentleman had bought ten Minutes with a Woman dearer, and many other facetious Remarks were made, unnecessary to be here related.  Heartfree was now suffered to retire into a Room with his Wife, the Commander informing him at his Entrance, that he must be expeditious, for that the rest of the good Company would be at the Tree before him, and he supposed he was a Gentleman of too much Breeding to make them wait. the Commander without carefully measured with his Watch; and Heartfree was mustering all his Resolution to part with what his Soul so ardently doated on, and to conjure her to support his Loss for the sake of her poor infants, and to comfort her with the Promise of Friendly on their Account; but all his Design was frustrated. Mrs. Heartfree could not support the Shock, but again fainted away, and so entirely lost every Symptom of Life, that Heartfree called vehemently for Assistance.  Friendly rushed first into the Room, and was soon followed by many others, and, what was remarkable, one who had unmoved beheld the tender Scene between these parting Lovers, was touched to the quick by the pale Looks of the Woman, and ran up and down for Water, Drops, & c. with the utmost Hurry and Confusion.  The ten Minutes were expired, which the Commander now hinted; and seeing nothing offered for the Renewal of the Term (for indeed Friendly had unhappily emptied his Pockets) he began to grow very importunate, and at last told Heartfree, He should be ashamed not to act more like a Man . Heartfree begged his Pardon, and said, he would make him wait no longer. Then, with the deepest Sigh, cry'd: "O my Angel!" and embracing his Wife with the utmost Eagerness, kissed her pale Lips with more Fervency than ever Bridegroom did the blushing Cheeks of his Bride; he then cry'd: "The Great God bless thee, and, if it be his Pleasure, restore thee to Life; if not, I beseech him we may presently meet again in a better World than this." He was breaking from her, when, perceiving her Sense returning, he could not forbear renewing his Embrace, and again pressing her Lips, which now recovered Life and Warmth so fast, that he begged one ten Minutes more to tell her what her Swooning had prevented her hearing.  The worthy Commander, being perhaps a little touched at this tender Scene, took Friendly aside, and asked him what he would give, if he would suffer his Friend to remain half an Hour? Friendly answered, any thing ; that he had no more Money in his Pocket, but he would certainly pay him that Afternoon. Well then, I'll be moderate, said he,---Twenty Guineas. \--- Friendly answered, It is a Bargain. The Commander having exacted a firm Promise, cry'd, ---Then I don't care if they stay a whole Hour together; for what signifies hiding good News? \---The Gentleman is reprieved ---; of which he had just before received Notice in a Whisper. It would be very impertinent to offer at a Description of the Joy this occasioned to the two Friends, or to Mrs. Heartfree, who was now again recovered. A Surgeon, who was happily present, was employed to bleed them all. After which, the Commander, who had his Promise of the Money again confirmed to him, wished Heartfree Joy, and, shaking him very friendly by the Hands, cleared the Room of all the Company, and left the three Friends together. In which the foregoing happy Incident is accounted for. Surgeon's Assistance also, and that there is no Passage in this whole Story, which can afford him equal Delight; yet lest our Reprieve should seem to resemble that in the Beggar's Opera, I shall endeavour to shew him, that this Incident, which is undoubtedly true, is at least as natural as delightful; for, we assure him, we would rather have suffered half Mankind to be hang'd, than have saved one contrary to the strictest Rules of Writing and Probability. GREAT Fireblood had been, a few Days before, taken in the Fact of a Robbery, and carried before the same Justice of Peace, who had, on his Evidence, committed Heartfree to Prison. This Magistrate, who did indeed no small Honour to the Commission he bore, duly considered the weighty Charge committed to him, by which he was intrusted with Decisions affecting the Lives, Liberties and Properties of his Countrymen; he therefore examined always with the utmost Diligence and Caution, into every minute Circumstance. And, as he had a good deal balanced, even when he committed Heartfree, on the excellent Character given him by Friendly and the Maid; and, as he was much staggered on finding of the two Persons, on whose Evidence alone Heartfree had been committed and had been since convicted, one, as he had heard, in Newgate for a Felony, and the other now brought before him for a Robbery, he thought proper to put the Matter very home to Fireblood at this time.  The young Achates was taken, as we have said, in the Fact; so that Denial, he saw, was in vain.  He, therefore, honestly confest what he knew must be proved; and desired, on the Merit of the Discoveries he made, to be admitted as an Evidence against his Accomplices. This afforded the happiest Opportunity to the Justice, to satisfy his Conscience in relation to Heartfree . He told Fireblood, that, if he expected the Favour he solicited, it must be on Condition, that he revealed the whole Truth to him concerning the Evidence which he had lately given against a Bankrupt, and which some Circumstances had induced a Suspicion of; that he might depend on it, the Truth would be discovered by other Means, and gave some oblique hints, (a Deceit entirely justifiable) that Wild himself had offered such a Discovery. The very Mention of Wild's Name immediately alarmed Fireblood, who did not in the least doubt the Readiness of that GREAT Man to hang any of the Gang, when his own Interest seemed to require it. He, therefore hesitated not a Moment; but, having obtained a Promise from the Justice, that he should be accepted as an Evidence, he discovered the whole Falshood, and that he had been seduced by Wild to depose as he had done. Villany, alias Greatness, lost not a Moment in using his utmost Endeavours to get the Case of the unhappy Convict represented to the Sovereign; who immediately granted him that gracious Reprieve, which caused such Happiness to the Persons concerned; and which, we hope, we have now accounted for to the Satisfaction of the Reader. Indeed we had Reason to apprehend, it would at first very greatly surprize him, and by that Means lessen the Pleasure of the Critics, a Sort of People, for whom, and for whose Entertainment, we have the tenderest Regard, and to whom we pay all that just Duty and Respect, which, of common Right, they ought to receive from every Author. it incumbent on him to visit him in the Prison, and to found, if possible, the Depth of this Affair, that if he should appear as innocent as he now began to conceive him, he might use all imaginable Methods to obtain his Pardon and Enlargement. described had passed, he went to Newgate, where he found those three Persons, namely Heartfree, his Wife, and Friendly, sitting together. The Justice informed the Prisoner of the Confession of Fireblood, with the Steps which he had taken upon it. The Reader will easily conceive the many outward Thanks as well as inward Gratitude which he received from all three; but those were of very little Consequence to him, compared with the secret Satisfaction he felt in his Mind, from reflecting on the Preservation of Innocence, as he soon after very clearly perceived was the Case. Earnestness:  As he perceived, therefore, he had interrupted her, he begged she would continue her Discourse, which, if he prevented by his Presence, he desired to depart; but Heartfree would not suffer it.  He said, she had been relating some Adventures, which perhaps might entertain him to hear, and which he the rather desired he would, as they might serve to illustrate the Foundation on which this Falshood had been built, which had brought on him all his Misfortunes. The Justice very gladly consented, and Mrs. Heartfree, at her Husband's Desire, began the Relation from the first Renewal of Wild's Acquaintance with her Husband; but, tho' this Recapitulation was necessary for the Information of our good Magistrate, as it would be useless, and perhaps tedious, to the Reader, we shall only repeat that Part of her Story to which he is a Stranger, beginning with what happened to her, after Wild had been turned adrift in the Boat, by the Captain of the French Privateer. Mrs. Heartfree begins to relate her Adventures. exacted on that Villain, (our Hero) persuaded me, that I was fallen into the Hands of a Man of Honour and Justice; nor, indeed, was it possible for any Person to be treated with more Respect and Civility than I now was; but, if this could not mitigate my Sorrows, when I reflected on the Condition in which I had been betrayed to leave all that was dear to me, much less could it produce such an Effect, when I discovered, as I soon did, that I owed it chiefly to a Passion, which threatned me with great Uneasiness, as it quickly appeared to be very violent, and as I was absolutely in the Power of the Person who possessed it, or was rather possessed by it.  I must however do him the Justice to say, my Fears carried my Suspicions farther than I afterwards found I had any Reason for:  He did indeed, very soon acquaint me with his Passion, and used all the gentle Methods, which frequently succeed with our Sex, to prevail with me to gratify it; but never once threatned, nor had the least Recourse to Force. He did not even once insinuate to me, that I was totally in his Power, which I myself saw, and whence I drew the most dreadful Apprehensions, well knowing, that as there are some Dispositions so brutal, that Cruelty adds a Zest and Savour to their Pleasures; so there are others whose gentler Inclinations are better gratified, when they win us by softer Methods to comply with their Desires; yet even these may be often compelled by an unruly Passion to have recourse at last to the Means of Violence, when they despair of Success from Persuasion; but I was happily the Captive of a better Man. My Conqueror was one of those over whom Passion hath a limited Jurisdiction, and tho' he was easy enough to Sin, he was proof against any Temptation to Villany. " We had been two Days almost totally becalmed, when a brisk Gale rising, as we were in Sight of Dunkirk, we saw a Vessel making full Sail towards us. The Captain of the Privateer was so strong, that he apprehended no Danger but from a Man of War, which the Sailors discerned this not to be. He therefore struck his Colours, and furled his Sails as much as possible, in order to lie by and expect her, hoping she might be a Prize." (Here Heartfree smiling, his Wife stopp'd and enquired the Cause. He told her, it was from her using the Sea Terms so aptly: She laughed, and answered, he would wonder less at this, when he heard the long Time she had been on board: And then proceeded) "This Vessel now came along-side of us, and hailed us, having perceived that, on which we were aboard, to be of her own Country: They begged us not to put into Dunkirk, but to accompany them in their Pursuit of a large English Merchant-Man, whom we should easily overtake, and both together as easily conquer.  Our Captain immediately consented to this Proposition and ordered all the Sail to be crowded.  This was most unwelcome News to me; however, he comforted me all he could, by assuring me, I had nothing to fear, that he would be so far from offering the least Rudeness to me, that he would at the Hazard of his Life protect me from it. This Assurance gave me all the Consolation, which my present Circumstances and the dreadful Apprehensions I had on your dear Account would admit." (At which Words the tenderest Glances passed on both Sides between the Husband and Wife.) " We sailed near twelve Hours, when we came in Sight of the Ship we were in pursuit of, and which we should probably have soon come up with, had not a very thick Mist ravished her from our Eyes.  This Mist continued several Hours, and when it cleared up we discovered our Companion at a great Distance from us; but what gave us (I mean the Captain and his Crew) the greatest Uneasiness, was the Sight of a very large Ship within a Mile of us, which presently saluted us with a Gun, and now appeared to be a third Rate English Man of War.  Our Captain declared the Impossibility of either fighting or escaping, and accordingly struck, without waiting for the Broadside which was preparing for us, and which perhaps would have prevented me from the Happiness I now enjoy." This occasioned Heartfree to change Colour, his Wife therefore past hastily to Circumstances of a more smiling Complexion. "I greatly rejoiced at this Event, as I thought it would not only restore me to the safe Possession of my Jewels, but to what I value beyond all the Treasure in the Universe. My Expectation, however, of both these was somewhat crost for the present: As to the former, I was told, they should be carefully preserved; but that I must prove my Right to them, before I could expect their Restoration; which, if I mistake not, the Captain did not very eagerly desire I should be able to accomplish:  And as to the latter, I was acquainted, that I should be put aboard the first Ship, which they met on her Way to England ; but that they were proceeding to the West-Indies . "I had not been long aboard the Man of War, before I discovered just Reason rather to lament than rejoice at the Exchange of my Captivity; (for such I concluded my present Situation to be.) I had now another Lover in the Captain of this Englishman, and much rougher and less gallant than the Frenchman had been. He used me with scarce common Civility, as indeed he shewed very little to any other Person, treating his Officers little better than a Man of no great Good-Breeding would exert to his meanest Servant, and that too on some very irritating Provocation. As for me, he addressed me with the Insolence of a Basha to a Circassian Slave; he talked to me with the loose Licence in which the most profligate Libertines converse with Harlots, and which Women abandoned only in a moderate Degree detest and abhor.  He often kissed me with very rude Familiarity, and one Day attempted further Brutality, when a Gentleman on board, and who was in my Situation, that is, had been taken by a Privateer and was retaken, rescued me from his Hands; for which the Captain confined him, tho' he was not under his Command, two Days in Irons; when he was released, (for I was not suffered to visit him in his Confinement,) I went to him and thanked him with the utmost Acknowledgment, for what he had done and suffered on my Account.  The Gentleman behaved to me in the handsomest Manner on this Occasion; told me, he was ashamed of the high Sense I seemed to entertain of so small an Obligation, of an Action to which his Duty as a Christian, and his Honour as a Man, obliged him. From this Time I lived in great Familiarity with this Man, whom I regarded as my Protector, which he professed himself ready to be on all Occasions, expressing the utmost Abhorrence of the Captain's Brutality, especially that shewn towards me, and the Tenderness of a Parent for the Preservation of my Virtue, for which I was not myself more solicitous than he appeared. He was, indeed, the only Man I had hitherto met, since my unhappy Departure, who did not endeavour by all his Looks, Words, and Actions, to assure me, he had a Liking to my unfortunate Person.  The rest seeming desirous of sacrificing the little Beauty they complimented, to their Desires, without the least Consideration of the Ruin, which I earnestly represented to them, they were attempting to bring on me and my future Repose. "I now past several Days pretty free from the Captain's Molestation, till one fatal Night:" Here perceiving Heartfree grew pale, she comforted him by an Assurance, that God had preserved her Chastity, and again had restored her unsullied to his Arms; she continued thus: "Perhaps, I give it a wrong Epithet in the Word fatal ; but a wretched Night, I am sure I may call it, for no Woman, who came off victorious, was, I believe, ever in greater Danger.  One Night, I say, having drank his Spirits high with Punch, in Company with the Purser, who was the only Man in the Ship he admitted to his Table, he sent for me into his Cabin; whither, tho' unwilling, I was obliged to go.  We were no sooner alone together, than he seized me by the Hand, and, after affronting my Ears with Discourse which I am unable to repeat, he swore a great Oath, that his Passion was to be dallied with no longer, that I must not expect to treat him in the Manner, to which a Set of Blockhead Land-Men submitted. None of your Coquet Airs, therefore, with me, Madam, said he, for I am resolved to have you this Night. No struggling nor squawling, for both will be impertinent. The first Man who offers to come in here, I will have his Skin flea'd off at the Gangway. He then attempted to pull me violently towards his Bed. I threw myself on my Knees, and with Tears and Entreaties besought his Compassion; but this was, I found, to no Purpose: I then had Recourse to Threats, and endeavoured to frighten him with the Consequence; but neither had this, tho' it seemed to stagger him more than the other Method, sufficient Force to deliver me. At last, a Stratagem came into my Head, of which my perceiving him reel, gave me the first Hint, I entreated a Moment's Reprieve only, when collecting all the Spirits I could muster, I put on a constrained Air of Gayety, and told him with an affected Laugh, he was the roughest Lover I had ever met with, and that I believed I was the first Woman he had ever paid his Addresses to.  Addresses, said he, d---n your Dresses, I want to undress you. I then begged him to let us drink some Punch together; for that I loved a Can as well as himself, and never would grant the Favour to any Man till I had drank a hearty Glass with him. O, said he, if that be all, you shall have Punch enough to drown yourself in. At which Words he rung the Bell, and ordered in a Gallon of that Liquor. I was in the mean time obliged to suffer his nauseous Kisses, and some Rudenesses which I had great Difficulty to restrain within moderate Bounds. When the Punch came in, he took up the Bowl and drank my Health ostentatiously, in such a Quantity, that it considerably advanced my Scheme.  I followed him with Bumpers, as fast as possible, and was myself obliged to drink so much, that at another time it would have staggered my own Reason, but at present it did not affect me.  At length, perceiving him very far gone, I watched an Opportunity, and ran out of the Cabin, resolving to seek Protection of the Sea, if I could find no other: But Heaven was now graciously pleased to relieve me; for in his Attempt to pursue me, he reeled backwards, and falling down the Cabin Stairs, he dislocated his Shoulder, and so bruised himself, that I was not only preserved that Night from any Danger of my intended Ravisher; but the Accident threw him into a Fever, which endangered his Life, and whether he ever recovered or no, I am not certain; for during his delirious Fits, the eldest Lieutenant commanded the Ship. This was a virtuous and a brave Fellow, who had been twenty five Years in that Post without being able to obtain a Ship, and had seen several Boys, the Bastards of Noblemen, put over his Head.  One Day, while the Ship remained under his Command, an English Vessel bound to Cork, passed by; myself and my Friend, who had lain two Days in Irons on my Account, went on board this Ship, with the leave of the good Lieutenant, who made us such Presents as he was able of Provisions, and congratulating me on my Delivery from a Danger to which none of the Ship's Crew had been Strangers, he kindly wished us both a safe Voyage." In which Mrs. Heartfree continues the Relation of her Adventures. " The first Evening after we were aboard this Vessel, which was a Brigantine, we being then at a little Distance from the Madeiras, the most violent Storm arose from the North-West, in which we presently lost both our Masts; and indeed Death now presented itself as inevitable to us---I need not tell my Tommy what were then my Thoughts.  Our Danger was so great, that the Captain of the Ship, a professed Atheist, betook himself to Prayers, and the whole Crew, abandoning themselves for lost, fell with the utmost Eagerness to the emptying a Cask of Brandy, not one Drop of which, they swore, should be polluted with Salt Water.  I observed here, my old Friend displayed less Courage than I expected from him. He seemed entirely swallowed up in Despair. But Heaven, be praised, we were all at last preserved! The Storm, after about eleven Hours Continuance began to abate, and by Degrees entirely ceased; but left us still rolling at the Mercy of the Waves, which carried us at their own Pleasure to the South-East, a vast Number of Leagues. Our Crew were all dead drunk with the Brandy which they had taken such Care to preserve from the Sea; but, indeed, had they been awake, their Labour would have been of very little Service, as we had lost all our Rigging; our Brigantine being reduced to a naked Hulk only. In this Condition we floated above thirty Hours, till in the midst of a very dark Night we spied a Light, which seeming to approach us, grew so large, that our Sailors concluded it to be the Lanthorn of a Man of War; but when we were cheering ourselves with the Hopes of our Deliverance from this wretched Situation, on a sudden, to our great Concern, the Light entirely disappeared and left us in a Despair, encreased by those pleasing Imaginations with which we had entertained our Minds during its Appearance.  The rest of the Night we passed in melancholy Conjectures on the Light which had deserted us, which the major Part of the Sailors concluded to be a Meteor. In this Distress we had one Comfort, which was a plentiful Store of Provision: This so supported the Spirits of the Sailors, that they declared, had they but a sufficient Quantity of Brandy, they cared not whether they saw Land for a Month to come; but indeed, we were much nearer it than we imagined, as we perceived at Break of Day:  One of the most knowing of the Crew, declared we were near the Continent of Africa ; but when we were within three Leagues of it, a second violent Storm arose from the North, so that we again gave over all Hopes of Safety.  This Storm was not quite so outragious as the former, but of much longer Continuance, for it lasted near three Days; and drove us an immense Number of Leagues to the South. We were within a League of the Shore, expecting every Moment our Ship to be dashed in Pieces, when the Tempest ceased all of a sudden; but the Waves still continued to roll like Mountains, and before the Sea recovered its calm Motion, our Ship was thrown so near the Land, that the Captain ordered out his Boat, declaring he had scarce any Hopes of saving her; and, indeed, we had not quitted her many Minutes, before we saw the Justice of his Apprehensions; for she struck against a Rock, and immediately sunk. The Behaviour of the Sailors on this Occasion very much affected me, they beheld their Ship perish with the Tenderness of a Lover or a Parent, they spoke of her as the fondest Husband would of his Wife; and many of them, who seemed to have no Tears in their Composition, shed them plentifully at her sinking. The Captain himself cried out, Go thy Ways, charming Molly, the Sea never devoured a lovelier Morsel .  If I have fifty Vessels, I shall never love another like thee. Poor Slut! I shall remember thee to my dying Day. \---Well, the Boat now conveyed us all safe to Shore, where we landed with very little Difficulty. It was now about Noon, and the Rays of the Sun, which descended almost perpendicular on our Heads, were extremely hot and troublesome. However, we travelled through this extreme Heat about five Miles over a Plain. This brought us to a vast Wood, which extended itself as far as we could see both to the right and left, and seemed to me to put an entire End to our Progress. Here we decreed to rest and dine on the Provision which we had brought from the Ship, of which we had sufficient for very few Meals; our Boat being so over loaded with People, that we had very little Room for Luggage of any Kind. Our Repast was salt Pork broiled, which the Keenness of Hunger made so delicious to my Companions, that they fed very heartily upon it.  As for myself, the Fatigue of my Body and the Vexation of my Mind had so thoroughly weakned me, that I was almost entirely deprived of Appetite; and the utmost Dexterity of the most accomplished French Cook would have been ineffectual, had he endeavoured to tempt me with Delicacies. I thought myself very little a Gainer by my late Escape from the Tempest, by which I seemed only to have exchanged the Element in which I was presently to die. When our Company had sufficiently, and indeed very plentifully, feasted themselves, they resolved to enter the Wood and endeavour to pass it, in Expectation of finding some Inhabitants, at least Provision; for the Plain which lay between the Wood and the Sea was extremely barren, nor did it afford any other Beast or Fowl than Sea Gulls.  We proceeded therefore in the following Order; one Man in the Front with a Hatchet to clear our Way, and two others followed him with Guns to protect the rest from wild Beasts; then walked the rest of our Company, and last of all the Captain himself, being armed likewise, with a Gun to defend us from any Attack behind, in the Rear, I think, you call it.  And thus our whole Company, being fourteen in Number, travelled on 'till Night overtook us, without seeing any thing, unless a few Birds, and some very insignificant Animals. We rested all Night under the Covert of some Trees, and indeed we very little wanted Shelter at that Season, the Heat in the Day being the only Inclemency we had to combat with in this Climate. I cannot help telling you, my old Friend lay still nearest to me on the Ground, and declared he would be my Protector, should any of the Sailors offer Rudeness; but I can acquit them of any such Attempt; nor was I ever affronted by any one, more than with a coarse Expression, proceeding rather from the Roughness and Ignorance of their Education, than from any abandoned Principle, or want of Humanity." A very wonderful Chapter indeed; which, to those who have not read many Voyages, may seem incredible; and which the Reader may believe or not, as he pleases. " We had now proceeded a very little Way on our next Day's March, when one of the Sailors cried out, he spied a Tower on our Left ; a second, looking that Way, said he saw it move ; and indeed so it did towards us. We presently discovered it was an Animal of an enormous Bigness, being of the Elephantine Kind, but so large, that the Elephant is to it in Size but as the Crayfish to the Lobster. The Approach of this vast Animal struck us all with Terror.  As for myself, I felt more than I had done during our two Tempests; for I dreaded less being swallowed by the unmerciful Ocean, than being devoured by the Jaws of this Monster, which, with a Voice suitable to his Bulk, now filled all the Wood with his bellowing.  It was impossible to escape him by Flight, nor had our Men much time to consider what Means they might use for their Defence. Our two Musqueteers in an instant, therefore, resolved to discharge their several Pieces at his Eyes, the one agreeing to aim at the right, the other at the left. They executed this bold Resolution with such notable Success, that the Beast was immediately deprived of his Sight, the Bullets having both luckily entred in at the Sight of the Eyes; a very fortunate Accident for us, the whole Dimensions of each Eye being very near equal to the Capaciousness of a large Hall. The Beast, which now roared infinitely louder than before, with the Anguish of the Wound fell to the Ground. My Friend persuaded the rest to depart as fast as we could, lest some others, of the same kind, should come to his Assistance, which might prove fatal to us: But the Curiosity of the Sailors was insatiable; they swore they would go up to the Monster, and examine him; for they apprehended he was mortally wounded by the Blow: Whereas in Reality Windsor Castle, which our Beast was neither in Size nor Figure much unlike, would have been in as much Danger of being battered down by a Musquet Shot, as this Monster was of being killed by it. But I almost shudder with the Remembrance of what I am now going to relate; for indeed I take it to be the strangest Instance of that Intrepidity, so justly remarked in our Seamen, which can be found on Record. In a Word then, one of our Musqueteers coming up to the Beast as he lay wallowing on the Ground, and perceiving his Mouth wide open, marched directly down his Throat. Had he not declared his Intention to those near him, we should have concluded, that he had been swallowed by the Monster; but as it was, we imagined him little better than Felo de se, and gave over all Thoughts of ever seeing him again, when suddenly we heard the hollow Report of a Gun, seemingly at a great Distance.  One of the Sailors declared the Sound came from the Inside of the Animal, nor had he sooner said so, than a River of Blood began to issue out at his Mouth, and shortly after the brave Sailor came forth at another Passage, which I must be excused from naming.  He informed us, that he had put the Muzzle of his Gun against his Heart, and shot two Bullets into it, which he perceived had done his Business, and indeed the Monster was absolutely dead. "As soon as the Blood ceased to flow from his Mouth, our whole Company marched rank and file through the Body; but I could by no means be prevailed on to follow them, whether I looked on it as an Indecency, (the Monster being of the Male kind) or was afraid of making my Clothes bloody, or from what other Motive my Aversion arose, is not necessary to determine. Two of our Men, with much Labour, brought forth the Heart. A small Piece of which we broiled; but the Flesh was unsavoury, being much coarser than the worst Neck Beef. I must not take Leave of the Monster before I observe, that a whole Lion was found in him undigested, and which we concluded he had swallowed a very little Time before we came up with him. " We now quitted the Monster, and saw, as we advanced through the Wood, several wild Beasts, such as Lions, Wolves, Tygers, and others of the common Kind; but I must not omit a large Reptile, we saw, on our third Day's March, of the Colour and Form of a Snake; but so immensely long, that he extended near a Quarter of a Mile; a Length to which his Largeness was disproportionate, being no more than about six times the Size of a moderate Ox. This Serpent would certainly have molested us; but though he stirred as we walked by his middle, he was fortunately asleep as we past by his Eyes. This Day we killed a Bird somewhat resembling a Lark, but infinitely larger; for we guest it could not weigh less than thirty Stone.  We drest half the Merry- thought for our Dinner, and its Flavour was so excellent, that I myself for the first time eat heartily. " The next Morning we saw a Fire at a little Distance from us, when we conceived ourselves drawing near some human Habitation; but, on our nearer Approach, we perceived a very beautiful Bird just expiring in the Flames. This was no other than the celebrated Phoenix, so much spoke of, and so little known. We would not suffer such a Rarity to be consumed; we therefore snatched it from the Fire, and, being resolved to taste this elegant Dish, we first picked his Feathers off, and then roasted him; but found the Flesh so far from delicious, that it was greatly distasteful. The Captain then ordered it to be thrown again into the Fire, that it might follow its own Method of propagating its Species. " Our Pork was now gone, and we had nothing left but the Remainder of the Lark to live on, which indeed would have been sufficient for a Month's Provision, could we have preserved it from tainting; but as we had no Salt, the extreme Heat of the Climate soon made it nauseous both to our Smell and Taste.  Death now put on a more dreadful Shape than any he had hitherto worn, and starving appeared to us inevitable; for our Ammunition was all spent, and we could flatter ourselves with no Likelihood of finding the Traces of any human Creature, from whom too, if found, we apprehended much greater Probability of Danger, than of Comfort or Assistance. " We had now travelled two Days together without any Sustenance, when, coming forth from the Wood, we saw just before us something resembling the famous Stone-henge in Wiltshire, and which we found to be a Bed of Pumpkins; but so large that one of them was more than we could have eaten in two Months.  We scooped out the Inside with some Tools we had with us, and then crept all of us into the Shell, which afforded us a cool Retreat from the scorching Beams of the Sun.  The Food was neither grateful nor nourishing; so that we soon quitted this Place, and arrived at the bottom of a high and steep Hill. I was become so faint with the immoderate Fatigue of my Journey, with the intense Heat of the Climate, and with Hunger, that I threw myself on the Ground, and declared I could go no farther. One of the Sailors skipt nimbly up the Hill, and, with the Assistance of a speaking Trumpet, informed us, that he saw a Town a very little Way off. This News so comforted me, and gave me such Strength, as well as Spirits, that, with the Help of my old Friend, and another who suffered me to lean on them, I, with much Difficulty, attained the Summit; but was so absolutely overcome in climbing it, that I had no longer sufficient Strength to support my tottering Limbs, and was obliged to lay myself again on the Ground; nor could they prevail on me to undertake descending through a very thick Wood into a Plain, at the End of which indeed appeared some Houses; but at a much greater Distance than the Sailor had assured us.  The little Way, as he had called it, seeming to me full twenty Miles, nor was it, I believe, much less." Containing Incidents very surprizing. " The Captain declared, he would, without Delay, proceed to the Town before him; in which Resolution he was seconded by all the Crew; but when I could not be persuaded, nor was I able to travel any farther before I had rested myself, my old Friend protested, he would not leave me, but would stay behind as my Guard; and, when I had refreshed myself with a little Repose, he would attend me to the Town, whence the Captain promised, he would not depart, before he had seen us. " They were no sooner departed than (having first thanked my Protector for his Care of me) I resigned myself to sleep, which immediately closed my Eyelids, and would probably have detain'd me very long in his gentle Dominion, had I not been awaked with a Squeeze by the Hand by my Guard; which I at first thought intended to alarm me with the Danger of some wild Beast; but I soon perceived it arose from a softer Motive, and that a gentle Swain was the only wild Beast I had to apprehend. " He began now to disclose his Passion in the strongest Manner imaginable, indeed with a Warmth rather beyond that of both my former Lovers; but as yet without any Attempt of Force. On my Side Remonstrances were made in more bitter Exclamations and Revilings than I had used to any, that Villain Wild excepted.  I told him, he was the basest and most treacherous Wretch alive; that his having cloaked his iniquitous Designs under the Appearance of Virtue and Friendship, added an ineffable Degree of Horrour to them; that I detested him of all Mankind the most, and, could I be brought to yield to Prostitution, he should never enjoy the Ruins of my Honour.  He suffered himself not to be provoked by this Language, but only changed his Method of Solicitation from Flattery to Bribery. He unript the Lining of his Wastcoat, and pulled forth several Jewels; these, he said, he had preserved from infinite Danger to the happiest purpose, if I could be won by them. I rejected them often with the utmost Indignation, till at last, casting my Eye, rather by Accident than Design, on a Diamond Necklace, a Thought, like Lightning, shot through my Mind, and, in an instant, I remembered, that this was the very Necklace you had sold the cursed Count, the Cause of all our Misfortunes. The Confusion of Ideas, into which this Surprize hurried me, prevented my reflecting on the Villain who then stood before me: But the first Recollection presently told me, it could be no other than the Count himself, the wicked Tool of Wild's Barbarity. Good God, what was then my Condition!  How shall I describe the Tumult of Passions which then laboured in my Breast!  However, as I was happily unknown to him, the least Suspicion on his Side was altogether impossible. He imputed, therefore, the Eagerness with which I gazed on the Jewels, to a very wrong Cause, and endeavoured to put as much additional Softness into his Countenance as he was able. My Fears were a little quieted, and I was resolved to be very liberal of Promises, and hoped so thoroughly to persuade him of my Venality, that he might, without any Doubt, be drawn in to wait the Captain and Crew's Return, who would, I was very certain, not only preserve me from his Violence, but secure the Restoration of what you had been so cruelly robbed of. But, alas! I was mistaken." Mrs. Heartfree again perceiving Symptoms of the utmost Disquietude in her Husband's Countenance, cry'd out: "My Dear, Don't you apprehend any Harm. \---But, to deliver you as soon as possible from your Anxiety.  \---When he perceived I declined the Warmth of his Addresses he begged me to consider; he changed at once the Tone of his Features, and, in a very different Voice from what he had hitherto affected, he swore, I should not deceive him as I had the Captain; that Fortune had kindly thrown an Opportunity in his Way, which, he was resolved not foolishly to lose; and concluded with a violent Oath, that he was determined to enjoy me that Moment; and, therefore, I knew the Consequence of Resistance.  He then caught me in his Arms, and began such rude Attempts, that I skreamed out with all the Force I could, tho' I had so little Hopes of being rescued, when there suddenly rushed forth from a Thicket, a Creature, which, at his first Appearance, and in the hurry of Spirits I then was, I did not take for a Man; but indeed had he been the fiercest of wild Beasts, I should have rejoiced at his devouring us both. I scarce perceived he had a Musquet in his Hand, before he struck my Ravisher such a Blow with it, that he felled him at my Feet.  He then advanced with a gentle Air towards me, and told me in French, he was extremely glad he had been luckily present to my Assistance.  He was naked, except his middle and his Feet, if I can call a Body so which was covered with Hair almost equal to any Beast whatever. Indeed his Appearance was so horrid in my Eyes, that the Friendship he had shewn me, as well as his courteous Behaviour, could not entirely remove the Dread I had conceived from his Figure. I believe he saw this very visibly; for he begged me not to be frightened, since, whatever Accident had brought me thither, I should have Reason to thank God for meeting him, at whose Hands I might assure my self of the utmost Civility and Protection. In the midst of all this Consternation, I had Spirits enough to take up the Casket of Jewels, which the Villain, in falling, had dropt out of his Hands, and conveyed it into my Pocket, before he recovered himself, which he now began to do. My Deliverer told me, I seemed extremely weak and faint, and desired me to refresh myself at his little Hut, which, he said, was hard by.  If his Demeanour had been less kind and obliging, my desperate Situation must have lent me Confidence; for sure the Alternative could not be doubtful, whether I should rather trust this Man, who, notwithstanding his savage Outside, expressed so much Devotion to serve me, which at least I was not certain of the Falshood of, or abide with one whom I so perfectly well knew to be an accomplished Villain.  I, therefore, committed my self to his Guidance, though with Tears in my Eyes, and begged him to have Compassion on my Innocence, which was absolutely in his Power. He said, the Treatment he had been Witness of, which, he supposed, was from one, who had broken his Trust towards me, sufficiently justified my Suspicion; but begged me to dry my Eyes, and he would soon convince me, that I was with a Man of different Sentiments. The kind Accents which accompanied these Words, gave me some Comfort, which was assisted by the Re-possession of our Jewels by an Accident, so strongly savouring of the Disposition of Providence in my Favour. " We walked together to his Hut, or rather Cave; for it was under Ground, on the Side of a Hill; the Situation was very pleasant, and, from its Mouth, we overlooked a large Plain, and the Town I had before seen. As soon as I entered it, he desired me to sit down on a Bench of Turf, which served him for Chairs, and then laid before me some Fruits, the wild Product of that Country, one or two of which had an excellent Flavour. He likewise produced some baked Flesh, a little resembling that of Venison. He then brought forth a Bottle of Brandy, which, he said, had remained with him ever since his settling there, now above thirty Years; during all which Time he had never opened it, his only Liquor being Water; that he had reserved this Bottle as a Cordial in Sickness; but, he thanked God, he had never yet had Occasion for it.  He then acquainted me, that he was a Hermite ; that he had been formerly cast away on that Coast, with his Wife, whom he dearly loved, but could not preserve from perishing; on which Account he had resolved never to return to France, which was his native Country, but to devote himself to Prayer, and a holy Life, placing all his Hopes in the blest Expectation of meeting that dear Woman again in Heaven, where, he was convinced, she was now a Saint, and an Interceder for him.  He said, he had exchanged a Watch with the King of that Country, whom he described to be a very just and good Man, for a Gun, some Powder, Shot, and Ball; with which he sometimes provided himself Food, but more generally used it in defending himself against wild Beasts; so that his Diet was chiefly of the vegetable kind. He told me many more Circumstances, which I may relate to you hereafter:  But, to be as concise as possible at present, he at length greatly comforted me, by promising to conduct me to a Sea-port, where I might have an Opportunity to meet with some Vessels trafficking for Slaves; and whence I might once more commit myself to that Element, which, though I had already suffered so much on it, I must again trust, to put me in Possession of all I loved. " The Character he gave me of the Inhabitants of the Town we saw below us, and of their King, made me desirous of being conducted thither; especially as I very much wished to see the Captain and Sailors, who had behaved very kindly to me, and with whom, notwithstanding all the civil Behaviour of the Hermit, I was rather easier in my Mind, than alone with this single Man; but he dissuaded me greatly from attempting such a Walk, till I had recreated my Spirits with Rest, desiring me to repose myself on his Couch of Turf, saying, that he himself would retire without the Cave, where he would remain as my Guard. I accepted this kind Proposal; but it was long before I could procure any Slumber: However, at length, Weariness prevailed over my Tears, and I enjoyed several Hours Sleep. When I awaked, I found my faithful Centinel on his Post, and ready at my Summons.  This Behaviour infused some Confidence into me, and I now repeated my Request, that he would go with me to the Town below; but he answered, it would be better advised to take some Repast before I undertook the Journey, which I should find much longer than it appear'd.  I consented, and he set forth a greater Variety of Fruits than before, of which I eat very plentifully: My Collation being ended, I renewed the Mention of my Walk; but he still persisted in dissuading me, telling me, that I was not yet strong enough; that I could repose myself no where with greater Safety, than in his Cave; and that, for his Part, he could have no greater Happiness than that of attending me, adding with a Sigh, it was a Happiness he should envy any other, more than all the Gifts of Fortune. You may imagine, I began now to entertain Suspicions; but he presently removed all Doubt, by throwing himself at my Feet, expressing the warmest Passion for me. I should have now sunk with Despair, had he not accompanied these Professions with the most vehement Protestations, that he would never offer me any other Love but that of Entreaty, and that he would rather die the most cruel Death by my Coldness, than gain the highest Bliss by becoming the Occasion of a Tear of Sorrow to these bright Eyes, which, he said, were Stars, under whose benign Influence alone, he could enjoy, or indeed, suffer Life."  She was repeating many more Compliments he made her, when a horrid Uproar, which alarmed the whole Gate, put a Stop to her Narration at present. It is impossible for me to give the Reader a better Idea of the Noise which now arose, than by desiring him to imagine I had the hundred Tongues the Poet once wished for, and was vociferating from them all at once, by hollowing, scolding, crying, swearing, bellowing, and in short, by every different Articulation which is within the Scope of the human Organ. A horrible Uproar in the Gate. will think the Occasion more than adequate to it, when he is informed, that our Hero, (I blush to name it) had discovered an Injury done to his Honour, and that in the tenderest Point---In a Word, Reader, (for thou must know it, tho' it give thee the greatest Horror imaginable) he had caught Fireblood in the Arms of his lovely L aetitia . As the generous Bull, who having long depastured among a Number of Cows, and thence contracted an Opinion, that these Cows are all his own Property, if he beholds another Bull bestride a Cow within his Walks, he roars aloud, and threatens instant Vengeance with his Horns, till the whole Parish are alarmed with his bellowing.  Not with less Noise, nor less dreadful Menaces did the Fury of Wild burst forth, and terrify the whole Gate .  Long time did Rage render his Voice inarticulate to the Hearer; as when, at a visiting Day, fifteen or sixteen, or perhaps twice as many Females of delicate but shrill Pipes, ejaculate all at once on different Subjects, all is Sound only, the Harmony entirely melodious indeed, but conveys no Idea to our Ears; but at length, when Reason began to get the Better of his Passion, which latter being deserted by his Breath, began a little to retreat, the following Accents leapt over the Hedge of his Teeth, or rather the Ditch of his Gums, whence those Hedgestakes had by a Pattin been displaced in Battle with an Amazon of Drury . ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 12 "---Man of Honour! doth this become a Friend? Could I have expected such a Breach of all the Laws of Honour from thee, whom I had taught to walk in its Paths?  Hadst thou chosen any other Way to injure my Confidence, I could have forgiven it; but this is a Stab in the tenderest Part, a Wound never to be healed, an Injury never to be repaired:  For it is not only the Loss of an agreeable Companion, of the Affection of a Wife, dearer to my Soul than Life itself, it is not this Loss alone I lament: This Loss is accompanied with Disgrace, and with Dishonour. The Blood of the Wild's, which hath run with such uninterrupted Purity through so many Generations, this Blood is fouled, is contaminated: Hence flow my Tears, hence arises my Grief. This is the Injury never to be redressed, nor never to be with Honour forgiven. My --- in a Bandbox, answered Fireblood, here is a Noise about your Honour: If the Mischief done to your Blood, be all you complain of, I am sure you complain of nothing; for my Blood is as good as yours. You have no Conception, replied Wild, of the tenderness of Honour; you know not how nice and delicate it is in both Sexes; so delicate, that the least breath of Air which rudely blows on it, destroys it. I will prove from your own Words, says, Fireblood, I have not wronged your Honour.  Have you not often told me, that the Honour of a Man consisted in receiving no Affront from his own Sex, and that of a Woman in receiving no Kindness from ours.  Now, Sir, if I have given you no Affront, how have I injured your Honour? But doth not every thing, cried Wild, of the Wife belong to the Husband? A married Man therefore hath his Wife's Honour as well as his own, and by injuring her's you injure his. How cruelly you have hurt me in this tender Part, I need not repeat, the whole Gate knows it, and the World shall. I will apply to Doctor's Commons for my Redress against her, I will shake off as much of my Dishonour as I can by parting with her; and as for you, expect to hear of me in Westminster-Hall ; the modern Method of repairing these Breaches, and of resenting this Affront. D---n your Eyes, cries Fireblood, I fear you not, nor do I believe a Word you say. Nay, if you affront me personally, says, Wild, another Sort of Resentment is prescribed.  At which Word, advancing to Fireblood, he presented him with a Box on the Ear, which the Youth immediately returned, and now our Hero and his Friend fell to Boxing, tho' with some Difficulty, both being incumbered with the Chains which they wore between their Legs:  A few Blows past on both Sides, before the Gentlemen, who stood by, stept in and parted the Combatants; and now both Parties having whisper'd each other, that, if they out-lived the ensuing Sessions and escaped the Tree, the one should give and the other should receive Satisfaction in single Combat; they separated, and the Gate soon recovered its former Tranquillity." conclude her Story, which she did in the Words of the next Chapter. The Conclusion of Mrs. Heartfree's Adventures. " If I mistake not, I was interrupted just as I was beginning to repeat some of the Compliments made me by the Hermite . \---Just as you had finished them, I believe, Madam, said the Justice. Very well, Sir, said she, I am sure I have no Pleasure in the Repetition.  He concluded then with telling me, Though I was, in his Eyes, the most charming Woman in the World, and might tempt a Saint to abandon the Ways of Holiness, yet my Beauty inspired him with a much tenderer Affection towards me, than to purchase any Satisfaction of his own Desires with my Misery; if therefore I could be so cruel to him, to reject his honest and sincere Address, nor could submit to a solitary Life with one, who would endeavour, by all possible Means, to make me happy, I had no Force to dread; for that I was as much at my Liberty as if I was in France, or England, or any other free Country.  I repulsed him with the same Civility with which he advanced; and told him, that as he professed great Regard to Religion, I was convinced he would cease from all farther Solicitation, when I informed him, that, if I had no other Objection, my own Innocence would not admit of my hearing him on this Subject, for that I was married. \---He started a little at that Word, and was for some time silent; but at length recovering himself, he began to urge the Uncertainty of my Husband's being alive, and the Probability of the contrary; he then spoke of Marriage as of a civil Policy only; on which Head he urged many Arguments not worth repeating, and was growing so very eager and importunate, that I know not whither his Passion might have hurried him, had not three of the Sailors well armed, appeared at that Instant in Sight of the Cave.  I no sooner saw them, than, exulting with the utmost inward Joy, I told him my Companions were come for me, and that I must now take my Leave of him; assuring him, that I would always remember, with the most grateful Acknowledgment, the Favours I had received at his Hands.  He fetched a very heavy Sigh, and, squeezing me tenderly by the Hand, he saluted my Lips with a little more Eagerness than the European Salutations admit of; and told me, he should likewise remember my Arrival at his Cave to the last Day of his Life; adding, ---O that he could there spend the whole in the Company of one, whose bright Eyes had kindled---; but I know you will think, Sir, that we, Women, love to repeat the Compliments made us, I will therefore omit them. In a Word, the Sailors being now arrived, I quitted him, with some Compassion for the Reluctance with which he parted from me, and went forward with my Companions. " We had proceeded but a very few Paces before one of the Sailors said to his Comrades:  D---n me, Jack, who knows whether you Fellow hath not some good Flip in his Cave?  I innocently answered, the poor Wretch had only one Bottle of Brandy. \---Hath he so, cries the Sailor: 'Fore George we will taste it;---and, so saying, they immediately returned back, and myself with them. We found the poor Man prostrate on the Ground, expressing all the Symptoms of Misery and Lamentation. I told him in French, (for the Sailors could not speak that Language) what they wanted. \---He pointed to the Place where the Bottle was deposited, saying, they were Welcome to that, and whatever else he had; and added, he cared not if they took his Life also. The Sailors searched the whole Cave, where finding nothing more which they deemed worth their taking, they walked off with the Bottle, and, immediately emptying it, without offering me a Drop, they proceeded with me towards the Town. " In our Way I observed one whisper another, while he kept his Eye stedfastly fixed on me.  This gave me some Uneasiness; but the other answered:  No, d---n me, the Captain will never forgive us. Besides, we have enough of it among the black Women, and, in my Mind, one Colour is as good as another. This was enough to give me violent Apprehensions; but I heard no more of that kind, 'till we came to the Town, where, in about six Hours, I arrived in Safety. "As soon as I came to the Captain, he enquired what was become of my Friend, meaning the villainous Count. When he was informed by me of what had happened, he wished me heartily Joy of my Delivery, and, expressing the utmost Abhorrence of such Baseness, swore, if ever he met him, he would cut his Throat; but indeed we both concluded, that he had died of the Blow which the Hermite had given him. "I was now introduced to the Mayor, or chief Magistrate of this Country, who was desirous of seeing me. I will give you a short Description of him:  He was chosen (as is the Custom there) for his superior Bravery and Wisdom.  His Power is entirely absolute during its Continuance; but, on the first Deviation from Equity and Justice, he is liable to be deposed, and punished by the People, the Elders of whom, once a Year, assemble, to examine into his Conduct. Besides the Danger which these Examinations, which are very strict, expose him to, his Office is of such Care and Trouble, that nothing but that restless Love of Power, so predominant in the Mind of Man, could make it the Object of Desire; for he is indeed the only Slave of all the Natives of this Country. He is obliged, in Time of Peace, to hear the Complaint of every Person in his Dominions, and to render him Justice. For which purpose every one may demand an Audience of him, unless during the Hour which he is allowed for Dinner, when he sits alone at the Table, and is attended, in the most public Manner, with more than European Ceremony.  This is done to create an Awe and Respect towards him in the Eye of the Vulgar; but, lest it should elevate him too much in his own Opinion, in order to his Humiliation, he receives every Evening in private, from a kind of Beadle, a gentle Kick on his Posteriors; besides which, he wears a Ring in his Nose, somewhat resembling that we ring our Pigs with, and a Chain round his Neck, not unlike that worn by our Aldermen; both which, I suppose, emblematical, but heard not the Reasons of either assigned.  There are many more Particularities among these People, which, when I have an Opportunity, I may relate to you. The second Day after my Return from Court, one of his Officers, whom they call Schach Pimpach, waited upon me, and, by a French Interpreter who lives here, informed me, that the Mayor liked my Person, and offered me an immense Present, if I would suffer him to enjoy it, (this is, it seems, their common Form of making Love.)  I rejected the Present, and never heard any further Solicitation; for, as it is no Shame for the Women here to consent at the first Proposal, so they never receive a second. "I had resided in this Town a Week, when the Captain informed me, that a Number of Slaves, who had been taken Captives in War, were to be guarded to the Sea-side, where they were to be sold to the Merchants, who traded in them to America ; that if I would embrace this Opportunity, I might assure myself of finding a Passage to America, and thence to England ; acquainting me at the same time, that he himself intended to go with them. I readily agreed to accompany him. The Mayor, being advertised of our Designs, sent for us both to Court, and, without mentioning a Word of Love to me, having presented me with a very rich Jewel, of less Value, he said, than my Chastity, took his Leave, recommending me to the Care of God, and ordering us a large Supply of Provisions for our Journey. " We were provided with Mules for ourselves, and what we carried with us, and, in nine Days, reached the Seashore, where we found an English Vessel ready to receive both us and the Slaves.  We went aboard it, and sailed the next Day with a fair Wind for New England, where I hoped to get an immediate Passage to the Old : But Providence was kinder than my Expectation; for the third Day after we were at Sea, we met an English Man of War homeward bound; the Captain of it was a very good-natured Man, and agreed to take me on Board. I accordingly took my Leave of my old Friend the Master of the shipwrecked Vessel, who went on to New England, whence he intended to pass to Jamaica, where his Owners lived.  I was now treated with great Civility, had a little Cabbin assigned me, and dined every Day at the Captain's Table, who was indeed a very gallant Man, and, at first, made me a Tender of his Affections; but, when he found me resolutely bent to preserve myself pure and entire for the best of Husbands, he grew cooler in his Addresses, and soon behaved in a manner very pleasing to me, regarding my Sex only so far as to pay me a Deference, which is very agreeable to us all. "To conclude my Story; I met with no Adventure in this Passage at all worth relating, 'till my landing at Gravesend, whence the Captain brought me in his own Boat to the Tower. In a short Hour after my Arrival we had that Meeting, which, however dreadful at first, will, I now hope, by the good Offices of the best of Men, whom God for ever bless, end in our perfect Happiness, and be a strong Instance of what I am persuaded is the surest Truth, That Providence will, sooner or later, procure the Felicity of the virtuous and innocent." Husband the Jewels, which the Count had robbed him of, and that presented her by the African Mayor, which latter was of immense Value.  The good Magistrate was sensibly touched at her Narrative, as well on the Consideration of the Sufferings she had herself undergone, as for those of her Husband, which he had himself been innocenly the Instrument of bringing upon him.  That worthy Man, however, much rejoiced in what he had already done for his Preservation, and promised to labour, with his utmost Interest and Industry, to procure the absolute Pardon, rather of his Sentence, than of his Guilt, which, he now plainly discovered was a barbarous and false Imputation. The History returns to the Contemplation of Greatness . from the Consideration of our Hero, who daily gave the most exalted Proofs of latter now grew so GREAT, i. e. corrupted in their Morals, that they spoke with the utmost Contempt of what the Vulgar call Honesty .  The greatest Character among them was that of a Pick-pocket, or, in truer Language, a File ; and the only Censure was Want of Dexterity. As to Virtue, Goodness, and such like, they were the Objects of Mirth and Derision, and all Newgate was a complete Collection of Prigs, every Man being desirous to pick his Neighbour's Pocket, and every one was as sensible that his Neighbour was as ready to pick his; so that (which is almost incredible) as great Roguery was daily committed within the Walls of Newgate as without. Envy of his Enemies against him. The Day of his Trial now approached; for which, as Socrates did, he prepared himself; but not weakly and foolishly, like that Philosopher, with Patience and Resignation; but with a good Number of false Witnesses.  However, as Success is not always proportioned to the Wisdom of him who endeavours to attain it; so are we more sorry than ashamed to relate, that our Hero was, notwithstanding his utmost Caution and Prudence, convicted, and sentenced to a Death; which, when we consider, not only the great Men who have suffered it, but the much larger Number of those, whose highest Honour it hath been to merit it, we cannot call otherwise than honourable .  Indeed those, who have unluckily missed it, seem all their Days to have laboured in vain to attain an End, which Fortune, for Reasons only known to herself, hath thought proper to deny them. Without any farther Preface then, our Hero was sentenced to be hanged by the Neck : But whatever was to be now his Fate, he might console himself that he had perpetrated what  \---nec Judicis ira, nec ignis, Nec poterit ferrum, nec edax abolere vetustas. For my own Part, I confess, I look on this Death of Hanging to be as proper for a Hero as any other; and I solemnly declare, that, had Alexander the Great been hanged, it would not in the least have diminished my Respect to his Memory.  Provided a Hero in his Life doth but execute a sufficient Quantity of Mischief; provided he be but well and heartily cursed by the Widow, the Orphan, the Poor, and the Oppressed; (the sole Rewards, as many Authors have bitterly lamented both in Prose and Verse, of Greatness, i. e. Priggism ;) I think it avails little of what Nature his Death be, whether it be by the Ax, the Halter, or the Sword.  Such Names will be always sure of living to Posterity, and of enjoying that Fame, which they so gloriously and eagerly coveted; for, according to our GREAT Dramatic Poet:  \---Fame Not more survives from good than evil Deeds, Th' aspiring Youth that fir'd th' Ephesian Dome, Outlives in Fame the pious Fool who rais'd it. He, therefore, betook himself to that true Support of Greatness in Affliction, a Bottle ; by Means of which he was enabled to curse, and swear, and bully, and brave his Fate.  Other Comfort indeed he had not much; for not a single Friend ever came near him.  His Wife, whose Trial was deferred to the next Sessions, visited him but once, when she plagued, tormented, and upbraided him so cruelly, that he forbad the Keeper ever to admit her again. The Ordinary of Newgate had frequent Conferences with him, and greatly would it embellish our History, could we record all which that good Man delivered on these Occasions; but unhappily we could procure only the Substance of a single Conference, which Mr. Wild committed to Paper the Moment after it had past. We shall transcribe it, therefore, exactly in the same Form and Words we received it; nor can we help regarding it as one of the most curious Pieces, which eiter ancient or modern History hath recorded. A Dialogue between the Ordinary of Newgate and Mr. Jonathan Wild the Great : In which the Subjects of Death, Immortality, and other grave Matters, are very learnedly handled by the former. my Sleep. better Use of those Instructions which I have endeavoured to inculcate into you, and particularly last Sunday, and from those Words: Those who do Evil shall go into everlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels, I undertook to shew you, First, What is meant by EVERLASTING FIRE; and, Secondly, Who were THE DEVIL AND HIS ANGELS. I then proceeded to draw some Inferences from the whole  a 13 ; in which I am mightily deceived, if I did not convince you, that you yourself was one of those ANGELS; and, consequently, must expect EVERLASTING FIRE to be your Portion in the other World. asleep soon after your naming your Text: But did you preach this Doctrine then, or do you repeat it now, in order to comfort me? I do it, in order to bring you to a true Sense of your manifold Sins, and, by that Means, to induce you to Repentance.  Indeed, had I the Eloquence of Cicero, or of Tully, it would not be sufficient to describe the Pains of Hell, or the Joys of Heaven.  The utmost that we are taught is, that Ear hath not heard, nor can Heart conceive . Who then would, for the pitiful Consideration of the Riches and Pleasures of this World, forfeit such inestimable Happiness! Such Joys! Such Pleasures! Such Delights! Or who would run the Venture of such Misery, which, but to think on, shocks the human Understanding! Who, in his Senses, then would prefer the latter to the former? miserable.

I am not without Hopes of a Reprieve from the Cheat yet:  I have pretty good Interest; but if I cannot obtain it, you shall not frighten me out of my Courage, I will not die like a Pimp.

Where then will be your Tauntings and your Vauntings, your Boastings and your Braggings? You will then be ready to give more for a Drop of Water than you ever gave for a Bottle of Wine. I will drink no Wine with an Atheist. I should expect the Devil to make a third in such Company; for, since he knows you are his, he may be impatient to have his Due. I despair of it; and so I consign you over to the Devil, who is ready to receive you. Soul to Heaven; and it is your Office to shew me the Way thither. I revile only the wicked ones, if any such are, which cannot affect you, who, if Men were preferred in the Church by Merit only, would have long since been a Bishop. Indeed, it might raise any good Man's Indignation to observe one of your vast Learning and Abilities obliged to exert them in so low a Sphere, when so many of your Inferiors wallow in Wealth and Preferment. not censure too generally. I must own, I might have expected higher Promotion; but I have learnt Patience and Resignation; and I would advise you to the same Temper of Mind, which, if you can attain, I know you will find Mercy; nay, I do now promise you, you will. It is true, you are a Sinner; but your Crimes are not of the blackest Dye: You are no Murtherer, nor guilty of Sacrilege. And if you are guilty of Theft, you make some Attonement by suffering for it, which many others do not.  Happy is it indeed for those few who are detected in their Sins, and brought to exemplary Punishment for them in this World. So far, therefore, from repining at your Fate when you come to the Tree, you should exult and rejoice in it; and, to say the Truth, I question whether, to a wise Man, the Catastrophe of many a Man who dies by a Halter, is not more to be envied than pitied. Nothing is so sinful as Sin, and Murther is the greatest of all Sins; it follows, that whoever commits Murther is happy in suffering for it; if therefore a Man who commits Murther is so happy in dying for it, how much better must it be for you, who have committed a less Crime. Spirits. the Spirits given us by Wine.  If you must drink, let us have a Bowl of Punch ; a Liquor I the rather prefer, as it is no where spoken against in Scripture, and as it is more wholsome for the Gravel; a Distemper with which I am grievously afflicted. I ask your Pardon, Doctor, I should have remembered, that Punch was your favourite Liquor. I think you never taste Wine while there is any Punch remaining on the Table. I confess, I look on Punch to be the more eligible Liquor, as well for the Reasons I have before mentioned, as likewise for one other Cause, viz. it is the properest for a Draught . I own I took it a little unkind of you to mention Wine, thinking you knew my Palate. Bishop. despair: It is yet Time enough to think of dying, you have good Friends, who very probably may prevail for you. I have known many a Man reprieved, who had less Reason to expect it. then would become of my Soul? Account of it, I warrant you. I have a Sermon in my Pocket, which may be of some Use to you to hear. I do not value myself on the Talent of Preaching, since no Man ought to value himself for any Gift in this World: But perhaps there are not many such Sermons. \---But to proceed, since we have nothing else to do till the Punch comes. \---My Text is the latter Part of a Verse only. Greeks which at that Time had over-run great Part of the Heathen World, had poisoned, and as it were puffed up their Minds with Pride, so that they disregarded all Kinds of Doctrine in Comparison of their own; and however safe, and however sound the Learning of others might be, yet, if it any wise contradicted their own Laws, Customs, and received Opinions, away with it, it is not for us. It was to the Greeks Foolishness . principally confine myself to the laying open and demonstrating the great Emptiness and Vanity of this Philosophy, with which these idle and absurd Sophists were so proudly blown up and elevated: And here I shall do two Things: First, I shall expose the Matter; and secondly, The Manner of this absurd Philosophy. retort the unmannerly Word, which our Adversaries have audaciously thrown in our Faces; for what was all this mighty Matter of Philosophy, this Heap of Knowledge, which was to bring such large Harvests of Honour to those who sowed it, and so greatly and nobly enrich the Ground on which it fell; what was it, but Foolishness ? An inconsistent Heap of Nonsense, of Absurdities and Contradictions, bringing no Ornament to the Mind in its Theory, nor exhibiting any Usefulness to the Body in its Practice. What were all the Sermons and the Sayings, the Fables and the Morals of all these wise Men, but, to use the Word mentioned in my Text once more, Foolishness ? What was their great Master Plato, or their other great Light Aristotle ?  Mere Quibblers and Sophists, idly and vainly attached to certain ridiculous Notitions of their own, founded neither on Truth nor Reason.  Their whole Works are a strange Medley of the greatest Falshoods, scarce covered over with the Colour of Truth: Their Precepts are neither borrowed from Nature, nor guided by Reason: Mere Fictions, serving only to evince the dreadful Height of human Pride. It may be, perhaps, expected of me, that I should give some Instances from their Works to prove this Charge; but as, to transcribe every Passage tending to prove what I have here asserted, would be to transcribe their whole Works, and as in such a plentiful Crop, it is difficult to chuse; instead of trespassing on your Patience, I shall conclude this first Head with a small Alteration of the Words of my Text. The Philosophy of the Greeks was Foolishness . inane and simple Doctrine was propagated. And here---But here, the Punch by entring put a Stop to his Reading at this time: Nor could we obtain of Mr. Wild any further Account of the Conversation which past at this Interview. Wild proceeds to the highest Consummation of human Greatness . and noblest Act of Greatness, by which any Hero can signalize himself. This was the Day of Execution, or Consummation, or Apotheosis, (for it is called by different Names) which was to give our Hero an Opportunity of facing Death and Damnation, without any Fear in his Heart, or at least without betraying any Symptoms of it in his Countenance.  A Completion of being more worthy of Lamentation than when Fortune, like a lazy Poet, winds up her Catastrophe aukwardly, and bestowing too little Care on her fifth Act, dismisses the Hero with a sneaking and private Exit, who had in the former Part of the Drama performed such notable Exploits, as must promise to every good Judge among the Spectators, a noble, public and exalted End. was too much and too deservedly her Favourite, to be neglected by her in his last Moments: Accordingly all Efforts for a Reprieve were vain, and the Name of Wild stood at the Head of those who were ordered for Execution. Contrition, he rather infused more Confidence and Assurance into his Looks. He spent most of his Hours in drinking with his Friends, and with the good Man above commemorated. In one of these Compotations, being asked, whether he was afraid to die, he answered, D---n me, it is only a Dance without Music . Another Time, when one expressed some Sorrow for his Misfortune, as he termed it, he said, with great Fierceness, A Man can die but once .  Again, when one of his intimate Acquaintance hinted his Hopes, that he would die like a Man.  He cocked his Hat in Defiance, and cried out greatly, Zounds! who's afraid ? Conversation which passed at this Season, especially between our Hero and his learned Comforter; but we have searched many Pasteboard Records in vain. he consented. This Meeting was at first very tender on both Sides; but it could not continue so: For unluckily some Hints of former Miscarriages intervening, as particularly when she asked him, how he could have used her so barbarously once, as by calling her B---? Whether such Language became a Man, much less a Gentleman? Wild flew into a violent Passion, and swore she was the vilest of B---s, to upbraid him at such a Season with an unguarded Word spoke long ago.  She replied, with many Tears, she was well enough served for her Folly in visiting such a Brute; but she had one Comfort however, that it would be the last time he could ever treat her so; that indeed she had some Obligation to him, for that his Cruelty to her would reconcile her to the Fate he was To-morrow to suffer, and indeed, nothing but such Brutality could have made the Consideration of his shameful Death (so this weak Woman called Hanging) which was now inevitable to be born even without Madness.  She then proceeded to a Recapitulation of his Faults in an exacter Order and with more perfect Memory than one would have imagined her capable of; and, it is probable, would have rehearsed a complete Catalogue, had not our Hero's Patience failed him, so that with the utmost Fury and Violence, he caught her by the Hair and kicked her, as heartily as his Chains would suffer him, out of the Room. Consummation of our Hero's Greatness :  He had himself indeed modestly declined the public Honours she intended him, and had taken a Quantity of Laudanum, in order to retire quietly off the Stage; but we have already observed in the course of our wonderful History, that to struggle against this Lady's Decrees is vain and impotent:  And whether she hath determined you shall be hanged or be a Prime Minister, it is in either Case lost Labour to resist. Laudanum, therefore, being unable to stop the Breath of our Hero, which the Fruit of Hemp-Seed and not the Spirit of Poppy-Seed was to overcome, he was at the usual Hour attended by the proper Gentlemen appointed for that Purpose, and acquainted that the Cart was ready. On this Occasion he exerted that and knowing it was impossible to resist, he gravely declared, he would attend them ; he then descended to that Room where the Fetters of great Men are knocked off, in a most solemn and ceremonious Manner.  Then shaking Hands with his Friends (to wit, those who were conducting him to the Tree) and drinking their Healths in a Bumper of Brandy, he ascended the Cart, where he was no sooner seated, than he received the Acclamations of the Multitude, who were highly ravished with his Greatness . bearing Javelins in their Hands, through Streets lined with Crowds, all admiring the great Behaviour of our Hero, who rode on sometimes sighing, sometimes swearing, sometimes singing or whistling, as his Humour varied. of the People, who were there assembled in prodigious Numbers, to behold a Sight much more rare in popular Cities than one would reasonably imagine it should be, viz. the proper Catastrophe of a great Man . Applause on this Occasion, there were not wanting some who maligned this Completion of Glory, which was now about to be fulfilled to our Hero, and endeavoured to prevent it by knocking him on the Head as he stood under the Tree, while the Ordinary was performing his last Office.  They therefore began to batter the Cart with Stones, Brickbats, Dirt, and all Manner of mischievous Weapons, some of which erroneously playing on the Robes of the Ecclesiastic, made him so expeditious in his Repetition, that with wonderful Alacrity he had ended almost in an Instant, and conveyed himself into a Place of Safety in a Hackney Coach where he waited the Conclusion with the Temper of Mind described in these Verses  Suave Mari magno, turbantibus Æquora ventis, E Terra alterius magnum spectare Laborem. admirable Conservation of Character in our Hero to his last Moment, which was, that whilst the Ordinary was busy in his Ejaculations, Wild, in the Midst of the Shower of Stones, & c. which played upon him, applied his Hands to the Parson's Pocket, and emptied it of his Bottle-Screw, which he carried out of the World in his Hand. Opportunity to cast his Eyes around the Crowd and give them a hearty Curse, when immediately the Horses moved on, and with universal Applause our Hero swung out of this World. Life had been, and which was so truly agreeable to it, that the latter must have been deplorably maimed and imperfect without the former; a Death which hath been alone wanting to complete the Characters of several ancient and modern Heroes, whose Histories would then have been read with much greater Pleasure by the wisest in all Ages.  Indeed we could almost wish, that whenever Fortune seems wantonly to deviate from her Purpose and leave her Work imperfect in this Particular, the Historian would indulge himself in the Licence of Poetry and Romance, and even do a Violence to Truth, to oblige his Reader with a Page, which must be the most delightful in all his History, and which could never fail of producing an instructive Moral. The Character of our Hero, and the Conclusion of this History. bringing together those several Features as it were of his Mind, which lie scattered up and down in this History, to present our Readers with a perfect Picture of Greatness . Jonathan Wild had every Qualification necessary to form a great Man : As his most powerful and predominant Passion was Ambition, so Nature had with consummate Propriety, adapted all his Faculties to the attaining those glorious Ends, to which this Passion directed him.  He was extremely ingenious in inventing Designs; artful in contriving the Means to accomplish his Purposes, and resolute in executing them:  For, as the most exquisite Cunning, and most undaunted Boldness qualified him for any Undertaking, so was he not restrained by any of those Weaknesses which disappoint the Views of mean and vulgar Souls, and which are comprehended in one general Term of Honesty, which is a Corruption of Honosty, a Word derived from what the Greeks call an Ass . He was entirely free from those low Vices of Modesty and Goodnature, which, as he said, implied a total Negative of human Greatness, and were the only Qualities which absolutely rendered a Man incapable of making a considerable Figure in the World. His Lust was inferior only to his Ambition; but, as for what simple People call Love, he knew not what it was.  His Avarice was immense; but it was of the rapacious not of the tenacious Kind; his Rapaciousness was indeed so violent, that nothing ever contented him but the whole; for, however considerable the Share was, which his Coadjutors allowed him of a Booty, he was restless in inventing Means to make himself Master of the meanest Pittance reserved by them.  He said, Laws were made for the Use of Prigs only, and to secure their Property; they were never therefore more perverted, than when their Edge was turned against these; but that this generally happened through their Want of sufficient Dexterity. The Character which he most valued himself upon, and which he principally honoured in others, was that of Hypocrisy. His Opinion was, that no one could carry Priggism very far without it; for which Reason, he said, there was little much to be hoped from him, who professed great Virtues; wherefore, though he would always shun the Person whom he discovered guilty of a good Action, yet he was never deterred by a good Character, which was more commonly the Effect of Profession than of Action:  For which Reason, he himself was always very liberal of honest Professions, and had as much Virtue and Goodness in his Mouth as a Saint; never in the least scrupling to swear by his Honour, even to those who knew him the best; nay, tho, he held Good-nature and Modesty in the highest Contempt, he constantly practised the Affectation of both, and recommended it to others, whose welfare, on his own Account, he wished well to.  He laid down several Maxims, as the certain Methods of attaining Greatness, to which, in his own Pursuit of it, he constantly adhered. As 1\. Never to do more Mischief to another, than was necessary to the effecting his Purpose; for that Mischief was too precious a thing to be thrown away. 2\. To know no Distinction of Men from Affection; but to sacrifice all with equal Readiness to his Interest. 3\. Never to communicate more of an Affair than was necessary, to the Person who was to execute it. 4\. Not to trust him, who had deceived him, nor who knew he had himself been deceived by him. 5\. To forgive no Enemy; but to be cautious and often dilatory in Revenge. 6\. To shun Poverty and Distress, and to ally himself, as close as possible, to Power and Riches. 7\. To maintain a constant Gravity in his Countenance and Behaviour, and to affect Wisdom on all Occasions. 8\. To foment eternal Jealousies in his Gang, one of another. 9\. Never to reward any one equal to his Merit; but always to insinuate, that the Reward was above it. 10\. That all Men were Knaves or Fools, and much the greater Number a Composition of both. 11\. That a good Name, like Money, must be parted with, or at least greatly risqued, in order to bring the Owner any Advantage. 12\. That Virtues, like precious Stones, were easily counterfeited; that Counterfeits in both Cases adorned the Wearer equally, and that very few had Knowledge or Discernment sufficient to distinguish the counterfeit Jewel from the real. 13\. That many Men were undone by not going deep enough in Roguery, as in Gaming any Man may be a Loser who doth not play the whole Game. 14\. That Men proclaim their own Virtues, as Shopkeepers expose their Goods, in order to profit by them. 15\. That the Heart was the proper Seat of Hatred, and the Countenance of Affection and Friendship. were after his Decease found in his Study, as the twelve excellent and celebrated Rules were in that of King Charles the first; for he never promulgated them in his Life time, not having them constantly in his Mouth, as some grave Persons have the Rules of Virtue and Morality, without paying the least Regard to them in their Actions; whereas our Hero, by a constant and steady Adherence to his Rules in conforming every thing he did to them, acquired at last a settled Habit of walking by them, till at last he was in no Danger of inadvertently going out of the Way; and by these Means he arrived at that Degree of Greatness, which few have equalled; none, we may say, have exceeded:  For, tho' it must be allowed that there have been some few Heroes, who have done greater Mischiefs to Mankind, such as those who have betrayed the Liberties of their Country to others, or have undermined and over-powered it themselves, or Conquerors who have impoverished, pillaged, sacked, burnt, and destroyed the Countries and Cities of their fellow Creatures, from no other Provocation than that of Glory; i. e. as the Tragic Poet calls it,  \---A Privilege to kill, A strong Temptation to do bravely ill. yet, if we consider it in the Light wherein Actions are placed in this Line,  Laetius est, quoties magno tibi constat honestum. when we see him, without the least Assistance or Pretence, setting himself at the Head of a Gang, which he had not any Shadow of Right to govern; if we view him maintaining absolute Power, and exercising Tyranny over a lawless Crew, contrary to all Law, but that of his own Will. If we consider him setting up an open Trade publicly, in Defiance, not only of the Laws of his Country, but of the Common Sense of his Countrymen; if we see him first contriving the Robbery of others, and again the defrauding the very Robbers of that Booty, which they had ventured their Necks to acquire, and which without any Hazard they might have retained: Here sure he must appear admirable, and we may challenge not only the Truth of History, but almost the Latitude of Fiction to equal it. been commended by weak Writers, have, (as I hinted in the Beginning of this History) by the judicious Reader, been censured and despised.  Such is the Clemency of Alexander and C aesar, which Nature hath as grossly erred in giving them, as a Painter would, who should dress a Peasant in Robes of State, or give the Nose, or any other Feature of a Venus, to a Satyr . What had the Destroyers of Mankind, that glorious Pair, one of which came into the World to usurp the Dominion, and abolish the Constitution of his own Country; the other to conquer, enslave, and rule over the whole World, at least as much as was well known to him, and the Shortness of his Life would give him Leave to visit; what had, I say, such as these to do with Clemency? Who cannot see the Absurdity and Contradiction of mixing such an Ingredient with those noble and great Qualities I have before mentioned.  Now in Wild, every thing was truly GREAT, almost without Alloy, as his Imperfections (for surely some small ones he had) were only such as served to denominate him a human Creature, of which kind none ever arrived at consummate Excellence:  But surely his whole Behaviour to his Friend Heartfree is a convincing Proof, that the true Iron or Steel Greatness of his Heart was not debased by any softer Mettle. Indeed while Greatness consists in Power, Pride, Insolence, and doing Mischief to Mankind; ---to speak out,---while a GREAT Man and a GREAT Rogue are synonymous Terms, so long shall Wild stand unrivalled on the Pinacle of indeed ought to be remembered on his Tomb or his Statue, the Conformity above mentioned of his Death to his Life; and that Jonathan Wild the Great was, what so few GREAT Men are, though all in Propriety ought to be--- hanged by the Neck 'till he was dead. some Readers (for many, I doubt not, carry their Concern no farther than his Fate) to know what became of Heartfree .  We shall acquaint them, therefore, that his Sufferings were now at an End; that the good Magistrate easily prevailed for his Pardon, nor was contented 'till he had made him all the Reparation he could for his Suffering, tho' the Share he had in bringing the Calamity upon him, was not only innocent, but, from its Motive, laudable.  He procured the Restoration of the Jewels from the Man of War, at her Return to England, and, above all, omitted no Labour to restore Heartfree to his Reputation, and to persuade his Neighbours, Acquaintance, and Customers of his Innocence. When the Commission of Bankruptcy was satisfied, Heartfree had a considerable Sum remaining; for the Diamond presented to his Wife was of prodigious Value, and infinitely recompensed the Loss of those Jewels for which the Count had paid, when the GREAT Wild procured him to be robbed of the Money. He now set up again in his Trade; Compassion for his unmerited Misfortunes brought him many Customers among those who had any Regard to Humanity; and he hath, by Industry joined with Parsimony, amassed an immense Fortune.  His Wife and he are now grown old in the purest Love and Friendship; but never had another Child.  Friendly married his eldest Daughter at the Age of nineteen, and became his Partner in Trade. As to the youngest, she never would listen to the Addresses of any Lover, not even of a young Nobleman, who offered to take her with two thousand Pounds, which her Father would have willingly produced, and indeed did his utmost to persuade her to the Match: But she refused absolutely, nor would give any other Reason, than that she had dedicated her Days to his Service, and was resolved, no other Duty should interfere with that she owed the best of Fathers, nor prevent her from being the Nurse of his old Age. Grandchildren, of which he hath several, live all together in one House; and that with such Amity and Affection towards each other, that they are in the Neighbourhood called the Family of Love . the Neck, save two, viz. Miss Theodosia Snap, who was transported to America, where she was pretty well married, reformed, and made a good Wife; and the Count, who recovered of the Wound he had received from the Hermit, and made his Escape into France, where he committed a Robbery, was taken, and broke on the Wheel. well deserve, and hardly earn that Applause which is given them by the World; for, when we reflect on the Labours and Pains, the Cares, Disquietudes, and Dangers which attend their Road to Greatness, we may say with the Divine, that a Man may go to Heaven with half the Pains which it costs him to purchase Hell ; nor is the World so unanimous as they ought to be in conferring this dear-bought Reward.  For, while the Majority of Mankind, while Courts and Cities resound the Praises of the said great Men, there are still some in Cells and Cottages, who view their Greatness with a malignant Eye; and dare affirm, that these great Men, who are always the most pernicious, are generally the most wretched and truly contemptible of all the Works of the Creation.
