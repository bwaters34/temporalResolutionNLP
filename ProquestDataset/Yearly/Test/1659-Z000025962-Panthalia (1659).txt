 and assiduate converse? And in both these highly advantageous to the individual Union and Constitution of a State. As for the style, dialect and method of the Author, I shall render you an account seriously and succinctly: He has with a pleasing facility (an Argument of much ingenuity) observ'd punctually that course in this Excellent Romance , which may serve for a Directory to every equal and sinewy Author , who by his integrity, purity and candor, vindicates his sincere Labour from the least jealousie of a rigid Censure. To second this Opinion (for my Pen was never ingaged to assentation) you shall find in this National Survey , neatly interwoven with sundry delightful passages; those three Requisites highly approved in Subjects of this nature. 1\. Fruitfulness in the Relation. 2\. An apt composedness in his Digestion. 3\. And a native quickness in his Expression. So as, if Homer (that Honour of his Age) was so highly commended for his contracted sweetness, in reducing his memorable Iliad to the compass of a Nut ; what opinion may you retain of this Relators industry, who with such perspicuity, brevity, and facetious elegancy has inlarg'd his Assay to so curious and copious a discovery? The attest whereof, with a free and ingenuous appeal to your own Judgment, is here transmitted to your perusal, by Your well-wishing Friend FLORENCIO TRIBACCIO . Royal Romance would not upon its first production or presentation be admitted to the Presse. It came too neer Truths heels to be entertain'd as a welcome Guest. The Stationer, to whom it was at first addrest, though he held close to the Principles of a just Monarchy ; and in the most distracted and Anarchical times (may this redound ever to his honour) has never given acceptance nor countenance to any Copy, that might saucily detract from the High Prerogative of his Great Master , durst not make it his Land-adventure to afford it a publication, lest his attempt should incurre a publick censure. But since the Dolphin (by means of a prudent re-assembled Synod, which made their constant care for constitution and conservation of a Republick , their sole Interest ) kept aloof from the shore , which divined a calm; PANTHALIA , bearing the title of this Royal Romance , has taken upon her the spirit to shew her self to the world, without an intended ground of exception to any, an amicable complyance with all; where such is her confidence grounded on the strength of Reason, and judicious Opinion, she stands at defiance against all corky and unballanc'd judgments. And having now got the boldness to speak Loyalty, and with the resolution of Hiero and Le aena , to spit in the face of Treason: she blusheth not in coming abroad into the world, being equipag'd with the livery of Loyalty. Neither is it in her to harbour the least occasional fear of coming off with as much honour in the scale of an equal censure, as ever any Subject has hitherto done of this nature, though in these , many with much eminency, to the infinite delight and improvement of Posterity, bestowed their labour. Such variety and propriety (those native Beauties of an History) shall the Reader find in her relations. So as though Epicurus became highly tax'd for having his Table better furnished then his Dishes were seasoned; And Epimenides's prodigality, for his having too much meat, and too little sauce; And Eriphilus's curiosity, in his having too much sauce, but too little meat; Your pallat, be it never so accurate, shall find Panthalia's provision sufficient in both, deficient in neither: Viands so well seasoned, as they shall give a pleasing relish to your taste; and so well ordered, as they shall render a delightful satiety, without cloying to your fancy. Neither am I so personally obliged to Panthalia , as to flatter her; nor such a stranger to the Essence of desert, as to hold the quality of Goodness in a capacity, either of being over-priz'd or over-prais'd: To the inlargement then of her Honour, I shall leave her to her own expresses to accomplish her. Compleat Work, Intituled PANTHALIA: Or the ROYAL ROMANCE. With their best Layes His Work , whose Worth deserves Apollo's Bayes. His happy Wit Improves their Judgment who approveth it. Look, Reader , look Into the pure Elixer of this Book, And thou shal find A Mine of treasure from a matchless Mind Retriv'd and gain'd To thy advantage, where it only aim'd. This is rich Oyle , Else must we blame our unmanured Soyle ; Whose only sense, Wit, Learning, Judgment come by Influence; Where Academicks are for Bug-bears ta'ne, Till mad men may recall their Wits again: And this chang'd Clime in folly lose her claim.

All her raign she lived a single life: singularly indowed with all eminent vertues and princely Ornaments suitable to a person of her quality: affecting nothing more then to present personall state corresponding with the dignity of her place: and to imprint a gratefull emulation in those Ladies of Honour , that attended her of admiring, if not of imitating so incomparable a pattern of becoming state, presence and majesty. Main and many were her Interests with forraign Nations: whose Embassies (so generally vers'd she was in all tongues) She ever answer'd in her own person, without the help of any Interpretour. Neither was she at any time observ'd to dismisse these without satisfaction: so copiously happy she appear'd in her expresse, so expedite in her dispatch. Many profest themselves her Servants; amongst which one Monsieur Artesio ; a gentleman of eminent Family, and singularly imbellished with all corresponding qualities to ennoble his descent: but her innate affection to a single life would stoup to no lure. Though Censure, which is ever shooting her impoyson'd shafts at persons of highest place, would not stick to taxe her of too much freedom in entertaining Favorites. And of these, Clarentio ; whom she was thought to receive with far more intimacy and familiarity then any of he rest, as he well deserved: For his actions were amiable: and his disposition so sweetly tempered; as he became popular without seeking it: and generally belov'd without any obsequious officiating of it. But this continent Lady; whose actions were richly interlay'd with Princely Strains of Modesty and Majesty; holding it not sufficient to be innocent ; that she might decline all occasion of aspersion, apt to traduce the purest and refinedst tempers; she intimated her constant resolvs to her much endeered Clarentio: and putting pen to paper: caution'd him, forth of a tender relation to her Honour, in this manner:  Although Clarentio , I am confident that your thoughts are so pure, as you make it the lowest of your scorne, to entertain an unbecoming and inordinate affection: so it behoveth us to reflect on whatsoever may properly conduce to the advancement or improvement of our honour. Fame is a precious Odour: but never so fresh nor fragrant, as when it breaths in the bosom-border of eminent Personages: whose vertues appear most transparent, when they diffuse their rayes from the face of Greatnesse. We will not Clarentio , inlarge our selves too much, lest we should perplex your thoughts with a tedious Preamble, before we acquaint you with our aime. Truth is, my much endeered Clarentio , that the whole Court has taken notice of your free and frequent accesse unto us: The facility of your admittance; with our liberty and freedom of discourse. That excellent States -man had made an exact Survey and Discovery of Princes Courts, who charactred them full of Eyes and Eares : Eyes, to pry and observe: Eares, to hear and traduce. This has begot in us that circumspection: as our address must be to appear in that Robe of Innocence to the eye of the World, which we cordially profess: And as an inestimable Jewel in our secretst Cabinet above all other Ornaments, which either Art or Nature can possibly confer upon us, we carefully retain. Our Injunction then Clarentio , must be this; that you henceforth discontinue your visits, and leave us to our self. Yet that it may appear, how your zeal  & alacrity in your service to us both at home & abroad; retains a constant impression in your Princess: and that she is as prompt to exhibit as to receive Favours: accept this Ring here inclosed for an affectionate pledge and tender of your loyalty: which merits an higher guerdon: though I must ingenuously tell you, my loyal Clarentio ; that this token, though at first sight of small consequence, may redound to your advantage. I am not ignorant of your condition; how you are or may be encountred with many occurrences. Profest Enemies and private competitors to your rising greatness. These, when they see my eyes averted from you; wil work upon your distance: and mould some design or other to your precipice. But let not this amate you; when you are exposed to the extreamest of danger, so tender am I of your safety and honour: that this Ring returned to us, shall secure you, and bring you fairly off, in spite of all opposition. Private Presents are exempted from jealousies: and inioyn an acceptance, compassionating the persons distance. No more; let this confirme me thy constant and affectionate Protectress, while I am, Bellingeria.  This unexpected Letter was not with that discretion relished; nor with that moderation digested, as became his condition. For apprehending, as his distempered thoughts suggested to him, who these active Instruments might be, by whose subtile undermining, he became thus debarred of all access to his endeered Princess: as one highly transported with passion (as what will not the heat of Competition do?) he resolved to take revenge of his suspected Corrivals, or to perish in his design. And to fortifie him in his refolvs the better, he joynes Licorus and Merannes unto him; Persons of power: and such as retained no good opinion of Licinio ; being the very same whom Clarentio suspected, and mortally hated. Licorus had some grounded reasons to pursue the Quest of Clarentio's design; having received sundry affronts, and those insupportable to his Heroick spirit, from an inferiour Favorite to the Princess: so as no occasion could be more welcom then this forward attempt of discontented Clarentio . Which within few dayes after (with so impetuous a Career was the torrent of their revenge hurried) broke forth into an oen commotion. The prime Seat, where at that time the Princess kept her Court, became wholly discomposed, the Citizens variously affected, and into factions divided. Some out of their love to Clarentio , as none more generally endeered, nor popularly interessed. Others of lower Fortunes, desiring nothing more then to Fish in troubled water, itched eagerly after Innovation, the onely Object of malignant spirits: but weak and sandy is the Foundation of that Building, which rears the Arches of her Fabrick upon Popular affection. The giddy Multitude, consisting of undisciplin'd men, whose peacefull Education had initiated them more to Shop then Camp, after some light picqueers and easie repulses, left unfortunate Clarentio to all extreames; which afterwards threw him into an irreparable Precipice. For though he with his few Adherents demeaned themselvs with incomparable resolution; yet at last oppressed with number; by Licinio's interposing himself (as it highly concerned him) and disswading such as appeared Assistants to Clarentio ; from exposing themselvs and Fortunes to manifest ruine, by neglecting their loyalty; and adhering to a publick Incendiary, whose pursuit after private ends and ungratefull requital of his Princes favours, had sufficiently manifested to the World, where to his ambitious designs were levelled, and with what a Tragicall period closed. Those, who had profest themselvs his to death, deserted him; preferring the safety of their Persons, before their ingaged reputation. Such was the mutability of Plebeian assurances. All this while, Clarentio with his few Assistants, stood upon their guard; resolved to sell their blood at as dear a rate as they could. But being first advised to try the affections of those who appeared wavering: and by declaration of his loyall intendments to decline their defection and falling from him; he exprest himself in this manner, to satisfie such as stood for him; as likewise those who were fluctuant in their resolvs, or suspected him: that his actions, maugre all sinister mistakes, were wholly grounded on termes of honour. Gentlemen, how much I have been traduced in the progress of this action, by some censorious spirits misstyled an Insurrection; I am not wholly ignorant. But I have so much charity, as to pitty their Error. It is well known to all such as have been intimately conversant with me during all my service abroad: and since my recall home, in my carriage at Court, how my addresses have had no other ayme, then how they might advance your endeered priviledges; not onely to preserve but inlarge the Liberty of all free-born Subjects: and procure publick peace to your Nation. For if my ambition had entertain'd any other thoughts; time I had, and opportunity enough to have projected my ends, and[![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) required the utmost pitch and period of my desires in the pursuit of Soveraignty. But the loyall recluse of this breast never harbour'd any such thought. My endeavours were ever addressed for my Princes and Countreys honor; though lately misconstrued, or rather purposely perverted: to make my actions appear more odious: and my Person an immerited spectacle of disregard in the eye of the Court and presence of my Princess. Neither can these subtile Cubbs, my private Underminers, walk with such secrecy in the clouds, as they can priviledge their malicious designes from an apparent discovery. That politick Parasite Licinio , though Nemesis sit upon his shoulders: and with much security skrue him into the opinion of the State, shall not in the prostituted lapp of his insatiate [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Pavedone , traduce mine honour nor the incomparable value of these noble Persons who here assist me; and stand upon the same termes of Justification in relation to their actions equally as my self, without condigne revenge. These Carpet-Curtain-Knights are those profest Tetters of Martiall honour; that though our perills secure their Persons: our highest actions must undergo their censure, and by their misconstruction become branded with dishonour. I shall not much fear to appeal even to those whose affections have been aversest from me: and whose ambitious thoughts, envying Competitors, have ever soared with Eagles wings to build their Nests in the tallest Cedars: To these, (I say) I ingenuously appeal, if their strictest scrutiny or discovery of all my actions domestick or forrain, may justly render me guilty of the least deviation from the track of honour: or during my reside in the Court or my assiduate attendance upon my Princess: by preferring any unjust request or incompetible suit to the prejudice of a Subjects liberty: or any self Interest in my daily appliance and continued address to her sacred Majesty. Look upon me, I beseech you, not with so contemptible an eye; as if I were wholly in my Eclipse; or totally declining. The Divine powers, under which I stand or fall, have cloathed me with that spirit of resolution, as it can encounter with the sinistrest and crossest occurents: and smile with a serene eye upon the unprosperousest Overtures. I have oftimes look'd in the face of death for the preservation of my Countrys honour: and with a resolute zeal grappled with the apparenst Objects of danger. Then were there times, when by the prowess of my Souldery, whose spirits were armed for the highest assayes: and whose cordiall affections were so espoused to me: as from the highest to the lowest there was none in all my Army, were he private Souldier or Commander, but he would expose his life to the utmost of danger, to secure me. Then, I say, had my desires opportunity enough to work upon; and to accomplish their ends: if I had entertain'd any such ambitious thirst of aspiring to a Crown: or of abusing my Mistress confidence, (whose advancement, both in title of Honour and Soveraignty, it shall be my endeavour with much alacrity and loyall fervour constantly to promote.) No; ye noble and ever endeered Citizens, of whose affections I have hitherto amply pertakt: and whose numerous respects I shall no less readily then really study to requite: my loyally-disposed brest became never yet fired with any such irregular heat: Licinio was the sole Object of my revenge: who under pretence of a prudent and discreet management of our State; whereof he will not stick to boast, how he by his vigilant care and incessant devoire sits at the Sterne: skrues himself into the opinion of our complyingst Favorites: enriching his own Coffers with the revenues of the Crown:  & reering the foundation of his fortunes upon the Marchants ruine: by raising injurious Imposts: and making others adventures; the sole ground of his advancement. Compassionate then his condicion, whose hand has been ever ready to support you; when the worst of extreams incountred you. You cannot be ignorant with what solicitous and incessant care I have laboured not onely the continuance, but also for the inlargement of your Charter: and with what instancy I pursu'd it to the ingagement of mine honour. Look then vpon Clarentio , as he has ever in your greatest straits devotionally serv'd you. Let him enjoy by your mutuall assistance, the liberty of a Subject; and priviledge of a Peer: especially upon this score; standing in competition with a Mushrom of Honour : whose descent had its Originall and late derivall from a Deske. Now is the time of manifesting those arguments which of love you have so numerously expressed: wherein should you fail, he irreparably falls who highly valued you, and who upon the word of Honour would have sacrific'd his life for your safety. This Speech, though delivered by a gallant spirit and a Rhetoricall tongue (being no lesse Mercuriall then Martiall ) was not so well relished as he expected. So full of levity and inconstancy is vulgar favour; being not back'd nor seconded by sager nor stronger heads then a confus'd Rable, or disordered Multitude can any way afford: as may appear by the sequele. For he found his speech to be an inconsiderable breath, no sooner uttered then sleighted. For their Mechanick spirits quickly cooled and recoiled. Friendless Clarentio ; then whom none more nobly endowed, nor constantly resolved, after some small resistance of the City-Guards, which came thick upon him; finding his useless valour, and the declining strength of his affectionate assistants Lycorus and Merannes to fall off still to their great disadvantage: he was advised to give way to necessitie: and to apply to so desperate a sore, a relenting remedy. A remedy, I confess, which his brave spirit would not easily incline to: for nothing held a greater distance with his heroick thoughts then laying down his Arms by submission; albeit he could not visibly apprehend any other refuge for safety to his own person or his weak supplies. Attached he must be and Committed too of High Treason: For under that notion Licinio , his mortal Enemie stiled it: and highly aggravated it: that he might more indelebly lay an aspersion upon his untainted honour: and beget him a lasting Odium with his Princess, which was his summary Labour. Some few dayes after (for the cruell subtilty of Licinio , would admit no delay) a Council of State was convened, wherein Clarentio with his Adh aerents were brought to a Judiciall Tryal. In which tryal the Prisoners, being brought to Bar, might be displayed by their discovery of several passions or affections. For Clarentio , as one commiserating the sad condition of those Gentlemen, whom their endeered love and personal affection to him and his concerns, had drawn into this action, was observ'd to be ever praying : in relation to their security, more then his own safety. Lycorus , whose thoughts were not conscious of the least tincture of treason, as he conceived, at the time of his tryal, played . But Merannes , whither it was out of pusillanimity or too deep a resentment of his misery, I know not: but too much effeminate passion was he observ'd to discover, by such as stood near the Bar, all the time while his Evidence was in reading: for he wept ; which detracted much from a spirit supposed to be spritely and resolute. Magirides and Pernio being Delegats for this tryal: as they were Intimates to Licinio , left nothing unsaid or undone, that might any way aggravate their Crime: or exasperate the Jurors, on whose verdict their lives depended, against them. In fine, they were all found guilty: which Sentence Magirides was pleased in a Rhetorical way (an improper Scheme of Elocution upon so Tragical an occasion) to dilate on in this manner. 'My Lords, you hear the qualitie of your Crimes, whereof you are all found guiltie: yet in my opinion, they admit a main and consequent difference. Though your attempts hold relation in the identitie of their Object: They are of diverse qualifications in respect of the persons acting. The Act, as you hear, manifestly prov'd, extends to Treason: the Object or person at whom your impoisoned arrows were levell'd, was your Soveraign: a Princess, then whom none more gracious: nor to some of you more immeritoriously bounteous. Excuse me, my Lord Clarentio , if I come home to you. No doubt, if you retain the least Impression of civil gratitude, an innate qualitie to persons of Honour, but you must necessarily acknowledge what a multitude of undeserving Favours have been conferred, nay accumulated by your Princesses singular bountie upon you. And how strangely you have recompensed those royal extensions of he Highness, I appeal unto your self: was it not sufficient for you to receive from her princely hand incomparable additions and transcendencies of honour; but your ambitious aimes must aspire unto a Crown: and by your disloial and ungrateful designs, make it your sole endeavour to devest her of all regal honour? Have you not at all times had her eare readie to give attention to your Suit? her Exchequer open to inlarge your Estate? her Letters of Command to impower you both by Sea and Land? Yet all these would not confine your vast and illimited thoughts to those just and conscientious bounds of Loialtie, which National conformitie obliged you to: Neither, has it been enough for you in this president of Treason to act your own interest: but to inwreath others, whose native affection to allegeance had impressed in their innocence better principles, in the like precipice. If these merit not a penall and personall judgement above example, I know not whereto the bent of Justice aimes.' Upon his high and rigid aggravation of these in this manner, Clarentio in a composed and civile address being ready to make a reply: He was interrupted: and not permitted to speak either in his own or Assistants defence: but returned with the rest to their Commitment, with an express day assigned for their Execution, according to the sentence already pronounced. It was now high time for Clarentio , as he tendered his own or his Adh aerents safety; to bethink himself of some way or other how to divert the imminent danger whereto they were exposed: and the more inevitable, in regard of his Enemies infatigable pursuit for expediting the course of Justice: which they went on with by their Officious Beagles so speedily: as nothing could be acted with more secrecy or subtilty: fearing, as might be probably collected by all consequence, that the Clemency of his Princess by some powerful interceed, might reverse the sentence already delivered: and receive them to mercy: which might fall heavy upon them (as they had good reason to feare) if ever Clarentio came in to Command, to vindicate the indignities he had formerly suffered: and their severe Judgement which they had lately pronounced. It was no time then for Clarentio , who stood now a Condemned man, to trifle minutes: but seasonably to recollect his thoughts: by applying a Soveraigne cure to so desperate a sore: and by way of prevention either to decline or adjourne the approaching houre of their Execution. Amidst his perplexed thoughts, he happily call'd to mind, that gage and token which it pleased his Princesse to bestow upon him at his departure from her: and his hevy receed from the Court. That Ring , the pledge of her Princely affection he happily recall'd to memorie with these very words she spoke unto him at the same time by letters, for no other Communication would be admitted. 'Accept this Ring here inclosed for and affectionate pledge and tender of your loyaltie: which merits an higher guerdon: though I must ingenuously tell you, my loyall Clarentio ; that this Token, though at first sight of smal consequence; it may redound to your advantage. I am not ignorant of your Condition; how you are, or may be incountred with many occurrences; Profest Enemies and private Competitors to your rising greatnesse. (Which prov'd within short time after a true divination.) These, when they see my Eyes averted from you; will worke upon your distance: and mould some designe or other to their precipice. But let not this amate you; when you are exposed to the extreamest of danger (so tender am I of your safety and honour:) that this Ring returned to us, shall secure you: and bring you fairely off, in spite of all Opposition.' The memory and enjoyment of so precious a pledge could not chuse but be a Soveraigne receipt in a time of such peril, wherein both lifes and livelihoods lay at stake. Forthwith then, to remove all delays which might prove fatally noxious to his condition: He made choice of one Athalia , a Lady of honour: and of high esteem with his Princesse, to returne this Ring; which he inclosed in a paper containing these lines. 'Madam, these very last words which you spoke unto me upon my unhappy departure from you; I have now good cause to hold them true diviners of my present misery. Your loyall Servant Clarentio is become a condemned man: and expects daily a separation from the world: as he before received a proscription from your Court. Innocence, it seemes, is not sufficient, where enemies are malicious and prepotent. I was attached and injuriously impeached of a Crime, which I call heaven to record, I ever abhorred. My trembling soul so commiserates the integrity of my disposition: aggravated with the infelicity of my present condition: as she blusheth to leave a line conscious of it.---Shall my unwilling pen whisper it! Treason! \---with what a fevorish temper do I mutter it! O my deare Princesse, may this token of your gracious favour here inclosed, nere speake for me; if ever my loyall heart, dedicated to your service in all faithfull allegeance, harbour'd so ungratefull a thought. My life I value not; mortality will injoyne it a Period. But honour is of a more durable temper; being the preciousest Pearl, man can enjoy living: and the sweetest perfume, that can embalme him dying. My captivity does not at all afflict me: nor the malicious designs of my implacable Enemies amate me: my spirit is spheared far above their spleene; their spite verg'd far beneath my scorne. should I lose the opinion of fidelity in the piercing and quick-discerning judgment of your Majesty; I should hold the encounter of death an easie Combat to such a torture. I shall deserve to live no longer then a pure and unblemish'd fame adjudgeth me worthy of it. It is neither the Sentence of death already pronounced: nor the fury of my Competitors clearly discovered; that can perplex me. I stand or fall in the skale of your opinion. Reteine but that conceipt of me, which my actions have merited: and which to my last gaspe shall be inviolably continued: and death shall be hugg'd as a welcome Guest by Condemned Clarentio '. The Ring inclosed in these lines was given to Athalia ; with promise that his desires should be effectually seconded: nor no opportunity omitted to expedite the Princesse answer in this particular. But Athalia , either through neglect, or over-born by the adverse part, injuriously depriv'd him of the benefit of his Present. So mutable and generally unfaithfull advancers be these Court-favorites of distressed Plaintiffs suits. But we must impute this to Clarentio's unhappy fate, in making choice of such a Messenger; whose affection was either so coole in relation to his safety: or so insensible of his Captivity; as her surfets in Court, or dis-respect to his Person; begot in her an Act of Oblivion: making her wholly forgetful of his dis-consolate Condition. Many daies had not the Phoebean beauty bespangled this inferiour Orbe with his Oriental lustre; til care was taken by his hostile actuaries for preparing and erecting a Tragick Scaffold. Where He with his two Assisting Lords at a precise houre were to suffer. The Execution was intended to be done with more privacy, for those Cautions forementioned, then it could possibly be performed. For the report of Clarentio's death became so dispersed, that the whole City was filled with the fame of it. Wherewith severall persons, as they stood variously affected, became strangly surprized. Many, and those of the eminentest quality, bemoaned his premature fall: Relating the noble actions he had done to the surviving honour of his Countrey: and high approvement of his loyalty: imputing the grounds of his Impeachment to no guilt of his, but to his Enemies malignant humour: whose sole bent it was, as they conceiv'd, to improve their future advancement by his Dishonour. But others there were far otherwise prepossessed. For these, being of the Plebeian Ranck, and consequently more easie to be wrought upon by the adverse part: too credulously inclined to the report which his malicious Adversaries had spread abroad concerning him: pretending, that Clarentio by his factious Instruments, had practised the Cities ruine: intending to seize upon their Treasury: and by the sinews thereof to leavie Arms, Ammunition and men to act his own usurping interest. The hour now approaching for this fatall and immerited execution: a great confluence of people assembled, contrary to the intention of the malignants;    [  Never was any design carried on with more secresie & subtilty, as we receive it from the Original History. ] who designed nothing more then privacy to vail it from the Eye and Ear of that Supreme Soveraigntie, whereof they remained ever jealous, lest the discoverie might produce an unseasonable prevention of their bloody intendment. Clarentio was presented first upon this sable Stage of State: the other two Personages onely appearing; to whom under a counterfeit colour of Clemencie, a Reprieve was granted. The fatal Axe and Block being now prepared: and the Executioner ready to performe his Office: Licinio, Magirides and Pernio being secretly shrouded, to be glad Spectators of this Theatral Tragedie, Clarentio with an undaunted and fortifi'd spirit (as nothing could be lesse expected from a Person of that gallantrie) addressed himself in this sort to his funeral farewel. My Lords and Gentlemen, you may here see to what a Catastrophe the progression of my loyall service has reduc'd me! Neither do I impute this to the levity of my Prince: of whose gracious favours I have so amply partak't: but the ingratitude of time, and the mortall Enmity of my Opposers: who with one unite consent pitcht upon this result; to ground their rising upon my ruine. And so far be my thoughts distanced from envying their imaginary happinesse: or maligning their surreptitious greatnesse: that I here protest before you all, Gentlemen, and attest Heav'n to record it: that I freely and cordially remit those numerous and insupportable indignities they have done me: not onely in designing my death: for that is the lowest in the skale of my sufferings: and the least in my dimension: but in their traducing of my fame: and blemishing mine honour, which might descend (if the Charity of good men should not remove it) in after-ages to my posterity. These, I say, in this my last accompt to Nature, I really pardon: wishing, they may receive the like entertaine in Heaven, as I render them now cancell'd in this my receed from Earth. Now to confirm your opinion of my innocency, I beseech you lend me your attention with a firme confidence of what I deliver to be authentick truth. The words of dying men should enforce the deepest impression, and receive most credit. I here vow before him that made me: and before whom I am to stand or fall: that this breast never foster'd such a thought, as might tend to Treason: or any seditious project against my Prince or the Constitution of her State. I was ever more retentive of those Graces and Priviledges of Honour I had received; then to blaunch them with an Act of such palpable ingratitude. It is not unknown to most of you, my Noble Lords, how personall Enmity and self- interests were the activest instruments of my fall. If they were here in presence, whom I onely glance at: for my time, as it is short, so most improper for vindication of wrongs, or impeaching of persons; They could not with modesty deny, with what instancy they have sollicited my compliance: and with what plausive pretences they labour'd to traine me to their Lure. Which I could never in honour acquiesce to: finding their aimes to be mercenary: and grounded on indirect Principles: yet this, to this houre I never discovered; so tender I was of preserving their reputes; who now make my Passage hence, their most Comicall and delightfull pastime. I shall request one suit more of you my Lords; but especially of you, my L. Stratonico ; being most vers'd in the Court: and most frequently in the eye of my Prince; that you would vouchsafe me that honour, as to present the most humble and devotionall Obeisance of a dying Servant to her Majesty. Whose last votive Sacrifice unto God, shall be for her long, happy and prosperous Continuance in this her flourishing State and Imperiall Command of Candy . And to support this so glorious a Fabrick of State, may she have a grave and conscientious Counsell to advise her in the mannage and government of her affaires. And that her prudentiall Senate may be ever purged of those ulcerous members, whose imposthum'd condition might corrupt the Constitution of her State.---Now good night to all the world:--- Executioner performe thy Office. My peace is made. The Executioner, more sensible it seem'd of Clarentio's suffering, then he was of his own; holding it an ungratefull Act to take off his head, who had formerly sav'd his life; became surpriz'd with such a Panick fear; as his trembling hand, knew not how to direct the Axe. Which Clarentio observing, incouraged him to do his work; saying, 'Be not so discourteous to me, Funello , for the favour I once shew'd thee; as to delay the expected minute of my remove: Trust me, I suffer more in thy protraction, then I shall in the performance of thine office.' But these words did but lightly allay his feares; which appeared at the very instant of this Execution. For such a trembling paralyticall motion indisposed his hand, as his Axe missing the joynt at which he aimed wounded him twice or thrice, terribly in his shoulder; before he took off his head: which was presently put into a damaske bag: and his body, though privately; yet with much decencie conveyed and interred in a Vault anciently belonging to his Family. Many howers were not past, till the Relation of this Tragicall Action came to the eare of the Princesse, either from the hand of Stratonico ; a Favorite of principall esteeme: and to whom Clarentio had at his death made his address for presenting his humblest Service to her Majesty: or from Athalia ; who, as you formerly heard, had either neglected or injuriously sleighted that pious and amicable office of delivering those lines and Ring to the perplexed Princesse, which Clarentio had recommended to her care and charge. And by all probabilitie it came from Athalia , who having a deep resentment of her unexpiable guilt: the very Evening after this Execution done; she repaired to the Court: and going up to the Princesse Bed-chamber; discovered with much passion what was befaln Clarentio : with her neglect of that office which she was obliged to performe. Wherewith the Princess, as one surpriz'd with fear of the issue, no less quickly then passionately interrupting her; what office might that be whereto you stood obliged, Athalia ; and failed in your performance? In my not presenting those lines with a Ring inclosed to your Majestie. What lines? what Ring? and from whom? with tear-swoln eyes, and a weak-breathing accent, she replied, from Clarentio . Oh then, have we lost eternally, Clarentio! May Iliads of miseries pursue thee, faithless Athalia . Be a stranger to our Court for ever; for ruining him; whose actions compleated him in every Charge that our Commands imposed on him, an absolute Person of honour. More would not her Princely passion either give way to hear; nor inquire: but retiring to her Closet, with a severe injunction of Athalias absence from her Court: She remained as one extaciz'd for many daies after; admitting none to her presence. Not long after this uncouth solitude and dis-passionate retirement, Stratonico was suffer'd to acquaint her with the whole Series of this Proceeding against Clarentio , and by whom he was with most vehemencie and rigour prosecuted; together with his free and ingenuous attestation upon the Scaffold, of his integrious thoughts during the whole carriage of his imploiments in his relations to loyaltie and constant fidelitie, which he would with all alacritie seal, (to clear his Familie of any such tincture) with the Sacrifice of his blood. This Narration recruted her passion: and imprinted in her royal affections a stronger apprehension of his vertues. But alas, within short time this conceipt of his approved integritie: and his immerited Censure so strongly wrought upon her, as it brought her into a great indisposition of health: but attempered nothing of her heat, in pursuing his revenge against those active Instruments of his ruine. For Magirides , and Pernio , who were his Rhadamanthean Judges were shortly after degraded: and with Writts of Ease justly rewarded. And for Licinio the prime Actor in this Tragedy; had not a noisome disease abridged his daies; an heavie and exemplarie Sentence of Proscription had attached him. Now to Epitomize the Excellencies of this Princesse Bellingeria , it were easie to collect hence; the nobleness and puritie of her disposition; in reteining the memorie of such as had bestow'd their Endevours in the Carriage of her affaires with fidelitie: and her care to vindicate their honours, whom irregular Command or injustice of Proceeding, to the prejudice of her Court, had illegally censured. Favorites she would admit none, save such as favoured vertue. For Councellours of State; she made choice of none, but where Judgment and Conscience were Concomitants. Humane Learning she affected; as an Imbellishment to higher Studies. State-reading she made singular use of: and to times and occasions prudently applied those requisites. Though unprovoked, she appear'd of a benigne and peaceable nature, lyable to no feminine nor weak humour; yet if assaulted, or by any invasive Force were it never so formidable disgusted; She would appeare a Princely Martialist: and in time of danger, give ample testimonies of her incomparable vallour: for she would not stick to go before her Souldiers with her Leading Staffe in her hand: and play the General in the Field, to incourage her men by her example to fight. So accomplish'd was Bellingeria ; and of such Princely endowments, being no lesse formidable to her Enemies; then infinitely winning and affectionate to her own: as she might appeale to the whole progresse of her flourishing Government, if ever any State were managed with more Forraigne feare and Domestick love. A president to present times: and memoriall to future Ages. Yet the purest Cloath may admit it's staine: and the integriousest person incurr a blemish. This I might instance in this unparallel'd Princesse; a Lady memorable for her virile and masculine valour; and no less generally fam'd for her virgin honour. Whose royall repute receiv'd a deep taint or tincture in one action; which, to contract our story with more brevity, closed thus. There was one Mariana , a Lady for state and magnifiscence, a Sophonisba ; for bounty and munificence a Berenice ; who was nearly linkt in blood to Berengeria . She, for diverse occurrences thwartly incountring her, was advised to leave her Country, where she had so many powerfull Enemies: and to retire to the Confines of Candy ; where she might be confident of a free and gracefull Hospitality; with all such princely accommodations as might hold correspondence with a Person of her quality. With these faire and plausive promises was Mariana induced to decline her Countrey: and repaire to Candy . Where she had not long sojourned; till some unworthy Instruments of State, pretending a zeal to the Princesse; suggested to her too credulous spirit; what ambitious thoughts Mariana had of usurping a Soveraignty: and how her recourse to Candy , although it pretended personall safety: was to ingratiate the eminentst Peers to second her in the pursuit of her regall Title; in succession to the Kingdom; whereto she held her self nearest by a lineall and hereditary descent, to the Crown. This private suggestion infinitely perplext the Princesse; neither would she at first give eare unto it: interpreting all things, according to the goodness of her nature, to the best sence. But at last by long perswasion, and sundry arguments of probability to induce her belief; she became doubtfull of Mariana's fidelity. And within few daies after, injoyned her a restraint: and that so easie, as it abridg'd not much her Liberty. But this jealousie, fomented by some officious Agents, became daily increased; and by degrees to such height, as she became attached of High Treason (which to cleare the Princesse innocence, she was wholly unknown to.) The Malignants of this distressed Lady, were main and many. And to expedite their designe, she became soon impeached. Artists they could not want to execute their work. At Famorgned was a Stately Scaffold shortly erected, where this unfortunate Lady was to sacrifice her life. Where she appeared with a cheerfull and amicable Countenance: (as what will not innocence cloathed with a noble spirit personate) and calling upon her Gentlewomen Philanthe ; wished her not to be at all amated with her death: 'though it be a Censure, said she, that I neither expected nor merited. My innocence incourageth me, and bids me boldly look death in the face.' After she had taken a turn or two over the Scaffold; and eying the Exetutioner: 'I am perswaded, said she, that thou art more fearfull of executing thy Office, then I shall be in suffering the stroak of Justice. But it behoves me to speak something in my own defence: though I could not be admitted to that favour at the time of my judgment.' Then inclining her body with a majestick grace (as no Person could put on Majestie with a more becoming or unaffected posture) she delivered herself in these words. 'Gentlemen, and you that are Persons of honour; be pleased to hear the last words of a condemned Stranger; One, the innocencie of whose actions never deserved any such censure. 'I came here for Sanctuarie; and behold the fruits of Candies hospitalitie! I came here for safetie; and the Sacrifice of my life assures me of Securitie. To tell you what I am, I shall not need much to acquaint you: few of you spheared in the rank of Nobilitie, but are known to my descent; I leave it to the puritie of my Soul to attest my desert. But the Cause is soon pleaded, where no Advocate will be admitted. Before I came forth of my own Countrey, I heard great fame of your Princess goodness: and Candies benignitie. My Entrance was no Design of disloyaltie, but an action of apparent necessitie; hoping to find that entertain abroad, which I could not partake of at home. I cannot but acknowledge my lineal right, but to reach at a Crown before it fell due: or to usurpe a Command from an others interest, was the least of my thoughts, the lowest of my scorn. To my knowledge, my demean has not merited any of these high indignities from any of your Peerage. My life has been hitherto of more retirement, then to imbroile my Person in any forraign affairs, or to fish in troubled waters; wherein active and unquiet spirits are most verss'd. But to what end do I discourse the forepast Condition of my life, drawing so near a period? 'My Lords, I know there be some of you, who out of a native compassion (the express Character of a noble nature) will commiserate my fall: and retein an harsh conceipt of those that were such eager hunters after my bloud. To you I appeal as vindicators of mine honour; which upon the word of a distressed Princess, you may safely act without the least blemish to your unquestion'd repute. It was the Clandestine practise and conspiracie of my Enemies, who designed my ruine, that winged my course for Candy . And by some eminent persons, as their assurance by Letters will manifest; I was made to believe (so apt was my innocence to become credulous) that nothing could be wanting, that might suit with a person of my qualitie in the Puncto of Honour, or any proper accommodation corresponding to so acceptable a Stranger. But my too late experience taxeth now my indiscreet Credulitie. It had been much better for me to have perished in my own Confines with honour: then to die in another, and remain branded with an ignominious Censure. But we must not contest with Fate: nor condemn Heaven of Injustice. Fit it is that Superiour Powers should exercise their dominion over Inferiour Bodies. Such high Decretals admit no Prohibitions. But I assume too much priviledge upon your patience: this unnecessarie spinning out of time, may some argue, implies a pusillanimitie of spirit: which, thanks to my Maker, stands at great distance with the resolution of my temper. We have hitherto, for the most part of our time, sailed on a rough and turbulent Ocean: and arriving now near our Harbour, what should we fear? Farewell to all; with a free remitment to those who pursued me to death. Then calling upon Philanthe ; who all this while appeared like another Niobe , drenched in tears. Lend me thine hand, said she, Philanthe : and pay thy last dutie to thy dying Ladie.' Where laying her Head, (above a feminine composure) upon the Block; with a princely majestie elevating her Eyes to heaven, where no doubt, her thoughts and fervorous desires were already fixed, she undergoed with incomparable patience, and soveraigntie over her passions, the stroake of death. This immerited Action lay a fowle aspersion upon Bellingeria: taxing her both for her too light credulitie; and too much crueltie. First of Credulitie; in opening her bosom to such groundless reports as the malignancie of her Foes had merely suggested. Secondly, of Crueltie; in embruing her imperial hand in her Kinswomans bloud; who fled to her Court for succour: and not to be proceeded withall, as a Traitor. Hence it was, that some of her nearest, and those of the purest and clearest Judgment spar'd not to say; That it was an apparent breach of National amitie: and a flat violation of Hospitalitie; which might be by these Evidences clearly attested. For, in the first place, there had been a firme Juncto and constant correspondence, confirmed by mutual presents and arguments of affection, cemented more strongly by the tie of Consanguinitie; betwixt these two Royal Ladies. Usual assistances upon occasional interests, reciprocally afforded; Commerce amicably without disturbance continued: with interchange of all civil offices: and respects of love equally communicated. Besides, Bellingeria might remain amply satisfied touching Mariana's fidelitie: for though she had been advised, nay seriously instanced to pursue the Quest of her Title: and to ingratiate herself with such as sate at the Stern: lest her strangenesse to Persons of Command and Qualitie might impede her legal and lineal challenge to her Soveraigntie: yet would she never give eare nor attention to all their perswasive inducements: saying, she was neither so jealous of the Prince of Candies goodness: nor so diffident of the validitie of her own Claim; but when opportunitie gave way to her just demands, she might without opposition be admitted to that Monarchical State, whereto both Law and Bloud had entituled her. And to leap into the sadle, before the right Owner were dismounted: or had diseased himself of it; argued impudence or manifest injustice. 'No, said she, I am none of those Lapwings who flie to their Nests with shells on their heads. Preparation with mature Judgment shall accompanie my Title before I ascend the Throne.' These just and pious Resolvs of so princely a Ladie; might have return'd a plenary and sufficient testimonie of her loyal & affectionate tender to her Royal Kinswoman, without dispute. But Crowns and Nuptial Beds, as they admit no Competitors: so their enjoyment begets, many times, sundry causeless fears; which by degrees usually break forth into Tragical Extreams. Yet in the discoverie of all these heavy passages, trenching so highly upon Bellingeria's honor; if we should take an impartial survey of some particulars tending to her vindication; we shall find sundry effectual motives, and those strongly enducing us to entertain a clearer construction of Bellingeria's proceeding against Mariana . True it is, indeed, that upon some perswasive suggestions, hammered by Persons nearly interested to the State; the Princess gave way to her Commitment; which might be taken rather for an easie confinement, then any strict restraint. But in relation to the Judgment pronounced; or the Act of Justice executed, she was wholly ignorant: as might appear by sundrie pregnant circumstances: which might be collected hence. First, this Princess after such time as she had received certain advertisement of the weight and rigour of those proceedings against her injured Kinswoman; she could never endure to admit any of her Prosecutors to her presence: displacing such as were Gownmen and persons of Judicature: and estranging those Favorites from her Court, who had any hand in the hastning of her dispatch. Nay, in her Princely Progress, it was ever observed; when at any time her Jests lay near that Place where Mariana suffered; in resentment of her death, she would usually take her Evening Procession, one of her Ladies onely attending her, to the place of her Interment: where she would solemnize her Memory with pious tears: causing a fair Monument of Ebony to be erected, and with an elegant Inscription beautified. Though by her next Successor, her body became afterwards removed, and with much solemnitie translated, to a Fane or Temple of more honour: where it now remains registred among the Eminenst Princes of Candy . Thus have we, and no lesse then deservingly, with an easie Sponge wip'd off those aspersions which licentious Calumny arising from the Corruption of time, had thrown upon the fame of this unparallel'd Lady. Whose renown has been the Subject of many ingenious Fancies; not onely to eternize her fame: but in improving their own judgement, in making choice of so rare and exquisite a Subject. But we are now to descend from the description of this absolute Idea of all Princes in her time; to her farewell on earth. You are now to imagin this Orient Sun, after she had attained to a ripe and full age, being already got to her Climactericall yeare inveloped in a Cloud, that sable Shroud of mortality. Albeit, it was generally thought, that the Constitution of her body considered: and her excellent temper in her directions of diet observed; She might, to the joy of her Subjects, have lived much longer: had not some occurrents violently incountring with her passions, enfeebled her health and contracted the Course of Nature. Neither was this passionate Conflict discovered in any personall Object more, then in the losse of her Clarentio: which name with an assiduate Tribute of teares, all along during the time of her Sickness, she usually repeated and reiterated: such deep impressions of affection had the Opinion of his Loyall Service imprinted in her heart. But forc'd at last to yield to Nature; she seem'd infinitely to rejoyce in her Remove, thanking Fate with a pleasing smile, for [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) winning her addresse to so faithfull a Friend: and serviceable an Instrument of State. But some there were who imputed these ravings and distempers to the extremity of her Sickness: which we shall not here dispute. It appeared that her memory continued perfect to her death: for she gave express Commands some daies before, that Lycorus and Merannes with all those that adheared to Clarentio's faction should be inlarged and restored to their Estates. After such time as Bellingeria's Funeralls had been with all Princely magnificence solemnized. Candy became infinitely distracted, touching the Nomination of their next Prince. For though they were satisfied in relation to his descent: being indubitable Heire to the deceased Princess: yet bore they a great disgust to the Nation from whence he was to come: being Illiria ; a People naturally servile, uncivile and pusillanimous. Neither could it be suppos'd as most men thought, that the Illirian could challenge his own without great opposition: or enjoy his Crown without much effusion of blood: and that some Electorate Estate would be speedily constituted to cross the Illirian descent. Which fared much otherwise; for Cicelio , a grave, serious and prudent person; though naturally averse from Martiall affaires, had so ingratiated the Peeres and principall Members of State (as what will not Gifts effect?) as he entred the Isle with generall approvement and acclamation. None to oppose him: all with alacrious spirits: ready to attend him: and to prepare away to his Coronation; which within few dayes after was accomplished: and with such Solemnity as it drove the Illirian Prince, now Candies Soveraign, into an high amazement. Justs, Tilts and Turnaments; Dramatick Enterludes, Masks, and Pagentry of all sorts, presented with incomparable state and infinite cost by the Citizens of Thamisopolis ; where these Coronation Shows were contrived, prepared  & perfected. Cesterns ran abundantly with Claret, White and Rhenish, as if they had sprung from the Celtick rivolets. Neither could this high presentment of State beget less then amazement in the Illirian Prince; seeing his own indigent, rude and illiterate Nation, never entertain'd his Eyes with any such rarities. His royal Consort, a Princess of a gallant composure and stately deportment, was with the choicest voices and airs, wherewith she was infinitely delighted, after the compleating of these Solemnities, gracefully receaved. Where the Lady Honetta and Devonessa by their incomparable voices and accomplish'd demean wrought so strongly upon her affection: as no society, treat, Ball nor Presentment could appear grateful to this Princess without their presence. And in very deed the free and frolick humors of these two Ladies suited nearly with the Princess disposition. For her Husband, being naturally addicted to retirement: or such Contemplative studies as disrelished much her palat; being a Lady dedicated to pleasure, by his privacy gave her way to all Courtly Liberty. Great was her content in Masks and Revels: wherein, if she chanced to observe any person more gracefully eminent, or actively performing then the rest; to do him the honour and compleat the presentment in a more absolute manner, she would with much cheerfulness and princely alacrity joyn with him in the Measure: and testifie her grateful acceptance with an appropriate favour. [  An Idea or Modell of a New Court. ] This begot in her young Court- Damasella's an infinite affection: joying much in the change of their condition: For Bellingeria in her raign could not enjoyn the Attendants of her Court more regular restraint, then this Princess after her short reside in the Court, initiated them in principles of liberty. State-affairs were not so much as thought on. New-fashion'd habits, melodious aires, amorous parlies, with a Mintage of quaint devised complements, such as the rustick incivilities of the Illirian Nation had never made their Princes acquainted withall. All this time, Honetta and Dionessa , Ladies dededicated to pleasure, and who had formerly to too much freedom exposed their honour, ceased not to present objects of Fancy to their frolick Soveraigness; Which could not be so privately suggested, but it was in the Ear of the Court closely dispersed. Which her slow and supine Prince either never heard of, or took no notice of: having the happiness not so much as to unlock the well-ordered Cabinet of his heart to any thought of Jealousie. For the activeness of his Spirit was wholly imployed in Field-pleasures: and such Sociable Complies, as relished more the palat; then any other youthful or amorous address. Which those two wanton voluptuous Ladies nimbly and artfully wrought upon in their application to his Consort. One Evening in a free Career of Discourse (in a close Arbour delightfully impaled with Myrtles, Emblems to a love-parley) Honetta an Excellent Tutoresse in loves Principles, told her Princesse, how in her Survey of a Court life, wherein she had been vers'd from her Infancy, she found nothing more consentaneous to a free and inlarged spirit then a rational and corresponding Favorite, to whom any Lady with reservancy to her honour, might impart the secresie of her affection: and receive assistance in the fair pursuit of her Desires. What might these Favorites be, answer'd the Princess, on whom, my dear Honetta , you are pleased to bestow so fair a title, and so clear a Character? Madam, quoth she, my Expresses shall be short and real. Though Plato be dead, his Platonicks survive. We have many here of that compleat Sect, that will labour by their fair deportment to merit your acceptance: who be those, said the Princess, whom amongst thy Select ones, may receive so free admittance to our relations? None of all our Courtiers, answer'd Honetta , more corresponding then Lycorus , (a person formerly ingaged in an action of infinite consequence and probable peril.) Devonessa hearing the name of Lycorus commended to the Princess for her Platonick ; was not a little disrelished with Honettas choice; being a person whom she had formerly entertain'd in her bosom before all others: and to whom with much intimacy she had devoted her affection. O by no means, Madam, make Lycorus none of your Platonicks (replied Dionessa ) he cannot possibly prove faithful in retention of your secrets, who has profest himself a Servant to many Mistresses. I could commend one to you, Madam, said Devonessa , whose personage, as it might beget in you a merited acceptance, so the approvement of his secresie, in whatsoever may highly concern your honour, deservingly correspond with your admittance. And this is Merannes ; a Person of a Courtly garb and amiable presence. This choice tendred to the Princess (by way of revenge, for otherwise it could not be construed) did not a little nettle Honetta ; for none more bosomly dear then Merannes nor familiarly affectionate: though with a pleasant compliance she wisely cover'd it: as if her thoughts were wholly estranged from any such Object. But Devonessa knew well, that Honetta could not but hold herself fully requited for her proposal of Lycorus to the Princess. Time thus run on rather in amorous discourses and introductions to Love then any other actuall expresses. Wherein though the Princess Ismenia shew'd her self a Soveraignesse of Pleasure ; yet there appeared in her no discovery of any Select Favorite; so cautious she was in her Choice: and so observant in the points of honour. Albeit some light Censors of the Court, who measur'd the levity of others affections by their own scantling; and whose eyes were no less suspicious, then tongues liberall; spread a report of her intimacy with Lycorus ; whose discreet composure was never known to transgress the limits of honour: nor ingage his repute to an inhibited pleasure. But some ground there was (and weake is that ground which censorious jealousie cannot build on) and it arose from hence: Basilius , her retired Consort, a Person wholly devoted to privacy and Comtemplative Studies, unless some other lighter Pleasure for recreation-sake, entertain'd him: walking one Evening in his Garden; and finding Lycorus in pleasant private discourse with his Lady: I approve this highly ( said Basilius) I see we are all for Platonick Learning . This Speech, without ground, begot an opinion in those light jealous Courtiers, but especially the Ladies, who variously rendred those words of Basilius , and much different from his meaning: That this weak Prince more espoused to Learning then Love; being conscious of his own deficiency, had dis-interessed himself of his Princess: and freely recommended her to the Tutelage of a Platonick Lord. Which traduce no sooner came to Ismenias eare, whose innocent freedom might clearly vindicate it self from any such groundless imputation, she could not be at rest till she acquitted this Charge of honour in this manner. The words are rendred according to their Originall tenure. Ladies, wherein has my freedom so highly offended, that it should nurse in you this opinion? Cannot discourse be entertain'd without lightness: nor the admittance of a Courtier without suspicion of wantonnesse? I am as yet but a stranger in your Court: and I wish with all mine heart, that I had never been initiated in it, if it stand so affected. A diadem is a precious Ornament, but inferiour to fame.--- This I had before I came among you: and injoy'd my dignity with as much liberty, and more honour. Surely, I cannot think otherwise, but that there raigns much infection in that Court; where harmeless affection appeares so infectious. I should prove as cruell to each accent of my delivery, as the Ostridge to her eggs, if they should produce a discovery of lightness in their issue. I have heard from some of you Ladies, whose long discipline hath sufficiently school'd you in the mode and rarity of Courts, that Platonick society might be admitted without the least touch or blemish of dishonour. And must a Rule of Exception be injoyned to a Princess which admits none to the freedom of her Ladies? Must our restraint inlarge your liberty? How far better then is it to imbrace Subjection then Severaignty? If the felicity of Princes consist in dominion; why should it not discover it self most in priority of affection? Are we to be lower in our love, because higher in our line? Ancient Records render us this testimony of our glorious Predecessor Athalia sometimes Princess of Candy ; that though her life was single, expressing in it singular Continence: her Parts exquisite, accomplish'd withall Princely Excellence; her exploits admirable, manifesting her prowess and happiness: yet did she allow her self State-favorites , to inable her in Rules of Politick Government, without the least Sentiment of Lightness. Her life was eminent: and her death to the quality of her life correspondent. Let me obtaine this boone of you, faire Ladies; that I may freely injoy without Censure, what my Progenitors did without least diminution to their honour. But if this may not be admitted me, I will propose unto you Ladies a more regular Copy of austerity. Platonicks shall be to us strangers: and our Needles our constant Consorts. A straid look shall incurre a Forfeiture. And for the Court , The Queens side shall become a cloister; let my Liege use his at his pleasure. This, I hope, will prevent all jealousie: and free us from all scandalous reports and immerited infamy. For dye had we rather with Fame, then live in dishonour. This drove such a cold qualme into those young Ladies hearts; as they knew not by what meanes to bring their injuried and highly incensed Princesse to her Former temper. The Court grew quite out a tune. A sad and uncouth Melancholy, a strange Guest to that Place, had sabled every Roome. The Queenes side appeared like a Tragicall Tyring house. But long did not these Sudds of Sorrow nor dumps of discontent continue. That Italian Proverb confirmed it self true in this Catastrophe. Short is Sorrows surfet, where Court-pleasure makes her Palet . New Presentments enlivened spritely and active affections. The Platonick State, so lately disheartned by Ismenia's disgust, in a more refined and compt garbe begun to resume its former beauty and liberty. Tilts and Turnaments with other Martiall Exercises, wherein the Peerage were formerly imployed; became Addresses of too virile a quality. Carpet-Knights were not for Campe-Service: nor Court-Couches convertible to Field-Bedds. Schools and Academies of Love stored with choicest Lectures of pure and attractive Rhetorick, to make their dialect a more powerfull Sollicitor to Fancy, were erected: and Masters of Revells appointed and amply endowed; and these were imployed in contriving and inventing variety of Comick and Pastorall delights: which were usually presented in their private Court Theaters, purposely erected for such Enterludes and Comicall Inventions. And good opportunity had Ismenia with her amorous Ladies to play the Platonick Courtiers: seeing Basilius made the Wild Forrest the Place of his solace and recreation. VVhence some virulent Spirits would not stick to traduce Ismenia : and make her honour suspected: saying, that so long as Act aeon pursued his Chace: his Alcione might securley make choice of her Game. But those who were known to her Conjugall Condition (though too much freedom might blemish her Fame) might witness for her, that her Princely thoughts mounted above the spheare of such servile affections. Being such an absolute Empress of her desires; as in those Platonick Encounters; where the strength of Continency was many times brought to a tryall: if her Pretending Platonick transported too much with confidence should divert from their addressed discourse, were it morall, historicall or mixt: and assume to himself a freedom less becoming: though more amorously glancing: she would not forbear sharpely to reprove him saying, that he had transgressed Plato's Laws: For some of his Works she had read lately rendred in her own Native dialect: but never found him act the part of a sensuall Suiter . Melidorus indeed, was holden her Eminent Favorite: and ever receiv'd, upon his appliance to her, with a gracefull Entertaine. But never more then modesty might admit: For in private visits, after that aspersion thrown on her, upon her reported intimacy with Lycorus , no Courtier, were he never so accomplish'd, could have access or admittance to her, without the presence of some of her Ladies of Honour. So as in this, so in other Objects of Fancy, her unblemish'd Fame was injuriously traduced. But her masculine resolution from a nobleness of Spirit, sleighted all such palpable aspersions. Neither could the purity of her Fame be more really clear from Infamy, then Bazilius honest heart was of the least thought of Jealousy. Neither did this indifferency to Feminine Objects, nor his affection to the contrary Sex, proceed (as some weakly conceipted) from frigidity of Nature: nor any inordinate degeneracy: but rather from the gust of those active recreations and exercises which he affected: and in their quality more suitable to men then women. But we are not here to weave Apologies. Historians with an integrious and impartial pen are to relate, but not to render an accompt of the actions of those Persons, wherof they treat. Those import their own interest: and as they acted upon the Stage; so must they receive their applause and approvement by the vogue and voice of their Spectators. In a word, as to sooth Princes in their pursuit of an unbecoming liberty, is noxious: so too curiously to make inspection into the secresie of their actions, is very dangerous. Domitian could not endure a discovery of his delight in the pursuit of Flies . Such toyes are held serious imployments with trifling Commanders: who lay not the ground of their undertakings upon what beseems them, but on what delights them. But let us return to our Court, bathed in all pleasures that either the height of Fancy or complement of State could contrive. Neither had Candy at that time, as you may collect by the Sequel, much to imploy herself withall, save onely with sumptuous Entertains, delicious Treats, and gorgeous Dress. For so happy was she in the enjoyment of a peaceable Prince: as by bounteous gifts and other obliging waies, he had not onely made neighbouring Princes his Friends: but possest himself of that opinion of prudence and Princely policy: as no difference arose among them, which with unanimous consent they would not refer to his decision. This graceful and long-continued habit of peace, as it enricht the State with plenty: so it begot in the Inhabitants an incommodious securitie. For those virile  & masculine spirits, which formerly proclaimed the Heirs of Honour, were become now strangers to actions & exploits of valor, being wholly unexercis'd to those Martial affairs, wherewith their first Assaies of Youth had been inured. Neither would those Stoical Censors of the State who profest theselvs mortal Antagonists to all Masks, Treats, Balls and reer-visits, stick to enveigh against the sensual libertie of their Pusillanimous Peerage: Saying that Crabtree-grafts inoculated in generous Stocks had quite spoil'd the Nurserie of Candy . And indeed what by the effeminacy of that present State, whose long peace and security had brought most of the Nobility to that delicacy; that as their Spirits were averse from the Exercises of Arms; so were their intellectual parts and inward abilities so weakned, or rather estranged from civil Consultations and affairs of State, as in their Election for Supply of such qualified Persons as might perform those Offices of high Concern (and wherein their Top-branches and Ciens of the eminenst Families had been formerly imployed) there was not one found of all that conspicuous line capable of such high undertaking: being better known to a Game at Tenis: then the performance of any State-service. Thus past these times with many vicissitudes and turns: while the Palms of Peace so impaled the Frontiers of Candy , as it had no occasion to dream of an Enemy. Mean while, the Court had wars; but they were amorous Encounters: Foes, but they were Corrivals. Amongst which Melidorus , that constant Favorite, and Ismenia's individual Platonick, continued his visits, being encouraged by the Princess Connivence and her Ladies easie admittance; who usually attended her, to pursue his quest. Which could not be carried on with such secresie: but it became an Argument of private Discourse amongst those Court-Ladies: who could no way shadow nor conceal the joy they apprehended upon their Princess reduction to her former Career of Pleasure: the onely Object which their affectionate libertie aimed at. In this number, but much different from their nature, was one Aretina , a Person of vertuous and choice repute: and one nearly allyed to Melidorus : who hearing with what Freedom this private Censure had dispers'd it self amongst those Ladies of Honour: and how much it derogated from her kinsmans Fame; which she so highly valued: as she could not with patience, (being otherwise of a Composed temper) heare them whisper touching any such Platonick Encounter, if it reflected on Melidorus ; but she would stand up in vindication of his honour, not without sharpe reproof of the greatest Lady, who out of an assumed Confidence durst oppose her. Till at last convinc'd with pregnant probabilities of usuall Platonick visits: and those at unseasonable times: which might beget Foments of jealousie to suspicious Eyes: and of rumour enough to jealous Eares: as one extased with a pious tender of her kinsmans honour; she set pen to paper, expressing her discontents in relation to his bleeding Fame, after this manner: transcribed from her own stile and character.  Sir; I am sorry to heare that the grandeur and burden of honour, under which you labour, should make you so secure, nay remisse in preserving it: you professe your self a Platonick ; but sure, though I was never much read in his Philosophy: nor school'd in his Principles of Morality; I cannot suffer my self to have so much Faith, as to believe that so sage and prudent a Master could give his Schollars such light lessons, as to fix their affections on prohibited Objects. Go to Sir; Is there none but your Princess to Court for your Mistresse? Look about you, and observe, (if your Fancy has not already begot in you a Phrensy) upon what two fatall shelves you run your crazy vessell, by playing the ambitious pursuer of such a precipitous Pleasure; two inevitable rocks, danger, and dishonour. The nearer Jove , the more subject to the stroake of thunder. And nearly, sure, you desire to be, when you would partake in his Right: and share in his Choice. You know well how Conjugall Bedds and Regall diadems admit no Competitors: affection being impatient of Competition. And if Common Beds challenge this Priviledge: what may we think of the Prerogative of Princes? Give me leave, Melidorus , to come home to you: the least drop of blood that takes its course through your veines, cannot receive a staine; but it must necessarily beget in me a glowing blush; from our near relations and propinquity of Families. Be not then so cruell to your selfe, as to neglect your own Fame. Pitty us who be your Allies, if you have no resentment of your own Condition. The Eyes of Our whole Court, like so many Stars in a Frosty Evening, shoot out and bestow their reflections on you. It is not the privacy of your Arbours; though never so retired: nor the vigilancy of your Agents, be they never so circumspect; that can cleare a Cloud inveloped with such thickness of infamy: or with all their art shadow the prostitution of your honour. The Splendour of Fame retains a pure complexion: and such as will admit of no borrowed Colours. This lost, never regain'd: how tender then ought a Branch of Nobility to be of preserving that which so highly conduceth not onely to the beautifying but accomplishing of a Familie? And this I am sure, you cannot chuse but reflect on. You cannot, if you look upon the many descents lineally derived from your Ancestry; but acknowledge your self infinitely obliged to the Superiour Powers; who have thus far and thus long continued the Succession of your Line, and preserv'd it without staine. And must a minute of usurp'd pleasure impaire the repute of so flourishing a descent? How many Eminent Families have we known shrinking under this burden; and these, perchance, not so conscious of such apparent guilt, as your suspected Converse has discovered? But you will say, what can be held suspicious, where the Person most interested will not suffer his breast to entertaine such thoughts: nor give credit to any such report, were it with never so much constancy dispersed? If this be your onely Objection, it seemes, Melidorus ; you work much upon advantage. But answer me, must your Princess innocence authorize your lightness? Admit his thoughts retaine in them a Freedom: must that gallant Soveraignty or dominion over his affections, beget in you a security of transgressing? Unshrowde your self, Sir, and lay your actions open to an impartiall discovery. Though Basilius acquit his noble and serene Spirit from harbouring any Conceipt of his Ladies stray'd thoughts: or of your unseasonable visits: His Court will not cast so light a vaile over it. His clearness from jealousie must not promise to your Errors an impunity. Nay, let me tell you, your Loyalty should produce in you Motives of more piety. When any Treasure is committed to our Care and Custody; we might justly hold it a violation or infringment of trust; to give up our Charge, or betray it to an Enemy. You are Elected the Princess Chamberlaine; let that treasure with you deposited, be never impaired nor impeached. Desist then, I beseech you, (with a Sacrifice of teare-swollen Eyes I beg it of you) from ministring any just occasion of suspicion to a Censorious State. Walke with a cleane foot neare the lyons den. For though he, with a conniving Eye pass by your Folly, and smile at your levity; you cannot be ignorant of the Apothegme of the Lyons Jack ; (and many such he has in his Court;) who by their Call will endeavour to rouse up their inraged Master: and expose your ambitious folly, a deplorable Object to his fury. We shall usually find Revenge most watchfull, when it seemes most asleep. Be not then so secure of your own safety, as to ingage it for an imaginary felicity; which like a vading shade, vanisheth quickly, and leaves the unhappy Pursuer to the acknowledgment of his shame. Such is your Case, which a timely prevention may decline: and consequently restore you to your pristine esteem: which shall incomparably suite with the affectionate wishes of, Your highly indeered Aretina .  This Letter, though it came from a Friendly hand and a Free heart; yet it wonderfully disgusted Melidorus : Fearing, as he rightly apprehended, that these suspicious reports, though they bare not the face of truth; might by the misinterpretation of such as were his Competitors; and maligners of his greatness, beget him an Odium with Basilius: and by his incensement procure him an heavy Censure from the State. He wisely recall'd to mind the Apologue; If the Foxes Eares were held for horns; he were a stout Orator that durst oppose it. Upon a serious recollection therefore of his own waies: with a resentment of his hazardous Condition, He fixt upon this result: to make use of such Instruments in the Court; whose Credit might beare him up, against all traducing reports; which, though privately dispers'd, had not then got admittance to Basilius eare: which though Chersines , a secret Enemy of his sought to accelerate, purposely to quicken his disgrace; yet this Incendiary either failed in his opportunity of acting what he had designed: or rather found the noble thoughts of Basilius so orderly composed and fortified against all such groundless surmizes, as he perceived all his Labour to be lost, though he omitted no time to expedite his injurious assaies. Meane time, those Persons whom Melidorus had made use of to vindicate his honour, exprest themselves Faithfull Agents in performing that Office of love which they had professed. And in calming the rumor of those reports, which had got too deep an impression, to be razed or removed at the first repulse; Melidorus pretended himself sick; to excuse his absence from the Court: and decline those Evening Visits which he had usually frequented. And to satisfie Aretina's desires by way of Letter, in this his seeming languishing Condition (being more surpriz'd with feare of future censure and ingagement of honour, then any other distemper) He returned her an Answer to her severe reproof in this manner.  Aretina , I could not peruse your tart lines without remembring that ancient Proverbe: 'No jealousie comparable to that of a woman.' Being apt to mint, where it can find no cause. You have known me long; but never lavish of my Fame. And I would be now infinitely sory, to be held so foolish, as to become so weary of my head, as to desire the removall of it from my shoulders. But my comfort is this, Aretina , that I cannot be more free of mine Honour, then you are of your Censure. You object, that a disperst report has already proclaim'd my guilt. Light Eares be those that will be so deluded. If either privacy of place; or opportunity of time could have wrought these effects on me; that pretious and unvaluable Gemme, which I incomparably prefer before all humane relations, had been long since blemished. But Honour, substance, nay subsistence were lowly verg'd in my Esteem, where true Reputation, without any additionall title or tinsell of adulterate Greatness, might, retaine its just posture, proportion and value. Neither have I in the whole Progress of my Course, acted ought that might beget in my unmanag'd thoughts an unsuitable Change. You taxe me highly, Aretina , in asking me, if I had no other Mistress, to present my Platonick service to, but my Soveraigness! And I must answer you in the same dialect: that there was none to whom I stood more obliged in loyalty to serve: nor who deserv'd in the Puncto of honour, the assiduate attendence of a Subject more. Besides, if you complaine of my private and frequent visits; my Place , whereto I was designed, could exact no less from me. I was, indeed, upon my Soveraigns opinion of me, appointed her Chamberlaine ; but with that modest limitation and Composure; as I spit defiance in his face, that shall dare to taxe my thoughts of the least touch of dishonour. This I write from a sick and languishing Bed, where our Protests should be free from dissembling; because our weake Condition imports a probability of dissolving. You tell me, that a Treasure was committed to my trust: and it were a violation of faith in me, to infringe that trust in me reposed: by suffering so precious a Treasure to be injuriously impaired, imbezled or impeached. I confess it, Aretina , that an inestimable Treasure was in my Custody deposited; and it has been my constant care to preserve it pure and inviolate: yea rather then it should any way suffer in relation to honour; I should hold it an acceptable Taske to sacrifice my deerest life, in vindication of it. But to curdle my blood the more: or infuse (for rather so do I desire to expound it) a religious loyall Feare in your Kinsmans breast; you offer to my Consideration the inviolable Priviledges of a Princes Bed. Sure, you retaine a better Opinion of me, then your lines signifie. Can your discretion suggest this imposture to you; that my late lightnesse should take away all thoughts of goodness? Or that I am become such a sensuall Libertine; as for an inexpiable Act of levity, to ingage, nay, make forfeture of my Loyalty? Surely, if our blouds (as you write) so nearly participate; you cannot in charity, nor propriety to your self, judge so severely of me; but you must feare some Corruption springing from your own veins; seeing, they so nearly partake with mine, as they derive their Origen from One Fountaine. But I must not chide you: Be it your goodness, Aretina , to desist from Suspecting; as I shall in this my retirement from giving occasion. And may I beget this belief in you; that a minute of perfunctory and penitentiary pleasure shall never make me forgetfull of the test nor tender of mine honour. Feare it not, I shall observe your advice; in walking with a cleane Foot neare the Lyons Cave : and a cleare heart to my Grave . For which provision, the residue of his pilgrim-hours are summ'd up by, Your most affectionate, Melidorus .  This Answer, though it were interlaid with some sprinklings of a wormwood Lecture; infinitely relished the palat of Aretina: whose onely serious Object was the Salving of Melidorus suspected honour. Whereof she appear'd the more tender, not onely in regard of their alliance: but of their joynt Education; the continued injoyment whereof had largely improved and highly inlarged this endeerment. This it was, that made his personal safety dear unto her; but much more, the Conservation of his honour. Such lineal coherence holds Fame in the descendent branches of a Family. But these lines coming from a sick bed (as he pretended) became such Cordial Receipts to Aretina's jealous thoughts; as she could not apprehend the least conceipt of her Kinsmans miscarriage: appearing upon all occasions, a Confident Champion in defence of his honour. But all such fears (as we formerly touched) had their rising from Sandy grounds. For neither did Melidorus frequent visits merit any such Construction, nor the free admittance of Ismenia (a Princess of unquestion'd fame) any such irregular traduce. Her too much freedom onely might deservingly incur Censure. Seeing Princes and eminent Persons shew their glory best at distance. Whereas too generall and familiar intercourse begets either an apparent Contempt; or disvalue to their Relations. Neither, indeed, should Censure rack it self to the highest pin, could it fall heavier upon Ismenia , then upon her too frequent repaire to Places of Concourse, as Theatral Presentments with other Publick Solemnities: and that with such privacy and nakedness of Reteiners; as she appeared much below her self. Yet those who were more intimately known to her disposition, could more candidly shadow this: and acquaint the World, how her smallness of Retinue proceeded not from any narrow nor parcimonious humour: but rather from a desire of retirement from popular aspect: coming more to see then to be seen: and frequenting these publick places of Resort, not to make choice (as some sinisterly expounded it) of Servants or Favorites suitable to her affection: but to heare the humours of the time wittily discovered, and to life acted: which might (as she oftimes exprest) highly deserve the applause and approvement of the Eminentest Persons. In her coming abroad she retained no unusuall port nor magnificence of State; lest it might beget in her an opinion of pride, which was ever a stranger to her thoughts: but in her princely demeane so affable and debonaire, as she ever returned a gracefull aspect and pleasing salute to all Persons according to their quality and degree: which in every place gave her an addition to her demerited honour: with arguments of popular affection wheresoever she appeared. And to leave her a reall Character; before she take her last farewell of her Court with all other Earthly injoyments: she never made Choice of any Favorite as a light Platonick, to lessen her Spousall affection; though the Corruption of time, and levity of some Persons about her, were apt enough to bestow their Censure, upon reflection of their own vicious Condicion; (judging all to be like unto themselves,) on the absolutest Objects of Honour. Her gallantry too, mixt with a princely compassion, was in this remarkable: That She never presented any Suit to the prejudice of the State: but for relief of such as were injured, a ready Supplicant. But Candy was not worthy of her; for shortly after, having her body much inflamed through immoderate exercise (which she purposely used to bring down her body, naturally inclining to Corpulency;) or through intemperate Bathing, as others opinion'd: or through excess of Hydroptick humours daily increasing and surprizing her; with a composed and more then a Feminine spirit she paid her debt to nature. But before her departure, to leave a testimony to the World of her untainted honour; She desired much that Basilius , her endeered Spouse might be sent for: in whose presence, and accompanied with sundry Ladies of Honour; She disburdned her self of what troubled her most: expressing her Sufferings in this manner. My Lord, I am now after a long and and troublesome Sea-fare, drawing near my Haven. Much I shall not speake, for my weaknesse will not suffer me. Onely let me obtaine this favour from you, that these last Expresses which I shall ever upon Earth deliver unto you, may receive that credit and impression, which the words of a dying Princess may justly exact. My dear Lord, we have long time injoyed the rarities of a free and profuse Court: where Honour , which should be the resplendenst Star in that Orbe, has been much obscured. And what with grief I speake in this my approaching Period, the Innocent oftimes incurred the heaviest Censure: while others by a smooth palliating of their lightnesse; preserved their Fame, though not the Essence of their Honour. Amongst those unhappy ones, I my self might be numbred; yet in this I accompt my self happy, that your pure and noble thoughts, my Lord, were fortified against all those Criminall aspersions: for which I humbly thank you. And though they were not worthy your belief: yet might my freedom of admittance merit your reproofe. But farther, as I am neare to my last breathing, I never inclined to your dishonour. But Innocence is not sufficient in such a Royall Courtly Continent. Noble Ladies, of whom I am now to take my long adue; retaine this Memoriall; and value it as an inestimable Jewell. "Be not contented with the bare Title of Ladies of Honour ; unless your Care be to preserve that Style from the reach of Censure . Nobility is but guilded Clay, if Reputation hold at distance with it. You cannot grace your Soveraigne more, nor these precious Pledges which I have had by him, and now leave with him, then by apearing Presidents of Piety, and initiating their Infancy in the like Principles of Morall goodness and Civility. \---My Liege and you honorable Ladies, farewell on Earth for ever: Nature injoynes me silence: be tender of your honour. But little needed this serious protest of Conjugal fidelity in this Excellent Lady; injoying such a Consort , whose noble heart was indued with such resolution, as it remain'd steel'd against the strength of Rumor and all groundless aspersions: which one day he was pleased more fully to express in a poetical dimension, whereto he was naturally affected, and for the Person of a Prince sufficiently accomplished. His meaning with a Diamond he left ingraven in the window of his Bed-chamber in this manner: altering onely the name of his Ismenia to Clara .  Clara Platonicks loves, but these are such, No man nor Woman likes them save herself; At such Competitors I think not much, But rather pity them; to run a-shelf Both Fame and States at once:---Such fancies be Acts tending more to Alms then Jealousie . Thus my Chaste Clara her affection cloaths With pure desires, which lighter fancy loaths. And to minister a Loves Powder in this poetical humour, to reconcile two distanc'd Pairs divided one from the other, for Allowance or Alimony (as the Lady seem'd to urge it, or some other discontent, privately known to herself) in the very Ladies Chamber window, who appear'd most aggriev'd, he writ these verses:  No worldly variance should divide A prudent Consort from his Bride. Each should with other joyntly share In mental joy and mutual care. No Joynture must this Juncto part, [  Sound Oeconomical Counsel. ] One Home, one Helme, one Help, one Heart. This sound advice did Plato give, So may you like Platonicks live: While every thought resolvs to love, "Dear Mates below, pure Saints above. Your affectionate Philogamist.  At vacant and retired hours; such Composures as these were his usual Recreations: neither did he make them as a Labour , but a Play , to quicken and set an edge upon his Fancy. Some intercursive passages relishing more of Pleasure then Passion would many times fall betwixt. Ismenia and Himself: but ever temper'd and allay'd with that Candor, as they ended ever with a Comical Conclusion: as may appear by those lines of reconciliation intended to Ismenia , though covertly shadowed under the Name of Mariana . [  Meaning som State discontents at that time perplexing him: but prudently carried & peaceably composed. ]  What, once again distraught!---Pray thee no more, Thou knowst my Magazen has laid in store Of Bosom-griefs : whose nightly pressures keep My Senses waking, when my Eyes would sleep. Hast thou lost all th'good Nature that thou had By adding Sorrows to a Soul so sad? Share with thy Consort ; 'twere too great a blow To suffer both in Wife and Subjects too. An unprepensed Passion is no Curse; Recall that Clause, " For better and for worse , It will injoyn thee Patience:---discreet wit Will either still a Storm or temper it. Meet me then with a Smile, to clear this wether, It shall unite us while we live together. Decad's of years in Spousal love bestow'd Should not admit acquaintance with a Cloud.

Aphorism. Antiq.  ] "Excuse me, Sir, said she; I would not touch Your gall, because I thought all had as much." Which Answer did his Patience so revive, As he became the mildest man a-live. Do so; 'twill ground a perfect harmonie Whether we Princes or Inferiours be. But to go on with the Continuation of our Story; we shall not here much need to dilate upon those Ritual Ceremonies observed at the interment of that incomparable Princess. Let it suffice, that nothing was omitted, which might properly tend to the Solemnization of those Royal Obsequies, either for magnificence of State, then which no Ceremonial more sumptuous: nor confluence of Attendance, then which none ever more populous. Neither were her Funerals accompanied with more solemnity of state, nor affluence of charge, then an universal sorrow of the whole Court: so generally was this Excellent Lady beloved and bemoaned. The sad Prince, her widdowed Consort, now deprived of so inestimable a Jewel; as became a careful Father, begun to recollect himself: and lay a provision, both for matter of Education and future preferment of those deer Pledges which were left him by his affectionate Ismenia . By whom he had two Sons; of different dispositions: For Cyrenius , the Elder was wholly addicted to the Campe: but Rosicles the younger to his Book, wherein he grew a singular Proficient. Now the fame of Cyrenius his youthful valour became so dispersed and rumor'd abroad; as many, and those of approved Judgment, were of opinion, that it abridg'd his daies: and that some neighbouring Prince emulating, or rather fearing his rising spirit and incomparable courage; practised by some inferiour Instruments (unworthy the stile of so eminent a Profession) his speedy dispatch. Though some others, quite of another opinion, (to vindicate, perchance, the repute of their Country) and that he dyed upon a Surfet of grapes taken in Natolia . But the former Opinion might appear more probable, in regard of a distastful message which this hopeful Prince, no long time before his Sickness, had sent to his Fathers Enemy: and nearly confining to his Native Country: 'That he was then bandying balls with his Racket: but it should not be long, till he had casten those Balls into another Mould: which the strongest Forts and Fortresses in his Kingdom should shortly hear of.' But touching the manner of his death, it is the safest way to suspend our judgment, being so variously descanted, and not as yet positively resolved. Let us onely conclude, great was his Fame, and premature his Fate: being One, on whom all Candy treasured their hope. Basilius being now reft in his declining years of so strong a stay and staffe to his age; took advice of the Council of his State, what Match might be held most suitable for the young Prince his Son Rosicles , the onely remainder of his Line: and Supportance of his decreasing life. Various and different were the Councils opinions in this grand Consult; but at last, like so many lines closing in one centre, they unanimously concluded; that the young Princesse of Hetruria was the suitablest Match for state, strength and corresponding alliance that could be made choice of: and to expedite this main concern (the speedy progression whereof Basilius infinitely importun'd) Silures a Court-Favorite;  & one of eminent esteem with Basilius , was designed to be his Attendant and Interpreter in his address to the Hetrurian Court. And to return you a character of this Silures ; He was of a graceful and winning deportment: of pleasing discourse and Courtly presence: though much affected to a native lightness: which he could artfully shadow (albeit the help of Moral Arts had not much enabled him) and delude the Eye of his Observer with a formal colour of pretended modesty. Which he might easily do; for though not in Books , yet sufficiently had he by his long reside and converse in Court, read in Men , how he might best please: and fall off too, with best advantage in palliating his unmanag'd affections. An excellent artifice, which he usually practised, in his Morning Sacrifice to his Glass and constant visits of attractive beauties! It is above belief with what general acceptance and princely entertain, Rosicles this vertuous Suiter was received: nay admitted to the presence of Parthenia (an unwonted freedom in that Court) and not onely so, but to enter into free parliance of Sponsal love with this incomparable Lady. Whose Princely appearance held ever such a comely distance: as it did neither promise too much forwardness, nor averseness in the Object of affection. Many daies were not past in these Love-pursuing Treaties; till the inamour'd Rosicles might raise his living hopes to a probable fruition of his desires, if Lycanthes Father to his indeared choice, would answer the fair Proposals of his aged Father with his clear assent and approvement. Which was so quickly and cheerfully seconded, as nothing was wanting to consummate their happiness (so individually were their hearts united) but those Sacred Rites, which admit all Loving Pairs a free enjoyment of what their longing thoughts so eagerly pursued. But alas; what sprinklings of bitterness intermixe themselves amidst the absolutest sweetes! You shall heare a Catastrophe unexpectly accompanying this amorous Comedy. A diversion beyond Conceipt: and beneath Fear. Which (not to perplex your thoughts with unnecessary delaies, apt to tyre your Fancy: nor fruitless digressions to surcharge your memory) befell in this manner. Silures , a Person singularly accomplish'd, as far as the Court of Candy could compleat him; being no less confident of his own abilities, then what Nature or the imbellishments of Art could confer upon him; became infinitely taken with Valeria , an incomparable beauty of the Hetrurian Court. Whom onely (being as yet in the Infancy of his affection) he attempted to make his, by amorous interbreaths, passionate sighs, with other signall arguments, legible enough to any judgment that had ever practis'd the service of a Mistress: or had read a Lecture of Love. But Valeria , a Lady no less wise then faire, knew well enough how to vye with him at that Game: and could bestow a Look, where she never ment to fixe her Love. Neither did it behove Her, to be too liberall in the throwing forth of those affectionate Lures: being married to a Gentleman of a noble Family: and beyond compare, gracious in the eye of the Court. Truth is, Rosicles could not be more hot in the pursuit of his legall addresses: then Silures was in his prohibited delights. Never was more passion shown in fewer words: nor more reall love, as it was shadowed, with more silence. This the Lady observ'd, joying much that her taking beauty, whereof her Morning-Glass had sufficiently dictated to her, should purchase her so speedy and unexpected a victory. Neither is it to be question'd, but that Eminent Ladies who know the value and attractive effects of beauty, triumph in nothing more then in this Soveraignty of love: taking usually more content in their Command, then Fruition of that Object whereto they pretend. Such was the humour of this gallant Lady; then whom none ever knew how to Court state with more becoming and unaffected Majesty: nor entertaine a Servant with more attractive reservancy. Meane time, Silures fearing that his long forbearing to deliver his devotionall affection to her; might beget in her either a Conceipt of weakness and timidity: or of coolness and indifferency in the pursuit of his Fancy;    [   Which opportunity was contrived and designed by Tripensa , a notable Court Coy-duck, not without promise of a great reward.   ] He resolv'd one day (and better opportunity could not be possibly presented him) being in a close Myrtle Arbour, where he addressed his First Encounter: And where in the best dress and dialect of love (disclaiming all further acquaintance with dull silence) He discovered the reality of a faithfull Servant in this sort. Madam, Excuse my Former silence; whereto an unexpressible affection and Zeal to your self did injoyne me: and now my boldness in this admittance of my presentment of his affectionate service, who remains wholly dedicated to your Honours disposall: holding his life in this onely happy, that it may bestow it selfe on the accomplishment of your Commands. Noble Sir; said She, you highly oblige me in this immerited Character you are pleased to bestow: neither is it in me with any equivalent Favour to regratiate you: onely know, that there is no respect confined to the limits of honour, which I shall not with much promptness re-tender you. But trust me, dear Sir, these private Addresses and shady Retirements suit not well with our Habit. And beshrow me, if I can conjecture how my Spousall innocence should be betrayed to this unexpected intercourse. How, Madam, betrayed! I hope your affectionate thoughts are far from harbouring such a sinister Conceipt. We may prove Traitors to our own surprized hearts, by too intentive fixing on such incomparable Subjects of fancy; but for you, Divine Souls , to be betray'd by your Servants, who make the pursuit of your Commands their supreme happiness; were such a Ridle, as the wisest Lover could never assoyle: nor whose violation the devoutest Flamins absolve. Such reall Servants were rare attractive Adamants, quoth she, in these impurer times; where plausive pretences weave up the webbe of a deceiving Fancy: and self-interest, or to give its proper attribute, sensuall delight, bear sway in Loves Regiment. Surely Madam, it has been your unhappy Fortune to encounter with ungratefull or indiscreet Servants upon this relation. For he deserves not the injoyment of a deserving Mistress; who to accomplish her content; would not hold the Sacrifice of his life a competent gage for such a Purchase. May you rest ever happy, answer'd Valeria , in the enjoyment of such a Mistress; that may merit the constant attendance of so deserving a Servant. Love is ever best ballanc'd with love: neither can there be any Eclipse in that Passion : where goodness may challenge an influence over affection. Nor can I be so indigent of Charity: nor hold such distance with Civility; as to hold a Stranger less in esteem then a loyall Lover. But pray Sir, ingenuously tell me, whereto these Obliging Expresses, which might work strongly upon a Subject of Frailty, may pretend! Upon no other Object then the happy Enjoyment of your self. Wherein, Sir, your Choice and my Change might make us of all others most unhappy, for I am injoy'd already. For loves sake, Madam, what Mortall so soveraignizingly commanding, or by the destinies so powerfully inabled, that has such Priviledg over your beauty, as to make of it a Monopoly? Must the Splendor of that Sun which might diffuse its beames upon the Universe , be confined to one Angle? Is Nature so prodigall to One; and so parcimonious to Others? Reflect upon your incomparable indowments, and that priority of Feature in relation to your exquisite Composure (Excellent Lady) and sure you cannot be such an Enemy to your self; as to encloister those accomplishments, which even humane Society had ordain'd to be Communicable. What do you meane by Encloistring? A Spousall Condition suits not with a Cloister; answered Valeria . But give me leave to informe your judgement better, lest you might suffer by inclining to an irrevocable Error. In your overvaluing my low abilities, you highly derogate from his Perfections to whom I owe my self. Neither can I otherwise think, but that the Clearness of your Intellect has already discovered a flaw in my Judgment; to make there my Choice, where there might be a probable desire or admittance of Change. Pray Sir, acquaint me; be your Country Ladies so apt to receive Servants: or to entertaine the pretended affection of a Forraigner without condigne Censure? Reputation, Sir, I can assure you is here in Hetruria , held an Ornament of higher value. Neither shall that word of Priority , which your rare dialect bestows upon me, beget in me a Conceipt above merit: or too credulous an attention to a personall praise, taking breath rather from volubility of dialect and Facility of tongue; then grounded effects and solidity of truth. For my part, Sir, since I first breath'd Court aire, I have ever reap'd more profit by dis-esteem then self-esteem. The one lifts us up, and transports us beyond the bounds of Reason, by presenting to our deluded Fancies, imaginary shadows of our own Conceipted Excellence; which always closeth with a dangerous Catastrophe, by inslaving our selvs to our own Fancy. Whereas a just dis-esteem of our own abilities may be properly compared to that exquisite Receipt which the wise Ulysses carefully used to decline those Siren-sugred inchantments which had miserably inveagled and surprized him, if he had not seasonably prevented those perilous Charms by Cautious Fears. Neither would I have you think, Noble Sir, but if there were in me any such priority as you pleasingly pretend, but that person who has all right and just propriety in it, should without danger of Competition solely enjoy it. This resolution of Valeria lessened the hopes of Silures in this amorous Suit: yet not so wholly discouraged him; as with this easie repulse wholly to raise his Siege: And the rather, for that he had formerly received some private Encouragemets fro such persons as had more intimate knowledge of Valeria's plyable disposition: that her native levity seconded by the delicacy of her Education could assure him of no less success, then a graceful acception and admittance to the fruition of what he sued for: if some light skirmishes and slight repulses did not amate his Spirit: nor tire his patience with delays. Neither, indeed, could Silures promise to his hopes less happiness, upon his last encounter and their departure one from the other. For she bestow'd upon him such an affectionate smile in her recede from the Arbour, as it could assure nothing less then an assurance of a further Favour: though her resolution seem'd to be of a more reluctant and unmalleable temper. Such singular art have some women attain'd in presenting smooth Looks and speaking Eyes; when their Expresses are with most nicenesse and subtiltie palliated. Mean time, her noble Consort, Versivalo ; though he had apparent grounds of suspecting much; yet his strong opinion and long Experience of her Constancy, made his clear thoughts strangers to Fear. For as she was held for beauty and bravery in all the Hetrurian Court most absolute: so her usual rejection of sundry Persons of eminent esteem had confirm'd her a Countess of incomparable Continence. All this time, Prince Rosicles no less solicitously then successively pursued his Quest. Neither was Parthenia's endeavours, to perfect their longing desires,  & ceremonially compleat what their mutual affections had already signed. Nothing unassay'd nor left unacted that might usefully conduce to the final accomplishment of this great Address. For Lycanthes Father to Parthenia , had wholly condescended to all such Proposals or Articles of Marriage as were return'd him by Silures : with other additional emoluments, manifest expressions of his entire affection to Rosicles . But honest Nuptial love was not onely here in agitation: Silures had quite forgot his Office of an Intelligencer; through the pursuit of an incontinent Lover. He prefers the purchase of Valeria , if he might have the fortune to obtain it, before any other imployment, were it never so considerable, whereto in loyalty he stood obliged. To prepare then his amorous address: and to bring his continued Motion to a fair period and conclusion; being flanker'd with sundry officious Agents; who nibling at the Bait of Reward ; the attractivest booty to servile Spirits; promised not onely their best assistance, but assur'd him of present success, if his Honour would give way to their advice. Being then not onely put on but infinitely incouraged by these officious Instruments to the re-assault of this Excellent Lady; and having presented her first with a rich Carknet (a Present intended for princely Parthenia , but deteined by Silures as a Reserve for a depraved beauty;) He labours with far more Courtly art then moral honesty or real modesty, to delineate his Passions begot of ill Principles in this manner.  Madam Valeria ; I have purchased, but from what hand I know not since our last intercourse, which shew'd a strange aversness in your affection; an hope enlivened above compare. Neither indeed could I expect ought lesse from a Lady so singularly accomplish'd: and of so sweet and resenting a temper: A structure of that Composure could not long hold out siedge to an affectionate Stranger: whose life was thrown wholly upon your Mercy: and whose highest contentment depended on your acceptance. I must freely and clearly, as becomes a devotionall Servant, informe your judgment in one particular, nearly relating to that impressive Zeal my affectionatest thoughts had tendered to your Honour. This it was that imbark'd Silures first for Hetruria ; although that great Addresse of my Princes Marriage with your Lady Parthenia carried on the designe. And never was occasion with more pleasure presented: nor more cheerfully pursued. My Personall distance from you, render'd me sufficient Experience of the infallible truth of that Maxim: "How Love divided from its Object became more violent. But my happy voyage has brought on this Conclusion: that a glad representation and fruition of so long a desired Object Cancells the date of those discontents, which a necessitated distance had formerly procured. Your subscription to time and place I shall not here commit to paper: in both these propose what may appear most suitable to your desires and preservation of honour. Meane time, accept this Token from his hand, whose heart you are already seaz'd on: and whose sole subsistence relies on the incomparable Valeria , so long as the destinies permit a Being to Silures.  This Letter and Present were with all care and speed sent to this Noble Lady: receiving them with more admiration then affection. For her pure innocent thoughts had never given harbour to the admittance of a light or licentious Suiter. Neither could she imagine by whose means or erring Suggestion this Credulous Stranger should become so confident of a Conquest; seeing their last intercourse promised nothing less. Many waies did she cast about to retreive this Secresie: and with much adoe she came to a discovery of this grand Design (a seeming Project of undermining or betraying honour) which, to avoid impertinent digressions, had been thus contrived. There was one Argiricidas , a profest Broaker in illegitimate Contracts: who understanding with what impetuous sollicitancy Silures importun'd the affection of Valeria ; pretending his intimacy with this Lady, offer'd him his service: and how he doubted not but to become a prevalent Agent in this Employment, if he pleased to transmit the Carriage of so high a Concern to his management and disposure. Argiricidas could not be more apt to ingratiate (in which art he was singular, being his Master-prize) then Love-transported Silures to entertain: grounding his belief on this mercenary Agents pretence of his known esteem in the Court: and his easie accesse and prevalency with this Lady; on whom he so infinitely doated. No Ear could be more credulously attentive to this Impostors plausive incouragements: promising him an ample reward upon his success; which with a frontless boldness he assur'd him, should every way answer his desires. Many daies were not past, till this deluding Sollicitor thirsty of the reward promised him; without ever imparting his Suit to the Lady: or remonstrance of Silures affection continued to her; he frames a Letter and directs it to this pitiful perplexed Lover in this manner.  Sir; you have heard how frequent drops will pierce the hardest stone; and I have found it true. That Breast which seem'd lately as impenetrable as a Rock of Adamant; by much working (as what meanes unassay'd that might successively operate to the issue of this designe:) becomes sensible of the Effects of love: and the apprehension of a deserving and obsequious Servant. The Conquest is got; and your way laid to arrive at the Port of your desires. This Task, I must needs confess, had it not been pursued seriously and seasonably, had irrecoverably perish'd before it had attained its maturity. But your interest made my Morning Visits and Evening attendance equally pleasing. The very last day I had access unto her, and upon this Theme took occasion to converse with her, was crowned with so cheerfull an Evening; as her gracefull complyance and assent infinitely sweetned and attempered my doubtfull endeavours: much like a wearied Traveller, who chafed with sultry heat, allays the extremity of his toyle and heat with the seasonable refreshment of a shady Arbour or coole Christall Spring. I shall not need to importune your pursuit; I know well, how your affection cannot chuse but be winged with speedy desires: having so incomparable an Object with all freedom ready to receive you: and with the choicest delights that Fancy may contrive, or an ingenious Lady devise, to entertain you. Take this, Sir, for so I accompt it, for the happiest imployment, that could be by your self commanded, or commended to the successive indeavours of Your most obliged servant Argiricidas .  A rare boldness! This Letter of Credence is received; his reward returned: and Silures with such aiery hopes strangely transported, as instead of brains, his head is wholly taken up with Chymeras. And these were the grounds of Silures confidence: wherewith the wisest man might have been deluded; much more a fantastick Lover. This it was that caus'd him to play the part of a Conceipted Secretary: and like another Ixion to be couzen'd with a Cloud. For we shall go on in a continued Maze of Errors: and in our extrication find them all highly reflecting on Silures honour. When Valeria had received that strange Letter from the hand of her Confident Lover; she knew not well what to make of it: but having found out the Author; she resolv'd to continuate this Error: and to bring Silures to the knowledge of the Estimate of a Ladies honour: and to contrive this Scene the better; she pretends love, where she meanes not to place it: and under a colourable profession, to present a Face of love, where she never intends to bestow it. Neither, indeed, could his assiduate visits and unseasonable Courtings do less then highly incense her: being a Lady of highest rank in Court: and the onely attractive Person for Majesty and Beauty. And consequently, One upon whom the Eyes of most of the Eminentest personages of honour were constantly fixed. Besides, her Husband descended from one of the flourishingst Families in all Mantua ; might justly take it as a derogation to the quality of his Person, to have so daring an intruder pressing into his Interest. These Considerable Motives quickned her Revenge, and that in such Exquisite a manner: as nothing could extend to an higher degree of severity in her: nor of more ignominy to him. And in this sort she moulds her Plot; not without her Consorts assistance, as may be probably conjectur'd, holding himself equally concern'd in this insolent attempt and insupportable affront shown them both. The Revenge, as the Story renders it, was no less expeditely acted then plotted: And to Posterity a Surviving Memoriall. The Lady Valeria resolv'd to feed him in his own humour, that his Catastrophe in the unexpected Change of the Act might appeare more heavy; suits her dissembled love in the like dress, to bring him the sooner to her Lure: and publish his shame under the vizard of love. Quick and concise was her Character, implying the impatient desires of a passionate Lover.  Trust me, Sir, such pretenders to love, as you appeare to be, (for your too prevalent lines have injoyn'd me to a Belief that your undiscerning Choice has made me the Mistress of your heart, and sole Soveraigness of your affection) such, I say, are dangerous Pioners to converse with. For in truth, we cannot challenge any propriety in our selves; so long as it is in your hand to draw the latch of our affection; which by your perswasion and over-working, becomes capable of any impression. We must then with Patience be casten in your Mould: and appear fraile vessels at the pleasure of the Moulder. I dare not say I love you; and yet, methinks, my Tongue begins to taxe me; nay, in express words tell me, that my dialect is not true. My Bosome too, which has been ever a profest Stranger to unlawfull heats; should I whisper to it a Tale of Forraigne Love; it would turne Infidel and not believe me: having ever held such distance with Passions of that quality.---But ay me! I must love, you say: and I must ingenuously confess, my Frailty, and your Fervor perplexe me a thousand waies in returne of my Answer. But the Suit is soon obtain'd, where the Petitioner may play the Commander, by challenging an influence upon the Party to whom He presents his Suit.---Go to Sir, you must play the Conquerour; but let me conjure you, by all those religious protests which you have so frequently and fervorously breathed: and with so many ceremonious attests confirmed, that you triumph not too much in your Spoile; let it be sufficient for your goodnesse to have gained the Gole, whereto the instancy of your desires aspired. Do not blemish that which your Judgment has so highly valued. That Lapidary might be justly tax'd of indiscretion or want of knowledg; who will carelesly suffer a Foile to be laid on that Gemme or Pearle which he esteemes of price: you have since your first sollicitancy set your honour at an high rate. Be equally tender of both our Fames in this relation. Let not the fruition of your desires make you too lavish in your express: nor too immoderate in your Excess of joy. These might prove two hazardous precipices to both our honours; which I am confident your discreet love will study to decline in this pursuit and injoyment of---I know not how to render it, a mutuall acquiescence of a dangerous prohibited pleasure. As you tender then the Object , to whom you pretend so high an honour, in this your affectionate Cariere, (which must be assented to, because, so prevalent a Suiter commands it) let this be your prime Endeavour. You have obliged me many ways by votive Expressions, powerfull lines and now in Tokens. To regratiate which tribute, I shall assure you Sir, by the word of honour; that SHE, whom by all likelihood you are to injoy, seeing it cannot be otherwise prevented, shall weare that Pledge of yours as an indeered Favour upon your access and private admittance to her. This is enough; could lines blush, I had not writ so much: yet if my Jealousie of intercepting these lines had not suggested to my timerous spirit fresh Feares, I had inlarged my self more. Only this; your safe conduct and arrivall to the acquisition of your desires, cannot be less then entirely wished by Your indeered Valeria .  The gladsome Receipt of this Letter so strangely surprized the deluded thoughts of our inamoured Silures ; as he found that ancient Adage true by his own Experience: Delay was bitter in the Quest of love . With winged Speed He resolves to pursue his tender'd Interest: and upon his access to her, finds her casten in a new Mould. Her deportment had made it self a stranger to niceness. No look but it retein'd a relation to love. Nothing could be delivered by him, but it did infinitly please. And to close this intercourse with a pleasing Period; time, place with all conveniencies are designed for the accomplishment of his desires: from the Expediting whereof Valeria shewed no averseness at all. When the Phebean Charriot after a long delatory progress (for so it appeared to Silures ) had finished his Course: and given way to Latona with her Sable Curtains to ore-canopy the inferiour Orbe; it was no time for this longing Amorist to foreslow his admittance to his imaginary Valeria: being made so well acquainted with his Lodging: and with what privacy, without the Conduct of any Lights, He was directed to enter the Chamber, in relation to her honour, whom he did so incomparably tender. Where He found a Bed-fellow, but of another hue, though he could not at first discover it, then he expected. But feeling the Carknet about her neck, which Valeria had writ unto him, 'Even she should weare, whom by all probability He was to enjoy; apprehending no Fallacy in it; as one satisfied with his Choice, He lay close inwreath'd in the armes of his uncouth Consort an Exposed Prostitute; a Moorish Woman, of an obscure quality, an infectious and diseased body. So as, when the Sun had display'd his burnish'd locks, his radiant splendor over the Universe: and Morpheus cloyed with a long nights slumber, had drawn aside his Curtains, that he might better discover the deformity of his Inmate; in a Furious and madding passion, as one quite distracted with that ugly Object of his loathed pleasure; Silures leaps out of his Bed, vowing revenge for this his unexemplary dishonour, if either Force or Policy could possibly contrive it. But for the present, he held no Practise more useful, nor for effecting his revenge more behoovfull; then to make it his principall design (a Practise most prejudiciall to the State of Candy ) how to dissolve that Treaty of Marriage; by cooling the affection of Prince Rosicles to his vertuous Parthenia , and to commence a difference betwixt the two States of Hetruria and Candy . This design admitted no protraction: for though he could not with all his subtile and serpentine perswasions aliene the grounded affection of Rosicles to that incomparable Lady: so deeply were those impressions fixed: yet by incendiary Letters privately and speedily transmitted to the old King; who through increase of years and decrease of constancy in adhearing to advice, became wholly led by the Councell of his Favorites: amongst whom, none more eminent, nor in higher trust then Silures . Such was the liberty of the time: and the infelicity of a State to derive their advice and assistance from those Lapwing Statists , who either would not, or could not manage those high considerable affaires so mainly conducing to the safety, peace and security of their Countrey. Now Silures , this corrupt Intelligencer, highly inflam'd with the swelling Fury of an implacable revenge, amongst other pernicious Messages meerly commenced without Colour of Truth; advertised the Councell of State, (especially such as were Feathers of his wing) what derogation it would be to the Flourishing Soveraignty of Candy to become subject to the Commands of an Inferiour State; which he had expresly collected by sundry Hetrurian braves: and those seconded by persons of the eminentst quality in all the Nation; that this alliance should make them so happy, that though they were Subjects in Hetruria ; They might by their prowess become Commanders over Candy . And to decline their joynt approvements from this Capitulation; He assur'd them more (no less ementitious then the former) how the Hetrurian Prince had already made so bold with their Prerogative Royall; nay, with the antient Crests and Signals of their Princes Family: as they blushed not to quarter his Coat: and to boast publickly, how the Constitution of our State of Candy , was raised out of ashes by the Hetrurian valour. These Relations, raked up from the Cinders of Revenge, which Silures had so lately imbosom'd, so highly incensed those inconsiderate Statists, to whom his Letters were directed, as with joint voice and vote they resolv'd to make their address to Basilius the old King, and to importune the necessity of his assent for dissolving the Treaty with the Hetrurian Prince, and for calling back his Son Rosicles , with express Command of forbearing to proceed in any such intentional way of Alliance. This was no sooner proposed by those young Statesmen; then it was readily inclined to by Basilius . Whose content rested principally in a free indulging of his aged appetite, rather then any management or address of State. It is not easie to apprehend the grief nor perplexed distemper of Rosicles upon receipt of this severe and unwelcom Message. But Silures so deeply blanched with dishonour, hastened his departure; but appeared as one wholly guiltless and unknown to the grounds of any such Command. But he could not so artfully nor subtilely colour it; but most of the eminenst Persons conversant about the Court, were acquainted with the Occasion of it: and afterwards became a Comical Argument (or a Satyrical subject rather) to the choicest and exquisitest Roscio's about the Court, both to exercise their Fancies, and actively to present them. Though the Hetrurian Prince distasting such invective Presentments, out of a native modesty and princely clemency, prohibited all such detractive Scenes, darting personally upon any ones honour, to be publickly acted. Now must we leave Parthenia bemoaning her hard fate; to be thus deserted without cause: and divided from the absolute Object of her pure affection without ground. So as she remained over-resolv'd to bid adue to the world: and to betake herself to a private Claustral life. Neither was it her purpose to alter that resolve: had not more impressive advice or a superiour Command diverted her retired course: Being afterwards espoused to a Prince of high Extraction: and singular endowments: yet would she never hear of any such motion; till she received certain intelligence of Rosicles marriage: so constantly and devotionally stood she affected. It was high time now for Silures to pack away, having run his Fame on so desperate a Shelf: as those very Foists  & Buffoons, who in an inferiour officiating way reteined to the Court, would usually point at him; and in a disgraceful manner twit him; and say: "There strutts that brave Forreigne Intelligencer, who has lately got a stroake over shinnes with a French Faggot : or a Snappe by a Neapolitan Ferret ." It is easie then to imagin with what celerity he winged his Course, to decline his shame. No time was reserv'd to take his long Farewell of his Grand Revenger Valeria nor his Moor Tripensa : from whom He had received more then he could claw off in haste: For that profest Haxter was noted for such a Mercenary Prostitute, as she was held a dangerous Inhabitant under the Torrid Zone : One, apt to infect more then a Publick Pest. Those Ladies then and dainty doxes of the Hetrurian Court, must hold him excused; for neglect of those Caresses and Civile adues; which, if all things had gone right, had been, doubtlesly, return'd with a gracefull and complementall dimension. Now, suppose these two launching forth into the Maine Ocean; where Calme Seas and prosperous gales accompanied them: being far more successive in their Passage by Sea, then Addresse by Land: lost in the One, but safely arriv'd by the clear Convoy and propitiousness of the Other. And with such assistance had Silures fortified his approach and access to the Court of Candy : as all his transactions were highly approved: his breach of the Match generally received as an incomparable Blessing to their State: instilling into vulgar Eares, who were apt to believe, what they had not the happiness to conceive; that next to the Providence of Heaven, They were to attribute the prudent and prosperous management of that great Act of State, to the cautious and circumspect Carriage of Silures , in preventing by a timely fore-sight the Conclusive Heads of that high and most Considerable Treaty. The production whereof, if once assented to, might have accelerated the ruine of Candy . Wherein some particulars were instanced, and those mainly insisted on, to beget in their Commonalty the stronger belief of the happy issue of this prevention. As first, how the Principles of Politick Government had not been onely much weakned, but quite dissolved by this Alliance: For the Forme and Method of their Soveraignty, was ever much different to the Hetrurian Posture: and so ambitious was the Nature of those People; (so they pretended) as they would not be content with the free enjoyment of their own Priviledges and Nationall Constitutions, but they must invade others Liberties; by reducing their Laws to their scantling. Neither was this all the inconvenience that might probably occur to their Flourishing State by this incommodious Alliance: For the discipline of their Church held no Consent nor harmony with them. How warily then and wisely was this prevented, e're any thing were positively concluded? These Reasons, though in an equall and judicious Skale, they might clearly appeare light and inconsiderable; they left such Impressions in the hearts of the Citizens; as they accounted of Silures for a Semi-deity ; but if they had perused his Conditions rightly, they would have found him a Light one (such as the Poets feigned their Heathen Gods to be:) but too much honour, as they thought, could not be conferred on a person of that quality; whose timely care and vigilancy had preserved their Country: by freeing them from that Juncto or Alliance, the Consequence whereof might have involv'd them in the miseries of a perpetual Slavery. These sugred pretences were those Motives, which caus'd them to receive him into the City with those Applauses and Acclamations, Bonefires, Conduits streaming with wine; Theatral Shows and Presentments both by Land and Water: with sundry Encomiastick Peans in magnifying his actions (so ignorant was the pen of the quality of his merits;) whereby it appear'd, that these deluded Plebeians ascribed more to Silures lightness: then they did to Rosicles composed and temperate Carriage. But the prevention of this insuccessiue match must make way to a new Address: For the hopes of the Kingdom being wholly treasured in the Posterity of Basilius : and Rosicles the onely top-branch of that Royall Stemme; the necessity of his Election in the Choice of a Consort, might admit no long debate. Ferrara was the Place where He was to set up his rest: and make his Choice. And this tractable Prince returns a faire and free Condescention to their definite resolve: though the memory of Parthenia's perfections, then which none more accomplish'd, retein'd in him that deep impression, as his affianc'd heart could hardly find harbour for any new affection. But on he must to this re-address, seconded by the attendance of his late Intelligencer. Who though he pretended an indisposition to health (as he might well, for the Fire was not yet quite out of the Furnace , nor his Cornelian Tub wholly removed) and by his Night-Cap, which he shadowed with the handsom pretext of an Hectick Fever; though intended to cover the Scalpe of an Adamite , left as naked as a moulted Scaledrak: with his unarmed Fingers, for they had lost their nails by fastening too eagerly upon an infectious beauty: Though he might object these Infirmities (as never better vital parts were seaz'd of more) on he must to this new Adventure: wherein, no doubt, his late misfortune would make him more tender of preserving the Constitution of his enfeebled Honour. Now to their Convoy and arrival. Their access to the Court of Hetruria was not with more state nor magnificence presented to Prince Rosicles and his noble Retinue; then it was with a Majestick kind of distance at his first coming to Court, accourted by the Prince and his daughter Irina ; with whom he was, as the State had debated it, upon his departure from Candy , to enter marriage. All the Court put on a shie countenance: nor did the Lady herself appear with less niceness, if at any time (which was rare) she took occasion to encounter Rosicles , or be in his presence. The grounds of which strangeness neither he nor his Intelligencer could at first discover; till one day an especial Favorite, one who had been formerly educated in the Court of Candy , imparted his mind with much freedom unto Rosicles ; unshadowing to him what had appeared before most intricate: and withall, that his affectionate zeal might be a-wanting in no considerable respect conducing to so fair an Address, he chalks him forth a way how he might alter the face of that strangeness in his Mistress: and possess the Court with a better opinion of him; then they had yet in their Entertaine demonstrated. His words, upon their serious Conference in the Pallace Garden, were these. Sir, I must ingenuously tell you, for I am none of these that would willingly delude you, having been formerly so much obliged to your Fathers Court for my Education; that your Highness goes the wrong way to the wood in this pursuit of your affection. The Princess of Ferrara bears a more supercilious front then to be content with the Gleanings of the compleatest Suiter in Europe . She has heard, and so has the whole Council of State, with the eminenst Persons in our Court, what a devotional Servant you have profest yourself to the Princess Parthenia in the Court of Hetruria ; where having received a dishonourable repulse, like a rejected or deserted Lover, you flie hither to supply your loss with the choice of a new Mistress. But our Ladies here be of an higher temper: and more coy by nature, to sit down with the huske, when they may have the kernel: or rest satisfied with Leavings, where they may be presented with the very first and best Fruits. Let me then advise from that intimacy of service I owe you; to make it your first Task to vindicate your honour; by making it appear to our Princess Irina , how this disperst report erroneously grounded, has highly injured you; in faming you to be rejected by Parthenia , (nor have I heard ought less;) seeing the Objects of your affection was elsewhere [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) stated: and now in its proper Centre closed: and in the acquisition of your desires happily crowned. Beget once this belief in her: and you must necessarily go on in a smooth track. Wherein the real wishes and actual offices of a Constant Servant shall ever go along with you. These incouragements highly enlivened the drooping hopes of perplexed Rosicles: who with these unexpected oppositions had nearly razed out of his remembrance the late impressive Idea of his deserted Mistress. And to put this faithful Favorites Counsel in practise; He call'd to mind a Letter formerly writ unto him by Parthenia : and amplified with various expresses of much endeerment; which he had firmly resolv'd to carry ever about him: not to that end as he afterwards employed it, but to ingrave in his memory a deeper character of her constancy. The lines were short but pithy: labouring to put Loves tongue to silence with the virgin stile of modesty.  Sir, Parthenia could say she loves you, but she dares not; lest it should put upon you that confidence that might betray her discretion, by giving way to your strength to triumph over her weakness. And yet she dares credit you: For though there be no faith to be repos'd in the face ; there is a line of Honour that cannot be crooked. Fame cannot be lyable to hazard in such a family. Your goodness has been pleased to delineate your love in sundry ample Expresses: and Parthenia can truly, though blushingly tell you, that if you knew her heart, you could not but confess how she thankfully answers you. Her onely Injunction, derived from a cordiall affection closeth in this: Appeare the same you seem, as you shall ever find in Your constant Parthenia .  This letter by his appliance to Euriola , one of her intimate Attendants, he caus'd to be scattered at the bottom of the Lobby, where she usually upon occasion repair'd to.    [   Some have taxt Rosicles for scattering this Letter: holding it a betraying of the modesty of his Mistress.   ] And what influence wrought upon his disdainfull Mistress, shall appeare by the Sequel. When his coy Irina had taken up this letter (scattered at unawares, as she imagined) and seriously perused it; as she receiv'd from one part of it satisfaction; so from the other, a conceipt of his mutability and irresolution. She remain'd satisfied by the Contents of it, that Rosicles had rather deserted Parthenia ; then Parthenia Rosicles . But she found another Flaw in it; which perplext her as much as the other pleas'd her: and that was his apparent inconstancy; in deserting a Lady so entirely his, and of deservings beyond exception; without the least ground of distaste, which brought her to this mature expostulation with her self. How now Irina ! Has time reserv'd you for no imployment; but to bestow your precious houres in perusing letters that concerne you not? Play not the wanton fly in sporting too much with the Flame of Fancy; lest your sing'd wings become a booty to Loves Fury. Ingage not your liberty to a Stranger, lest the Forfeiture bring you off with dishonour. What is Rosicles to Irina , or Irina to Rosicles? Have you none to bestow your affection on; but on such an One, as can suit his Fancy to all Objects: and pretend Faith, when he intends to colour it with the cunning artifice of Fraud? what priviledge of Exemption may you challenge above his deserted Parthenia? None could (as it well appears, and I commiserate her injuried condition) Sacrifice to Loves Altar with more fervour, nor unveil her Conjugal desires with more innocent Candor; yet must she be rejected where her affection was most individually fixed and unextinguishably fired. An excellent cautionary Lecture for an inconsiderate Lover. Desist then, and keep thine eyes within their Lodges: thy Fancy communicable to none but thine own Bosom. This will secure thee from the thraldom of a light Suiter: and return thee a freedom of enjoying thy self, incomparably more valuable then these ceremonious protests of any Complemental Lover. The whole world (if thou shouldst take thy Survey) presents but in a Land-skip, a continued counterfet Love-mask ; wherein appears variety of Faces, but they are not native nor genuine; but borrowed vizards. And, sure, if Paint be so odious a tincture to real beauty; what may we think of these adulterate Colors of painted Fancy: when we seem least that we are: and are most what we seem least?---But ay me! Tenderd love, which may be real and without any such flaw, merits no such heavy construction: nor any such Criticism. Digest then thy thoughts better: and suspend thy Judgment, till truth, the daughter of time shall discover his Carriage in that Hetrurian Suit: with all the Circumstances necessarily accompanying so main and important an addresse. Neither will this appear a Task of any such difficulty as not to be atcheived: being pursued with industry, and discreet secresie. I am confident a politick head might (if all other wayes were obstructed) plough the ground with his own Heifers: and that I hold to be the clearest and expeditest course. It were easie to gather by this pretty amorous Expostulation, how Irina for all her pretended motion or aversion from the suit of Rosicles , stood cordially affected: which she more clearly discovered by her diligent inquiry. This by the assisting means of her Gentlewoman Euriola , came in very short time to be effected. For one Philaster a person of especiall account with Rosicles , but no well wisher to Silures , professing much love to ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) This Euriola was a native Cretan : though Ferrara gave her Education.   ] Euriola , and desiring nothing more then to become her intimate Servant: entring one day into a Familiar discourse with this Mistress of his affection (for so he styled her) touching the Carriage of that great business in Hetruria ; and being very inquisitive, according to her Ladies direction, of sundry particulars, both in relation to their proceedings, and unexpected breach in the Conclusion: He fully acquainted her with their whole Progress, and occasionall division in this sort. Madam Euriola , none can more punctually satisfie your obliging Commands in this Relation then my self; which I shall do more willingly; because it may vindicate the honour of some who have the nearest interest in it: and lay the blame on those who by their irregular comportment justly deserve it. Most injuriously has our noble Prince been traduced: nay, privately tax'd, (so far as the malignancy of their report would pass for current,) of levity and inconstancy in the pursuit of his affection: And how ungratefully Parthenia's loyall Expresses were requited. But these Criminations may be wiped off with an easie Spunge: For his faire and well-compos'd demeane was royally affectionate; his Carriage modest and temperate, in no Course dis- proportionate to the Greatness of himself: desiring nothing more fervorously (and herein closed his desires most Princely) then to have that business expeditely effected, which had been so generally approved and advanced. But I must tell you, my deerest Mistress, that there was an uncleane Beast (I must freely unbosome my self to your Commands) that troubled the smooth passage of this Christalline Current. One, who should have been a principall Agent in promoting it: but [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) bemoane a Remora in our Proceedings. For that amiable thred of love, which the Prince my Master; had woven: and by a mutuall contexture brought nearly to perfection; (for no difference nor disparity appeared in their Choice:) his sensuall desires untwisted: dissolving in one day, what many weeks had contracted: and what two equally united hearts had so freely entertained. Euriola here interrupting him; earnestly besought him to know who might be the unhappy Actor of such a mischief? Excuse your Servant, Madam, replyed Philaster , I shall not much need to display him any further: his dishonour has more then sufficiently publish'd his disorder. He has been a Servant of such long continuance unto sense: as it has fortified him against all shame. In one word, this Sybarite , to give him according to his dimention a just Character; is a profest violator of honour: and to the grief of a distemper'd State be it spoken, an individuall Minion to Him who sits at the Sterne. This is the Portraiture unto life of a light Intelligencer. So, said Euriola ; now I have you. I have heard him, indeed, call'd the Catamite of our time. But Fame is apt to belie those that are in place. Howsoever, in this He shew'd himself an Instrument of unexemplary baseness. Madam, you apprehend it rightly: and if with modesty I could discover every particular, how it was projected and acted, it might make up an Annal to Posterity, and leave the Actor to a stigmatiz'd memory. Lines cannot blush; I shall in a Scedule leave to my Excellent Mistress, what I cannot returne with Freedom by way of discourse. Penns be the best Pencils, where Pictures are to be shadowed: Or the Subjects we treat of, shadowingly couched. Neither was Philaster unmindfull of his promise, for within few daies after, he returned Euriola a lively Story of Silures Folly. Which with all convenient speed she presented to her Lady. Upon perusall whereof, as the Narrative of the deluded Sensualist, being taken in his own Gin, did much delight her: so the unexpected Overtures of the two dis-appointed Lovers did much perplex her. But above all others, that strict Command of the Old King and his Councell; so peremptorily injoyning Prince Rosicles to dissolve the Treaty: and with all speed to returne to Candy . Yet her Compassion became counterpoiz'd by a late inbred affection. For being now in every particular satisfied of Rosicles gallant deportment: and that He was guiltless of what she most suspected; inconstancy in the dereliction of his Mistress, she begun to feel a glowing warmth in her own bosome, so as, what she commiserated in another, she became sensible of, in a representative view of her own Condition. These Impressions grew so firmly fixt in her virgin affections, as love, to whose Name, Nature and definition she was so lately a Novice; was now entertain'd as her nearest and dearest Consort. She disclaim'd all distance now with Rosicles ; in whose presence though she had injoyn'd her tongue a Silence; she had aspired to that perfection in her Progress of Fancy, as she had Speaking Eyes: which any Intelligible Lover, had he been never so weakly disciplin'd in the Service of a Mistress, might upon the very first reflection have easily apprehended. So as his suit will admit no long demur: His Person and abilities being so well approv'd: his Family every way corresponding to her Choice. Wisely then, lest some sinister occurrent, as she had read of before, might obstruct her intended choice; she applied herself to her Mother- Queen (for her noble victorious Father had been not long before dispatcht by a desperate Assassine    [   He was desperatly stab'd by Clariva in his Chariot.   ] ) imparting freely to her, the affection she bare to Prince Rosicles . This discreet choice of Irina's was no way distastful to her Mother; apprehending rightly how this intended match might highly conduce to the assistance of the State of Ferrara , then imbroiled in sundry Divisions both at home  & abroad: the Furie whereof, as she wisely thought, might be more seasonably composed and attempered by this useful alliance. So as upon a very short debate, being much quickned by the Queen-Mother, who might gather her Daughters heat by her own youthfull temper: a marriage betwixt these two illustrious Princes was by the Councel of State condescended to; though by a Contingency of high Consequence, Prince Rosicles was call'd home, before these Espousals could be, as was intended, personally solemnized. Which was within few weekes after Solemnly performed by Proxie : and the Lady safely transported to Verdo : and there received with all state and royall magnificence: From whence she was conducted by the Eminentst Persons of the whole Nation to Thamopolis: where she was with much joy and indeerment entertained by Rosicles . But very soon after, those Festivall Solemnities which were to accompany these Nuptialls, became upon this occasion unexpectedly abridged. The old King Basilius keeping his Court then at Sibalt ; fell sick unto death: whereof diverse reports were dispersed: and being sudden, begot more jealousies. Some were of opinion that his distemper arose from his intemperate Feeding and that his crazy and unhealthful body being not onely sated but much inflamed with luscious Fare and sweet Wines, too strong for his declining Constitution, had begot in him such hydropick humours, with other contingent infirmities, as they shortned his daies. Though Others, and some of those, Experienc'd Physitians and Philosophers, would not stick to say expresly, that this good old King died of Poyson. Which they constantly affirm'd, should manifestly appear by sundry impregnable arguments, if the State would give way to a discussion and discovery of it. And Silures , One who all his time had been an intimate Favorite to Basilius ; (and upon that score more ungratefull then Imagination may reach to,) became publickly accused and impeached before a Convene of State, as a principall Instrument of this Regicide. Which accusations, though too full of presumption, were within few daies wholly suppressed by the especiall grace and Favour of Prince Rosicles (which was strangly interpreted by many:) such was the temporary Felicity of Silures , as he became a successive Favorite to two Princes. But highly odious to all humanity, if an Agent in his death, whose immerited affection raised him to that height. But whether the grounds of his accusations were just or no, we shall not here determin. They are left to an higher scrutiny, whose judiciall eyes cannot be deluded; nor by favour disswaded; nor Feare deterred; nor reward corrupted; nor any by-respect diverted. To whose doom we leave him, to stand or fall. But to return you, by way of Digression, a strait & impartial survey of this Basilius , as we should account him a rare Lapidary, whose Cabinet stored with al variety, canot render one stone that admits a discernible flaw in it: so might we justly conclude of Old Basilius ; who, though he were enricht with sundry excellent parts suitable to his princely quality: and which, no doubt, might merit imitation by his Posterity: yet there might be discovered some unbecoming blemishes highly derogating from the Splendor of those Parts wherewith he was adorned: and Dignity of that Place whereto he was advanced. And to omit the rest, by instancing in one more remarkable then any of the rest; you may collect by what has been formerly observed of his infinite affection to Favorites, that it lessened that esteem in the opinion of his People, especially of those who sate near the Sternage of the State, which his endowments, embellished with a native humility, otherwise deserved. Now, amongst others of his Bosom-Minions, who partak't freely of his bounty (being a Person of a large heart, though a remiss Spirit) there was one Tremoses an Illirian born, and of an uncourtly demean; wholly moulded to the rude condition and Education of his Mountainous Countrey; yet of an amiable aspect, and comely personage; whom the Prince was pleased to receive principally into his favour: and to confer great honours and revenues upon him. But neither the height nor heat of his desires became so bounded. For in that Royal Court where this eminent Favorite was highly graced, it happened that one Polygama , a Lady of incomparable beauty and brave presence set her love upon him. But there was a main impediment to thwart her design: For her desires aimed at nothing more then to be married to him: which she could not lawfully do, being long before espoused to a Person of noble Extraction: and some years after personally imployed in the Senats Service. But what may not affection, be it never so illegally grounded, speedily effect, being seconded by powerful assistance; which Tremoses could not want through his reliance on Basilius . So as, though this great Favorite had been much disswaded from assenting to any such Match; especially, by [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Enthimio , his faithful Secretary; who out of his zeal and fidelitie told him expresly, that his acquiesce to that Marriage would beget him a lasting Odium with all the Peerage; besides, that it was so highly piacular, as it would admit no Dispensation: which honest counsel became fatal to the Counsellour, and no way prevalent over the wild affection of this unfortunate Lover. For no sooner had Tremoses imparted this to Polygama ; then she inflamed with the furie of Revenge, procured his speedy dispatch with a Spanish fig, by means of her Parasites and mercenarie Complices, fitting Assacinats for her Service. [  The Arch-Flamin first, with some others of the rest, jointly legitimating this Divorce. ] Neither was this all; for when this amorous Ladie could not compass her purpose any other way: she was advis'd to press a Divorce , in regard of the debilitie of Vaxedor her Husband: which she not only prosecuted eagerly, but effected succesfully; being encouraged by some Claw-back Flamins , who to gratifie Basilius in favour to his endeered Minion, returned their positive Opinions, that this Divorce was lawful and warrantable; in case of his Insufficiencie.    [   So Injuriously too were clear ingenuous spirits delt withall; as an Excellent Parnassian in those dayes, taking the modest freedom of inveying against the illegalitie of those Spousals, was sharply censured.   ] Which was accomplish'd by a cunning smooth way, or shrouded imposture; having her person changed, upon view, as was supposed, to make good the Testimonie of her virgin unpenetrated Condition. All which, this Basilius , (of so easie an inclination was he to his Favorite) with much connivence passed over: nay, not so much, as adjudging to a demerited death, (though formally pretended and judicially sentenced) those who were principal Actors in Enthimio's murder. Such was his easiness to those whom he intimately affected; as his hand was ever readie to bestow, and his over-wrought Clemencie to remit; more then either the revenues of his Exchequer would well permit: or the Equitie of their Cause deserve. Which Lenity was held by some for Pusillanimitie; whereto in very truth he was naturally inclin'd; as his posture in the presence of Strangers every where discovered. But the injuried Vaxedor became a Revenger of the wrong he had received from the Father; in accepting the Title of a Commander by the Senats vote in manning and managing those Civil Wars against his Son. The sinister issue whereof closed unexemplarily fatal. A strange but true Divination occasionally ensued, as was credibly reported, upon this unlawfull Marriage. A Person wholly unknown to Basilius , took the confidence to press into his Presence; using these expressions: O Basilius as thou hast reft an Ewe of her true Owner; So shall thy Kingdom be rent from thee . This amused Rosicles , being there present, which his Father observing; Rosicles , said He, Let not the words of a Madman trouble thee: Hee's distracted, let him pass . Only thus much let me acquaint you withall, in relation to the declining Condition of Silures being no more then what was observed by the whole State of Candy ; that after Basilius death (    [  The Imagination is apt to contrive sinister consequences from dangerous principles. ] wherein his hand was reported to be instrumentall) Silures never prospered in any designe either by Land or Sea: appearing in every action fatall to his Friends; Fortunate to his Foes: and in the end, most Tragicall to himself, being in the heat of his youth, and growth of his fame,    [  A Person of singular native parts, rare indowments, perswasive tongue, rich fancy, and graceful affability. ] by a Common Souldier, under colour of a personall injury depriv'd of life: and bereft of all those attractive Objects of sensuall love. Yet let me tell you, though this Gent. were subject to many gross infirmities, and humane frailties; such as eclips'd much from that eminence of place whereto he was advanced; and those High Offices wherewith He was invested; this Courtly Libertine was inriched with singular abilities; and such as did infinitely become him. And amongst others, give me leave to recount this as an especiall One; wherein he was ever observ'd most absolute. It had been oftimes his Fortune (an unfortunate Condition in a Martiall Commander) to fall deep in arreers with his Souldiers, but most of all with his Mariners; a dangerous Society to contest with: yet these, though in great Companies they would oftimes mutinously and in a tumultuous manner not onely inclose, but violently and with implacable Fury rush into his Lodging: upon his approch and conference with them; (such was his felicity in the Rhetoricall art of perswading) as these inraged men never departed from him unsatisfied; albeit not one penny of their long arreeres were discharged. This had been many times observed, and he infinitly admired for it. Besides, he was of a seemly complete deportment; an affable winning presence, an amiable Countenance: and gracefull in all suitable habiliments of honour: nothing, but Command of his affections, which darkned the splendor of all his actions.---   [  The tincture of one predominant vice darkneth the splendor of many eminent vertues. ] But we must now returne to our Court of Candy , where we left the Solemnities of a Princely Nuptiall contracted by the unexpected intervene of a premature Funerall. Rosicles having now succeeded Basilius : and enter'd marriage with Irina that gallant young Princess of Ferrara ; the Court begun to put on an unaccustomed State; nothing more affected, nor with more freedom embraced then an unrestrained liberty, which Rosicles easily gave way to, because he perceived his young amorous Queen to be a Person of pleasure: and to imbitter the Current of her delights with an unseasonable opposition now in the Spring and initiation of them, as he thought, would seem harsh and unsavory. But Habits are dangerous, when grounded on faulty Principles. These boundless strains of liberty broke forth into licencious issues. The Prince became a Subject to his Queens Command: and she to the pursuit of her own pleasure. A conjugall love injoyned him to obey: and a native affection to Courtly delights begot in her an easie Soveraignty to Command. Neither yet was this so absolute in her as to glory in it: nor so remiss in him, as not to countermand it. Howsoever, so taking is the bait of pleasure, as Rosicles , one naturally much addicted to Learning, of an improv'd Schollar became a Compleat Courtier: not so much out of a love that he bore to that Change, as the satisfaction of his Choice: seeing Irina would have it so. Neither were these injoyments so free, as they could be in the strictest sense construed, Blemishes to modesty. Though the age, from what distaste Heaven knows, began to grow more Censorious: and to tax their    [  A vertuous Princesse, and highly accomplish'd, injuriously traduced: and through popular hate shamefully dishonoured. ] Princess Irina , of lightness, for her familiarity with a late entertained Favorite Claridamus : whose person nor parts could not in any equal and unbias'd judgement merit the affection of such a Mistress. But set Rumor abroad and it will find wings to flie. The groundless distasts the Ilanders conceived against him and his Princess were artfully palliated, and with such subtile pretences shadowed, as an older head then Rosicles had, could scarcely discover them. The Origen or Source whereof sprung up first in a State-diet ; called at Strewmintes . Wherein upon their first Convene, (to mould their unexperienc'd Prince to their own ends) they promised to advance him in dignity, and affluence of Treasure above all his Predecessors: nay, that never any preceeded him that could match him: (which fell out most truely, as they afterwards used him.) [   Likewise from that hatred, which was conceived against him by the People, sundry Critick Prophecies were dispersed divining "How Act aeon should be worried by his own Currs:  ] With these guilded Pills, or golden pretences, meer Shadows of imaginary Greatness, suffering himself to be deluded, They conclude many Arts derogatory to his Government: and infinitely prejudicial to his Commands. And to exasperate his Subjects against his personal Soveraignty; Pasquills and Stationary Libells were every where dipersed: and frontlesly pasted on his own Gates. The Fuel of State-division being by these Incendiaries thus fomented: Civil wars began: and with such fury, as Rosicles and Irina were brought into extream Straits. The one out of her own Frontiers expulsed: the other to the hazard of an unnatural war exposed. And to instance you in One Conjecturall ground of his continued mis-fortune; then which none ever hung more heavy upon a Royall Family: Count Hadorf , a Person highly Serviceable to this distressed Prince in all his undertakings; observing his insuccessive Addresses all a-long; with what strange and incredible Overtures his Majesty became constantly incountred, made bold one day to impart his mind to Rosicles with much freedom in this manner. Sir, said this Count , may I make bold to ask your Majesty one Question? Go on, said He, my present Condition has arm'd me with that Patience (the onely Salve I find to allay the extremity of my unexemplary suffering) as there is nothing my Friend can speak, which I have not a stomack to digest. Pray then, answer'd the Count ; resolve your Servant in this. Did your Majesty never ingage nor Sacrimentally oblige your self to Parthenia , before your Espousalls with Irina ? Ay me! replyed Rosicles , herein you wound me above all my mis-fortunes. And after a troubled and abrupt Pause, as if he Had more deposited in his Heart, then He could disburden himself of by expression of Tongue . I confess to you ingenuously, said the Prince, that as none could be more indeer'd to the merits of a Religious Lady in relation to love; So none could be more indispensably ingaged in my Vows to her self: I held nothing more incomparably dear then to injoy her: nor ought striking more desperately at the Root of mine Honour, then the violation of my Protests unto her. Which Confession so perplexed the Count , as it forslowed his resolution in proceeding any further in this Quarrell. For betaking himself to a private Retire; the onely assistance He all his time after contributed to his unfortunate Soveraigne, were pious Prayers and loyall wishes: holding his breach in so high an Interest to be a dangerous Omen to his future Success. Many Fields were fought; much Civile blood shed; Families in themselves divided: Father against Son: and Sonne against Father ingaged. Nought but Fire and Fury: yet such was their Folly, as none knew well what they fought for. For Rosicles , being of a malleable and easie temper, rather inclined to the height of their demands, to his great disadvantage; without any opposition at all to the Proceedings of his Diet: concluding ever in this calme and composed manner: That all such Proceedings whereto he addressed his course, closed in this peaceable period; and confined their pursuit to this Point. The defence of the Law of the Land, Of the Liberty and Property of the Subject, regulated by that line and Rule of Justice; by which those Preceeding Princes of Candy for many Successions had mannaged and prudently governed their affaires . Nay, to imprint the deeper belief in his distasted Synod; who with light attention gave eare to his Protests, freely and in a full Assembly He invoked the Superiour Powers for witnesses (a rare and unusuall attest in Candy , a people no less nice in making their vows, then serious in performing them;) How his onely Care and Industry was to defend and protect the Liberty of the Subject, the Law of the Kingdom, His Regall just Rights, and his Honour, much more precious then life, as He affirmed. Neither was it, (as He in the presence of those Select Statists declared) in the power of any persons to encline Him to take Arms against his native Subjects, nor miserably to imbroil the Island in Civil wars: and that his Carriage all along had given sufficient evidence to the world how much his Affections had abhorred, and his heart bled at the apprehension of a Civil war . But whereto tended all this? Their previous resolution had obstructed attention. They could not Find hearts to believe: where they could find none to love. Loialty appeares ever an attentive hearer; whereas Sedition proves an indocile Scholar. Lectures of Morall discipline or legall obedience are of hard digestion to such fiery spirits. It is true; The Law is the safeguard; The Custody of all private Interests; Personall Honours, Lives, Liberties, and Estates are all in the keeping of the Law; without this, no Soveraignty; no Propriety; every man hath a like right to any thing. Yet this Law so necessarily conducing to the Conservation of all Estates is to be moulded after the Lesbian Rule : it is to be evenly squared: aptly proportion'd in so faire and equall a distance: as it neither undiametrically ascend too high; nor descend too low. For His Maxim in this is true, though it came from a dangerous Head-piece: If the Prerogative of the King overwhelme the liberty of the People, it will be turned to Tyranny; If Liberty undermine the Prerogative, it will grow into Anarchy . An even hand is ever fittest to guide the helme of a State. But it is affection that gives best Calking to the Vessel: which once lost, the Endevours of the wisest Princes fall out insuccesfully, because not entertained with a correspondent loyalty. Many waies sought unfortunate Rosicles to ingratiate himself with his own. As first, by disburdening his Subjects of those heavy Impositions that had been Formerly laid upon them. As likewise, to incourage the adventures of the Marchant; and revive Commerce, which was then at a stand; He sent forth his express Edict, That there should be a Suspension of the execution of the Pramatica's (or restraint of Commerce) untill such a Season: purposely to improve traffick, and consequently gain their affection. But Princes are brought to a great strait, when they must beg acceptance from their Subjects: and at last, lessen their Power by yielding too much. This distressed Rosicles by bitter Experience had sufficiently tasted: being disowned of his own: and deserted by those Heads (to that height was Faction grown) who by their prudent advice and loyall assistance should have supported the State: and diverted those dangerous Consequences, which soon after brought miserable rents and divisions in their Government Politick. While some stood for an Anarchical Independency; Others for a Platonick parity, One for a democratick, another for an Aristocratick: others, and those of the Popular Leaders for an Oligarchick Power. Neither was it at all to be wondred, that the Members should become thus distracted, being from their Head divided. Truth is, these distempers were imputed by the adverse party to the levity of Rosicles Councill, who (as they ballanc'd them) were too light in the Skale, to debate of any considerable designe: far apter to corrupt their Prince, then to direct him in any action tending to his honour, or improvement of the Publick. Neither, indeed, to speak ingenuously, were all his Senatours Solons ; being generally persons dedicated to pleasure, or adhearing to self-interest , an infection that soveraignizeth too domineeringly over the world. Such were these; whose small care for the Publick accelerated the ruine of that unfortunate Prince; as you shal more fully hear by our ensuing Discourse: being a Continuation of the calamitous Condition of a Princely declining Family. Private and inconsiderable differences set abroach by fiery and discontented Spirits oftimes breaks forth into fearful Combustions. Rosicles denounceth open war against the Plebeians: and the Plebeians abate him nothing: For being backt by the Synod of one side: and assisted by experienc'd Commanders on the other, they appear as ready to engage their Estates and Persons in these Civil Wars; as the Prince could be. He for his Prerogative Royal: They in defence of the Liberty and propriety of Subjects. And to strengthen them the more in these sad undertakings (for now their Fury grew implacable) they procured the Association of the Eliots , a slavish mercenary People, naturally addicted more to plunder then to fight. By whose confederacy seconded with forreign assistance far more formidable; in sundry pitcht Fields they ever put Rosicles to the worse. The grounds whereof might probably arise from two Considerable Reasons. First in relation to them; who, upon any defeat receiv'd a present Recruit by means of the Publick Treasury, which was ever ready to returne them Fresh supplies: and with those sinews of war , to re-furnish them upon all Extrems. Whereas those who took part with Rosicles , had no other pay then their own Revenues to maintaine them; which exhausted, they remained wholly destitute of any hope of future relief. Besides, as the Plebeian Forces were infinitly vigilant and cautious in all their designes: attempting nothing without mature advice, policy and discretion. Nor more happy to get a victory, then ready to make use of it. So the Princes Party was in their undertakings more rash and precipitate. Far more apt to get a victory, then to use it wisely: Nay, rather contenting themselves with a piece of a victory, without pursuing it: which redounded to their great disadvantage, in all their Proceedings. For being transported with a part of a Conquest, like Libertines more then prudent Souldiers, they would not stick to Carouse the whole night to the honour of an halfe-got victory: which oftimes became a whole One to the other Party, before the next night approch'd. Nor could it be expected but Rosicles success in such disadvantageous grounds must be answerable, seeing whatsoever he lost could no way be supplyed: but whereinsoever they suffered, was quickly recruted. Besides the difference, which appeared in the quality of their Forces. For He hazarded Gold to Gravell. The eminenst Commander for the Plebeians, after the death of Ravedox , in these Transactions, was Bellonius ; whose discription we shall here return you, as the Original renders him. He was a Person, who had more strength in his hand , then sage in his pate . Far more active then solid: having more of Ajax in him, then of Ulysses . His Lady Verona , descending from a Family stored with valour and titles of honour; discovered to the world a derivative spirit from so Heroick a linage: although in this particular she might seem to decline from those Principles of her Memorable Ancestors. Who, as they were lineally valiant, so in their Fidelity they appeared ever most constant. Whereas Verona excited her weak Consort both by Letters, with other assiduate perswasions, apt enough to work upon such an Head-piece; to these undertakings: and especially in this private Curtain-Lecture which she with much vehemency read unto him, a little before he stood ingaged upon this Service. [   Verona's perswasive Speech to Bellonius .   ] Sir; do you not observe how Rosicles under the pretext of a Soveraigne pursues the Course of a Syracusan Tyrant? do not your Eares glow with the report of his indisposed and mis-mannaged Government? Is not the Court become by the sensuall liberty of a Ferrara Lady; who courts her endeered Favorite Claridamus , as if he were her espoused Consort, a Roman Suburra? Do not our Publick Streets and Stages Eccho with Scens of their dishonour? Must the Priviledges and antient Liberties suffer: and none interpose to wipe off this scandall and indelible shame to our Nation? Sir, reflect upon your Education ; you have been bred up in Arms. You cannot embrace a Fairer occasion of reviving your practise in Arms: nor improving your honour: nor of gaining an eminent opinion with good men: nor of redressing the numerous injuries of those who have insupportably suffered: nor of regulating an effeminate Court now wholly debaucht and disordered. Let Fame then, I beseech you, and the bleeding Wounds of your Countrey awake you. The Senat and their Plebeians look upon you, as a marke of valour. On then, with these Embraces I beg it of you, and secure your Countrey to your Fame and redemption of her honour. Never shall any action appeare in more beauty, nor shine with more splendor. This perswasive Lecture delivered by a tongue that had a commanding influence over him, became so prevalent with Bellonius , as it quickly raised and roused him from a secure sleep: enlivening his thoughts with actions of an higher temper. Ambition now begun strongly to work upon him. And in the first place he considers, and with the Conceipt of it apprehends no small joy; how the Synod of Candy , and the Plebeians had made choice of him, from the singular opinion they retein'd of his valour and martial experience: How he was likewise to receive the Title of General : a stile of incomparable honour. You may suppose him then going on with all alacrity to his Charge. Where with far more Courage he enters the Field, then with discipline to manage a Camp. Though infinitely prosperous he became in all his Exploits: wonderfully hazardous in all, but inauspicious in none: as fortune usually favours (to make use of the Proverbe) those men, to whom the gifts of Nature are most sparingly imparted. Nor, indeed, for personall action could the whole State of Candy make choice of a more resolute Commander: nor one more eagerly pursuing the vading shadow of honour: Being One (to returne him his true Character) wholly for action , nothing for designe . Which prov'd well with some (and those the Principallest Instruments in that Service) who stood at distance with danger, making use of Bellonius Forwardnesse, as the Fox did of the Cats paw in the Apothegme: making bold with the help of her Foot to pull out the Chessenut from the Embers. An excellent politick way, to secure their persons from peril: and yet to share with the activest spirit in the Fame of the Conquest. On still goes Bellonius successively in all his adventures: desiring nothing more then to Cope with Actions of difficulty, which it was his happiness to atchieve prosperously, with the generall applause of the Army. And what may seem more remarkable: Though it was his use, especially in doubtfull occurrences, to appear ever in the Van: suffering no Souldier under his Command, to be more personally ingag'd then himself, nor more exposed to apparent danger: yet came He never off wounded, saving Once, in all those desperate Encounters. Having brought on this Great work of the Plebeians to such unexpected success: his Lady Verona , after a due and serious discussion of these unfortunate Brawls; begun wisely to recollect her self, with the approching Miseries of her distracted and distressed Countrey. And amidst those thoughts, falling upon a deep resentment of the Princes sad overtures, and the justness of his Cause, which she never before fully apprehended, she highly repented, that her perswasion should ever produce that injurious effect; by exciting her Husband to an undertaking so unjustifiable: and to her judgment, being now reclaim'd from her Former errour, most irregular to the Course of Justice. Upon her due recollection of these, she expostulated the Cause with her self in this sort. How now Verona ! was it not sufficient for thee to connive at those grievous indignities done to thy Prince, unfortunate Rosicles ; but thou must additionally inlarge them with thy injurious perswasions? Say Verona , did ever thy wronged Prince merit this at thine hand? Thou pretended the redress of a State: but what relief may this deluded People hope to derive from these disastrous and Tragicall Events? Has our perplexed State (then which none more happy, if it could have conceipted its own happiness) chang'd her Face for a better Complexion: or taken this strong Physick to purge her Body of crude and corrupt humours: and consequently inable or enliven her Constitution? No; it is rather to be feared; by sending forth one seditious Legion, we have redoubled the number, and brought more in. Apollo's Temple is dishonoured, Diana's impiously prophaned; their ancient Rites and Ceremonies either wholly contemned: or shamefully abused. And wereas we pretended to expulse a Tyrant; heavens grant, that this pretensive exclusion of One, introduce not a Multitude. Well, Verona ; let not the occasionall Source of these menacing mischiefs arise from thy breast. Thou hast done more then enough already; redeem this injury by appeasing the Storme. Thy tongue drew Bellonius into the Field; be it thy endeavour to call him back with thy pen. Neither did she foreslow her resolution: For without more ado, desirous to undo, what her too rash advice had induced him to undertake, with an ingenuous [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) retraction of her former incouragement to so unjust a design, she addressed her request to Bellonius being then highly ingaged in the State-service, in this manner. It must be my Taske now, Sir, to disswade you by my pen, to what I formerly perswaded you to by word of mouth. Second thoughts are ever held wisest, because grounded upon maturer advice. Your continued success, as I have collected from the Circumstances of this Cause for which you fight, may prejudice the declining Condition of a good Prince: but no way rectifie the Corruption of a distemper'd State. You ingage the safety of your Person meerly for others Interests: who make you but a Stale for their indirect ends: or a Staire to their immerited advancement. Your atcheivements be they never so prosperous, cannot appear to any judicious Eye, really glorious, when their event in all probability must close in Scens of blood, to the ruine of a flourishing State, and fearfull dissolution of all Political Order. Withdrawe then I beseech you; let not your hand beare record against you in this Fatall Catastrophe. He who fights against his Fidelity; cannot purchase any Fame with the Presentment of the Eminentst victory. Neither is it valour to fight, where Justice accompanies not the Cause. My Eyes incessantly flowing, may be impartiall Witnesses, how much I have bemoaned my indiscreet Councill. It will be some redemption to have retracted: and infinite content to your endeered Verona for you to second it. Your prowesse has got you too much Fame, receiving breath from so inglorious a Fight. Hasten then your departure from the Campe; you may believe me; I am not my self till I see you. These lines winged his course for the Country; taking first a solemn leave of the inferiour Officers and Commanders in his Army: pretending an indisposition to health: with a seeming unwillingness of deserting his Charge; if the infirmity of his body did not enjoyn him to a necessary retire. But truth is, he had so expedited the work: and by his numerous victories, so flesh'd and animated his Souldiers; as the remainder of the work might in short time be brought to perfection. For the unfortunate Rosicles , though he had some Forces of the Cavalry left him, and those full of gallantry, and spritely resolution; yet was he destitute of such accommodations an necessary Supplies as were requisite for support of an Army. Money, Magazin and Munition he was stript of; and at that time those loyal Adherents which stuck closest to him, had exhausted all their revenues in this tedious and insuccessive service. But want of means could not beget in their brave minds a defection of spirit: nor decrease of loyalty; so devotionally were they dedicated to him, amidst the roughest and sharpest Encounters of hostility. Resolving to sell their lives at as dear a rate as they could: and by their Deaths to improve their Princes quarrel as much as they might. But though affections and desires render much strength to military Forces: yet those Forces cannot appear strong; that are accompanied onely by affections. After Bellonius recede from the Army, and his private retire to the Country; (such influence had his commanding Verona over him;) he resolv'd wholly to surcease from Arms; apprehending some light resentment of what his Forwardnesse had acted in his assistance of the Synod and Plebeians against the just Proceedings of distressed Rosicles . Whose Condition by his continued success, grew daily more desperate. For though there appeared some hopes to this injuried Prince of repairing his loss in his first attempts and progression of this war; yet men, who generally ballance the goodness of the Cause by the event, observing his success, contrary to all probability of reason, to prove so sinister; the greater number begun to fall off from his assistence no less speedily, then he declined in his Fortune. True it is; though one Swallow make not Summer; yet one mans Summer makes many Swallows: as might appear by the Plebeian Party. Which (and in this observe the gratitude of vulgar spirits) though they had nearly acquired the end of their desires by the prosperous atchievments of their late retired General; yet upon dereliction of his Charge (necessitated, as he pretended, by the indisposition of his Body) they made no better account of him, then a Cashiered Souldier: all his exploits were quite forgotten; the memory of his forepast actions razed; so justly was his valour in a Service of disloyalty requited. We shall here inlarge our discourse in the relation of one Instance, and so proceed in our Story. This Bellonius having one onely Daughter, and invested in great possessions; desired much to match her with a Person of descent, merit and Family. Verona his imperious Lady, whose affections stood lately more for Rosicles then the Plebeian Party ; freely discovered her thoughts to Bellonius ; that no match could be propos'd more corresponding with Nigella their Daughters qualitie and fortune;    [   Bambuca suspected for private Intelligence. ] then one Bambuca , descended from the House of Silures that eminent Favorite. Who, though He had all along sided with Rosicles : yet upon some private, and as was supposed, unworthy service, by Intelligence or some other treacherous Office done unto the Synod, purposely to ingratiate himself with the enemy, being then grown the far stronger Party, as an Instrument to their side, though not much usefull, He was by vote recall'd from Exile whereto his Fortunes had driven him: and permitted to returne home, and for a season to enjoy his own. Now Bellonius , who opposed his Verona in nothing, easily inclined to her Proposalls. And by private Agents, powerful enough as he thought, to accomplish so equall a request, He sollicited the Councill-Board for their assent. Which he did by Verona's advice, to prevent all inconveniences. For Bambuca being reputed an Enemy to the State (though privately reconciled) it could not be held safe to enter upon any such terms with him without their approvement. Which in all reason could not seem otherwise then a feasible Condition. But so strangely was his suit sleighted; as their late ingratiated Consort, was by Command peremptorily injoyned, upon penalty of life, within such a time, to depart the Territories of Candy: and to returne to the place of his Exile; with confiscation of all his Estate to be disposed of by the Publick. So Nigella became deprived of the Object of her affection: and He by this suit exposed to a worse Condition. A faire Reward for so long and hazardous a service. Albeit, when least expected, these Articles of Marriage by Verona's instancy were not onely revived: but this Match privately solemnized; to the great disgust of the Councell of State : but especially to Climenes , who sitting at the Sterne , could not in policy relish such dangerous Allyances. But in very deed, the Plebeians little needed at that time the assistance of Bellonius ; Fortune breath'd prosperously upon their Sails. Albeit their sleighted Generall importun'd much to know the grounds of this repulse: which was soon return'd to him in these words: That the State could not hold it self secure upon their assent of so strong an allyance: especially in a time so variously fluctuant and unsetled . And this was all he could receive from them. Climenes, Lamachus , and Muratus were the onely men in esteem: and such as sat at the Sterne of the State. All which, as by the long Continuance of those Civile Wars, as they were grown eminent in the discipline of Arms, so to give them their distinct Characters, they might be properly described thus. Climenes was a person of a piercing and subtile judgement. An exact Reader and discoverer of men. Serious and solid in his discourse; familiar with few; seemingly affable to all. Much affected to Intelligence, which highly improv'd his knowledg. No less happy then speedy in dispatch. Confident in his designes: and a Constant Secretary to his own Councells. He knew well by a Cunning way of pretending to make his mouth a stranger to his heart: having ever an open embrace to his profest Foe. He had got that Tiberian , art, or rather it was innate with him, to walk in the Clouds: and to shrowd his dangerousest Projects with smoother appearances. A man hardly to be re- gain'd, being once lost: nor long to be enjoy'd, unless preciously retain'd. An infinite Obliger, if his words would ingage him: seeming bountifull, but naturally Close-fisted: so as never any pretended more by his liberality to merit a title of honour; who inlarged more the Revenues of his private Exchequer. He was ever jealous of a strange Face, as he might well: for never had any more Foes without, nor Feares within: none outwardly better arm'd against assaults: nor inwardly more naked, nor affrightfully expos'd to alarms. A religious Professor; yet no Sect whereto He would not adheere: and profess himself a Favourer. He was very suspicious of the Carriage of any Commanders, unless they were of his own Election; and to his own Family in relation. So as his own Allyes were generally design'd to the Highest Commands. His Extraction was good; but Ambition deprav'd it. No Engineer on Earth more expeditely nor experimentally artfull for acquiring his own ends. He was held in the opinion of men stout enough: and wise enough too in the heat and height of the Battell; as to tender the safety of his Honour, by a secure distancing of his Person from danger. It was usuall with him to counterfet an humble dress and express in the management of his affaires; ascribing little to himself or the prudent Conduct of his Forces by his direction: yet might you easily collect by the Series of his discourse, that the period of the Action were it never so glorious, pointed at him: Which he shadowingly sought to discover, by lessening the valour or inconsistency of the advice of such as were his Colleagues: or by some cursory digression, impe in his own personall adventure to close the issue with relation to his honour. It is to be confest by all that knew him, that none had ever more Art in deluding the apprehensions of men, by seeming to be what he was least. Yet somethings he did which undisguis'd him, by displaying him to the World, to be an eager pursuer after popular Fame: nay, that Ambition was his Minion amidst all those deceiving pretences or dazlings of humility, which he had casten before the eyes of undiscerning men. Wherein, to speak truth, his vaine-glory proclaim'd his Folly. For even in Sacred Places, where the eminenst Monuments of the ancienst and reverendst Statists were erected; he caused his own Statue to be reered: and from the very Materials of their memorable Mausolea's irreverendly raised. Which Art, as it discovered his arrogance more then all his visible appearences of humility could repair: so the erection of it tended more to his scorn, then it any way redounded to his fame. So as some in contempt of him, in their passing by it, would not stick to say, That it was great pity such a fair Lodging should want a Guest . After such time as by the splendor of his success he was grown to a more absolute Command over the State; he practised one device, which of all others was most quaint and remarkable, and it was this:    [   Proditionem s aepissime fingeret, quo effictae clementiae fuco subditum falleret. Sabel. in Decam .  ] He would usually mint treason, to beget an opinion of Clemency and Compassion in the supposed Offender: and delude the Subject with a belief of a mild and relenting temper, by remitting or mitigating the Censure of an innocent Traitor. It was his fortune ever to get the Mastery sooner over his Enemies , then over his Passions ; especially after such time as his Commands became Independent . VVhich might be instanced in this, to omit many others. Being one day made acquainted with the small store of Treasure remaining in his Exchequer: he utter'd these words in great passion, at his coming fro Samia. My Souldiers grow rich, and I poor.---Not Six pence in the Exchequer! ---Zounds---I could wish with all my heart that I might meet Rosicles, if his Waggons were well supplied with ten thousand men in the Field: I should have hope either to get mony by booty; or dye bravely . From which insatiate appetite and hydropick thirst of avarice in this Commander, Candy could not then be compared to any Creature more properly then to a Cremona Goose in Italy ; where they have a way to fatten only the Heart of the Goose; but in doing so, they weaken, and make the rest of the whole body grow lean and lank. Or to the Spleen , the growth and fulness whereof begets a decay or Consumption to the whole body. But in imitation of that Lacedemonian Agis , he took an excellent Course for calming this distemper: for to cure this fury, as if he had been stung with the Tarantula , he would forthwith call for Musick (to which Musical aires he was affectionatly devoted:) or else he would cause some little Children of his own relation; in whose Company he would so cheer himself; in riding on Cockhorse, or such like Childish Exercise: as in short time he could attemper his choler, and become his own man. Though at last his distemper grew so violent; as a Jealousie of his own safety made himself a perpetual Prisoner to himself: Guards without could not secure him, when such Legions of Fears did inwardly accompany him. This it was to command others, and to be a stranger to his own Commands. I shall not enlarge this Character any further: you may take dimension of the Eagle by his talons ; of Alcides by his Foot: and so we leave him. Now for Lamachus , he was more active then designing. One, on whose easiness Climenes wrought much for his own advance: and afterwards as meanly requited for his affectionate service. In the whole process of those Civile Imbroilments, Lamachus had ever a full share. No considerable Scene, wherein he acted not his part: and came not off with much Fame. He was of a generous winning nature: and much belov'd of the Souldery. Of whose affection and profest zeal unto him, if he had seasonably made use; he might not onely have parallel'd Climenes ; but perform'd an incomparable Office of piety and loyall duty to his distressed Soveraigne. Whose heavy condition at that time, merited more pity then it could attract Envy. And certainly his naturall disposition, had it not been mis-guided by irregular Principles, would never have fallen upon any such Extrems; being inclined to a just and loyall generosity. And surely He had the happiness to have sundry opportunities offered, if they had not been by his unhappiness neglected, of appearing an usefull Instrument for his Restauration , whom intentionally he seem'd to tender: and to commiserate his Condition, whose sad disasters had brought his unfortunate Family to that pitch of misery, as never were branches sprung from so royall a Root so dis-rent nor irreparably divided from their Originall Stemme. Which glorious action had it been timely pursued, as it was opportunely presented; it had not onely advanced but setled Lamachus in such a flowrishing and stable Condition: as it had raised its Foundation above the reach of a Corrival: or the Envy of any disloyall Malignant; to whose Censure his [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) cleanest actions became afterwards lyable. Neither is it to be doubted, but if his more apprehensive thoughts could have divined what hard measure his meriting Service was to reape from Climenes , to whom he had been so usefull and successfull a Colleague since the very first grounds of those unhappy distractions: He would have been so sensible of his present Condition and future safety: as to Crown the Evening of his actions with an Exploit of piety. Which he might have done without much difficulty, being so countenanced by the Souldery, especially at that time, when Climenes being then in pursuit of a Title which dis-relished the Army: and which all along during that tedious Tract of a Civile war He with all his Complices had seriously and solemnly dis-avowed: had begot to himself and his Allies a general Odium . This was an excellent occasion, if it had been Lamachus fortune to make use of it: for him, after a loyal reconciliation, to have united his Forces with Rosicles , and by that happy Juncto, seconded by Bellonius auxiliaries, who in a retired discontent, had a deep resentment of his own indignities; might have accomplish'd the work, redounding no less to his honour; then his reparation and restitution to whom he ought himself. But the Fates had otherwise decreed. For nothing could Rosicles design: nor in his course of Warfare undertake, which ever promis'd success; were it with never such care, vigilancy or circumspection pursued. Which we must leave to the sacred-secret Cabinet of a superiour Council; transcending far the inferiour light of our Intellect. For the ambition of Climenes in his pursuit of a Titular Regality had not onely disgusted, but wholly aliened the affections of those who were his Equals in the Field: besides other personal injuries which his uncontrouled liberty had acted: so as even Fania's honour, Lamachus his endeered Consort (a Lady of approved continence) by his too much freedom, became suspected: and by the aspersive pen of a Satyrizing Pamphleter basely traduced: yet all these Consequences (so sinister was his Fate) conduced not at all to Rosicles advantage. This Lamachus , whose Character we here render you; was not onely addicted from his youth to all generous Exercises; as Horsmanship, Artilery, Musick and the like: But by the help of Pratensis , he became an excellent Florist: in which study he used to bestow many hours, till he had attained to an exact perfection of it. VVith Papillus too, a Country Limner he consorted familiarly; by whose direction he was initiated in the pleasant Art of Delineature: wherein after his coming to Thamipolis , upon acquaintance with Perocu , and his dextrous Fancy, he became exquisite. The Exercise of these Studies brought him to the true estimate of time: holding nothing more precious, then the expence of those hours which conduced to the improvement of his Knowledge. But to these Sedentary addresses he never seriously applied his endeavors, till the heat of those wars begun to be more cool and temperate: unlesse at such spare and succidaneous Minutes, as he might bestow himself in these without dis- advantage to his higher imployments: which he ever pursued with much promptness and alacrity. He was ever observ'd to be spare in the relation of his own adventures:    [   Nulla unquam amicitia minore acquirenda est sumptu, qu am clementia. ] and had the real way, without any adulterate art, of winning affection; which he procur'd by his native affability, and usual Clemency. The only Cement , which with least Cost both knitteth and dilateth the Sinews of Amity. Lastly, for his Extraction it was good: but his actions inlarged his fame. Which had climb'd to an higher Story, had he not with Med aea taken the worser part. Now for Muratus ; to limne him to life, he was a Piece tact up in Shreads of vain glory. Yet to do the Puffin right, he did such good Service in those Parts whereto he was designed, as he became infinitely prosperous in his undertakings. This dispers'd his Fame abroad; and in short time gave him the name of Conquerour in those Places where he resided and governed. The report of his valour and successe, whether it came from the relation of his own pen, (as he was ever held for a singular Amanuensis in the publishing of his own fame) or from the hand of others, so highly transported his Lady Mazinella (a Creature of the same mould and temper in the pursuit of honour) as she grew madded with the daily report of his Victories: neither could she contain her passion, without discovery of her folly in directing her fantastick Letters to him: and venting strange Imaginary whimsies, such as her airy brain conceited of her Muratus , during his Employment in Umbria ; where he and his victorious Forces at that time lodged. And to instance One for all; we have here inserted the Copy of one; which may to life portray the fancy of this Lady.  O my Muratus , how thy daily victories over thy contemptible Foes enliven the spirits of thy Mazinella! Can thy fame fly higher then it has already? Is there any region in the universe that has not partak't of the report of thine actions? I shall infinitly taxe the Poets, my invincible Muratus , for feigning Atlas to be the Worlds Supporter, when my imaginary eye represents to my Fancy the Sinewey Shouldiers of my Herculean Muratus . Where shall not thy Statue be erected; thy Insigns displayed; thy Trophies reered; that thy memory not only in Candy , but in every Countrey may be eternized? Ay me! The world is too strait for the Circumference of thy fame. Time must find out a shriller Triton to publish the glory of thine actions. What was it to dig through Athos ; or level Isthmus : or with populous Armies to drink up maine Rivers? These, were they congested all in One, could not equall the least Enterprize of my Muratus . Be thine owne still, for none can be like thee; nor for atchievements near thee. Thou canst not conceipt with what indeered arms thy Mazinella doth inwreath thee, when she is farthest distanc'd from thee. O what Hectors may we expect arising from our Progeny; when such native valour appeares in our Family! If thou wilt believe me, my Hannibal and I was lately taken up with Hecuba's dreame: for methought I was conceiv'd of a Flaming Torch : and our Augurs here told me, that it divined a gallant victorious Birth, that should make such a fire in Crete , as all her frontier Assistants could not quench. Another night, and it was very lately, for it was since the report of thy incomparable conquest in the West, I was infinitely troubled with Mandanes vision; presenting to my conceipt a Broad-spreading Vine ove-shadowing the whole Isle of Candy with her distended branches. This I durst not impart to any: nor receive the divination of it from any: lest it might trouble the State: and beget in Climenes , who acts for an absolute Soveraignty, a private jealousie of the arising growth or aspiring of our Family. These be rare Presages, which we are to leave to Superiour Powers to ordinate. I must play the dissembler with my affections: and forbeare from calling thee home, lest my too much instancy might clip the wings of thy Fame: though I could wish thee lodged here, as well as incamped there: that I might heare thy tongue the relator of thine own actions: and amidst that rhetoricall fancy, really injoy Thy Mazinella .  The perusall of this Letter begot a thousand imaginary Conceipts in Muratus . Nor could he possibly be so successful in the Progress of his affaires; as He was swolne high with the opinion of his victories. So strongly had vaine- glory possest him; seconded with the applause of people; whose Eyes are usually so fixt on the rising Sun, as they can scarcely admit of a possibility that it should ever set. But, indeed, Muratus his native humour was such, as he affected nothing more then to be admir'd. So as, He had got a suitable Consort to feed him with the Fuell of his own Fancy. Whose pleasing lines He resolv'd to answer, not without an ample discovery of his later actions, in this manner.  How well doest thou deserve, Mazinella , to be a sharer in my acquisition of honour: with those victorious Trophies which either Time has, or Posterity may erect to my memory; who reservest such a faithfull Annal of all mine actions? Neither is it to be doubted, but that my late exploits, if they have not already come to thine Eare, will returne thee more additionall lines to inlarge thy Kalendar. There is no day wherein I raise not one Story higher in this structure of fame, which I have on so faire and firme a foundation reered. Muratus name is now grown formidable: So as, I have now made that Caesarian Impreze mine own: I come; I see; I overcome . I encounter with no Remora , where ere my adventures lead me, to frustrate my designe: or divert my Conquest. And though Honour be mine highest Object; I meet with Materials to feather my Nest. I have been lately courted to forraigne undertakings: but the Interest of Candy hanging so heavily on my shoulders ( Atlantick as thou styles them) requires my personall attendance. Neither can my successfull service (then which none ever more prosperously continued nor atchieved) expect less then a gratefull remuneration: otherwise I shall manifest it to the Highest in Command, that they have not to deal with a Person either undeserving or undiscerning. But this is the least of my feare: they dare not lose Muratus , so long as they have an Enemy in the Field. Thy Dreams divine no more then I expect. The Branches of my Military Forces have already overshadowed the face of these Coasts. Under whose umbrage they hold themselves happy that may be received. The state must find me new ground and more valiant Foes; or my prowess in the highest Carere of our actions, for want of opposition must sleep. Thou canst not make use of that gallant Land- skip in thy Garden-Gallery, where those Heroick Statues of our Antient Worthies are to life presented, but thou must necessarily reflect on thy Muratus : and conceipt him ranked in the same file. Themistocles could not sleep for the emulation he bore to Miltiades . After-ages shall find this verified in the Survey of our numerous Conquests. Which succeeding times may more easily emulate then imitate. Sundry Peeces of our Field-fights have been of late artfully drawn; but as Ã†naeas said to Dido , they want that life wherewith they were acted. Muratus could do more in an houre with his pike, then Apelles could in an age with his pencil. For the management of a Family, it is the least of my feares; such relations cannot chuse but flowrish, where the Master of the Meniey so highly inlargeth his Fame. My desires lodge with thee; while this pursuit of Honour divides me from thee. When we have vanquish'd all, and no less is nearly effected: after these Iliads of surprizes and myriads of prizes, expect the victorious returne of thy Muratus.  Thus have we heard how sociably these two Consorts suit in their humour: nothing but flashes of vaine-glory, as if Muratus had procur'd a Monopoly from the hand of Fortune (of whose mutability he was not sensible, being puff'd up with the opinion of a continued success) of Conquering wheresoever he came, and with whomsoever He was to encounter. But Mazinella , who held her Consort such a deity; nay such an indeered Minion to Fortune, as the tide should never turne. Nor the Sun-beams of his shady happiness suffer Eclipse: found by sad experience the weakness of humane Confidence: and how foolish it was, to sing a Song of Triumph before the victory. For within few daies after, Prince Rosicles having rallied some few of his scattered Forces, re- assaulted this invincible Muratus : and in a pitcht Field routed him (more by valour then number) with all his Forces. After which shameful defeat, a Messenger who had secur'd his Person by flight, winging his course for refuge towards Muratus his Mansion- house; his Lady out of her Belcone seeing this speedy Messenger, as one infinitly desirous to partake more in the report of her Consorts victories; could not with patience containe her self; but before he was well dismounted, with much confidence and alacrity of spirit, accosted him in this manner. [   Eheu! Muratus non vincit sed vincitur: Hostis Eum sequitur, non Ille Hostem. Uno die fama long aevi temporis extinguitur: Hostem in fugam non vertit, sed vertitur. Ammian .  ] Relate unto me, I beseech you, (for my desires soare with aiery wings) where is my victorious Muratus now chasing the Enemy ? To whom this amated Messenger with a dejected Count'nance, returned this Answer: No, indeed, Madam, I am to acquaint your Lady-ship much otherwise: For I can assure you , Madam, that the Enemy is chasing him . These unexpected tydings could not chuse but transforme this Lady to a teare swolne Niobe : Seeing one houre had quite obscur'd the splendor of all his preceding victories. So inconstantly had Fortune turn'd her wheele; and lay'd this great Hannibals honour in the dust: causing his Fame and Fidelity to perish both together: a just reward for his immeriting service. We shall now take occasion to discourse of some small reviving hopes in Rosicles , of regaining what his misfortunes had made his composed Spirit, apt to entertaine all adverse occurrences with a serene Countenance to beare: and the grounds of his recovery were derived from these consequent Motives. Prince Rosicles being at that time with those few dis-united Forces he had, disposed for his winter-quarter to remain at Bovado within the Confines of M aeonia : a Place for all conveniences singularly seated: as likewise the most eminent Seminary for all humane learning that the Universe could afford. Which flourishing Academy, though it had been long time begirt with a strait and impetuous Siege, yet so constantly it adhered to those Principles of Allegeance, wherein it had been ever educated, as it came off bravely, and acquitted her walls of the Enemy with much resolution and gallantry. Rosicles , I say, here residing, there came an unexpected Message from the Eliots (after they had joyned with the Ilanders against him) pretending themselvs zealous of his welfare: and to palliate their counterfet posture (to that mercenary Nation an innate humor) alledging, how they commiserated his declining Condition: and through a present resentment of his pious Sufferings, how it repented them much of what they had done; being induc'd thereto (to give a better Colour to their hateful defection) through a constant desire and united vote (or perfidious Contract , for so it might be more properly notion'd) for preserving of their known Liberties and Ceremonies of Hammon . And to publish to the world what they intended; they had with joynt consent resolved, and to Articles subscribed and signed the very next Spring to enter the Field: and in his assistance to die or live. Rosicles , though he had small cause to confide; yet his present Condition injoyn'd him to connive: and to cancell the memory of his forepast injuries with an Act of Oblivion. Fortune had taught him to bear an even Sail in the roughest storms: and to receive a reconciled Enemy with a seeming Complacency. Men, be they ranked in what quality or condition soever being reduced to those Extreams, wherein Rosicles through his sad mishap was implunged, must be glad to dispense with time: and imbrace any Instrumental means for repairing their own interests. This unexpected offer of assistance, howsoever he were cordially affected, seemingly over-joy'd him. Better a weak allyance then none: though his affiance could be but very small, where his late Experience had presented to his remembrance such apparent arguments of distrust. But the frequency of their interceedes, with the seriousness of their protests so wonne in upon him, as his disposition, being naturally flexible and plyable to any impression, begun to retaine a good Conceipt of them: and that they would by their valour (whereof they never appeared guilty redeem their disloyalty: and so by degrees through their assistance, which their protests had confirm'd unto him, recover what he had lost by the Fortune of war. But feeble is that relyance which is grounded on deceiving Principles; as you may gather by the sequel of our History: so constantly sinister appeared Fortune in her pursuit of this Princes succeeding miseries. The very next Spring, so soon as the season would afford [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Forraigne with other necessary accommodations for a military service; Rosicles removed in a private disguise, fearing the interception of his Enemies; which were in those parts plenteously quartered, and too numerous for his weak Forces to oppose; from Bovado to Nevergon ; where the Eliots , as they pretended, purposely waited for his speedy repaire. And upon his approach, with a seeming alacrity receiv'd him cheerfully: being prepar'd with men and munition, as they made their credulous Prince believe, to go on in the work; and re-estate him in his own. But a Treaty was held fitting, in the first place, to determine the quarrell by Faire Proposalls: and to decline that effusion of blood, which might necessarily be occasion'd by the sad Consequences of a New war. Which was without much sollicitancy condescended to by rhe adverse Party: knowing well, as they had subtilely wrought it, that the issue of this Treaty would conduce much to their advantage. For Climenes , who had the prime Oar in this adventure: and whose timely intelligence had sufficiently discovered to him, how those Persons with whom they were to deal, stood affected; had got the art of ploughing with Rosicles Heyfers. His Cabinet Counsel would admit no lock. Nothing so privately carried, which was not by Climenes artifice quickly discovered. Such a singular Privy-Counsellor, was he grown to from a Private Souldier. Short was this Treaty, but sharp for Rosicles . So far were these perfidious Eliots from contributing their assistance; as to their surviving ignominy, they set a price of their betrayed Prince: exposing him to the mercy of a profest Enemy. Thus became he not onely depriv'd of his Soveraignty, but restrain'd by his own from humane liberty. Study his escape he might, but acquire it he could not: for his Designs were as soon disclosed as they were thought on. In this pensive plight for some Moneths remain'd this Captive Prince: none admitted him to consort with, to whom he might impart his griefs: or by whom he might receive the least dimension of Comfort amidst the burden of such pressures. In these retired and resenting hours; He oftimes recollected himself: and as one unmindful of his own Fortunes, then which none more visibly calamitous, in a pious reflection on the heavy condition of his Exil'd Lady, he would usually vent his Passions; though he had none to commiserate them, nor with a discreet reply to allay them. O, would he often say, what an unhappy Consort is he, who makes the Innocent a Consort with him in his unhappiness! was it not enough for me to suffer all the Extreams that Fortune by the fury of perfidious hands could inflict upon me: but I must make her a Sharer in my misery, whose actions were ever full of honor and princely majesty? was this the end I brought her from Ferrara , to inslave her; and of an illustrious Princess to make her below a Subject? She might wish such a Nuptial had been converted to a Funeral. For what got she by her access to Candy , but an immerited hate, and a Name steep'd in Calumny? This gives an addition to the weight of my miseries. Since her unfortunate Choice has brought her to a disconsolate Change. And how should I, poor I, apply to her undeserving sufferings a Cure: when I cannot allay the least sting of a Cordial [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Cure in my self?---O my dear heart, how I do sympathize with thee; while others, who owe themselves unto me, take the boldness to soveraignize over me! How deplorable a thing it is to fall below ones self: and become subject to those, who in reason ought to obey! If Princes have no preeminence on Earth: sure I am, they have none in Earth: what a weak Structure then presents this Pile of Princely honour? If Diadems be stuck with thorns while we wear them; how do we feel our selves eas'd, when we are reft of them? O nothing! nothing! The ambition of Princes is such: that though these Thorns prick them, they do not feel them. But the continued progress of my misfortunes have made me more sensible of an humane condition. O, to what height had my Descent rais'd me: and to what a low descension has that deceiving height prest me! To see one Branch shred or cut off from a fair flourishing Stock , is not to be wondred at nor much bemoaned, for it may give an additional increase or nutrition to the rest. But to see the Stock it self and all those hopeful Ciens that spring from it to perish, might justly exact Compassion. Sometimes has my distressed Family appear'd plenteously stored both with fruit and flourish. Neither did my hard Fate hold it sufficient to lay an heavy hand onely on me and my succeeding Progeny: but on Her innocence, who suffers both in her Fame and Fortunes through my unhappinesse. Upon this pensive Soliloquie and passionate Expostulation, there came in suddainly a Retainer to that surly Keeper, to whose Custody he was with a strict charge committed: acquainting the Prince (then a disconsolate Prisoner) how there was a Messenger lately arriv'd from Ferrara with a Letter from his Queen, importing present dispatch, as he pretended. The Prince commanded him to be forthwith call'd in: from whose hand having received the Letter, with intimation of her health (the very first question he demanded upon the Messengers Entry) with a fervorous desire by the permission and in the hearing of his Keepers, he perus'd his Lady Irina's Letter; which he might do without exception or distaste to his strict Guard, being in Contents thus.  My dearest heart; Subjects of Concerne are strangers to me: these lines are onely made Inquisitors after thine health, the onely absolute hope now left me. I desire infinitly to know how the Eliots have borne themselves towards thee. I am very jealous of their dealing: having appear'd so perfidious from the beginning? O how often, when inveloped with the Sable Curtains of Night, confin'd to a sad Recluse of Silence and Sorrow, has thine Exil'd Irina bemoan'd the anxious Condition of thee, my deerest Rosicles ; being driven to that inextricable strait; as to relye on such weak and suspicious Meanes! I reside here, Sir, where upon my long dependence on a voluntary but necessitated Pension , such is my feare, I shall in short time grow an ungratefull Guest. Relations, be they never so neare, become onerous; when their Sojourne becomes long, and their Attendance numerous. Obligations of this nature, have been from my youth up such strangers to me; as they have appear'd to me more active then passive : Being from that Family whence I descended, more accustomed to oblige then be obliged. Be thou, my deare Heart more princely dispos'd, and more charitably opinion'd of thine Irina ; then Plebeian votes have delivered their temerary reports. These hold, that a Princess cannot keep correspondence nor a formall Familiarity with a deserving Favorite, without a touch, nay, an apparent taint of honour. Charidamus I can either keep or leave without any such irregular love. I shall never look so far below my self; as to make my Servant, my Copesmate. They who think otherwise of me, I shall with much patience suffer them to be deceiv'd; and smile at their Folly, seeing them so palpably deluded, yet I shall hardly stoop to so much lownesse, as to labour the art of undeceiving them, by removing Charidamus , whom they terme my intimate Favourite, from my attendance. Their groundlesse jealousies shall not work to my inconvenience. I know Claridamus to be just and Faithfull: and He that conceipts him to be otherwise, knows not Claridamus . We are stated here in a Nation , from whence we derive our Pension : which, though native to me, my thoughts suggest to me, it retains no Cordiall affection to you. Those numerous injuries your Predecessors have done to Ferrara ; will as yet, entertaine no Act of Oblivion. Though for the present they contribute to the maintenance of yours; their intestine hate is implacable to you. I shall not aggravate it, Time to your greatest diadvantage will discover it. Be cautious, deare soul, of thine Intelligence . The fairest pretending Face is aptest to infringe the Solemnest Juncto of Faith. This Caution highly concerns thee. Intelligencers are become State-Pioners, they digge deep, where they look for rich Ore. Seeing, my deare, thine own appeare thy Mortallst Malignants; do nothing beneath thy self. No outward Occurrent, be it never so consequent, can possibly make Man inwardly unhappy; unless the servile dejection of his mind hale him to that unfortunate Condition. It is the gloriousest Character of any Prince to entertaine the braves of Fortune with a smile: and her flatteries with a scorn. This have our Eminentst Heroes in Former times practised: and by their excellent temper become inwardly happy through their outward infelicity. But I shall little need to insist on this Subject; thy Constancy has approv'd thee, truly Princely in all thy deportment. Thou maist believe me, my bosom does nightly find a Lodging for thee, when thine own Irina is most distanc'd from thee. If more Calme Halcyon daies shine upon us, we shall appeare equall sharers: and if otherwise, let our resolution teach us to be patient Bearers. Let me have the happiness to injoy thy pen, till opportunity make me happy in the Fruition of thy Person. Lines may unite us, when at most distance. This Comfort, in her separation from all others, is yet remaining to Thine own Irina .  It is not easily to be exprest what deep resentment these lines upon their perusall wrought on the troubled affections of distressed Rosicles . Though his Condition were heavy, and in relation to his Family, most unexemplary; yet he could have wish'd that it might have been shrowded and concealed from the Eyes of the World: especially from those, to whom He stood so much indeer'd as to Irina ; who upon report of his Sufferings, could not chuse but infinitly compassionate his miseries: yet upon a more serious recollection, He held it not so fitting to keep secret from her what all neighbouring Coasts had not onely taken notice of: but would shortly, if not done already, by way of Commerce be communicated to other Forreigne Countreys: especially to Ferrara , a State, whereto the Candiots both by allyance and other necessary correspondences held free and frequent recourse. He chus'd rather then to become his own Amanuensis in the relation of his late disasters, then to have the Continuation of his perplexed Condition displayed by the Gazetta's of the time; which usually delude their Hearers either by abridging or exceeding truth in their Narrations. To prevent which obvious Errors, and to render his Irina all speedy satisfaction during his immerited durance, of his Condition and quality of his sufferings; He returned her these Lines in a brief but effectuall Summary; as none for facility nor felicity of pen, accounted more absolute, in this contracted manner. 'I shall second thy desires, my deare Irina ; but let me conjure thee, by that inviolable pledge of Sponsall love which first united us; that this reall discovery of my present condition, whereto my hard Fates by those ungratefull Instruments designing my totall ruine have forc'd me, operate not too passionately on thy tender affection. Thy Rosicles is betray'd in his trust: and remains now restrain'd by them, who were legally to derive from Him , their Previledges, Subsistence and Liberty. I should be infinitly amated with the grandeur of these pressures; if my innocence fortified me not against all Oppositions. Never was Family pretending to Greatnesse, and without colour of usurpation so justly planted; by injurious hands so violently surprized, nor impetuously seazed. My Natives they were who have made their Marchandize on me. And if protests or vows even to the Altar could have retain'd an influence upon their undertakings, or brought them to a sense of humanity; my lineall right and just assumed State had not closed in this Catastrophe. Thou advisest me, and I thank thee, for it is an advice that ariseth from a Spirit that breaths nothing but Majesty; to do nothing beneath my self : And I shall resolve thee, (to cleare thy Feares from any Act that may dart the least opinion of unworthiness in me) that my thoughts shall never stoop so low, as to purchase my liberty, or regaine a Soveraignty by aspersing the least blemish or dishonour on my Family. No (my Heart) though they have brought me as low as Earth can make me: my mind shall hold a diametrall proportion with my pristine State, though my Body cannot. It is not a Grate that can immure the Spirit of a Prince; unless he has lost himself as well as his Seat. My hopes are not yet confin'd, though my Person be. There be some good men yet breathing, who can and will distinguish the justness of a Cause: and indew'd with a generous pity, or native piety, commiserate my Condition: and from a reflection of my wrongs, derive an apprehension and serious impression of what may befall themselves. And though it be true, that it imports more happiness to be envied then pitied ; yet pity wel assisted  & amicably seconded; may bring those who were lately pitied, to be afterwards envyed by those by whom they were distressed. In the heaviest of my Extrems am I thus supported. Lower I may be in the accompt of Fortune: but nothing lighter in the Scale of Resolution. 'For those injurious aspersions thrown on thy vertuous name; let the stings of such traducing tongues never move thee; thy innocence retains a clear and integrious opinion in my brest: thou needes not attest it with vows: Those make it their endeavour (which is but washing of the Ã† thiop ) to defame thy Spousall honour, who beg attendance on the Time : and looking on the Rising-Sun , never deigne to cast an Eye upon that Great Light which the opacous shadow of their Moon has eclipsed. Thy pure breast may entertaine these Time-traduces with a Smile or a Scorne ; as thou were't pleased in thine to teach me how to receive Fortune. That were an unparallel'd beauty that could exempt its attractive quality from the reach of Censure: or a Person, who had incurr'd a Plebeian hate, for such an One to free himself from a touch of dishonour, were a Prodigy, as Time makes it, in the Course of Nature. 'I know wel (for so much his Morality taught me) that all Justice is comprehended in Innocence: and that Innocence reprehends all Injustice: thy purity then may plead thine Apology. Being pure in the Estimate of thine own, Thou art secur'd from the meldew of vulgar Fame. For what Archers be these who shoot at thine honour, but Plebeian Timists or State-Shadows : injurious Purchasers of Others rights; Profest doers of wrong and impudent detracters from others Fame. And can these impeach thy repute? 'Truth will never maintaine those who are asham'd of her. And some there be to my knowledge, and those, such as nestle under the branches of Cedars , who have palpably declin'd from the reall profession of Truth to their shame. 'As for Ferrara , my dear, though a Sacred Tye has allied me to it; yet shall I never cordially relie upon it. It is to be ingenuously confest by all, that it has receiv'd too many indignities from Candy to raze out the prints or impressures of them: But none of these were ever acted by thy Rosicles , but his Predecessors: which might attemper the quarrell in my particular: but in relation to thy Person especially, my indeered Irina ; who art enforc'd there to make thy Reside, or rather thine Exile, where thou breath'd thy first native aire: deriving thy extraction from that Heroick line, whose unequall'd prowesse highly improv'd the honour of that Nation; though they sleep now in the bed of dust. Here to partake (being necessitated thereto by thy Consorts misfortune) of usefull accommodations corresponding with thy Condition; were but a Civile hospitality in them: and no less then with princely modesty and without the notion of beholdingness (a word of too hard digestion to a gallant and dis-ingaged Spirit) thy lineall descent, to omit other relations, might justly exact. But our Fortunes will not permit us to contest either with Fate or Foe. 'If any Balm will cure us, or allay this Alloes Potion of affliction that so imbitters us; it must be a patient composure of our minds: this it is that must calm our distempers. 'I have inlarg'd my self more then I intended; but excuse it, my dear One; for methinks, every line here addressed to thee, enliveneth me in this unsociable Cell of my Restraint. Mean time, let us anchor our hopes in this, that the Superiour Powers, who reserve an influence over all our Actions, and under whose hand it is for us either to rise or fall, will afford us more chearful beams of reviving Comfort; by crowning our Cloudy day with a Clear Evening: and so re-unite us, or by a gladsome Translation impose a period to our suffering: and joyntly eternize us.' Thine own Rosicles . These were the last lines which the Princess ever receiv'd from her Captiv'd Rosicles : being so strictly guarded by Speciall Command from the Senat , as all intercourse was obstructed either by Letter or address of Friends during his restraint; so irreconcilable was this division grown betwixt this distressed Prince and his People. Yet amidst these distempers, He had ever some well-wishers left, who to their power so far as their Forces would extend to, desisted not from contributing their best assistance to his defence, with an integrious demonstrance of their loyalty. Amongst which, one ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [ ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) An Illirian of high Extraction.   ] Lycanthes pretending infinite zeal to this injuried Prince; but how he stood inwardly affected, his Cloudy and immasked thoughts knew best; levied a strong and Formidable Army: and with these puissant Forces (far more numerous then orderly managed) He invades the Territories of Candy : where with more confidence then valour or martiall prowess, He marched along, but in a posture much unsuitable to an experienc'd Souldier. For he appeared in his garish and pompous Colours (like a vaine Popinjay ) as if he had been going rather to a Morice or May-game, then any Martiall adventure; vanting all along in this his undisciplin'd Progress (for so might his march be truly styled) of an assured victory, before he faced the Enemy. Neither surely could any thing less have been expected; if such Considerable Forces had been under the conduct of a serious and successfull Leader: but as that wise Polititian well observed: Better it is to have an Army of Harts, with a Lyon to their Leader: then an Army of Lyons with an Hart to their Conducter : Such influence has a discreet and resolute Commander in the success of his Army. Which Lycanthes found true to his bitter experience. For though his Forces were singularly well prepared; yet his indiscreet confidence suffered them to be so dis-joynted and in their March so strangely distanced, as they appeared more like Forragers then Souldiers: more apt for booty then to attempt a victory: and in pillage they feathered their Nests sufficiently: making every Coast, where they so freely exercis'd their rapine and injurious plunder, their Mortall Enemie. But the Event of this Battell return'd them a demerited guerdon. For having met their Foe, whom Lycanthes so little feared; and over whom he so bravingly triumphed, before He became ingaged, They wholly discomfited him; without much resistence; to Lycanthes great dishonour, and his defeated Forces unexemplary slaughter. So as that very Place where this Victory with so small difficulty was acquired, became so purpled and with dislaughter'd Corpses so numerously and confusedly covered; at there scarce appeared sufficient purprize of ground to afford them Graves. That small remainder of them whose Fortune it was to be preserved from the edge of the Sword: were made subject to as heavy a Fate: being generally sold for Bondslaves, and at so easie and contemptible a rate: as their value might appeare conformable to their valour: their despicable price, to the estimate of their pusillanimous prowess. As for the rest of his discattered Forces, by the slow Conduct of their March, and their distance from the Battell, (having never approch'd the Face of the Enemy) they retreited back both with safety and Spoile: impoverishing the Countrey whereever they marched: returning to their penurious Homes, no less full- handed then faint-hearted. Now to give you the true Character of this Lycanthes ; though he were of eminent extraction; He was ever held to partake more of a dissolute then resolute disposition; One, who could easily dispence with his faith; infringe his promise; violate his vow: and a cunning designer, and disguiser too of his intendments for his own Interest. Yet was he never known in those designes, (were they never so subtilely couched nor carried) to appeare prosperous. Neither was it thought by Those, who held nearest correspondence with him: and ey'd his actions with the prudentst inspection, that his intention in this Expedition was clear or candid: but that he looked more upon himself, and how he might advance his own interest; then how to vindicate the injuries of his distressed Prince: who remained still a restrained person; destitute of all humane succour or assistance. But those high and inscrutable Judgments of the Superiour Power, which startleth those who are most secure and insensible of their irregular Condition, though they seem for a while to sleep, they seldom slippe: as might be instanced to life in the Tragicall Period of this unfortunate Polititian: who cut off in the height of his ambition, was enforc'd (without the attendance of many reall or cordiall Mourners) to become a Spectacle to the World, and to perform his last act upon the Scaffold: and sacrifice his projecting head on the Block. Which, though he sought by all submissive wayes and mercenary means to prevent: yet all his Contrivements could not operate to his safety. Two others of remarkable quality there were besides himself, who having received the irrevocable Sentence of death, were to die with him: which three were usually in Candy thus distinguished. One a Courtier, and no Souldier. The Second a Souldier, and no profest Courtier. The Third neither Souldier nor Courtier. Which was meant by Lycanthes ; being a person naturally surly and uncivil: and in Martiall affaires ignorant. After this great discomfiture; from whence so much was expected, and so little accomplished: the Senatual and Plebeian State continued in a flourishing peace; having no Assailants either privately to oppose them, or publickly to invade them. For the Captive Prince was secur'd; and his weak Allies deterr'd from designing, much more from acting any thing considerable to a Democratick disadvantage. During which Calm, or peaceable Cessation, the Candiots became infinitly prosperous (as their valour well merited) in sundry consequent adventures. For their Generalissimo Moccenigo burnt ten Turkish ships and fourteen Saiques; and took the Tribute of Rhodes amounting to 200000 Crowns; with the loss of 100 of his men, and 300 wounded. After which gallant exploit, he joyned with the Roman Galleys and those of Malta : and with their united Forces, invincible for their resolution, they went jointly again to the Dardanelles , to obstruct all such Vessels which carried provision to Constantinople : and were resolved (so highly were they inflam'd with the heat and pursuit of their victories) to fight the great Turkish Fleet, intending at that time to keep their Rendevous at Scio . Such noble assayes with answerable successe did these victorious Ilanders not onely attempt, but bravely to their surviving memory perform: during those short interbreaths and intermissive respirations of Civil war. Whence it may be easily collected, what memorable actions and Conquests might have been atchieved and to the succeeding glory of Candy continued; by those Heroick Spirits, whose viril veins had their blood wholly exhausted in those Civil wars. Yet during this seeming Calme and Cessation from Arms, the Synodical and Plebeian Faction were not wholly acquitted of Foes nor Fears. All stood not well-affected to that mixt and confused state of Government. For there were ever Some (and those not of the meanest quality, though their Feverish Spirits were not elevated to any publick action) who confidently expected and eagerly desired, that their new-introduced Anarchy might be suppresse,d: and Rosicles to his own restored. Others there were who stood aloof, giving aim to the Events of those times: and having their Hutches well stored: and their Nests well feathred at home, would not lose a plume to preserve their fidelity. Whereas others were casten in a purer and more refined Mould: sticking not at all publickly to manifest their Loyalty. Some whereof (and those of the eminenst, and best disciplin'd) were bestow'd in Garisons; upon neighbouring Castles, Cittadels, Forts and Fortresses, most defensive, offensive and tenable. From whence they usually made their excursions for suppliance or accommodation; whensoever any opportunity presented it self to their advantage. And I shall here take occasion to relate some pleasant Passages, varied and interwoven with much delight (as an Alloy to our more serious discourse:) which we shall return to you in a modest dress; without the least touch of levity or petulant scurrility: for such light trimming should be out of request and quite estrang'd from the native body or Contexture of an History. especially such as were younger Brothers, and had no other Fortunes but the resolution of their Spirits to rely on, who ingag'd themselvs freely in this Service. But all Pitcht Fields being now determined; they were enforced to associate and unite themselves to such as had disposed their persons, and reposed their last hopes, and fortunes with whatsoever seem'd dear unto them in Garisons. Amongst which, there was one Acolasto (neither had he his Name given him for nothing, for he was of a prodigal and profuse humour:) and could find way to spend it, if his Revenues had been rais'd to an Empire. This free-bred Spark, having now ran so far on score, as Chalk would give him no more credit; nor his Acquaintance afford him supplies or fuel to his boundlesse Expense; he takes upon him this resolution to take Sanctuary in one of those Garisons: the only Subterfuge to his exhausted Fortunes. But finding one Obstacle of maine and irremovable Consequence to his necessitated design; it was his endeavour, but all in vain, to remove it. This Acolasto had been privately contracted to an handsom young Damsel; one for beauty accounted the Pearl of her Country. Her this Prodigal youth acquaints with his intendment: and how his present impoverish'd estate, being reduc'd to a forlorn Condition, would not permit him any longer repose nor reside in those parts. But all these Objections, though perswasive enough, would not work any impression upon her youth: expresly telling him that if he fixt upon any such resolution, he should not want a Companion, for she would follow him. Though at last, on his serious protest that he would sojourn no longer then such a time as he proposed and limited to her, after much solicitancy with the shady hopes of his preferment, she consented to his request. Streight to a Garison doth Acolasto address his course; where by some assisting means he was not onely received, but admitted to an inferiour place, convenient enough for his subsistence, and conformable to the quality of his Commands. But the onely benefit he extracted from thence, was a Lecture of Temperance: for the Garison was not guilty of too much excess: in which form of discipline had this young Souldier been seasonably indoctrinated, he might have remain'd with his Panthalia , in a secure plenty, without ingagement or defiance of an unknown Enemy. The prefixt time of his returne being now arriv'd and past; and this amorous Damasella hearing nothing of him; saving onely of the Place of his aboad, but whether remov'd or no she had not heard: and becoming infinitly impatient of his delay; resolv'd to direct her course towards the Garrison, where she was inform'd Acolasto was not onely receiv'd but preferr'd. Many pregnant reasons were given her, to disswade her, from an Assay so full of danger, and prejudicial to her honour: but none of these could evince her: nor with all the pretended Feares they could object, decline her. Her resolution was pitcht; and the day of her perillous Progress immutably fixt: and that she might without discovery go on in her Journey, she took upon her a disguise much below her extraction; the habit of a Pedler ; with points and Laces about her neck: and all other accommodations suitable to so indigent a Calling. But meane had that Commodity been, which such a beauty could not put off. Along she goes thus attired; taking with her Pandione an Alliance of hers (a Maid of singular modesty and gracefull demeane) for her Attendant. With much cheerfull discourse and pleasant parlyance did these two amiable way-mates entertaine the time, and allay the difficulty of their Journey. O would Panthalia say; what, dost thou think, Pandione , that Acolasto will say, when he sees me thus habited: how doest imagin, will he receive his Pedler? I cannot, replyed Pandione conceipt the Caresses of Fancy: nor what these imaginary Conceptions of love may aspire to, being such strange Guests to my virgin bosom, as to this hour they were never there admitted. But surely the tediousness of the way, and dangers that accompanied it might to any unbyass'd judgment merit well a free and gracefull acceptance. I gather well by your alacrity, the strength and vigour of your Fancy. Labours become Pleasures, when the Object we aime at deligts us. What Obligations hast thou laid on me, answered Panthalia ; who art so willing to share with me in this Journey, without hope of partaking with me in the like Joy? You might easily injoyne me to a Taske of more difficulty, might my Service facilitate your content in any measure. But I am much afraid, said Pandione , that we have not yet past the Pikes; we have more emergent, if not imminent perills to encounter with: for we may heare how Souldiers are disperst every where; whose incivilities how might our weakness avoid, or by what meanes evade, if their unbounded and licencious Fury assault us? I have resolv'd of a Cure for that Sore, replyed Panthalia . I know well, the Habit nor Profession of Pedlers will not secure us; though it has thus far disguis'd us from our Natives. We will therefore change these Feminine Habits, to preserve our Honours: and take more virile habiliments upon us. Heavens grant, said Pandione , that I shame not my self in that shape: for I am confident, I shall never regularly nor without suspicion conforme my posture to a paire of Breeches: but I shall follow your direction: and mould my pace to your gate as well as I can. Their New-form'd Habits being accordingly provided; they went on in their address. But they had scarcely drill'd on a league or two further; till they were advertised for certaine by a Countrey Bore, that the Garrison whereto they shap'd their Course was so straitly blockt up, and on each side so beleagured, as no passage could be admitted to it, nor Egress from it. These unexpected News infinitly perplexed Panthalia : fearing much, as she might very probably conjecture, that in this pursuit after her beleagured Acolasto , she had wholly lost her labour. But being now near Night, they hastned on towards an adjoyning Village, where they were informed, they might receive convenient accommodation for their Lodging. And passing along heavily; for all their merry parliance was now converted to sad Scens; not far distant from thence; They happily incountred with an ancient Gentleman taking his Evening walk in a Field adjacent to his House. Who seeing these two late transhap'd Pilgrims; and desiring to know what way they addrest their course, Panthalia told him, that their occasion lay for the next Garrison; purposely to visit a dear and intimate Ally of theirs, and to accommodate him in those necessitous times with some competent supplies. Alas, answered the Gentleman! I am much affraid lest your Journey prove as fruitless as it has been tedious, if your Address did extend it self to any considerable distance. No less remote then Landek , being neare the utmost Confines of Candy , replyed Panthalia . Too long a tract to appear effectless. And I shall freely communicate the the grounds of my Feare unto you: for the probability of the issue I shall leave to your own Judgments, being of such neare concern to your selves. You shall know Gentlemen, that this Fort, or place of Garrison, known commonly by the name of Pontisk , were impregnable, I must confess, if the besieged had provision, but necessity must enforce them, were their Spirits never so resolute, to a speedy reddition. For it is beleagured round and with such assiduate violence assaulted, as it cannot be tenable long. Meane time, neither ingress nor regress is admitted: where if any one chance to be inconsiderately suprized; all hostility without mercy is inflicted on him. Be then advised, young Gentlemen, by One who has been sometimes reduced to the like Straits that you are brought to; decline your ingagement upon these desperate Extreams. No long time will be admitted, as the Case stands, for compleating this Siege. The exigent Condition of the Party beleagured is such, that they must either yield, and timely too, or they expose themselves to the Fury of an implacable Enemie: so small reliance or hope of mercy is to be expected from the hand of Crueltie. This passionate relation wrought so strongly on the endeered affection of Panthalia , as her eyes were resolv'd into rivolets of tears. Though she shadowed her resentment with as much art as her present condition, impal'd in the purprize or such affliction, could possibly permit. But she could not so artfully dissemble it, but this grave Gentleman quickly apprehended it, and in a generous Compassion seemingly partakt with her in it. But to minister a Cordial to these dispassionate qualmes: and allay their Sufferings, which appeared to him above expression, he proceeded in the affectionate tender of his hospitable Entertain in this manner. Young Gentlemen, said he, for your names I know not. With a modest interruption, replied Panthalia , my Name is Melicertes : and my Kinsmans Dulcippus . May you long flourish in the Splendor of your names and relations, said he; but you must excuse me, if in this commiseration of your adventures (for never could a more inopportunate time nor hazardous assay call you forth of your own Country) I return you my advice, disgustful, it may be, at the first view; because the alacrity of your youthful Spirits may be such as it will admit no impedes, but rather pursue then prevent danger. No, answer'd Panthalia ; though our desires breath into an infinite fervour of visiting so endeered a Friend: yet must we with patience give way to the extremitie of time: and with much thankfulness submit our selves and our perplext affairs to your prudent advice and direction. For our Condition rests now, as those who sail in a Pinnace ballac'd with an heavy burden, but without anchor; expos'd to storms, shelvs and every approaching danger. Let me then play your Pilot; I shall find you Sea-room at least, to secure you from an imminent peril. With all serious attention they gave ear unto him: advising them with much prudence and affability in this sort, for their present Security. It has been your fortune, Gentlemen, to come to this Grange; where you may rest confident of a free and Friendly welcom; and though not so accurate, as it may be, your qualities merit, yet not altogether unworthy your acceptance, as your Pilgrim Condition, accompanied with so many inevitable obstructions, necessitates it. I shall then injoyn you, out of a pious care to your welfare, and hospitable respect to the ingagment of your Persons, to take your Repose here with me and my Familie: till these violent and impetuous storms be over-blown. Long they cannot continue in relation to this Siege. For the beleagured Party, must either yield, and that shortly, or suffer without mercy; as hath been lately with extreme menaces imparted to them by the Enemy. With a cheerfull gratitude They entertain'd his generous Offer. In variety of discourses a part of the night was bestowed: and after a Free and liberall repast, the old Gentleman sensible of the weariness of their Journey; gave direction to his daughter ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [ ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) In an Abstract of this Romance called Lysippe . ] Aretina to accommodate them with all conveniences: and to lodge them in one of the best Rooms, suitable, as he imagin'd, to their condition; though in modesty they appear'd silent in discovery of it. By this it grew Bed-time for this ancient Gentleman; whose due observance of seasonable hours had inlarg'd his yeares with much health and fresh vigour. And having now taken his leave of these two late transhap'd Gentlewomen, with wishes to their good rest; He departed the room, recommending them to the serious care, diposure and accommodation of his daughter. Now this Aretina was his onely Child; One who had been often in the way of Marriage but ever mist it. One Remora or other still interposed the Object of her preferment. Neither were her desires cold in the pursuance of her affection. But either her Suiters Fortunes were below or above her Condition: or the freedom of her disposition sprinkled their Suit with a dis-relish: So as, she was grown now as ancient in yeares, as Fervent in her desires: and commonly distinguished in those parts by the title of the Mother of the Maids , or the Maiden-Matron ; the Vestall Virgin , or the Virgin Votaress ; or more commonly by the Prioress of Cardel . But no such religious nor abstemious a votaress, as to reject the affection of a pretending Servant: or discourage the amorous Assayes of any spritely or alacrious Gallant: being as flexible and apt to receive an impression of love: as any youthfull Lover (were his protests never such strangers to his breast) was addrest to tender it. You may easily suppose then, what a pleasing and acceptable charge this Taske was, being so seriously recommended to her by her Father. Beauty is a dangerous bait; as apt to take, if it be nibled at, as to be taken. This prov'd an attractive Object to Aretina . Who might discover in her two affectionate Guests so much native beauty; as it could not possibly actuate less then irresistible flames in the bosom of Fancy: nor become less, if not timely oppos'd, then a dangerous Incendiary to young blood. Time, we know, is precious; and Aretina weighs the estimate of every graine or minute at the highest rate, during her Custody of these two amiable Sojourners. And Panthalia , accomplish'd with no less quickness; of Fancy in apprehending; then excellence of Beauty in surprizing; to delude her inamour'd Guardian, and shadow her own disguise; exprest so much art, as she answer'd look with look: and with that amorous kind of reflection, as her smiles presented language enough; to operate this coneipt in Aretina ; that she was no less taken then her self: directing their affections mutually on one Object: so strongly did this imaginary influence act upon the enlivened thoughts of that ancient amorist. These apprehensions interwoven with other suitable discourse spinned out the night longer then these two wearied Pilgrims well desired; but these Civilities of Aretina's attendance with other obliging Treats could not mannerly permit them to discover their weariness, nor importune her departure. At last with a pleasant smile (an intelligible regret of what she meant) she took her leave, leaving them to their rest: whereof, no doubt, they partak't more fully then Aretina did: whose active thoughts had made sleep a stranger to her eyes. These two being in bed, Pandione was very inquisitive of Panthalia , what an opinion she had of Aretina ; Sleep, Girle, quoth she; Thou need'st not doubt but she would prove kind enough, if we were Consorts to correspond with her desires: neither do I think, but if she knew our Sex, which I would by no means have yet discovered, but our accommodation might appear less, and her care in relation to us, more remiss. The sable Curtains of Night were no sooner display'd: and Latona resigned her shady government; but Aurora disheviling her golden tresses awakned love-sick Aretina ; whose care solely fixt upon her Charge (the delightfull'st Task that ever her aged Father injoyned her) winged her speed to these two scarce-awakt Pilgrims; Morning Cordials, with whatsoever might most indulge the sense, could not be wanting, for Panthalia was the Idea whereon she affectionately fixt; the onely Earthly Deity to whom she offer'd, & for whom she reserved her entirest Orisons. Never was Creature upon the first interview more deluded, nor strangely surprised. All the next day, after their usual repasts, which were with far more curiositie prepared and dished then had been formerly; they bestow'd in Arbour-discourses, with other time- beguiling Recreations: and with that varietie as if she had set her whole Family a-work to entertain these Stran, gers with raritie of Inventions. For her aged Father, an ancient hospitable House-keeper had imposed a period to all secular cares, and recommended all the charge and provision of Oeconomick affairs to his Daughter, who knew well how to retain an hanke, and abridge that profuseness of bounty, if her providence had not been over-master'd by Fancy. Neither in very truth, did Panthalia , whose education had been inured to delicacy, disgust this freedom of Entertain: who, though she were ingag'd in pursuit of another Allay; yet had she ever a reserve for Sense ; which with much complacencie her desires were ever strongly bent to satisfie. When night came, they bestow'd it no less delightfully in other trifling pleasures; as in making Gooslings i'th ashes; draw gloves, Purposes, Ridles and the like: wherein Panthalia had been much vers'd: and appear'd, especially to Aretina , infinitely ingenious. Neither in these onely, but in Exercises of Poesie, to shrowd their Sexes effeminacy; they would frequently endeavour to express their pregnancy: but their Subjects were ever drawn from love in the Choice of a Mistress, of such like Fancy, which suited handsomely with Aretina's humour: and left deeper impressions in her affection. One day, (upon a prepared resolution betwixt them) Panthalia with her diamond wrote in a window of her Lodging, being directly opposite to Aretina's Entry: and from whence she usually made her Prospect to a delightfull Garden, neare adjoyning, these lines:  That wench for me, and none but shee, That's neither froward nor too free. And Pandione , to cover her self with the like vaile; being in her Election for the same Sexe, answer'd her in this sort:  That wench, I vow, Shall be my Joy, That's neither forward nor too coy. Aretina chancing next morning to read these verses, laugh'd heartily, Alas, poor Fools, quoth she! How pittifully are we weak women tax'd, to be forward, froward, coy, and what not? whereas you subtile men be those Coy-ducks that lure us to your Nouze , and then unhappily leave us. For when you have got your desires, they beget satiety, and by degrees prepare fresh fuell for new Fires. Yet, trust me, methinks Love is a pretty thing: and I could find with all my heart to love; so I might find One that would do the like. Panthalia standing at her back, presently interrupted her, saying: Why, Lady, retaine you that harsh opinion of us; as if all mankinde were adulterate mettall; and no pure bulloigne amongst us? No, replyed Aretina , I am not infected with any such Criticisme. I am confident, Melicertes , you could love, and constantly; if your Curious eye could once fixe on an Object that might like you. And the Object I could really fixe on, answer'd Panthalia , (desiring nothing more then to inwreath her still in this Labyrinth of love) is very near me. Speak cordially, Sir, have your thoughts a reall inclination to love? Do not hold me, sweet Mistress, all Cucumber : your Servant (if I may assume so meriting a title) has native vitall heat; affectionate desires inabled with active Faculties as other Creatures have. Trust me you make me put on complexion; no doubt, Sir, your Constitution retains no Symptoms of a Consumption; but promiseth more alacrity in action, then reality of affection. And yet I will not judge rashly, methinks such a Feature should partake as well of Constancy as Fancy: yes, Madam, if the Expressions of a Stranger were not accompted of as aery motions, you might find something in Melicertes to merit your good affection: seeing, as he may safely protest, your indeering Entertaine and obliging Favours have won so much ground of him; and acquir'd such Command over him; as incomparable feminine beauty was the very first that He idoliz'd, or courted for a Mistress; and that she should be the sole and absolute Object of his Choice, if it might be his happiness to deserve that acceptance, that ever he ment to espouse of her Sexe. This infinitely transported Aretina ; so as she could scarcely containe her self from sealing her free assent and acquiescence with the gage of her lips: but Pandiones hasty coming in prevented the Seal: so as no more of any amorous discourse was admitted at that time: onely muttering with her lips, (and that with much privacy, lest her fellow-traveller should partake of this secresie, and consequently impede the hopes of her approching felicity) that such a faire face Could not possibly harbour a false heart. So easily she suffered her self to be deluded with a meer Chymera of Fancy. When night came, she designed another way not onely to initiate but accomplish the pitch of her desires, which she projected in this manner, a way to prostitute her honour for the speedier injoyment of her pleasure. To expedite this, she gave especial direction that these two Guests should be lodged in several rooms: and Panthalia next her own. Which done, Aretina opportunatly suited with the darkness of Night to vail the immodesty of her address; laid hold upon that seasonable occasion, with much silence to leave her own Bed: and as one fearful to lie alone, made bold to acquaint herself with an unexpecting Bed-fellow. Panthalia betwixt sleeping and waking, imagining her to be Pandione , you keep unseasonable hours, Girle. Which words Aretina took to her self; little thinking that Pandione could pass under that notion. Meane time, Panthalia unmindfull of her new Consort, either seemingly or really appear'd, as if she had recommended her self, in a sweet repose, to Endimions lap. Thunder could scarce awake her; much less the fruitless imbraces of an intrusive Guest. Nearer and nearer did Aretina , (so much soveraignty had unbounded sence got over Reason) creep towards Panthalia ; who at last as one halfe awake us'd these words: "Pray thee Pandione lye not so neare me. Alas, sweet Soul, said Aretina ; what a strong Conceipt has the remembrance of his beleagured Friend begot in him! This Pandione , doubtless, is the same Gentleman whom they desire so much to visit. He must needs prove constant to his Mistress, appearing so faithfull to his absent Friend. Then with a low feigned voice, as one fearfull either to disturbe her quiet: or conscious of her own boldness, whispering closely, She told Her, she was not Pandione but Aretina : and that her devotional affection to him, had caus'd her to dispence with prudence and virgin continence: and that his piety would not censure this act, as an apparent argument of impudence, but intire zeal and obsequious service. Neither was it the Satisfaction of a sensual desire, but the happy fruition of his Society, that had estrang'd her from her rest. This was strange dissembling Rhetorick, deserving rather to be admir'd then believ'd: yet it might pass for current, being instill'd into her ear, who Dulcina -like, either seem'd to sleep or was asleep: while Aretina more watchful then an Hesperian Sister, continued her repose, hourly expecting a grateful requital from an hand that had no power to give it. Thus was this inamor'd Lady in all her Assays deluded; expecting more then she injoy'd: by fixing the Eye of her mis-guided fancy on an incompetible Object. By this time had Latona rendred up [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) his Comands to the Government of Phoebus . Those [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) rosack and resplendent beams, so long distanced from diffusing their glory on this inferiour Orbe; as if they had infinitly desir'd to partake of the view of so incomparable beauty as Panthalia's : (for Aretina's she could not be abitious of it) peer'd secretly through the Cranies of her Lodging: which this vigilant Aretina observing lept presently out of Bed; fearing (as such light Assaies must needs foment feares) lest Pandione or some of the domesticks might come in, and discover her unexcusable boldness. Meane time, Panthalia awaking (and whether awake before or no, it were not easie to be determined) and seeing Aretina ; she rais'd her self a little upon her pillow, using these words: You are an early Huswife , Aretina. It seemes you cannot keep your Bed for want of a Bed-fellow. It is as good, said she, for Aretina to have none, as to have a cold One. Parthenia knew well enough her meaning, but would neither discusse it nor discover it: no, nor dive too inquisitively into it, lest her temperance might be censur'd bashfullness: her modesty a naturall frigidity or imbecillity. This therefore she discreetly shadowed: so as, though she well perceived that Aretina shewed a Countenance more averse from her, then she had formerly done; yet this abated nothing of her cheerfulness; pretending infinite affection to her: and upon occasion wantonly disporting with her: as if more virile heat appeared in her; then her approvement could apprehend. Yet it pleas'd her not a little; to observe with what a seemly and amorous dalliance Panthalia exprest her affectionate Zeal to Aretina ; which made her confident of a future contentment with more freedom: so irresistibly had these aery influences wrought upon her: ingaging her to sundry dispassionate encounters, and permitting no opportunity to pass by her, that might suitably correspond with her desires, or more clearly accelerate them. And no doubt, some new dialogue of love had been really mov'd by the One, and no less faignedly approved by the Other; had not Pandione come suddenly in and prevented this re-encounter. At whose entrance, Aretina hastned down from Pathalia's Chamber; letting a paper drop from her as she left the Room, but so apparently as Panthalia , to whom it was shadowingly addressed, could not chuse but take notice of it: the lines were these.  The purest Ornament of Continence, If opportunity give way to sence By entring Combat may receive a foile, Yet such a Staine is but a native soile: You know my meaning:---let the closing Night Combine two Lovers in a joynt delight. Be same you seem, SIR; Nature will admire That th' Weaker should be stronger in desire. Panthalia taking up the Paper Pandione desir'd much to partake of the Content of it; being perswaded, by sundry Symptoms which she discovered, and by which she gathered, that Aretina's infirmity stood in need of some soveraigne Love-potion: and that no Physitian, were his art never so exact, could perfect the Cure, but that eye which gave the wound: and that the onely Weapon-salve to allay her distemper was in Panthalia's power, though her modesty would make no discovery of it. But though Pandione was very importunate for perusing those lines; yet Panthalia would by no meanes communicate them unto her. Onely she told her, that one day, if their Journey produc'd a cheerfull issue; those very lines which she so much desir'd to peruse, would afford them an excellent Scene of mirth; but as then she would not disclose it. But your Countenance, answer'd Pandione , is such a legible Index , as one may apprehend it it without an Interpreter. Go to, Madam; I pitty the poor deluded Girle; that she can find no other Object to suit her affection; but such an one as must necessarily deceive her straid hopes in their Fruition. How strangely thou talkst, said Panthalia ! Must her free and hospitable Entertaine be interpreted Love? Much Civility, I must confess, there is in it: and a generous resentment of our Condition: but this is not to bear the Notion of sensuall love, or any other indispos'd affection. Not only Aretina , but her whole Family has laid many Obligations on us both, for their numerous Favours so amply contributed in our greatest Extreams. Whereof I shall ever reteine a gratefull record: as for any other obligements or relations, they derive their suppositious grounds onely from the help of your Invention, Pandione . I shall not demeane my self so unmannerly as to become a busie Inquisitor, where I may not without disgust appeare a partaker. But give me leave to enjoy my own confidence: and make my thoughts their own Secretaries: Such light and merry-conceipted Loves as these, if such there be; may be entertain'd with indifference, and continued without prejudice. Such Issues will not lay a Charge on the Parish where they are nurs'd: nor cause the Parents to bemoane their hard Fate, in bringing forth an untimely birth. Trust me, thou art a shrewd Girle, answered Panhalia : but lest my wench should long for what she cannot partake: and consequently incur a malady through my too much secrecy; especially, seeing these innocent Love-sallies (as thou termst them) are not onely to be entertain'd but discoursed of with such indifferency, as their relation can infer no prejudice; lend me thine attention; or if thou lovest to be an Interpreter of thine own Jealousies, peruse these scattered lines,  & from them draw the line of her distempers. Pandione laughing heartily at the perusall of the paper; Trust me, said she, I perceive feminine beauty becomes very dangerous in a Masculine shape. It seemes, Madam, if you either want Fortunes or a Mistress, you might be sufficiently supplied with both. But pray you resolve me, what receipt hold you convenient to apply to this inamour'd Creature to recover her inthralled senses (for I conceipt her to be infinitly distracted:) for trust me, it is far above my Cure. Let that be the least of thy care; answered Panthalia ; she is not so deeply distempered, but she may be timely recovered. If the Tarantula or Calenture may be capable of cure; this discomposure in Aretina cannot be without hope of recovery. It is but a deception of sense, the worst you can make of it: and such a deluded Fancy (hold it if thou please for a Phrency) cannot make Art a Fool, by despairing of a remedy. Well; said Pandione , I shall wish your application may produce good effect. But I could not chuse but suspect something more then ordinary, when our Lodgings were so strangely divided: and no apparent necessity to induce it. But my comfort was, the issue of such blind love could not prove less then innocent, howsoever her intendments were designed. Bare hopes were the greatest birth she could conceive with, or your affectionate embraces procure. Well, replyed Panthalia , I am sorry that any scattered looks should fall from me, to work this effect: but her present cure shall be my constant care. At this very instant came in the old Gentleman her Father, which occasionally broke off their further discourse: for doubtlesly had he been made privy to it; the story would not have relished well to his pallat: hearing his daughter so pittifully deluded, and his civile Hospitality so ungratefully requited. Now the News which this Gent. brought was of such consequence, as the communicating of them might well produce a twofold effect, joy and fear; which may appeare by these Circumstances grounded upon his own relation, which He no less seriously then discreetly delivered in this manner. Gentlemen, I am made acquainted this Morning by infallible Intelligence; and such as you may relie on: That this Castle, whereto you intended to address your Course, is now upon Capitulation to be yielded up, after so long Siege stoutly continued, and maintained: and now upon no less honourable terms rendred. Three days are onely assigned to the Party beleagured to acquit the Fort, and to depart, after that time limited, with Colours displayed and ordinary arms, and in their march to be so conducted by the Enemy to the next Garison (which they have already made choice of) as no violence nor incivility shall be done them, but secured, according to the Law of Arms, from all hostility. The former part of this relation sounded with a cheerfull accent in the Ear of Panthalia : but the latter was accompanied with jealousies and Fears. She delighted much to hear of the reddition of the Castle; hoping by that means to come to the injoyment of Acolasto : but hearing of their remove to another Garison, she raised to her troubled thoughts just occasion of Fear: conjecturing, that he would march along in that remove: and out of his youthful heat, wherewith he had been infinitely transported, become wholly forgetful of his former obligements; which to prevent, she thought it fit to expedite her address: rendring first a fair acknowledgment to the Gentleman for his free and liberal entertainment during their repose with him: resolving withall, to go on with their adventure the next morning by time, if there intercurred no apparent Obstacle to impede it. And with much conveniency for this design; upon the Gentlemans departure from her Lodging, Aretina came opportunately in, fruitlesly expecting what her desires pursued: upon whose approch, Panthalia in a pensive and contristate manner (as one much perplexed with the late message) accoasted her in this sort. Madam, we have now received intelligence by your Fathers relation; that we shall very shortly acquit your noble Family of two troublesome Guests. A grateful acknowledgment for your numerous Civilities is all the retribution that can be expected for the present from our estrang'd condition: which shall leave a deep impression, with a constant intendment of a future gratification, whensoever an happy opportunity of requital may present it self. Upon this hint, giving a private hint to Pandione , to withdraw; she proceeded in this manner: Your many immerited Favours contributed to me, Lady, have obliged me perpetually to be your Servant: but to undeceave you in one particular, I hold it a civil duty, for otherwise I should fall into deep arreers upon the score of your approved affection. The Paper which you lately scattered, dictated to my thoughts an unexpected Conceipt of your favour, nay fervour of love towards me. But whence derived I could not easily discover: For if from beauty (as I was never Narcissus -like opinion'd of it) I should with Sputimius , have rather disfigured it, then suffer it to be an occasion of such dangerous and discomposed effects. But your discretion will, no doubt, quickly order these distempers by recollecting your self, and rectifying those mistakes which begot these easie errors. In reply to your lines, I made bold, Madam to return a paper, and to fix it in your Chamber window: which if you have not already partak't, you may be pleased to peruse. It will amply render you my condition, portraiture and constitution. What I am, and in what capacity I may be yours: The Draught will discover, what my hand cannot so mannerly deliver. Aretina with pace no less accelerate, then heart affectionate hastened towards the paper, promising, as she conceipted, such satisfaction, as her desires could inlarge themselves no higher: which she found exprest in these lines:  Ixion was deluded by a Cloud, So laureat Daphne from Apollo slipt, So Danae , so Semele sought to shroud Their Virgin beauties:---If our fancies dipt Deep into such Chymera's; let's remove Such aery phantasies, and leave to love. You love me well, and so I wish you should, Although I cannot answer your desire, For she you love is of another mould Then to effect what your affects require. Where if your erring fancy run a-shelf, Blame not Panthalia's beauty but your self. I am not same I seem; for if I were, I should not Acolasto thus pursue; Fix then your fancy in a proper Sphear; Since I partake no more of Man then you. For this disguised Habit was put on To shield mine honour, which I stand upon. 'Leave then this Love, which having once given o're, That Maiden lives not, who shall love you more.' The Contents of these lines begot in Aretina more admiration then dis- affection. She, who before pursued Panthalia , as a Conjugal Lover; begins now to imbrace her as a natural Sister. Her mistakes she onely labours to apologize: which is no sooner modestly pressed, then it is freely granted. Though her Sex seem to be changed: Aretina reteins an affectionate bosom for her; ready to contribute in any measure wherein she may gratifie her, whom so lately in a virile habit she did so intimately tender. These friendly Offers, and unexpected Offices suited fitly with Panthalia's occasions; which induced her to return this Civil regreet, as an ingenuous agnition of her continued respect; which she infinitely fear'd, might receive a Check upon the Change of her Shape. Madam, I see well, no habit nor shape can alter the form nor impressive figure of your love. Your free and hospitable entertain has already obliged us highly: and now at our farwell, it is your pleasure to inlarge your goodness higher: and to ingage us to your Civilities deeper. I must ingenuously acquaint you with my resolves: and in these relie upon your assistance. I am now after a long and tedious Journey to complete my address. I heare by your Fathers relation, how this Garrison here adjoyning is to be dissolved: the Castle rendred: and Acolasto amongst many others to be removed: and in other places of Fortification disposed, as for conveniencie they shall make choice on. Now my jealousie is great (from that interest I have in Acolasto ) lest these occurrencies should make him forget, what his former vows and solemn protests oblige him to perform. My resolution then is to resume my own habit, and appeare the same Panthalia that I am: but a Place of retirement is my desire: and this so near the Garrison, as I may address a message to Acolasto : wherein I purpose to inform him with the place of my reside: with my expectance of his returne. But the conveniencie and contiguity of this Place are equally requisite: wherein I shall wholly relie upon your advice and direction. Ladie Panthalia , said she, for now I know your Name; there is no affectionate office wherein I shall appeare defective, so it may be usefull or accommodate to your vertuous designes: and shall hold my self infinitly happy in expediting them. In the first place then, I shall be serviceable to you both in preparing you habits according to your desire, And for your Place of retire, there is a Recluse not half a league distant from the Garison, where you may securely reside, till you have dispatcht your address. Of what Condition is that Recluse, said Panthalia ? It is a Monastery or Votary, replyed Aretina , dedicated to Delia . Where many of our Sexe are usually received: and after their time of Probation, united to their Society or Sisterhood. Nor need you to feare of a faire and friendly Entertaine, for they are Persons infinitly Civile: especially to all such as pretend honour to the Patroness of their Society. Shortly after, these two being singularly well accommodated both for habit and other necessaries by the especiall care and provision of Aretina ; having first taken a solemn and gratefull leave of the Old Gentleman: and return'd some tokens as testimonies of their thankfulness, to his Family; by Aretina's affectionate Conduct, they were brought on their way, till they came to a faire Prospective Hill, not far distant from the House where those Delian Votaresses were bestowed. And there Aretina left them; but not without teares, you may well suppose, so acceptable was their Society; as to be deprived of it, appeared to her more bitter then death it self. Having entred the Votary, they were entertain'd with all Civility by an antient Matron, the Governess of that Family, or rather Prioress of that Society. by whom they were led into a beautifull Chappell; curiously adorn'd with sundry exquisite Statues, emblematizing Diana and her Nimphs : which were so to life portrayed, as nothing could work more impressively upon the imagination of the Spectator. The Pillers of the Temple were of Porphyrite Marble. The Monuments erected within, were of Jacinth, Topaz, or Rock-Pearle; whereon were ingraven diverse Epitaphs, expressing much elegancy of Conceipt, to perpetuate the memory of those Sisters of that Society there interred. After the Survey of these; Panthalia seeming desirous to know what Priviledges or Immunities were anciently conferred on their Society; the Governess related to her at large with what antiquity in many successions they had been continued; by whom conferred: and with what care preserved. Which done, that it might appeare to these Strangers, that she would not be a-wanting in any Civile Office, tending to the satisfaction of their desires or improvement of their knowledge; She return'd her an exact Catalogue, in the nature of a Concordance, containing the Rites and Ceremonies solemnly used in their Society: As also after what manner the Sisters of that Family,  & dedicated to Delia , were received into their House. You do passing well, Reverend Votaress, said Panthalia , in making me acquainted with the Customs, Orders and Ceremonies of your Society; who after some time of Probation, may probably become One of your Family. Neither would it be any derogation to you, daughter, replyed the Governess, to incorporate your self in our Fellowship: seeing sundry eminent persons; even some who descended lineally from the loyns of Princes, have dis-valued their stiles of honour; laid their diadems aside: and confin'd themselves within these walls. May I, Sister, be so happy as partake of the knowledge of your Nation and Extraction? I am nationally a Candiot , answered Panthalia : and now on my address to an affectionate Ally here remaining in your Garison. May you prosper in your designs, replied the Governess. But the report of your Nation puts me in mind of a sad relation, which I have oftimes heard spoke of in these parts: and it was of the heavy and calamitous Condition of a Prince of that Country: how disloyally he was deserted by his own: and afterwards restrained of his Liberty; which his distressed Princess no sooner received notice of, then she relinquished the world: encloister'd herself; making a singular vertue of necessity; in partaking more absolute felicity in her enjoyment of an inward then outward liberty. Whence I collect, how in the extreamest Encounters of Fortune, this private retirement within a Cloister, may afford that which the whole world cannot minister. It is true, Reverend Matron, said Panthalia ; when her exiled Condition was most imbittered with gusts of affliction; it was her use to bestow her seriousest hours upon devotion: But for a Cloister'd life, which you are pleased to commend so much, her affection never stood for that long. Though in relation to her safety, she might seem to pretend to that kind of privacy: For her disposition was naturally otherwise biassed: having her Education so much dedicated to youth: as her maturer years had ever a reserve for the like freedom. Though this might be truely said of her, that no Princess injoy'd more pleasure with a constant regard to her honour. It has been much wondred at, replied the Governess, how her Husband, never deservingly censured for any predominant vice, should so precipitously fall from such an height of Command, into so deep a gulph of misery: seeing his equal temper of Government was such; as his facility could neither accuse him of too much remisseness: nor his severity of too much roughness. It was an heavy Fate for him to suffer, being endow'd with so princely temper. It has been ever the unhappy condition of most Countries, and with grief I speak it, particularly of mine own, said Panthalia ; when fulness of Fortune, fatned by a long continuance of peace, has begot in them a surfet, never to be content when they were well. This have our Natives of Candy sufficient experience of. For though they enjoyed plenty in a full measure; yet grew they weary of their Condition. Either did their Soveraign displease pretending that he did Lord it too much over them: or that his Council was corrupt or viciously affected: or their Laws and Liberties too much abridged: or their Impositions so heavy as not to be supported: you have heard the Fable of the Froggs . They itched after a new Commander, which at last they got; but repented them of their Change. Secure we were from Foes without, and Foes within: but innovating our State, we became subject to both. Never was Government so distracted, being before so orderly setled: and harmoniously disposed. For to enumerate those three blessings; which make every State in its Constitution truly happy: and in others winters, to retein a fair complexion and flourishing beauty; to wit, Commodity, Liberty and Tranquillity : none could be more amply blest in the plenary possession nor full fruition of all these. For the first, none more rich within, nor more improv'd by Commodious traffick abroad. Our general peace, being in league with all, calm'd our Seas: making us lyable to the fear of none. Gladly did Forreign Nations commerce with us; ready to furnish us with what we wanted: as our Coast was in affording them Supplies of what they needed: yea, to repeat that elegant Observation of our Native Bard.  Candy for rich Supplies was such an one, All stood in need of her, and she of none. Secondly, for Liberty none more amply inlarg'd. Their Priviledges enjoy'd without restraint. No Servitude nor Vassalage permitted in so free a Nation. The Subject had an absolute propriety in his own. No incroaching hand without due Censure durst pretend to his interest. Men might safely without feare of a mercenary Informer communicate their thoughts: and exhibite their Complaints if any indignities were done them in relation to their Fame Fortunes or Persons. No tongue could admit a priviledge to traduce: neither could Greatness become such a Subterfuge to Guiltiness, as to give it an impunity to offend. Neither were our Laws such Spider-webbs, as to give way to great Ones to break out, and to Little Ones to keep in: Being so equally ballanced, as neither price, prayer nor power could pervert them. Such was their free and impartiall dispensation of Justice. Which neighbouring Countreys (so hard it was to observe these rare Presidents) were more apt to admire then imitate: to approve, then improve their practise by them. Lastly, for Tranquillity ; neither publick nor private Estate could possibly flowrish with more security. No Forraigne Powers to invade: no indigent Persons at home, to purloine. No Court-Parasite, nor State-Minion was admitted to prefer an injurious suit: if it imported an unjust challenge, or an illegal request; the Solliciter was to undergo a Mulct: or recceive a personal Censure. Neither could the fury of an Enemy ingage their security: for there was neither Guard nor Garison, vnless there were one upon the Princes Person: and that with such reservancy, as if the regality of his Place had not exacted it; he could well have dispenst with it. It seems Candy , said the Governess, became seaz'd of a violent Phrency. A constitution so distemper'd, requir'd a continued Purge. Bodies Politick being so full of vicious humors cannot be long healthful. It is most true, replied Panthalia : and you collect rightly the indisposition of Candy . It was a deep Surfet that first begot in my Country this infirmity. A Surfet of peace, which caus'd her to be more remiss in the prudent managment of her State. For so long as we had Foes abroad; we could be content to love our Friends at home: but when our Coast became clear of Foes, we begun to make Foes of our Friends. We thought the yoak of one Soveraign too heavy. And in stead of one, we are now under the Subjection of many. Here One assumes to himself the Prerogative; while others in Competition, having equally born the heat of the day, repine at his ambition. These recollect with themselvs the dangers they have past: and how their valour and martial service were of as high Concern in the accomplishment of the work; as he who sits at the Stern, and attributes the honour of the day solely to his own undertaking. Which would, no doubt, beget infinite number of fractions in a State so weakly setled; if the wise and cautious carriage of Climenes ; who from a private Souldier had rais'd himself to an absolute Commander, had not made up those breaches, which a distracted State had produc'd: wherein he declared himself a singular Artizan in the successful pursuit of his own aspiring interest, as he prov'd that Maxim infallibly good: "A designing head was to be prefer'd before a number of active hands." For though the imployments of others, in this mutation of Government, had been no less distructive to Rosicles Forces then Climenes: yet it was ever his good Fortune to make use of a victory, and to instill this opinion into his Souldiers (who, indeed, became wholly his) that his discreet Commands were the onely ground of their successe: and the rest, meer Ciphers or Shadows made to follow him, and consequently directed by his Light. This he carried so smoothly, as even those who were his Complices could not with all their ingenuity discover it. For he had got into the art of insinuating into their affections, and with a formality of hugging them, wheresoever he encountred them. Nor was this all; for there was no person being of his relation, but he sought privately to advance to one Place of Command or other: so as in very short time, all considerable Offices were solely conferred upon those in whom he might confide, and become his powerful Assistants, in case of opposition. Thus did his policy act for his future security. Has your distressed Prince, demanded the Governess, hope of no Forreign succours to relieve him? This, methinks, much concerns neighbouring States to reflect on. Such deposing Presidents dart fearfully on other Princes. Much has been expected, but weakly seconded; replied Panthalia ; Such Princes as might probably contribute their assistance, are at odds amongst themselvs: which distractions fall out sinisterly to his advantage. Besides, Those, on whom by affinity or alliance he might in reason most depend on, in a joynt association to the adverse Party; professe themselvs his mortal Foes: which sprung, indeed, from some unhappy Incendiaries of his own: but the revenge falls heavy on his enfeebled Party. Onely some scattered Forces there remain of his own; as may appear by their unsuccessive Attempts: for their exploits conduce weakly to his interest: and no wonder, being so destitute of the sinews of war; as they want necessary Supplies for their own relief. But I shall tire you with the continuation of these sad occurrences, which few States can parallel. I shall now return to my own address. Wherein, reverend Matron, though a stranger to you and your vertuous Society, I must presume of your assistance. No Stranger, of what quality soever, makes recourse to our Cell, answered the Governess, whom by the Rules and Constitutions of our Order, we are not bound to assist. Piety were useless, were it not communicative. Relate your occasions, and our best advice shall not be awanting. Panthalia incouraged with the free tender of such obliging Courtesies, imparted to her amply what her desires were; being onely in effect, to procure her a faithful Messenger for delivery of a Letter to an affectionate Ally of hers, called Acolasto : of whose safety she desir'd much to be satisfied, with some other particulars of Concern, without the least hint of any nearer intimacy or relation to him: which she purposely conceal'd for some private respects best known to herself. The curteous Matron wish'd her to prepare her Letter, and according to her direction, it should be carefully delivered. Taking hold upon this opportunity, she wrote to Acolasto in this manner.  SIR, I verily believe that your Rules in martiall discipline have estrang'd you from the Rules of loyall affection. Vows and Protests since you became a Souldier, have got a dispensation in the heart of a Lover. But know Sir, though women be of the weaker Sexe, which implies their imbecillity; they have so much sense, as to be capable of an injury. You will say, perchance, this is but a shadowing of Fancy: and that my long Journey argued an individuall retention of affection. Pray; Sir, suffer not your self to be deceived: I can with as much ease dispence with that small interest of love betwixt us, as I can put off my habit. Our Contract is not so firm, but I may as freely dispence with it, as you with your Faith. A Field-Bed may suit well with a Martiall mould: But such a repose would not relish well with Panthalia's mind. Your Profession proclaims your valour: may it redound to your honour; so as Panthalia , your unexemplarily wronged Panthalia , may be henceforth to you and your actions an everlasting stranger. I have suffered enough; I meane not to be so unpittifull to my self, as to inlarge sufferings with fresh feares or inconstant Fancies. You may believe me, Sir, I have taken a long leave of love: it is my onely grief that ever I imbosom'd it; but it is not my Fortune alone. It has been the fate of many kind hearts, to open their bosome to a Viper, before they knew its nature. If ever I give Entertaine to such an unquiet Guest; it shall be upon securer grounds, and better acquaintance then I have hitherto done. Unhappy is that woman in her Choice, whose levity will admit of Change; or dispence with Faith. As for this tedious address which I lately undertook; have not the least thought, that it was any intentionall designe in me, to make this inquiry as a relative Object of Fancy: in conceipting otherwise, you infinitly delude your self. This taske was to divorce us, not unite us: wherein I remaine so satisfied, as no Argument, be it never so evincing, may oppose it: or decline my resolution from being confirmed in it. Private Contracts being not accompanied with other Ceremoniall Observances and Conjugall Offices (especially where just occasions of difference are scandalously offered) may legally admit a dispensation. Now cast your Eyes, Acolasto , upon your own vagrant and debaucht Course, and it will give you matter enough to approve my resolution. Your causeless desertion impos'd a period to my affection. Vows and Protests had no power to tye you; the time of your prefixt returne neglected by you; the remainder of your Patrimony, which should raise a Subsistence to a Family (if not timely prevented) aliened from you. And is your Person so valuable, as to injoyne love, where there is no possibility to subsist? But I shall not press your Fortunes, being deprest enough already. I must igenuously tell you, they are held in the Skale of knowing men (walk you never so obscurely) to be scarcely competent for the Equipage of One, much lesse for the supportance of many. But if Panthalia might have confided in your constancy, and that She had not in a cleare contrary way, found in your unmanag'd Course so much levity: your Fortunes should have admitted no exception, had they been ranked in the lowest condition. I am informed, how after the yielding up of your Fort, and breaking up of your Siedge; you are for removing to another Garrison: the Gods guide you; onely before your departure, let me acquaint you with my resolve, which shall manifest my zeal more to devotion, then any humane affection: know that Panthalia stands so much affected to these Rites, Ceremonies and religious Rules of this Goddess Delia , in whose Society I here remaine, that her firm and immutable resolution, is to be united to their Order. The day of my approbation, admission and initiation is designed, with the assent of our Governesse, the second day after your receipt of these, and for the Place of my Institution, it is ordered to be in the private Fane of Dionissa . Where, if you please, you may by permission of our Society become a witness of Panthalia's desertion of the world, and all other secular interests: which, as it shall confirme my Election without Change, so it may prepare your affection for a new Choice. Howsoever, let not these lines divert your remove. Your designes (as they have been ever) are maine and many. Mine reduc'd to One, the happy enjoyment of a divine Fancy. Your deserted Panthalia .  This letter was more speedily returned, then it was cheerfully received. Never came heavier tidings to Acolasto's eare, then this unexpected resolution of his highly-incensed Mistress. For after his long absence from her; he had pitcht upon this determinate course; presently after their yielding up of the Fort Royall , to remove to no other Garrisson, as had been suggested to Panthalia ; but to returne with winged speed to his Native Countrey; and with a just excuse attemper his Mistress prejudicate Conceipt touching his retardancy. How deeply then might He appeare extasiz'd in the perusall of these lines; being, by their intervene, as he conceiv'd, wholly prevented of his aimes. So as, his reflection upon these, drove him in the silence of the night, into these extreme and disconsolate passions. 'Unhappy Acolasto , thou hast at last found how justly the Superiour Powers have delt with thee for thy continued track of folly. Thou hadst but one absolute comfort left thee, to allay thy distempers; dis-value the braves of Fortune; sleight the insults of Foes; or attone the distasts of Friends: and this ONE thy debaucht Course has irrecoverably lost: whereto wilt thou wander, deserted Lover? Be thine intentions bent to remove to another Garrison, to try the issue of thy Fortune: or first to be a personall witness of Panthalia's profession; who deservingly has left thee, because thou hast left thy self? yes; take thy solemn farwell of her, whom thou shalt never see hereafter. 'Lines are effectless; be it thy resolve to attend her aversion from thee, and conversion to that Sacred Deity, whereto she hath so religiously dedicated her Virginity. This done (as thy last living obsequies to her indeered memory (commend thy self to those designes, for which the Fates, have reserved thee. The utmost period of thy disasters, thou hast already attained: worse cannot befal thee, then thou hast encountred. If any cheerful ray of future happiness smile on thee, as it is beyond hope; so if any adverse occurrent ingage thee to an inevitable danger, it shall be without the compass of fear. For what can be left to him either for hope or feare; whom neither hope may possibly raise higher: nor Fear bring down lower: but in the extremest degree of a forlorne condition; hopeless of the one, and helpless in the other? Rest then in a restless retire, till this approaching day shall summon thee to accompany her Change, on whom thy Fancy did once so immutably (though carelesly) fix thy Choice. And may my Change by a speedy dissolution terminate my misery; since her vows, to whom I ow'd my self, has shut up her bosom from a resentment of my infelicity, or capacity of mercy.' In this short intervall of time; the Governess apprehending an inclinable affection in Panthalia to be received into their Order; as one infinitly desirous to become a Patroness to so accomplish'd a Sister, made choice of one Saladine , one of her Society, and an excellent Oratress in the pursuit of such religious designes; injoyning her to be perswasive in the effectuall contriving and accomplishment of this work: intimating withall, how useful it would be to their Society, to have such an One initiated in their Order, whose parts and Person might highly conduce to their Honour: and withall, how she had upon private discourse, found in her a plyableness that way; which she would not at that time too eagerly pursue, but modestly silenc'd it, intending to make it Saladines work, being more familiarly to be transacted by a Sister in relation to their mutuall Society; then the Governesses more awfull Command. Neither could any thing occur more opportunely: for upon this very hint came in Panthalia ; upon whose approch, after a Civile and Matron-like Salute, she withdrew, giving way to Saladine to pursue the designe; whereto with a composed alacrity She addressed her self in this manner. 'Madam Panthalia ( o that it were my happiness to enstile you Sister!) Your sweet and amiable Society has seaz'd so strongly on our Governess , and on us who live here in all Obedience under her Commands, as nothing could be equally grateful nor corresponding to the general Vote and Suffrage of our House, as your reception into our Society. Neither, Madam, should you find with us any such Stoical or unsociable Condition; that it might beget in you a tedious or undelightful Communion. For though our incloister'd Walls promise little or nothing suitable to a Secular Content: we can in this retirement inlarge our desires in the fullest measure, to the freest injoyment of themselvs. We have here spatious and delightfull Walks; Odoriferous Gardens;  & Osier Arbours for recreation: cheerful and ingenious Sisters to converse with: Pleasures and Disports proper for every Season. There is nothing that an innocent liberty can require, which you may not here partake. 'And though we have here no Courting nor Love-Sallies in request; yet we can religiously, with a discreet Ceremony, imitate it: and personate a Sister for a Compleat Courtier, and a Courtly Suiter: and though Strangers to the Complexion of Art, yet Artists to the Conservation of Nature. We can here Time it without affectation: and though Strangers to Apish love, pretend a formal garb of affection. Our Ambition is confin'd to these Walls; wherein we injoy more in having little, then others have in possessing much. 'We have long since publish'd a divorce to a Conjugal State; though we never yet knew, what Husbands meant. Our greatest Forreigners are mundane cares. Neither do we find any thing, in our Survey of Earth, worthy the entertainment of a tear or a Sigh. For how should we in discretion languish in our desires for injoyment of that which cannot fill us: or repine for the loss of that; from which the Course of Time must necessarily divide us? Our constant Lectures of Mortality, have sufficiently School'd us in all Principles of Morality. The recollection of these have made our day-tasks our delightfull'st Consorts: making our Evening the dayes Ephemerides. Thus is our Society imployed: and our hours improved, by communicating our Knowledge; reading and conferring our Observations one with another. This, unless blind Fancy have prepossest the Fortress of the heart; cannot chuse but infinitly surprize the affection of a Contemplative Soul: which the seriousness of your Conceipt, if I do not mistake, seemes to incline to. 'Excuse me, Madam, if the Fervour of my desires have too amply inlarged my discourse. Let my Cordial affection weave an Apology for this presumption. Onely let me truly tell you, if your disposition bend that way, no Society shall ever answer your Content with more suitable Harmony.' These polite and passionate Perswasions of Saladine , seem'd to work so effectually upon Panthalia ; as if her discourse had wholly weaned her from any further Familiarity with the world, by a devotionall intendment to be initiated and inrowled a Sister of the Delian Order. Neither did she conceale her resolves (howsoever inwardly disguis'd) but imparted her self freely to her in this sort. 'How much a Stranger stands obliged to your indeerments, Sister Saladine (for I shall highly rejoyce in the conferment of that Title) though I cannot in your manner, so rhetorically express it; yet shall I with my best endeavours study to deserve it. 'My coming hither I shall ever hold the highest happiness that ever befell me. For it has brought me to an injoyment of my self: and to dis-value that which formerly (nor can I remember it without teares) had an absolute Soveraignty over me.' What singular Object might that be, replied Saladine , that could make so gallant a Spirit its Subject? 'Oh, for loves sake, do not aske me; it doth so much distaste me, as nothing now can be more opposite to my thoughts, then what sometimes sported most with my conceipt: inwreathing me in an inextricable Labyrinth of Folly.' Come Sister (since you will have me call you so) deal ingenuously with me; was it not Fancy, that merry Folly, that so intangled you? 'You divine rightly, said Panthalia ; it was Fancy, that amorous Phrency, that miserably deluded me. 'I must confess really, that in the prime Flower of my youth, before I could distinguish Faces, my wandring Eye begun to play the cunning Impostor, and to lay Snares how to deceive my heart. Youthfull beauty became such an attractive bait, as my distemper'd Fancy regulated onely by the appearence of an outward posture, drove my misguided affection into many irregular extreams. For though sundry Fortunes were presented me; and those no way unsuitably accompanied: For the Owners of those Fortunes were of eminent descent, and for Personage, gracefull enough to any competible or impartiall Eye; yet such curiosity attended my Choice, or such diversity of Features begot in me an assiduate desire of Change, as what I loved one day, produc'd a distaste in the next. 'It suited much with mine humour to be courted by a multitude of Servants. In generall to retaine many; but in Speciall to entertaine none. Self-opinion is a dangerous darling: a bosom-Idol; no sooner admir'd then ador'd. 'I begun to have a Conceipt of my own parts, and ingeniously to jeer those, whom not long before I seemed to affect. 'Thus plaid I with Fancy, as if I should never have been taken by it: Thus nibbled I at the bait, as one without fear to be intangled with it: but in the end I found the Proverbe experimentally true:  'So oft the frisking fly sports with the flame, Till her Seere wings are singed in the same. 'For at last my dis-compos'd Fancy fixt it self on an Object , whose Person might be a Motive sufficient enough to induce love: but it was invested with other inward qualities; which in the eye of discretion, might have retarded my Choice. For to render him his just Character; He was a youth wholly dedicated to pleasure: a meer Stranger to his Estate: making it his onely aime to fuell his unbounded expence with fresh supplies. 'Many disswasions I receiv'd from entertaining the affection of so profuse a Suiter into my bosom; and Some of his own were the assiduatest Agents in this business. But imagining this to be rather a designe for their own ends then my content: and that the smallness of my Portion induced them to practise the withdrawing of my Fancy from him, rather then any other Essentiall ground; Those Allies of his could not be more instant in disswading, then I was constant in persisting: preferring Him whom I formerly affected, before all others, who by my Friends approvement, were afterwards brought on and presented. 'Yet I must tell you Saladine , though my youthfull fancy were in this manner seated; our marriage to this houre was never ceremonially solemnized. Which I shall ever impute rather to my good Fortune then my Wit. For that was long before gone a wooll-gathering: though it was my desire, in this eager pursuit of love, to protract time, purposely to discover, whereto the youthfull Cariere of his licentious Fancy would arrive, and in what period it would close.' It seemes strange to me, replyed Saladine , how your affection should so far estrange it self from discretion, as to fixe your Choice , where your judgement found such probable arguments of Change .    [   What sensible qualms & undefinable Passions distressed Lovers have felt, may be seen in Ariost. Elegies. Archiloch. Simonid. Pind.   ] You suffer'd your self, in my Opinion, to be too prematurely drench'd in Love where your Object was too apt to fly out, and out of his native levity, to be taken with every Lure. 'O Sister Saladine , it seems you never shot yet in Cupids bow! Else you would confess, what amorous Girles generally know: and what by bitter experience they have sufficiently felt: how a freedom and liberty even to profuseness, acts more powerfully in the quest of love; then any bashful or modest posture. 'Active Youth cannot chuse but beget love: whereas a sober and remiss Civility dulls the edge of Fancy. 'But thanks to the Superiour Powers for my arrival here; I am now wholly drawn off from all such light thoughts, as formerly nestled in my Virgin bosom. For as the irregularity of his Course gave me small hope of his recovery: so the recollection of my Succeeding Fortune, poized with the freedom of my present condition, has made mine heart an Alien to the indiscreet entertainment of any such youthful Fancy. 'Though I must tell you, Sister, so fervorous were my desires in the pursuit of his Happiness; as I shall ever wish him well, and hold it one of my prime earthly felicities, to hear him succeed prosperously in the world, with the improvement of his indangered reputation, and gallant deportment in military affairs: all which, the future management of his actions (being no less then his Person promiseth) may hereafter deserve.' It were easie to collect from hence, said Saladine , that there remain still some small Sparks of Fancy raked up in the Embers; which would quickly take fire if they were fomented. 'No doubt, Sister Saladine , but you have read so much Philosophy, as may sufficiently informe your judgement, and revive your knowledge in the Mysteries of Love: the Discipline whereof, (though the Devotional retirement of your Monastick life has made you a Stranger to the Practise of it,) has long since discovered to your Reading the nature and quality of that influence. It will tell you what powerful effects it produceth: how it can transanimate the Spirit of the Lover to the Bosom of the Object beloved. It can unite two hearts in One, and by an individual juncture, incorporate two distinct Bodies in one Mind. Neither should I have so easily dispenc'd with these imaginary Fancies; had not my happy admittance into your regular Society, brought me to a more sensible apprehension of my former condition, by dis-relishing those amorous Potions or Circean Impostures, wherewith the folly of my youth, had inthrall'd me.' May we then, replied Saladine , derive these hopes from you; that you will become one of us: and inrowle your self in our Family? 'You shall not need to doubt of it; my resolvs are so fixt, as the reality of my Profession shall witness it: and attest your whole Society to second it. Neither will the relation to my own Condition, nor the devotion I cordially tender to your religious Order, suffer me to play the Dissembler. What I have here imparted to you in private; when the prefixt time of your admittance shall call me to this Task of Obedience; shall sincerely and without any guilded pretences (which make a [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) gallery of Sanctity) manifest it self. For I perceive clearly (so soveraign is that Eye-salve which I have not onely received, but usefully applied, by the assitance of your Company) that if I should wanton any longer in the fruitless Delights of Sensual love; my reputation would suffer a loss: and my Discretion (being so well school'd both by Precept and Example) suffer an irreparable foil.' This will be pleasant news to our Governess, answer'd Saladine ; For none ever of late yeares came to our Foundation, to be admitted, who was more generally indeered, or by our Commandress more highly valued. 'Their immerited esteem of me, my humble Observance of your Orders shall make it the highest of my endeavours to requite: and as I am the youngest in your Order, so shall the lowest of your Commands approve me your humbly- affectionatest Sister and Servant.' While these two lately adopted Sisters were bandying Civilities in this manner One with the Other; Their Governess came unexpectedly in; desirous, as it might be probably gathered, what good effect Saladines advice to Panthalia had produc'd: or what hope she might entertaine in the reception of so promising and acceptable a daughter. But Saladine , rejoycing much in her success; and quickning her address unto her: told her, how she had made way for inlarging her Foundation. What do you meane, said the Governess? Our Foundation holds correspondence with our Revenues. So we may preserve it to Posterity: and inrich it with a vertuous Family, we shall hold it sufficiently inlarged: these Cyens of piety are those large-spreading branches that shall best dilate it, and with their cheerfull umbrage safeliest secure it. Madam, said Saladine , you have here one hopefull branch more to beautifie your Family: and we here present her to your discreet government: and pointing to Panthalia ; the Governess, as One surprized with incredible joy, embraced her: Saying, none could be more welcome to their Society: and proposing Saladine to be her Bed-fellow; as one suiting best with her disposition; She requested Panthalia to make choice of what day She pleased for her initiation and reception into their Order: which we intend, said she, shall be observed with that solemnity, as our due honor to a Stranger, shall express what content we apprehend in the injoyment of so absolute a Sister. Panthalia , seemingly transported with the joy of this Election; was not so forgetfull of her Lesson, as not to remember the prefixt day mentioned in her Letter to Acolasto : which, though She could not be confident of the issue, whereto her intendments were addressed; her Care accompanied with much Secrecy, so fitly prepared; as the grounds of her designe promised faire, howsoever the event might second it. The very same day therefore was appointed for performing these Ceremonies, which She had in her Letter formerly expressed. Meane time, none could appear more Observant nor morigerous to the Orders of the House, then Panthalia ; but the Course of her Probation was but short: for the day of Acolasto's remove from his Garrison, and the approaching time of her dedication, would not permit the expence of many hours. And much had She to think upon, before this pregnant birth, being but as yet in it's Embrio , could be brought to perfection. For such was the promptness of her Conceipt, as she lov'd to shew wit in the greatest extrems: and to intangle the expectance with smooth deceptions: as may appear by the issue of this Narration. The modesty of Pandione her Fellow-traveller, declined her from interessing her self in this Secrecy: yet could not their private and assiduate Conference free her from jealousie. Some strange thing, as she suggested to her self, was in moulding, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) when She desired much to partake. Till now at last her opinion became confirm'd, by what she had casually over-heard: for by playing the Cunning Eve-dropper, she came to a discovery of Panthalia's resolvs: and how her long and tedious Journey had diverted that aime, whereto it was addrest, by taking a long farewell of love, and confining her Travaile, which she had so patiently indur'd, to the Walls of a Sanctuary. This though she could hardly believe (for as yet she had found no such mortified affections in Panthalia ) yet reflecting upon her neare relation to Acolasto , she intended to try further. So as, having so faire an opportunity offered her as Panthalia's privacy; with much modesty and winning sweetness, She accosted her after this manner. Madam, I perceive by your late and unexpected resoves, though Civility, as well beseem'd me, would not allow me so much boldness as to insinuate my self into the Knowledge of them, how your Monastick Zeal has turn'd love out a-doore. Your sometimes indeered Lover must now seek his Mistress in a Cloister, or else he must never have the hope to finde her. What doest thou meane by this, Pandione , replied Panthalia ; thy discourse seemes a Riddle to me: and my Fancy no such Oedipus as to assoile it. No, Lady, said She; I understand your Fancy is of no such circumference as it has been formerly. Love is now fallen off from the hinges. Your affection is become thawed, and resolv'd into devotion: and your late zeal to a Cloister, has quite estrang'd your thoughts from the visit of a Garrison. Vesta has put out the Tapers of Hymen . But pursue your Course, Madam, I shall not make it my Taske to disswade you from your designe. Onely, be it your goodness to excuse Pandione , if her resolvs be not dedicated to this Society. For She has profest her self such a Votaresse, as never to lead Apes in Hell: nor walk in the Elysian Fields without a Mate. Tell me Pandione , can any one injoy more felicity in the world, then to Soveraignize over the Cares of the World? To what period have my numerous desires brought me? Have I not all this time snatch't at a shadow, and lost the reality of Content? Have I not in pursuit of a Consort, lost my self? Were not all these guilded promises, wherewith I miserably deluded my affection, and have not these closed fairly (through an unexpected Catastrophe) by making their period in devotion? And might not that Period have been drawne before we undertook this Journey? Had you not Recluses dedicated to devotion in your own Country; wherein you might have been receiv'd in to a Vestall Society, if you had not been transported with the heat[![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Fancy? This Relation will sound strangely, when it comes to the Eares of your Friends, That Panthalia , the Westerne beauty, should play the amorous Pilgrim: and in the end of her Journall, Sacrifice the reliques of her Fancy to a Monastery. An Incence better bestow'd then on loose love. With an even hand I have seriously considered with my self:    [   Panthalias reply.   ] and in a competible Skale ballanc'd my present condition, with the blasted fruits of a doubtfull affection. And in One Skale, I presented Him, whom I sometimes valued: and in the Other, the perfection of that divine State whereto I addrest my resolvs. In my recollection of these; and comparing One with the Other, I found an infinite difference. The one assuring me of an accomplish'd content, without any probable incounters to disturbe it. The other objecting to my thoughts many Obstacles: being such, as they could not chuse but suggest sundry occasional disgusts and distempers to the best composed and regulated Spirit. Then a Contemplative life (being what the Supreme Powers affect) what more happy? Then an indisposed Consort (whereto even the most approved patience cannot give acquiescence) what more heavy? I appeal to your self, Pandione , whether the memory of Acolasto's dissolute Course could relish with your Fancy! His continuance in the Country, before his imployment became Military, proclaim'd him sufficiently; and can you think the Profession of a Souldier should make him better: or reduce him to a more Civil Order? It were a strange cure for a youthful course. Give me leave, Lady, replied Pandione , to impart my self freely, and in such manner as shall neither tax your Servant of presumption, nor suffer my thoughts, which have been ever dedicated with all obsequious reality to your vertuous Commands, to fall short in any express that may essentially conduce to your honour: or may divert Calumny, which traducing Spirits are no less apt to dispense then to harbour. These be Assays of different nature, neither shall I hold it a Task of higher importance to advance the one, then to prevent the other. It is not possible that you should forget the grounds which first induced you to this hazardous adventure: wherein my humblest desires have constantly addressed their best endeavours to your service, was not then Acolasto your sole aim? How should it happen, that your Fancy, the onely Actuary in this tedious Journy, should become so eclipsed as to dis-value that Object most, which your Conceipt had formerly ranked the highest in your Books? But your wisdom now after a small revolution of time, has found out a new distinction betwixt affection and discretion. You lov'd the man, but not his levity; his person, but not his quality. Resolve me, Madam, did you not know all this before we put on our disguize? was not Acolasto the very same he is, in your opinion? No, you will say, his Martial discipline has unciviliz'd him for the office of Love. Oh, do not oppose your own judgment in this debate! Mars , if we may give credit unto Poetry, whose divine influence has ever descanted the best upon Fancy; was every way as Compleat a Courtier as a Warrier. A Field-bed was not his onely Repose. That Lemnian Ram found him more amorously lodg'd. When his Fury was resolv'd to Fancy, he appear'd a Servant more sutable for Court then Camp. But to divert from this adventitious Discourse, and return to your self; did not the freedom of your affection wing your speed towards this Garrison? were you not then resolv'd of his military imploiment? what then should beget in you this alteration? If devotion be the ground, it bestows on love the more grace: but if a pretence of devotion make the Fruits of love abortive, it will prove a disguize rather to delude, then improve your profession. But certainly this Matrons advice has produc'd some strange operation in your declining affection! And what sinister effects may probably arise from thence; you apprehend not. This may enliven your Fancie with an interiour Flame: and make you wholly forgetful of your errand: mean time you consider not the perplext condition of your deserted Friend: who cannot chuse but wonder at your inconstancie; when such experimental tokens of your setled and immutable love had confirm'd you his. A decrease or easie falling off from a pen- feathred affection, being weakly grounded and tenderly imp'd, may be without much difficulty dispenc'd withall. It never reteined such heat as to operate in the heart: nor act distempers in the brain. Whereas the continuance of your Fancy has aspir'd to more maturity. You were pleas'd to relinquish many, and those of eminent qualitie, to injoy him: and shall a shadow of late-pretended zeal imbellish'd with Vestal Ceremonies divide him from you? Trust me, Madam, if ever my youth attain to that felicitie, (and who knows what the Destinies have decreed for me?) that I may justly challenge an interest in a deserving Consort; rather then I will dis-ingage him whom I love, I will freely ingage my life, and expose my humane Being to the worst of Extreams. It were great pity, said Panthalia , that such a render and kind-hearted Turtle should want her Mate. But who knows not that it is much easier to prescribe a Cure, then to submit or give way to the Receipt. I was sometimes as resolute in the obliging respects of a Servant, as either you could be, or any Amorist living. But when experience informs my judgment to life; that if my indiscreet Fancie transported with the heat of unbounded youth, had inclined to the advice of Friends: or with an unbiass'd affection had evenly weighed those sad Consequences which frequently arise from inconsiderate love: I could no way have chus'd but blush at my rash Choice; and infinitely repented in suffering Sense, which periods its content in a moment of Delight, to retain such a predominant hand over Reason. That approv'd Observation of wise Girles, who measure love by discretion, cannot be unknown unto thee Pandione: No sooner makes Poverty into any possession a seazure; then by that Forcible Entry it ejects love, and makes it a stranger . And might not this have prov'd my Case, if I had run on in my track of Follie,    [   The best Choice that admits no occasional grounds of Change .   ] by exposing my self and my deplorable Fortunes to a remediless miserie; in giving way to the Conduct of a blind and inconsiderate Fancie? Reflect upon Acolasto's riotous and profuse excess; and tell me if my unhappie Choice could have expected ought less. O Pandione , how wisely is that love planted, when it is discreetly seasoned? It looks not so much upon a Sprigg of Rosemarie; nor the taking off a Nuptial Garter; as the mutual interchange of bosom-respects; the fruition of real and essential Comforts: with a just provisional care for a Posteritie, whensoever time shall answer their hopes, and accomplish their desires in the injoyment of so incomparable a Blessing. This is a Lecture, replied Pandione , which to this day I never heard you read. But it seems, this Cloister has put you into a Siege above the quality or capacity of an ordinary Lover. I have known sometimes when the wind was in another door. Your modestie could once have vouchsaf'd to be taken into a Rash-bearing: and to have broke a Cracknell or drunk a Sillibub with the youth of our Parish. A whole afternoons story of the joyes of a Marriage life would at that time have seem'd short. Activity was in those daies preferr'd before a Patrimonie, else had the Image of your deserted Acolasto never retein'd such a deep impression: nor injoin'd you to so long and hazardous a Journie; being an apparent argument of your immutable affection. It is never too soon to prevent an ensuing mishap (said Panthalia ) especially in an Assay of such high concerne; the success whereof, if prudently entertain'd, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) proviseth a continuall holy-day: but if wildly and indiscreetly transacted, may admit one Marriage-day, but the sequel a Tragick Scene without all hope of a Comicall Conclusion. I must confess, a timely discussion of these probable Events might to my greater advantage have been recollected, and more seasonably digested: but such was the indisputable fervour of my desires, as it hurled me head-long upon this tedious and perillous Journey. The most virile and Masculine spirits have not at all times their wits near them: well then may our resolvs arising from the weakness of our Sexe, receive excuse. Howsoever, my late alteration in the Course of my affection may incur a popular Censure, I cannot be less then confident, but my late hazardous Travell has sufficiently gratified his coolness in the pursuit of what he so seriously profest. His Proposall was definite; at such a prefixt time to returne back from this unnecessary Service: wherein he ingag'd his Person without constraint, or probability of preferment: But the title of a Souldier cancell'd in him the thoughts of a Lover. Acolasto appear'd not the same he was. His eclips'd Fancy discover'd a dificience in the slowness of his performance. And am I so restrain'd in the strict Rules of Love, as to be deprived of the like liberty? This were an injury to our Sexe. To have our affections managed by the stronger hand: to make us their Mistresses no longer then at their pleasure: and to Cashiere us as unsuitable Reformades in an humour. These riotous Servants, who appear more prodigal in their Expresses, then reall in performance; can artfully pretend us love, so long as we have the power to oppose our own wills; and in the unjustest Commands, subject our selvs to their imperious interests. Whereas, if we should at any time, even in impertinences, cross them, how quickly would the edge of Fancy become rebated? were it not then far better to intertaine that Condition with much freedom and composedness of Spirit; wherein we may remaine secure from these domestick Clashings, and injoy our Contents in a sweet and delightfull discourse, then to ingage our liberty to a Conjugall tyranny? Your late Claustrall Revolvs, answer'd Pandione , have brought you into a strange point of Heresie. It will repent you, er'e it be long, if you continue in this erroneous opinion, that this World had a Creation; For you oppose the meanes of Generation: and no People, no Society; and no Society, no World. Thus would your Monastick Conceipt make the World a wilderness: Humane Habitations Deserts. But give me leave to tell you, that these religious Anachorites who have divorc'd themselves from the world, are unsociable Consorts for those that have to do in the World. They partake too much of the nature of the Ostridge to be suitable Friends, or amicable Companions. The discourse of a Grave : or a discovery of the Elysian-Fields (extracted from the pregnancy of Poets brains) must take up the whole houre. And are these Subjects for young yeares, or green thoughts? why should they not, replied Panthalia ? What inferiour subjects can in weight of reason be held comparable to those which operate in the inward affections of the mind a setled peace? Are we not so long as we are here sojourning, properly resembling light and unsteared Vessels floating on the Maine, and by means of cross and adverse winds, driven from our designed Coast, or intended Harbour? Is it not then high time to prepare our selves against the encounters of so hazardous and tempestuous a voiage? Those many storms and menacing Shelvs which interpose us in this perilous Passage, advise us seasonably to provide for a Convenient place of Landing. The life of a wise man is to return to God: this was the positive opinion of divine Plato . But how should we retain in our selves either a capacity or possibility of returning; if we take no content in meditating of the Place, nor contemplating the delights which we are to injoy in the fruition of that Place whereto we address our Course? It is the Conceipt of the Object, that makes our Journy easie: whereas our rarity in conversing with Heaven, begets a distance in our thoughts, and make them strangers to their Country. 1 Seneca wisht for Philosophy; that as the face of the universal world comes into view, so that might be presented to us as a Spectacle most unlike unto the World. And I shall ever wish the like with that Divine Moralist. For the influence of a better world can never animate strongly on the Faculties of any dull or Sublunary Spirit, that suffers it self to become Subject to the Despicable Soveraignty of Earth. It seems, Madam, said Pandione , that you are grown to be a Philosopher, since you became a Monastick Professor: and that you have been lately so indoctrinated in Timons School, as you will in time publish to the whole world, that you are an Enemy to your own Sex: For in your contempt of love (a womans bosom-consort) you can appear nothing less. Had your Progenitors retein'd this opinion: and exprest it in their hate to generation, where then had been your Being? You mistake my meaning answer'd Panthalia . I profess my self a Satyr onely to light love. When Fancy grounds it self upon a phantastick habit, or an outlandish Cringe, or an affected tongue; wantonly descanting on a Theam of love: I cannot more properly compare such a distemper'd Amorist, then to Pigmalions fond love and doating Complement to his marble Mistress. And what joy in such a formal Statue, which admits no such active motion, as may either procure or deserve affection? This, though an Object to the eye , would prove an Abject to the heart . If in mutual and neighbourly relations such difference of Countenances appeare, through the cross Occurrents of Fortune; where poverty oftimes weakneth, if it wholly dissolve not the band of amity; we may collect hence what the heavy effects of want may produce in the nearest endeerments. O Pandione , let Reason go before every Enterprize, and Counsel before every Action! Which Precept if I had seasonably observed my straying steps might have been better directed; my rash affections more discreetly managed, and no occasional motive of discontent to thy self ministred, in relation to thy long and wearisom Journal: nor no ground of repentance to my glowing youth in admitting, and too credulously inclining to the easie protests of so light a Suiter. But thanks to my better Fates; these distractions are reduc'd to a calmer and clearer period. It is an happiness sometimes to have erred; especially where the recollection of our Error calls us home to a knowledge of our selvs, and an acknowledgment of our Failings: For by this means, we become not onely wiser in the apprehension, but much happier in desertion of that Error which we formerly affected. I shall not argue with you, Madam, replied Pandione , touching the Subject of love; but leave you to your own Choice: But if the ripeness of youth beget not in your devotion a Change, I shall hold you to be of strange mettal. For my own part, though I have ever really lov'd you, in your late Conversion I never mean to follow you. Age when it is in a decline suits best with a Cloister; but youthfull heat with the imbraces of a Lover. At the very instant while they were thus discoursing,    [  Secrecy & Celerity be the two moving wheels of succesfull fancy. ] there came unexpectedly a Messenger with a Letter from Acolasto ; with much secresie directed, and by the Convoy of a Select Friend carefully presented: after the Contents whereof Pandione out of her accustomed modesty, would not appear inquisitive: but walking aside, left her to the perusal of Acolasto's character; which rendred it self in this manner,  Panthalia (if you will vouchsafe so much favour to your deserted Servant as to use your Name, whom you have so causelesly estranged from your affection) be pleased to cast an eye upon his lines, though you have shut your bosom from the receipt of love: and heare him in his last Expresses; whereto your unexpected resolvs and his deplorable Condition have brought him. Compassion in a well-disposed Enemy may be easily procur'd; when his dying Foe with his last breathing words beggs a pardon: craving nothing more, with teare- thrilling Eyes and throbbing heart then reconciliation in the closing period of his approaching dissolution. Hold your sometimes indeered Acolasto to be at this very instant in the same case. Be pleased then to entertaine these funerall enterbreaths with a pious pity, though your estranged thoughts dart upon their unfortunate Author a regardless scorne. Dying mens words ever reteine the deepest impression: especially when we consider how that very mouth which so lately uttered those words shall be injoyned to a perpetuall silence, and never impart the least accent or syllable of a word (as a message from his mind) to the world any more. Conceipt not this as a disguise nor a pretensive Colour to abuse you: your rejected Lover surprized with such a remediless distemper, cannot possibly at this time act the part of a dissembler. I have already run over the difficulties of my disconsolate Course: and am now performing my last Act, if the best Artists designed for our Garrison, do not deceive themselves. Eye me then with a pious pity, paying my last debt to Nature. Whereto I should invite you, if such a Spectacle of mortality might deserve your vertuous presence. But alas, the illimited freedom of my actions merit no such favour. Yet, as you were pleased, upon your late resolvs, to importune my attest to your new unexpected Profession; so being no lesse known to your approved piety then my own Folly; I might presume to expect most, where I deserved least. Meane time, be it your goodness to commiserate where you cannot Cure: and to cast your Eye of pity upon your expiring Servant; though it be within the Walls of your Cloister; for to an higher honour my weak ambition dare not aspire. Of such Modells by way of Landskip our Sea-men make excellent use when furthest divided from Land: And in a Compassionate reflexe on his languishing Condition, who cordially honour'd you, wish him more rest, by his peaceable Passage from hence, then ever he could injoy here. And now give me leave to unrippe my bosom in the discovery of my youthfull levity; For which I shall make bold to beg your pardon; not in relation to my immeriting affection, but the present weakness of my Condition. I confess Madam; and I am ashamed of my self, in the agnition of my Error: that you were pleased sometimes to bestow your Favour upon an undeserving Object. One, who might have appear'd incomparably happy, if he had known what felicity rested in the fruition of a divine Fancy. But in his inconstancy brought him to this brink of misery. Yet let me not taxe my self of a Crime, whereof I was never guilty. That inconstancy which I speak of, never to this houre wherein I ly dying, could be by the rigidst Censure discovered in my hope; for that was pure and unstained; though the many discomposures of my youth rendred me profusely dis-ordered, and unworthy the acceptance of so incomparable a Choice. None ever more entirely lov'd, and more vainly deluded with Excursive delights. These I repent, though I cannot redeem. For you may believe me, seeing my present distemper will not suffer me to deceive you; that I should imbrace death cheerfully, if it might be my happiness to recall what I have lost by my Folly. It is now too late for me to capitulate with Heaven: or promise the inexorable Fates upon hope of a Reprieve, a dereliction of what I formerly affected: with a fervorous desire of imbracing what my unseasoned youth formerly distasted. Let it suffice, that these last words and vows of your unfortunate Servant, obsequiously confirm, as in life so now in death Solely Panthalia's .  What strange and variously dispassionate effect; the sad perusall of these lines wrought in the relenting heart of his perplexed Mistress, were not easie to discover. His sad condition she infinitely bemoans: His accomplishments she presents to her thoughts; and finds in them many things worthy loving: as for his defects arising from the frailty of youth, she so excuseth or extenuates them, as they appeare not to her judgment lyable to reproof. With numerous teares and affectionate Sighs, she often repents her self of writing so rough and disconsolate a Letter: imputing the blame to her inconsiderate Character, and from thence the Source of his distemper. Her resolution formerly entertain'd for a religious Profession; became now more strengthned then before. For that Onely Object which she seemed to slight, though her bosom perhaps could have dictated otherwise, being as she verily thought, removed from Earth: her Contemplation could not be better directed, nor her hours more affectionately dedicated; then where they might be with most content and least distraction bestowed. Yet could not this intended separation from secular cares estrange her sequestred thoughts wholly from those amorous passages, which she with a passionate content remembred during her free entertainment and affectionate enjoyment of her Servant. O how happy (would she say) might we have been Acolasto , had not youthful Folly challeng'd too much influence over thy Fancy! Fate had not thus unhappily divided us: nor our Nuptiall hopes resolv'd their joys into Funerall teares---Farewell forever; onely let me begge this of thee: to forgive the unkindnesse of my lines; as I shall entirely the Errors of thy love. Pandione having been but a small space distanc'd from her, and observing her thus strangely perplext or extasi'd rather with grief, hastned towards her, compassionately demanding of her the Cause of her discontent. Of discontent in me, Pandione ! Canst thou see any such alteration in my Count'nance, that it should present to thy thoughts any such visible Symptom? But I shall clear thy doubts. Thou canst not but know Pandione , how my resolvs are pitcht upon an high Concerne, an utter desertion of the world, and my espousall to a Monastick life: Now, pray thee tell me; is it possible that any Companion should bid a lasting adue to his long continued acquaintance without a transitive sigh, or some small appearence of grief? I have had a Free injoyment of the world, and interlaced my Secular imployments with Choicest refreshments and is it easie to forgo all these in the prime of ones youth, without the Sacrifice of one teare? Though I must confess that the Choice of this Profession was voluntary and without coercion and sundry maine inducements to disswade me from this resolution. Some whereof no doubt, replied Pandione , reteine a deep impression in you. None of those, which thou conceivest to have the strongest influence over me; said Panthalia . Neither canst thou object any argument in relation to love, to foreslow my desires, nor divert my designs. For this Letter has cancell'd the thought of a Lover. Thy Kinsman Acolasto , whose premature fate I shall ever obsequiously bemoane, is, as this Letter renders him, paying his last debt to Nature. Alas, poor wretch; the more is his happiness. His death may merit your pity, though his life became estranged from the acceptance of your Fancy. In paying that debt, He has discharg'd those deep Obligations, which He stood ingaged in, to your beauty. This Sacrifice, being the last Tribute of a dying Lover, may justly expiate the Errors of his youth, and consequently regaine your good opinion by the innocence of his death, which he could not reteine by the late progress of his indisposed life. Teares prevented Panthalia's reply; the burden of her grief was so heavy, as it injoyned her pensive tongue a necessitated Silence, Still ascribing the prime grounds of his distemper, to proceed from the harsh dialect of her Letter. Pandione after this sad relation of Acolasto's death, for better she could not expect from the circumstances of Panthalia's discourse; seemed very desirous that Evening to depart from the Monastery, and leave this dis- consolate Lady to her intended Profession; the next day being designed for her initiation. But Panthalia's importunity so far wrought upon her, as she consented to the attendance of those Solemnities usually observed in such religious initiations; though for her self she neither affected any of those disciplinary Rites; being too regular for her youthfull temper: not to be so far divided from her native Countrey, being the choicest reside, as she accompted it, for the injoyment of her Fancy. unexpected prevention. Scarce had the Orient Sun diffused his radiant Spangles on the Earth: or extracted his pearled Dews from the Diapred Meads; till the vigilant Governess joyful of the reception of so hopeful a Daughter: call'd up the Votaresses designed to her Charge: wishing them to take special Care that nothing might be omitted sutable to the performance of those accustomed Ceremonies observed in the initiation and Election of Professants. Neither could she be more serious in her Commands, then they in their obedience: which to Delia's honour, and the approvement of a new Sister; was performed in this manner. The Pavement being with much curiosity and uniformity impav'd with Porphyrite Marble, was strowed all along with fresh and fragrant Flowers from the gate of the Monastery to the Temple Porch; from the prime Portal or Entrance of the Fane, the Passage directing to the Main Quire was odoriferously perfumed; the Altar, where their Delian Ceremonies were usually solemnixed, richly Syndoned; upon every Column were Lamps, wax Lights and Tapers in golden Candlesticks erected; Musical Instruments enlivned with the choicest and refinedst ayrs each where resounded: nothing was awanting that might properly conduce to the accomplishment of those Ceremonial Observances. But lest we should hold your eyes too long fixt upon the Surface, and so keep you from a more serious and intentive reflection upon the beauty of this inward Structure, and by too ample a relation of the Ceremony, darken the Splendor of the Story; we are now to present to your view the presence and deportment of the Governess, whose care was not onely bestowed upon the deboring and beautifying of these ritual Solemnities: but how to expedite the main work, for which these decent accommodations were prepared. Taking therefore this initiated Professant ( Panthalia we mean) by the hand, with a graceful demean, the rest of the Order likewise following her, she mounted the stayrs leading to the Altar, where the Habit , wherewith Panthalia was to be attired, was shown her: which she eyed with a pleasing and graceful aspect, as if no Present could be more acceptable to her. Here the Governess took occasion to address her discourse to Panthalia with much cheerfulness; assuring her that she could never disburse honour with more alacrity to any Votaress entring that Society; which expressive favour coming from the mouth of so Reverend a Guardiness, Panthalia gratefully requited with all humble obeysance; wishing nothing more then that her due Obedience to her pious Commands might have the happiness to merit her vertuous acceptance; which should be ever the highest pitch of her desires. Neither, indeed, howsoever her resolvs were formerly fixed, did she appear in this way of her Profession, to play the Dissembler: For remaining now half perswaded that her deserted Servant Acolasto had taken his long leave of Earth; She took upon her this resolution never to returne into her Native Countrey, nor to receive into her bosom the Conceipt of any new Fancy: but to bid adue to all youthfull Folly, by changing the world with a Monastery, and the affection of a translated Friend, with the devotion of a sequestred life. By this time, had the Governess presented Panthalia to One of the Sali , or Ministers of the Ceremonies; who had formerly been vers'd among the Persians , and held in high esteem, bearing the Office of Mithras , or Chief Priest of the Sun: and afterwards ordained [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Prince Patriark to the Delian Order. Whose function it was, amongst other especiall priviledges of his Place, to offer up the Votaresse, at her initiation, to the tuition or devotion of the Governess, and to complete the Ceremonies usually observed by that Society, at the time of her dedication. And by what divine Fate, Heaven knows, even at the very instant when this Lady was to be presented, and into the Society received; came unexpectedly in the late-seeming languishing Acolasto , who by the safe Conduct of an intimate Friend of the Patriarks, was with much secresie and security brought into the Temple; without the least discovery of what he either intended, or designed. It is not to be imagined what strange perplexities this unexpected sight begot in his amazed Panthalia . But her Face, the truest Index of the heart, by her interchange and variety of Colours, growing now pale and then red display'd what her enforc'd composure labour'd to conceale, seeming to vye Colours with the Chamelion, though unchangeable in the ground colour of her affection. Long time she mused, and as one intransed with some attractive Object, gave little attention to whatsoever that Ceremoniall Minister delivered; which was generally observed by all, but especially by the Governess; who, as she was a devout reverencer of those Monasticall Rites and Institutions of her self: So could she not endure that any of her Order should appeare remisse in their honour to such ancient Solemnities: but with auricular attention and Cordiall devotion to apply themselves to those Ministeriall Observations of her Temple. But the Agent of these Ceremonies, being intentive to his Office, took small notice of such divertisements; so as, receiving Panthalia upon the Governesses presentation, into his hand; according to their accustomed Rites in such Dedications observed: with a reverend deportment he used these words unto her. Daughter we are made known to your pious intention, and with what fervor you desire to be receiued into this religious Society: wherein there be three things which you are constantly to retein in memory, to inable you the better for your serviceable imployments in this Family. These three which are so necessarily to attend you, and whose attendance may accomplish you; are Humility, Industry and Continency. Humility, in observing the Commands of your Superiour. Industry, in bestowing your time constantly upon some usefull endeavour. And Continency, in admitting no discourse nor sociable intercourse that may detract from your Honour. These three duely observed, Daughter, will make a Compleat Professor. But now to the work of your Initiation; whereon all the Eyes of your religious Sisters are fixed; as on some glorious or resplendent light newly created to give an additament to their inferiour reflections. To you then Daughter, as a Monastick Deo-dand , am I to address my Speech: To whom are you pleased that I shall give you ? To this Gentleman, answer'd she , for He has the greatest interest in me. This answer could not perplex the whole Society more, then it transported Acolasto with joy. Whose unexpected acceptance imparadis'd the extasi'd thoughts of this deserted Lover: who of an amorous Captive, was become a Princely Conquerour. For never did Prince triumph more in the injoyment of a Soveraignty, then this late seeming-sick Acolasto did in the seazure of her beauty. But such Nuptial meetings were not to be admitted in this Family: wherefore being excluded from the Tutelage and Devotion of the Governess, not without apparent tokens of indignation, these two loving Turtles with their over-joy'd Companion Pandione , were commanded to pack thence with all speed, menacing them too, that if they stay'd above their time limited in those parts; their gross deluding of so ancient and reverend a Society, should not pass uncensured nor escape with impunity. But Delay was as tedious to these Lovers, as it could be to their Commanders: From thence they departed with all cheerfulness and alacrity: albeit Panthalia , to express a grateful Civility to the Governess and all her Society, took a fair and friendly Farewell of them all; excusing her sudden and unexpected alteration; with her former ingagement to Acolasto ; which without apparent violation of Faith she could no way dispense with: assuring them withall, that if He had not taken hold of that opportunity; her resolution to religion had gone on, without entertaining any succeeding Motives of Fancy. This ingenuous acknowledgment might seem to allay, but not wholly to cure this indignity. But their speedy departure was the onely way to calm this distemper. Homewards therefore are we to imagine these two reconciled Lovers returning: mutually relating those sundry Occurrents, wherewith, during their absence one from the other, their sinister Fortunes incountred withall. Which ministred no less content in their way-faring relation, then Scenes of discontent in the pensive re-view of their former Condition. But subsequent joys play the office of speedy Sextons in burying the memory of those that were precedent. The society of love interlaid with occurring stories of delight made their long Journy less tedious. Unexpected Contents are ever cloathed with the clearest habits, and put on the purest paint. These, as they are most real, so they appear ever most visible. The Party cannot conceal them, for his very Countenance upon their first appearance make a discovery of them. It is a Recovery which gives the sweetest sent ; these our Expertest Hunters observe: and the very like effect do all crost Lovers apprehend in the eager Chace or Pursuit of their affection. Panthalia rejoyceth in the recovery of her Acolasto , who in her opinion was irreparably lost: which was no less argument of joy to Acolasto , in the re-seazure of her suspected love: both which contents so sweetly and mutually acting, equally reflected on Pandione as a main Sharer in these injoyments. Long it was not, till their affections thus grounded, were ceremonially confirmed, with the consent and approvement of their Friends. But transitory joys cannot possibly admit a perpetuity. These Nuptial hony Months are oftimes mixed with much aloes: as it fared with this unfortunate Couple. For Acolasto , either forth of a distate which he conceiv'd of Panthalia's Freedom; being such as a moderate or unprejudicate judgment would have ascribed rather to her affability then levity. Or out of his own inconstancy (as if he had taken a Surfet of inclosed grounds) they begun to live apart. In which unhappy division, Acolasto became gracious in the Eye of an eminent Lady, called Morana ; a Person of incomparable State and gallant presence: but infinitely addicted to the Choice and acceptance of Compleat Favorites. This Lady above the rest of her relations held Trimelio and Acolasto in principal esteem; the one being a singular Secretary and of an excellent Dialect: the other of a graceful and winning demean. Both contesting in their assiduate Service, which should appear nearest in her thoughts. But Competitors in relation to Subjects of Love beget ever the dangerousest quarrels. An infinite jealousie chanc'd to arise betwixt these two amorous Favorites, which broke forth into such an irreconcileable heat, as nothing but Fire and Fury breathed from them. Fancy in dependence to a Mistress, especially where Beauty has surprized the heart, will admit no Corrivals. Acolasto to revenge himself for some private affronts done him by Trimelio ; accused him, and not without apparent Cause, as was generally supposed, of his profuse and too liberal report spread abroad to Morana's dishonour. The Substance of which report was this: That his intimacy with Morana, the great Mistress of his affection, had raised it self to that pitch, as Acolasto was but used for a shadow to palliate her designs: but his familiar secresie onely reserved for her private Cabinet: and that his access with much freedom was made feasible to him, even to her lodging Chamber, at all hours . With sundry other vanting expressions, derogating highly from Morana's honour. No sooner came the report of these injurious and ungratefull aspersions to the eare of Morana , a woman of a masculine and vindicative nature, then she became highly inraged, vowing revenge in the extreamest measure; if the words which Acolasto had attested upon due examination proved true. Neither would her impatience permit delay: for the very next morning sending for Trimelio , in the presence of Acolasto his accuser, she accosted him in this manner. Wherein have my Favours, Trimelio , been so profusely scattered, as the too liberall conferment of them might justly redound to my dishonour? Have I ever acted any thing so indiscreetly, that might beget in me an opinion of levity: or so free in my express, as to make you confident of an unbeseeming interest in my affection? was it a gratefull requitall in you, to answer my immerited esteem of your parts with a Calumnious report? Could your easie access promise to your deluded thoughts such success; as your free admittance to a Ladies chamber could not chuse but make you Owner of her Bed? was our affability a Signall of immodesty? In what a miserable Condition be poor women stated, when their very Countenances must be censured; their pleasing demeane traduced, and their smiles, if too freely or frequently bestowed, injuriously taxed? Well, Sir, clear the poyson of this traduce and vindicate mine honour, in justifying your fidelity to the Conviction of your Accuser: else expect an heavy and speedy revenge from the hand of incensed Morana . Trimelio , upon this unexpected regret, became infinitly perplexed; That excellent Forme of dialect wherein he usually flowed; was reduced to a calme, or rather an amaz'd Silence. Not one word could he utter either in defence of his own innocence: or excuse of his rashness. At last recollecting himself with much timidity and weakness of spirit He muttered forth inarticulately some dis-joynted words to this effect: that man breathed not who durst accuse him of any such Crime. Yes, replied Acolasto , here he breaths who dares justifie your dishonour done to this Lady, and will be ready upon your deniall to maintaine it with his blood. Are you my accuser, said Trimelio? No Sir, I appeale to your own Letter: your own hand will impeach you without any other Accuser. And taking a Paper out of his Pocket: Madam, said He be pleased to shew him these lines: and whether he can or no remember his own Character? After She had received the Paper, and cursorily perused it; with a contracted countenane turning her self to Trimelio ; Sir, said She, my question shall be short and effectuall either to cleare or impeach you; resolve me in a word, is this your hand? I cannot deny it, answered Trimelio . Then must Marana conclude, replied She, that thou art an egregious Villain. This Letter here produced, and to one of thy Associats impudently addressed, but by my Faithfull Servant Accolasto's care no less happily then casually intercepted, displays thy guilt and injoyns my revenge. All this while with a dejected Countenance Trimelio after the production of this Letter, fixing his Eyes upon the ground; remained mute, replying nothing either in defence of himself; nor opposition to his Accuser. Which unwonted Silence (for none usually of more volubility in Courtly Rhetorick, nor affectation of discourse then Trimelio ) induced Morana to conclude: that there was more modesty in his Face then his Heart; For the one deblazon'd an apparancy of guilt by an expression of shame; which the other fruitlesly sought to disguise: but the clearness of such odious Crimes, which morall honesty could not chuse but blush at, might not possibly frame for such a distained visage any vizard.    [   Morana's Sentence on Trimelio . ] Prepare thy self then without delay for death: for a lower revenge cannot expiate thy guilt . After which words, laying her Commands upon some select domesticks of her own (Assacinates sufficiently flesht for such actions) forthwith to dispatch him: this Scene was with no less instancy then Cruelty executed. Which she, arm'd with a remorseless hand and a relentless heart, to discover her implacable Fury, redoubled with three mortall stabs with a poniard: upon receipt whereof this unfortunate Favorite presently expired. [   Acolasto resents Morana's cruelty.   ] Acolasto , though seemingly pleased with this act; yet recollecting himself, He had such resentment of the truculency of his merciless Mistress, as he apprehended the danger of his future security. He remembred well how formerly dear Trimelio had been to his Lady, and in how short a space he had closed the freedom of his Comick delights with a fearfull Tragedy. This brought him to a Representment of his own uncertaine Condition, thinking thus with himself: That seeing Morana's favours were so quickly resolved to mortall hate in relation to Trimelio ; what less could be expected by Acolasto , if any new Corrivall should arise, and become an Instrument of his ruine, as he had been by his projectment to Trimelio : He resolved therefore to decline his pursuit after strange mistresses, and his adoration of prohibited beauties, seasonably to endeavour his peace and reconciliation to his late-deserted Panthalia . Which within few daies was no sooner desired, then accepted: no sooner tendred, then admitted. An act of Oblivion was mutually signed of all occasionall distasts formerly commenced: and an happy re-union, after so causeless a division, cheerfully confirmed. This unexpected Juncto gladded Panthalia far above all the joy she conceived in her amorous access to Acolasto . Long did they live together in this Conjugall injoyment: no Remora's to impede the continued Current of their re-united affection. And to return an higher inlargement to the renewal of their Comforts, by the Bequests of some near Friends, whose indeerment and relation to Him, injoyned them to contribute at their deaths to the advancement of his Revenues, their means became much improved; which raised their youthfull Spirits to that unaccustomed port, as it begot in them a profuse and excessive Freedom: the blame whereof, as opinion spread it self, was laid upon Panthalia's delicacy: For Acolasto , after such time as he had sowen his wild Oats in Forraigne Fields, grew so uxorious , as his Course was wholly managed by her Conduct. So strangely became he reclaimed; as from a Favorite of other light Mistresses, he fell to be an obsequious Servant to his own. But to descend from these Divertisements; which, as they were stored with variety and interchange of unexpected Passages, cannot chuse but afford much delight to any equal or well-ballanc'd Judgment; especially considering what near dependence these incidences had to the Subject of our Discourse now in hand: we are now to return to the Series of our History; the various Consequences whereof may justly produce occasional Motives both of Compassion and wonder. We are now to present to your Eye upon a Sable Scaffold erected by an usurping power, an Object of incomparable worth, though accompanied by disastrous Fate: rich in all Ornaments that either Art or Nature could imbellish him withall; and pursued with as much popular hate as ever any Person so highly and deservingly interested in the management of State- affaires to these times incurred: From the infancy of his honour, to his fatall decline we shall here render him, interveining this sad and serious discourse with various passages, worthy the recollection and usefull application of the clearest and most refined Judgments. Who if they have attained to the highest pitch of greatness, may collect by this Great mans fall, how greatness is most subject to a disasterous fate: this we have inlarged with some necessary Cautions or directions how to prevent popular hate (the constantst pursuer of honour) in their height and freedom of Greatness. This Sophronio before these distractions in Candy , was a Person of great eminency; though afterwards popularly branded with Calumny. He was held both at home and abroad of such high abilities, as both for martiall discipline, wherein he retein'd an opinion of singular dexterity; as likewise for State- policy; no man in his time, was accounted his Parallel. For many yeares together He was deputed the Provinciall Governour in Iberia ; wherein he carried his Commands with that justness and irreprovable equity, as none could taxe him, even in his nearest relations, of partiality. In the Field he behav'd himself like an experienc'd Souldier; in the Court like a prudent Senatour. Prompt and acute in preventing danger, and of nothing more conscienciously tender, then in the whole manage of his actions, by just waies to a prudent care in preserving the condigne title of honour. His Commands were evenly ballanced twixt Love and Feare. Wherein, as the [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Levity he exprest to his Souldiers, did not estrange them from an awfull Feare: no more did his well-tempered Severity lessen their love. By an assiduate training and disciplining of his Men, which during his reside in Iberia , were numerously rais'd, and drawn to a Considerable Army, All such as were enrowl'd and had constantly serv'd under his Command, there was not any private Souldier but he was grown so expert in the use of his Arms, and military Conduct in the Field, as he might in relation to his judgement and experience, lead a Compleat Army. [   There was no design of difficulty which these Souldiers from the affection they bore to their Commander, would not encounter. Being ready to teach Hannibal to break Rocks with Vineger   ] In a word, such influence had this equall temperature of Love and Fear wrought upon all those Iberian Forces listed under his Command; as He might confidently aver with that no less affectionate then resolute African ; That he was so dearly interessed and cordially possest of his Souldiers hearts; as no assay were it of never so imminent or apparent danger, which they would not attempt with all alacrity for his sake. Were it to leap from a perpendicular Hill; or from any steep or precipitious Cliffe into the maine Sea; there was none of them from the highest to the lowest, who would decline that inevitable danger, being grounded on his Commands or conducing to his honour. And to give one additament more to his prudence and prowess; though his Prince had deputed him to the government of such a Province; then which none more servile, savage nor cruell; yet in very short time after his Plantation there, by his discreet and awfull management, none became more faithfull, civil nor loyall. Yet for all this bracks are found in the purest Cloaths. Though none in any age more loyall to his Prince, nor Faithfull to the publick State; yet was this Great Patriots Candor and Innocence so eagerly pursu'd by Consular hate and popular heat, as never was any one more sincere, and more traduced: more usefull to the State, and more ungratefully sleighted. Sundry Articles of High Treason were exhibited against him, which were seconded and strongly prosecuted by such, who sat at the Sterne of the State, making it their onely designe to bring them into disgrace; who vyed with them in the management of State-affaires: or who by their abilities out-stript them, and consequently more eminent in the Eye of the Publick. The Particulars of the Charge laid against him were these. First, that he had laboured to weaken the strength and sinews of the Candian State by raising Commotions, and fomenting divisions in the Frontires of their dominion. Secondly, that he had infused poysonous Principles into the bosom of the Prince, highly destructive to the Government of a Politick State: Suppressing by his Power (which they pretended to be seconded and irresistably strengthned by the influence he had over his Soveraigne) all municipall Laws; ancient Priviledges; liberty of Subjects: with whatsoever necessarily conduced to the uniform Order or Constitution of a State. Thirdly, He was accused of Extortion and Corruption in his Course of Judicature (a traduce of all others most injurious:) for never was Aristides held more just, then he approv'd himself in all his Proceedings. Fourthly, of Tyranny and oppression; which his small increase of Revenue clear'd him of: For it appeared, that during all the continuation of his Provincial Government, he was much poorer than when he first entred it: For his Heir, a Gentleman of hopefull parts, was inforc'd after his Fathers Death, to make sale of a great quantity of his ancient hereditary Estate, to discharge his Debts. Lastly, He was tax'd of being profusely free in relation to his Honour; not only for admiring, but sensually pursuing strange beauties: and amongst the rest, of One especially; who as she was espoused to a Person of Honour, so she attested upon her death her innocence; not only in his vindication, touching whom that infamous report was dispersed: but likewise of her clearness and purity in defiance of all the world. To be brief, there was no Crime, that might strike either at Fame, State or Life, which was not with much bitterness and passionate vehemence aggravated. His Prosecutors by way of Plea were Cambriano, Mardanes, Albanus , and Palmeriades . Whereof the Last only shew'd himself temperate, civil and of fair deportment. For the rest, they breath'd nothing but Fire and Faggot. Death was too easy a Sentence for such heavy (and as they term'd them) inexpiable Crimes. But amongst all these, none of his Adversaries more impudently violent than Menippus and Nevio ; the one for exclaiming; the other for commenting what he never either spake or thought. Yea, rather than that malicious Nevio would give way for Sophronio's innocency to pass with impunity; to make good those assertions and ementitious testimonies, which were produced and vehemently pressed against him, He seconded his Informations with apparent Perjury. Whereof he was convinced by Circumstance to his great dishonour, if his seared front had been sensible of any such blemish. But his inveterate hate to Sophronio's person so strangely transported him with passion; as the Title , which he had deservingly stript him of, caus'd him to transgress the bounds of Reason, and in his pursuit of revenge to neglect the Cure of his wounded reputation. But to return you the success of these two malicious Prosecutors, who so furiously run after their own quarrell; you shall know that vengeance dogg'd them at the heeles: and that the Supreme Powers will not suffer their Judgments to slip, though for a season they suffer them to sleep. For the One of these ( Menippus I meane, a sensuall Libertine even in his age) dyed a miserable and infamous death. And for Nevio , then whom none more hatefull, He became through his Contemptible life, by Those esteemed least, for whose service he had been imployed most. A just Censure for such actions of dishonour. Which Time shall sooner surcease to be, then with the File of Oblivion raze out. Suppose now Sophronio , that Mirror of his time for prudence and State- policy, attached, indited and arraigned at the Bar of High Justice: where we are to present him, as his Presence well deserved, bearing himself in a grave and discreet posture; serious and solid in his Answer: and in every particular Article of his Charge so Satisfactory, as none of that Great Auditory heard him, but infinitly suffered with him: and out of a generous and generall compassion, so far as their equall opinions or powers could extend to, acquitted him: holding him so clear of whatsoever had been Objected against him, as none could taxe him Criminally, nor justly conclude him less then innocent; unless his Appellants were highly impudent. But such was the joynt vote of the Patritian Order, seconded with the aery blast of the vulgar; as they proceeded to his Sentence and Censure: imagining, as might be easily gathered by consequent grounds, that their new Constitutions of State could not hold, if he stood up. And that it was far better for One to perish then an Unity; though One in Him was of more worth then the whole Assembly. Truth is, had not Sophronio been prevented by a premature and unsuspected Surprize; Those who were the principall Instruments of his ruine, had fallen into his snare: for the Traine was laid, but the cautelous prevention of the Guilty, became destructive to the Innocent. It was high time then, as they thought, to take Him out of the way; and by his timely remove to lay an easier way to their Foundation of a new Government: so prompt is the braine in designes of blood. With a calm attention He gave eare to the Sentence of death pronounced upon him; without any Change of Countenance at all. Which constancy of his, as some erroneously thought, proceeded not from his own resolution; but from the Confidence He had in Rosicles , his Princes affection. But those hopes, if any such were, prov'd of all others most failing. For though his loyall and devotionall Service had merited more from his Soveraigne, then any Subject within all his dominions: yea, though the Prince himself had been an Eare- witness of all the Articles preferred and pressed against him: and in presence likewise, when this incomparable Statesman not onely made his Reply to whatsoever was objected: but upon his just defence came off with honour: yea, though Rosicles in relation to Sophronio's innocence; publickly protested, that he could find nothing in the whole course of their Proceedings against him, which might render him culpable either of death or defame; being so discreet and conscientiously politick in the Carriage of his affaires during his Provinciall Government, as he might be far sooner admir'd then imitated by those that should follow him. Yet for all this, such influence had some of those State-Sycophants (even those whose religious profession might have exercis'd them in better Offices) over the facile and pliable nature of Rosicles , as upon their discovery of the necessities of the time, the results of the House, and clamours of the People, They wrought so strongly upon him (the best natures are the soonest deluded) as they perswaded Him to Subsigne his death; whose innocence he had so lately attested. An act of high ingratitude, you will say, it was: and He acknowledged no less; bemoaning this Offence, which He held piacular, in the extrems of Fortune with briny teares. And now you may imagine, that this Fury of Hate, which had so strangely fired the hearts of the Senate, would admit no delay; it must break forth with a violent torrent, to the ruine of the Innocent. The Warrant was no sooner signed, then it was with all speed transmitted and delivered to the Warder , in whose custody he remain'd then under restraint: which came quickly (harsh news are ever impt with swiftest wings) to Sophronio's hand; who was at that very time ordering his affairs, and composing his mind against all occurrents. For his better preparation wherein, he was even then reading Seneca's Tract of the Tranquillity of the Mind , when this sad Message came. Which, smiling he entertain'd with this mild reply, after he had seen Rosicles Seal Manual, and subscription to the Warrant: This it is to confide in the arme of flesh, and to rely on humane levity . Having perused the Paper, his Desire was to be left alone; that his privacy might allow him what the world could not afford him. Being thus left to himself; after a serious recollection of his present and approaching condition; calling for pen and inke, he resolved to direct his last addresses to his vertuous Lady, in a Funerall Letter to this effect.  My Deare, thy Sophronio is Sentenc'd to dye; but as thou lovest me, let not this perplexe thee. My Crime is Loyalty; how cheerfull then and expiatory must be that Sacrifice, which must be offer'd up to the last Obsequies of such a Service? Those who dye with honour, though they dye to life, they live to fame. After a long Sea-faring Compass, I am now approaching Harbour: where if my vessell come off with honour, what wouldst thou crave more? I have a Conscience within me, that will witnesse for me, I have been no Servant to time, but to truth. My Principle which I have held from mine infancy, and which I meane to Seal with my blood, was Allegeance : and to dye under that Notion; who can hold it less then a Subjects debt, and in the sufferer a glorious resolution? I have felt the opposition of many furious Assailants; who both in language and private practise to make my actions appeare more odious to the eyes of God and man, have struck highly but fruitlesly at the ruine of mine honour; but their Splene fell far below my spirit: their spite far beneath my scorne. They may triumph in my fall, but never in my shame. And though ingratitude in lieu of my faithfull service, has been lately my guerdon; I shall signe Him to whom I owe my selfe, a cleare and Conscientious pardon. I will not revive it, lest I should reteine too deep an impression of it: and cast a surviving dishonour on his Name who acted it. I am too well known to thy tenderness and goodness, to importune thy Care towards those Living Pledges, sweet innocent Babes which I leave behind me, and must recommend unto thee. To thee I leave them, who doest so entirely love them: and to whom now thou art to performe the Office of a double Parent in nursing and informing them. Farewell, Farewell on earth for ever; till we shall be happily re-united, and without feare of division live together, Thine to death, SOPHRONIO .  With what a languishing and contristate Spirit this good Lady perused these Funeral lines of her dying Lord; it is far easier for the conceipt to imagin, then for any pen to describe. Never was Sorrow more passionately retir'd, nor more cordially silenc'd. But Mercies moulded in the bosom of Tyranny revert into Cruelty. For neither could this Ladies pious tears, nor his approved innocence beget in his relentless Enemies the least sense or apprehension of remorse. Marble is not easily pierc'd; nor the Tigers nature quickly civiliz'd. The Senats instancy backt with Plebeian insolence and implacable Fury would prolong no time for Sophronio's execution: Fearing, as might be thought, lest that hand which had sign'd and subscrib'd his Death, might recall his Doom. So as, after the third day immediatly following the warrant had been delivered to the Warder; a Scaffold, by the Consuls express Command, was erected upon Pharamount ; to which, Sophronio with a strong Guard of Souldiers was conducted. Where mounting the stayrs of the Scaffold with a cheerfull and pleasant countenance, as if he had addrest himself rather for a Festival Solace, than a Funeral Office: Upon his ascent, looking about him with a graceful aspect, he turned himself towards the Seats where sundry Persons of eminent quality had bestow'd themselves: and eying a wonderful confluence of People crowding not only about the Scaffold, but clustring all about the Trees adjoyning to the Place of his Execution; with a setled and composed Demean, he delivered himself in these words: or as near, as the brevity of an exact Character could render it. My Lords, and you Gentlemen who are come hither to be spectators of my death. I am here to be presented for a spectacle of wonder. Being made a Sacrifice of loyalty in relation to my Prince: and an Eye-sore to the State. So as, if Fidelity be a capitall Crime, which never before these seditious times was held one; I must freely acknowledge my self culpable, and consequently a deserving Sufferer: if otherwise, I appeale to your apprroved judgments, if a loyall death be not a Signall action of honour. I am so confident of my reality in the whole carriage of my affaires since my first imployment in the State of Candy ; as I dare attest any Person in this great Assembly, that can justly taxe me of any injurious proceedings against him or any one of his Family. Truth is, I have been personally accused of many, but to this houre never found guilty of any. Sundry Articles, and of high quality objected, and with all Fury pursued; but nothing proved: appearing rather scandalous aspersions, to impeach my Fame, and surprize my person; then grounded allegations to weaken my repute or evince me of treason. I have clear'd my self in all; yet am I found pardonable in none. An inevitable necessity is laid upon me; I must dye: and I embrace my doome cheerfully. It is better for one to perish, then an unity . And I hold my self a light ransome, to redeem my Countreys liberty. But it is much to be feared for that Nation to be accompanied with success, whose Foundation is laid in blood. I have been ever a Faithfull Servant to my Soveraigne: wherein, if I have done too much; it will appeare to the whole world that my recompence in lieu of that service, has been too small. But this fault I impute not to Him, but to them who deluded him. It is easie for cunning men by their evil counsell to have strong influence over Princes Commands when their backs are at wall, and their hopes under Hatches. My wish is, He may raise himself strength from my ashes. I have ever observ'd it, and now found it true by sad Experience, that usurping Powers have their Centre every where, but their Circumference no where. Meer's that transgress their hounds, must not be confin'd. It is the honour of Treason, to sleight the Order of subjection: and out of an audacious contempt to spurne at Command; by making it's own will an irreversible Law. I feare much, lest such State-pioners in these times of distraction, by their lawless fury, should act much mischiefe in the Frontiers of Candy . But I leave it to the Powers above to divert this Catastrophe. This fear which I conceive and by all probable Circumstances divine, proceedes from that entire zeal which my loyall heart beares to the State, for whose pretended safety and liberty I here dye. But I must not be long, lest my delay might beget in you a prejudicate opinion of me touching that, which, I dare attest my frailty, I never had, a fear to dye . One word home-ward, and then to my last home. For my Civile affaires; they are already ordered. As for my dis-consolate Consort, and those tender Pledges of our Conjugall love, my sweet Infants; I Commit them to the protection and providence of Heaven; to comfort and support the One, and in mercy to speak for the other, who know not, poor Babes, to speak for themselves. And now my Good Lords and Gentlemen, hear the last words of a dying man, which in pitty should reteine the deepest impression, because the last Expresses, that ever He shall deliver upon Earth. Be pleased to acquaint the Senat, that the senses of Sophronio's innocence had so compleatly arm'd him, as he durst look death ith face: and entertaine the stroak of the Axe with a smile. Now do thy Office, Executioner. After this, making himself ready, and putting off his doublet, He went towards the Block; where with a stout and undaunted courage laying his hand upon the Edge of the Hatchet: This, said He, is a Cure for all diseases; a receipt against all maladies . This done, by direction of the Executioner; a man of high name, though of vile condition; He cheerfully layd down his Head upon the Block, which was divided from his Body at one stroak It was afterwards by permission, artfully seered to his neck, and conveyed to the Vault where all his Ancestors lay; not far distant from his Mannor-house of Sylviana ; where He was with no less honour solemnly interred, then generally bemoaned. Truth is, his Funerall Farewell seconded with his patient and composed demeane at the time of his death, begot that resentment in those who had formerly been his Mortall Enemies; as his last adue breathed forth with so graceful a passion, enforced teares in their Eyes, who never before that time lodged remorse in their hearts. Yea those, who were the principal Agents and assiduatest Instruments of procuring his Head to be cut off; could with all their hearts have wish'd it on again, when they had duely considered, how the wisdom of that Head, which the Hand of Faction had taken off, might have composed and repaired many Fractures, which the Liberty or rather Anarchy of a distracted State had produc'd. But it was too late to recal what Fate and Plebeian Fury had snatcht away. Sundry papers were pasted and posted up in the eminentst parts of Thamipolis especially near the Marchants Trapeza , containing such inscriptions as these and the like.  "Vaga vulgi, vota vani, Clari clades Coriolani ." For in many places he retein'd the Name of Coriolanus ; with whom he was parallel'd for his brave atchievments, clemency, and actions of honour.  "Saeva plebaei flamma furoris, Laeva patricii pestis honoris."  Peoples heat and Consuls hate Crusht a brave Patritians State. The prudent Senat did not hold it fit that this Act should be exemplified, but upon Sophronio for Example sake only executed: And that no Proceedings after that time should be admitted as legal against any other being prosecuted by Plea in the like manner. And that their Saintly Clemency might to Posterity be commended, it was ordained, that no Action whereof Sophronio stood accused or impeached, should after his death be recorded as Capital, but that the memory thereof should be to all intents and purposes utterly abolished: and that no Person whatsoever should be rendred Criminal or accessory to Treason, being attached upon the same grounds. But though this Law became revers'd, it restor'd not his life; whose ransom might ballance with the Estimate of an Empire. Thus far have we inlarged our Discourse, as it was consistent to our Story, touching the Life and Death of Sophronio ; the only Mirror of that age for Prudence, Courage and Polity. Unthankfully sentenc'd, and subscrib'd to by Rosicles , whose faithful Servant and Creature he had been: and with no less Princely Compassion bemoaned by unfortunate Rosicles after his Execution, for his necessitated Subscription. Being induced by the Arguments of a timing Primat to do, what he in honor, neither could, nor would incline unto. Howbeit this unprincely Act so highly incensed Irina , as she withdrew herself from the Court for many days together;    [  Silence the properest posture for Sorrow, and privacy the fitest Cell to act it in. ] like a pious and compassionate Princess to vent her discontents in private. But we are now to climb up from these lower [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Stiars to higher Stories: and from dependent Ciens (though none of all the Consular Order more eminently qualified, than that Person, whose life and death we have here described) to the Top-branch, even Rosicles himself. Whose unexemplary mis-fortunes, for Annals to all succeeding ages, we have here historically compiled and methodically digested. sentenc'd to death. Such was the implacable enmity of the Synod, and madding Fury of the Plebeian Family towards their unfortuante Rosicles ; as they held it not sufficient to restrain him of his liberty, and strip him of his regal dignity; but to deprive him of his poor life, being all that was left him, and so compleat his misery. And that they might bring this to a more speedy dispatch, they caused an High Court of Justice to be forthwith erected, and this surrounded with Funeral Sables, importing some sad design, which shortly after ensued. Thither was disconsolate Rosicles brought, or uncivilly haled rather by the Consuls command, and after a tedious restraint to ingage his calamitous life to their severe judgement. Active and nimble instruments had the incensed State provided to bring this last work to effect: Amongst which, those whom they principally relyed on, not onely for contriving and drawing the articles of charge intended against him, which were high and heavy: But such as could Rhetorically play the Orators, by withdrawing the affections of that small party which sided with him; as likewise in aggravating the quality of his crimes, which they pretended in the Survey of all Annals, to appear unexemplary: and by that means to make compassion in his case a stranger to the assembly.

Sinonaintes , a smooth Engineer, and of singular trust with Climenes, Chalibetes , an excellent Orator: One, who had Tongue enough, to fortifie an ill cause, and to cloath his pretences in any colour: but the indisposition of his body crossed the intention of his mind; being disabled by sickness, to persue personally the weight of his business, Leuco-Magiris , a contemptible Baudite; who had drunk of all waters, and by running too deep on score, had a little before been inforced to run out of the Country, till treachery brought him into request and inabled him to pay his arreers. But of all others Rabsheda , was designed that Rhadamanth who was to supply the Seat of Iustice; in whom, had impudence and insolence lost their lodgings, they might have easily found entertainment. Suppose him then summoned by this merciless man: where standing before that Predominant Bench, and in the condition of such a prisoner, who called to the bar of justice, might assure himself to be encountered with many profest foes, but few firm friends. Suppose him (I say) though crushed with indignities, with a Princely and Majestick demean, presenting himself in this manner. [   This Hall was built by the Roman Rutilius , where the Candiots had hung up their Ensigns, with other Oval monuments, for signals of their numerous victories against the Illiri ans .   ] Looking first about the Pretorian or Senat Hall a place no less spacious then numerous: and eyeing the great press and multitude there assembled: What means, said he, this confluence of people? They be come (answered Rabsheda ) to hear a Tyrants tryal, a Rebel I can see, replyed Rosicles , but Tyrant I can discover none. Unbosom your self, said Rabsheda , and you will soon discover him, for how should he be accounted less, who in these civil distempers has been the onely Author of the effusion of so much blood, and that of his own people, within this crimson Isle of Candy? What do you mean Rabsheda , said Rosicles , by that Crimson Isle; and by whom was that tincture laid? By your own hand, answered Rabsheda , deep died and embrued in your subjects blood. Upon which words, being with a braving insolence uttered, the incensed Prince raising himself a little upon his chair. Egregious Rebel, said he, has ignorance glazed thy forehead with that impudence, as neither thy Princes presence, nor thy sworn allegeance, can imprint in thee an awfull fear, nor civil reverence? These words breathed forth with such a graceful Majesty, so startled him; as for a good space, they calmed not onely his passion, but silenced his Elocution. Till at last, as might be probably gathered, recalling to mind that great reward which was by the Senat promised him; and seeing himself so strongly flanker'd, and by the souldiers acclamation so highly encouraged; he recovered his speech: and with great boldness calling him to the Bar; A strange summons of a subject to his Soveraign; the Prince much exasperated with this unexemplary insolence told him expresly, that his Soveraignty had mounted a story higher then their commands, and that their new moulded Laws were to stoop to his Prerogative.

A charge of high consequence, being already drawn up, was publickly read, the particulars whereof were these. 1\. That his Government had been tyrannical, in laying insupportable burdens by impositions, imposts, exactions, with other heavy pressures upon his impoverished subjects. 2\. That he bestowed best places on worst men. 3\. That his corrupt councel, had depraved the state, confounded their municipal laws; and consequently destructive to the ancient Rights and Priviledges of their Nation: the fatal issues whereof were generally noxious to the liberty of his subjects, with sundry other Criminations of like nature, and of lower qualification in their measure. All which, with a scornful smile, as objections inconsistent to his pious condition, HE seemingly sleighted, using onely these words: That his Innocence was recorded above their Seat of Justice . But the decision of his cause hung upon the Senats prepensed resolve and edge of the souldiers sword, being sentenced to die, and that before his own Court- gate of Candy-Port ; within the ken of his great Citie Thamipolis : where within few days after, without [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) a resistence (a rare president to all Ages) he was executed, according to his sentence formerly delivered. The Senat onely had this kindness for him, in admitting two Flamins to prepare him before his death. Onixus and Reshu . The latter whereof, though a seeming Saint, nay, opinion'd for a reverend Patriark of their profession, appeared an egregious timist: One who knew well how to close with time, and hugge the shadow of an eminent favorite, for his own interest. For the former, He was no formal, but a serious and sincere professor and on whom this sentenced Prince so much relied; as he derived from his mild and sweet tempered advice much comfort. Amongst many we shall instance this for all. The adjudged Rosicles remaining some few daies after his sentence pronounced in a house of the Jacobins , where He was no less strictly guarded then rigidly used; He began to feel some contests or wrastlings in himself, suggesting to his magnaminous thoughts, how ill it would become him to subject his head to the Hatchet of a slavish Baudit, and without resistence to submit himself to the execution of so unjust a Sentence. And such deep impression had this debate wrought upon him, as he became half resolved to divert the hand of Justice by his personall resistance until the morning before he dyed, having acquainted Onixus with his purpose; He was by his grave and discreet advice, with tears from his eyes plenteously flowing, disswaded from entertaining any such thought: For, said he, this act would drive you into fury, and consequently discompose your soul for her preparation to an higher seat. Desist, said he, I beseech you, from any such thought; but recommend your case to the Providence of Heaven, whether it be to life or death. To which pious and prudent councel he cheerfully submitted. And in very truth, it had prov'd a vain assay to have made resistance, seeing there were sundry engines, and those invisibly contrived, purposely prepared to hale him to the Block if he had offered the least force or manner of opposition. The time now approaching, a strong Squadron of Stratiots were appointed to guard him along through the ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [ ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) This Theriorophie was an impark'd ground be longing to the fraternity of Jacobins : through which Rosicles was conducted to the scaffold.   ] Theriotrophie , [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) bearing a spacious vale and the Court chace; and so by ascent to the Amphitheatre; through which he was brought down to the Scaffold; where with a pale visage, but Princely presence, casting his eyes upon the multitude of People (then which a greater confluence had been seldome at any time seen) He declared himself without the least diminution of state or courage, in this sort. Good people, You are come hither to see your Prince become a Sacrifice to his Subjects. A person held unfitting to live, because he scorned to purchase evil mens love. I am guilty of many crimes, if you believe my accusers; Tyranny especially. But a dying man may for pity sake find ears to receive his Apology. Here I stand before God and Man; where I appeal to the whole World, from whence I am going; And to Heaven, whereto my hope is I am coming: That I never to this hour unsheathed my Sword to shed the blood of any Subject from the highest to the lowest. Impunity in neglect of my own safety has prov'd to my self a Tyranny: but my charity forgives them freely. I must ever bemoan the Blood of ONE, whose Death by inforcement, seconded with the perswasions or impostures rather of Timing Parasites, my Hand unthankfully subscribed. Never did subject merit more of Princes affection, and receive for his service a more undeserving guerdon. Oh, that my tears could rinse or raze forth the memory of so unhandsome an action; or expiate the guilt of such a crimson crime! In this my last farewel and adieu to the World, I cannot but stand amazed at the infelicity of our Family, since our first plantation here in Candy: where we are become strangers to our own, and bemoaned more by strangers then our own. Long time has this sad onmious Cloud hung over our house: Be it Heavens pleasure at last to disperse it. Never did Royal Race since the foundation of Candy , fall into like misery: But there is an instrument ( pointing at the Axe ) that will shortly ease me of my sufferings. If there be any Member of the Senat here present, I salute him in the name of that whole Representative Body, assuring him in them, and them in him, that they could not be more ready in giving, then I in forgiving their severe sentence. But Mercy is seldom shown, where pity tooke no place. But I have been dealt withal too short, to continue my discourse long. Then taking his leave of the Gentlemen of his Chamber, and of his facetious friend Parthenius ; with eyes Elevated to Heaven, he subjected his Head to the trembling hand of the Executioner; who performed his Office with more fear then skill. His Body was some few days after (being first made a Mercenary Spectacle to the people) without any solemnity at all, privately interred. Such was the immerited fall of unfortunate Rosicles . Then whom none ever more justly governed, nor more deservingly to be beloved; who became more disloyally treated, more scornfully deserted. Now it might be asked, how it could possibly come to pass, that in so populous and confluent a City no hand should be lifted up in defence of his innocence: And there is an apparancy of reason for it. Those who stood well affected to the Royal Cause, were but few, and those naked: Whereas the disaffected were many, and those compleatly armed. So as tears and groans were the best supplies their feeble forces could contribute to his relief. But indeed there was no impede greater to Rosicles success, nor wrought more to his disadvantage, then his subsignation to Sophronio's death. This it was that begot a distrust in some, who could with all their hearts, through the disgust they received from their present inverted Government, to have changed faces, and wholly adhered to the Prince, had not this jealousie possest them: imagining, that it could not be safe for them to confide in him, who had subscribed against his own resolution and publike protest, to the death of so faithfull a servant.    [  Saepe justitiae injusta redit Comes Sententia. For suffering an unjust judgment upon another, himself was brought to suffer by an unjust judgement. ] What might a Proselyte foe expect, when a loyal subject fared so ill? This it was which begot him the greatest Odium ; being in every mans mouth, and consequeutly a precipice to his proceedings. Sundry menacing presages there were of his approaching ruine, before his death; discovered by several apparitions seen in the air: As terrible armies skirmishing directly over the seat of his chief city Thamipolis . Bloody Streamers with apparent models of Funeral Scutcheons, indented with Gules and Sanguine Characters, visible and legible. Two Moons of different magnitude. Mixendes an eminent Peer of Candy , riding abroad to take air in a stately Chariot, drawn along with six gallant Flander Mares , having onely Aniel , a Groom of his Chamber opposite to him in the end of his Chariot: The Mares suddenly staid and would go no further, though his Charioter with the help of his Postillion, used all the art and force he could to drive them forward: upon which unexpected stand, Aniel , as one wonderfully amazed, suddenly cried out; My Lord, What Woman is that sits there beside you? Mixendes , though at first he discovered nothing, became suddenly sensible of the danger of this imposture: for his Heels were presently struck up and hoisted to the inner top of the Chariot, with his Head groveling below. Having with much difficulty recovered and raised himself, by the assistance of his astonished Groom, they joyned both together to fasten upon that apparition, which seemed to them a real woman, intending to pinch her; but this phantasme, or whatsoever it might import, with a terrible flash of fire and hideous voice suddenly vanished: But not without apparent hurt to the Charioter, having his Leg broken in the very Box where he sate, from whence he had not removed, nor used any agitation nor motion at all. The Postillion likewise became strangely distempered. The guider of the Chariot being pitifully maimed, shortly after dyed: Whose body after his death, either by inchantment, or some other occult malady, grew as black as pitch. This Mixendes , being one in the lower list of the late created consuls, was accompted by some to be privately an active complice of Rosicles ruine, and that this accident befel him, purposely to caution him of his transgression: though others have since that time vindicated his honour from that aspersion; and that it was an act of Witchcraft occasioned upon the dereliction of his Lady. These were rare occurrences, but no way comparable to those strange prodigious births: terrible to the eye of nature; which were produced at that time, and could presage nothing less then some fearful unaccustomed alteration; whereof this amongst many. In the West part of Candy , as is reported to have hapned sometimes upon the like occasional mutations in the Confines of Gascoigne , a Female child was born, that from the Belly upward was a Twin, having two heads, two breasts, and four arms; and the one part did that which the other did not: So that whilest the one did eat, the other would not; and whilest the one slept, the other waked. And having lived in this manner (as a Prodigy to Nature) for some certain time, the one died, the other surviving; which afterwards through the stench of the other died also. That which by this prodigious birth, had been formerly predicted, was by as fearful an issue not long after seconded, in production of those state combustions whereto no age was ever exemplary. After Rosicles death, the Cypress trees, Laurels, and Palmato's which in that Country were of plenteous growth and surpassing height, whol lye withered. Thus by the change of one, was the state of Candy quite changed; the face of the Court disfigured, and a flourishing government into an Anarchical condition reduced. For the ancient Peerage, whose descent and desert might justly record them in the catalogue of Honour, either through discontent or ripeness of age were expired. Amongst which Lycorus, Merannes, Arnoldo, Tutonus, Trevenco, Polidon ; leaving those to steer the state, who preferred their own interest before the interest of the publick. As for that new Mintage of Nobility, extracted from the creation of Climenes ; those that were the graver, and in their qualification accompted wiser; imployed their time in incroaching, and inhancing their revenues, and inlarging the priviledges of their Mannors: Whereas the younger Fry were for undertaking Duells in defence of their Mistresses. Which light skirmishings, being neither much fatal nor fearful, were the onely signals of their valour, as Rings, Gloves, and Ribbands, the richest Trophies of their Honour, which mushrump-gallantry ran all along in a blood for many ages together; making good that Philosophic all Maxim: "That the Corruption of one was the Generation of another. The nature of things, through the depravation or degeneration rather of times growing such, that whereas a good man is joyned with a bad, the bad is not bettered by the good, but the good corrupted by the bad. Thus fared it with this innovated state of Candy . in his lineal-regal estate, being strengthned by the assistance of the Eluri and other frontier Scythians (a people that were ever held fast foes, but failing friends) but Princes in their distress must be content to lean on weak Crutches, invaded Candy . In a fair Battalia were the two Armies martially disposed, and their Tents orderly picht near to a strong and well fortified City, called Reus Court , anciently Saly Castro . Hopes equally breathing, half of the day was this Battalia in dispute; wherein Charicles by the singular prowess and dexterity of his Pedeantry, being all of them excellent Archers, had long time the better, till overpowered by continual recrutes, and the treachery of Leontius ; who had the principal command and charge of the Scythian Caualry: and hovering remissely upon an hill, above the Armies, behaving himself more like a Spectator then a Warrier , never so much as ingaging his person to the necessitous assistance of Charicles : He with his Forces became wholly routed. Albeit the Prince, even in his greatest distress, considering how his personal security and regal soveraignty were both at the stake, with an incomparable spirit charged twice or thrice quite through his Enemies Army, continuing in the field without the least decline of courage, so long as there appeared the least hope of subsistance, or the Cavalries assistance; whose perfidious Commander had been too highly corrupted, to forget the reward of his service. Thus was the unfortunate Charicles , as if an ominous Cloud had constantly hung over his family, inforced to leave the field, being so deserted of his own by this discomfiture, as very few or none were left to accompany him in his flight. The Enemy had his scattered Forces long in chace, taking many prisoners; and such as were of eminent quality, as might be probably conjectured, seeing the most of his party, unless they were of the ruder sort of Scythians , had been persons qualified and of extraction, whereas the adverse party were generally Plebeian and Mercenary. But in their pursuit, their eagerest hunt was after Charicles , by whose surprize, the Senat conceived them to be secured from danger, and freed from the attempts of any invasive pretender. And that they might be more speedily seized of their prey, it was their prime care to have all the ports laid; their stratagems with much secrecy contrived, their Ambuscado's set, and sundry parties of Horse every where dispersed and disposed for the taking of this deserted Prince. But for all this they mist their aim, for the providence of heaven was such (an act which cannot be too much admired) Charicles escaped their politick designs; and whereas there appeared no visible probability of refuge or receipt; He found for the time a convenient harbour, to decline his inclosing danger, by such strange means and instruments as shall be related hereafter. the Enemy; was in a Pilgrim habit, Hospitably received and seasonably secured, beyond all expectancy by Candiope . of all hope or visible help, have escaped in their imminency of dangers the implacable fury of the enemy, being reserved, no doubt, by Divine Providence for some future ends. This might be instanced to life in the present condition of distressed Charicles ; the issue whereof closed in this sort. Candiope , a Lady lineally-loyally descended; being both by extraction from her family, and education from her infancy so affected; Walking one morning early in a Grove; whereto for her private retirement she usuall frequented, and wishing nothing more out of the loyal fervour of her desires, then to hear the event of that great Battail at Reus-Court , with the good success of the Prince, whose restauration she unfeignedly besought. It was her fortune in the tract where she walkt, being not far distant from the publick road, to meet with one in a Palmers weed, fixing his dejected eys on the ground, as if some sad mischance had befaln him: or as one weary of earth, resolving to measure out his Grave, and to play the Sextons part before he dyed. Long was it ere she could awake him out of this his melancholy dump, or pensive amaze, so strangely extasied seemed he to be, as nothing appeared in him saving motion that might argue him to be living, or for the present capable of respiration. At last drawing nearer unto him. Good sir, said she, what is it troubles you? What misfortune has befaln you, that it should have such strong influence over you, in writing your discontents in such deep Characters of sorrow? Alas, Madam, replyed He, it were a fruitless discovery, to impart our griefs where there is no hope of remedy. My wounds, with many others, rankle too sore to expect a present cure. Candiope collected by these words, that all things had not faln out well at Reus-Court , with much importunity therefore she desired to know of him, whether he had been personally ingaged in the battail or no, and what the success thereof might be? With a deep scalding sigh, we are all wholly lost, said he . Our Prince utterly routed, his hopes expired. The softness of your Sex, and affability of your nature may retain that temper, as it may afford compassion to our forlorn condition; for as yet we have hardly found it. Wo is me, answered Candiope , who might he be that was the Agent of this sad scene of his infilicity? The probable ground of his misfortune, replyed the Palmer, arose from the treachery of Leontius ; a principal commander of the Scythian Cavalry, by whom, he with his associates were wholly routed. And that this disaster proceeded from Leontius treason might be hence conjectured; for after the battel was ended, and he amongst others surprized, his gentle usage and easie confinement by the Enemy, discovered to all the world his secret treachery. But what is become, said Candiope , of distressed Charicles? Of a potent Prince, replyed he, he is now made a poor Pilgrim; a fugitive deserted of his own, and nothing but a meer shadow of hope to support him. A weak supportance, Heaven knows, said the Lady: Oh that I might have the honour to give him harbour; with what prompness and fidelity should my best endeavours answer it? You may perchance replyed he, have the occasion, and he the good fortune to pertake your assistance; for his hapless condition must procure harbour in one place or other, or we must conclude him lost for ever. Mean time, Madam, I must ingeniously acquaint you, seeing your noble disposition steers your course that way, how I am become His Highness Almoner or necessitous purveyor, while he in a disguised habit acts the sad part of a disconsolate wanderer. Thus has our condition, which formerly hath been a stranger to servile ends; or to what must now oblige us, beholdingness, injoyned us to submit to the necessity of Fate; and to beg releif with silence, when our language cannot in modesty find a tongue to express our necessity. Wo is me for you, said the tear-swoln Lady, that ever your Prince should be brought to that exigence. But your pale visage with other apparent arguments of your infeebled condition, stand in need, as I conceive, of more relief from a bountiful hand; then of verbal compassion from a pitiful mouth. These words that come from us are but airy expressions to wasted spirits. Painted meat to a pensive Pilgrim: Be pleased, Gentle sir, for by what title to distinguish you, I wholly know not, to take a repast at my fathers house, in this next Grange here adjoyning, where I can promise you security; though it may be no such equipage as may any way suit with a person of your quality. This curtisie could not otherwise chuse but be received with infinite acception; to him especially and his distressed consorts, who had not onely found necessary relief, but even humane pity a stranger to their misfortunes, As they were thus conversing, and Candiope resolved to bestow her care upon his accommodation, by conducting him to her fathers house, (a [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) continent repose for a wearied Spirit) where she might not onely receive further intelligence touching Charicles condition, whose safety she so much tendred; but afford all competent supplyes to this disconsolate Palmer, as his present necessity required. As she was, I say, bestowing her whole care and ingenuous indeavours upon this Office of Piety this signal freedom of Hospitality, she might hear from the skirt of the Grove a pitiful voice (a voice well known to the Palmer, though it rendred a strange accent to the ear of the Lady;) So full of passion appeared every expression from the language of that sorrowful person, as none could do less then commiserate his sad condition; upon the hearing of those pressing grounds of his complaint and personal resentment. The words, as they were by him passionately delivered, and by her no less pitifully received, were these. O Heavens! When will these cloudy dayes close with a clear evening? Must this black cloud hang for ever over our unfortunate house? Must our disasters fall thus upon us in a continued torrent to all succeeding Ages? Must Theatres be erected onely for acting our tragedies? Must the fame of our family be quite razed forth of the Annals of posterity? Is there any such close crime known onely to the eyes of Heaven, but shut from the knowledge of men; whereof our House hath been highly conscious, and as yet remains unexpiate, and consequently the occasional ground of our misfortunes? Oh, may these tears of an innocent Prince, rinse the guilt of a nocent Progenitor! for any part I appeal to the powers above whereon depend the Foundation and Mutation of States, if ever any act of folly since my infancie merited from the hand of Fortune such infelicity. Lay thyself open to the whole World, and make them thy judges, who most hate thee, and least value thee, or those demerits in thee, and let them freely discover, if any act were ever by Charicles done, that should make him thus undone. Candiope at the name of Charicles , being not able to contain her self any longer, interrupted these passionate complaints, saying: Wo is me for thee, Noble Charicles; then whom never any distressed Prince diserved better, and in his pursuit of a just claim succeeded worser. Let us draw nearer, said she to the Palmer; Why should he be thus deserted, and pertake no sociable comfort to allay his distemper . CHARICLES had no sooner got a sight of them, then rousing and raising himself from the shady covert where he reposed; as if he had not been the same man, whom his sad complaints had so lately discovered of all men most unfortunate; and with a cheerful countenance looking upon Molinutus (for so was the Palmer called.) It was your Office, said he , Molinutus, to play the Purveyer and not a suiter: Our mispent times will admit of no Mistresses . Afterwards looking aside upon the Lady, then whom none of a more becoming [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) nature: Excuse me, Madam, said he, if I sport with my misfortunes, My low repose, and leane repast require some expediences to repair the ruines of a late shaken fortune . CANDIOPE fixing her eyes intentively all this while upon his meagre countenance, vyed in tears with his words; and at last falling on her knees. Dread Leige, said she, lately, but all too soon, has your poor Handmaid heard of your great disaster.    [   Tempore & Medio, in omni Malo fruimur remedio. ] But what is it that Time and Opportunity may not recover? Fortune ows your Highness as much as she has taken from you. Sir, it has been your hard and heavy state to suffer by a disloyal enemy; and from an absolute power to fall upon such a precipice of misery, as no age can present a parallel, nor to a Prince so well deserving, a catastrophe so tragically fatal. But as it hath been your great unhappiness to decline from so high a pitch of regality (which decline shall not be, I hope, of long continuance) so shall I ever hold it to be the happiest occasion that hath been at any time presented me, to become an unworthy instrument to your security. The place, Sir, whereto you may with much safety retire, is near adjoyning; and wherein you may injoy your own commands with all freedom. Your place of repose is my fathers house; wherein you may be accommodated with all conveniences, though not sutable to your quality, yet with such a subjects welcome as his care of your safety shall demonstrate his fidelity. Your Highness shall need no other purveyor then our own family; nor any other securer then the pledge of our own lives, which shall be devotionally imployed to do you service. Is it possible, said He, that Heaven can reserve any Family so faithfull to One so unfortunate; and on whom such sinister occurrents have acted their worst of Fury? [  Much safer then a higher Protection, whose reliance had been his ruine. ] Go to, Molinutus , we will confidently commit our selves to the Charge of this affable and compassionate Lady, who openeth her breast so affectionately to the resentment of our misery. Such freedome of language, accompanied with such a fair  & debonair Carriage, cannot chuse but promise us safety, if we may be capable of it, after so hot and hostile a pursuit. Along they resolve to go with the Lady to her Fathers Grange, where they were with all amicable hospitality received, and with all such accommodations suited as their private Family could afford them. For inlarge them further, they wisely would not, lest their entertainment might be suspected. After their some dayes reside in that affectionate Harbour, contriving what way were best to take for his safe and speedy Convoy to Ferrara , whereto he bent his course: Candiope a faithfull Secretary in all his assayes, bethought her self of an expert and trusty Pilot, one whom the Favours of her Family had formerly obliged, who had pitch'd his resolution for that coast within few dayes after, with whom she dealt so seriously and secretly, in relation of her interest and confidence in him; as she contracted with him for their conduct to Ferrara : in which voyage she intended (so tender she was of the Princes safety) to become both an Assistant and Associate. The prefixt time was designed, and all things prepared for their passage. Into the ship with much privacy, and so disguised, as probably appearing without discovery, were Caricles, Molinutus and Candiope received; but no sooner imbarked and ready to hoise up saile, then one Phereclus a Captain, designed by the Senate to guard that Port, and to take account of all such Passengers as were to take shipping there, with a surly and imperious demean opposed their admittance; acquainting Dioscurus , Master of the ship, that he was personally authorized to make search, and due examination take of all such persons as surreptitiously (for so he term'd it) made their way from that coast; especially at that time, when such enemies to the State were known to be stragling abroad. For whose attach and apprehension he himself with other prime Commanders were to those Ports nominally assigned. But Dioscurus a person of a stout and resolute spirit, wholly slighted his braves, telling him that his ship was his house, and those whom he had received into it were his Family: whose safety he was bound in honour to defend: he wished him therefore to desist from making any attempt, lest his resistence might casually ingage his person with all such as should assist him to inevitable hazards. Upon these words the Captain shewed his Commission, imagining that the power and validity thereof would divert all opposition, and give him ready way to execute his commands. But he found it much otherwise, for Phereclus could not be more speedy in pulling out his Commission, then Dioscurus was for hoisting up Sail, and lanching forth into the Main, attesting his confidence with a volley of shot, taking so his leave with much alacrity of the coast of Candy . Within few weeks after, being favoured with prosperous gales, they arrived safely in Ferrara ; where we will leave him a Pensioner to the State; and recounting his misfortunes to the incloistered Queen his disconsolate Mother. Thus have you heard how Charicles beyond all hope, by the private Conduct of Candiope , escaped the pursuit of the enemy. And to return you an Abstract of the miseries of this Family, we may here in sable colours deblazon these sad accidents of Armory in the ruines of a royall-declining Family: then which none more highly deserving, nor more unhappily decreasing; and all this in a very few years compleated. For what miseries more lineally linked to one House, or more successively continued? you have heard how Basilius , who succeeded Athalia , or as we have originally styled her, Bellingeria , was strangely, and not without jealousie of his subjects, dispatched; his eldest Son Cyrenius , a Prince of excellent hopes, not without suspicion of poyson, prematurely removed; his younger Brother Rosicles , as you have heard, before the eyes of his people, the face of his eminentest City, and at his Court gate wofully slaughtered, his Son Charicles treacherously deserted, discomfited, remaining exiled; his Widow-mother incloistered, and the memory of that Royal Race by the Senates express decree, to be quite extinguished and razed out of the Catalogue of Honour, as persons incapable of bearing any office in the Common-weal. So as there remained no hope of a new being or breathing to the revivall of their Phaenix ashes, unless some invisible hand far above all humane expectance should interpose it selfe, and in mercy raise it from the rubbish of division, and by degrees restore it, miseries of an innovated Government. observation in all States, that they remain less secure, when they promise to themselves most security. This might be manifested to all Governments ; but especially where Usurpation puts in for a Title. Wherein, admit there were no Heir Apparent to make his Claim, there would be a Latent Power to take revenge. So it appeared in this State-Theatre; though Candy had exiled her Foes, she retained Fears. Civil Wars betwixt Climenes, Bellonius , and Lamachus reduce this distempered State to miserable distractions. For this confused Aristocracy consisting neither wholly of Peers nor Plebeians , but of a promiscuous Society; begun at last to have a resentment of their translated Government: with what felicity accompanied the harmonious union of a well-temper'd Monarchy; with the disasters that usually occurred where numerous Commanders burdened the State with distemper'd humours by their plurality. Subjects easily shake off the yoak of Soveraignty, when their Commanders be many. One or none, sayes C aesar . None but One, sayes the Usurper . None rather then One, sayes the Leveller . Thus Government deprived of one legal-Lineal Soveraign, became wholly irregular. The issue whereof may be clearly instanced in this headless State of Candy . Bellonius was a person (as hath been told you) of an active hand, but defective head-piece, a stout spirit, but shallow intellect, fitter for action then design: one who could do much, but speak little, and of that little, small to purpose. Infinitely serviceable had he been to Climenes in all his undertakings, and incomparably prosperous in his atchievements, being in all those Civil Wars commenced against Rosicles and his successor Charicles made Generall over all the State-forces, and under whom Climenes , during all that time, acted onely as private Commander. But Climenes taking notice of his weakness, but never till the heat of the day was past, apprehends a disgust concerning his contracting a marriage or alliance, as he pretended, with an eminent person, who had held a correspondence formerly with Charicles . This was easie for him to do, having by this time insinuated himself into the esteem and favour of the Army, by great rewards, full pay, and fair quarter. Bellonius recalling to mind what service he had done for the Publick, stood for a while in resistence, as a Champion in defence of his honour, armed with more Fury then Patience, Prowess then Prudence. Verona his Lady extracted from a noble and couragious Family, incouraged him highly in these actions, assuring him that the memory of his exploits could not but remain a deep impression in the State, and Souldiery too, with whom he had so resolutely ingaged his person, and exposed his safety to the desperatest attempts. And so unmindfull was the State, Senate and Souldier of his former ingagements, and so indifferent for his welfare, as they left him to himself to sink or swim. But of small avail is Valour without Assistence; Price and Reward had made him incapable of Revenge, Truth is, Bellonius had formerly good opportunity for preserving his Fortunes, Freedome and Honor, and of averting that ominous fate which hung over his Family; but by neglecting it, he threw himself with all these into an inevitable precipice. His onely hope, amidst these extreams, which his declining greatness depended on, was a New Convene of the late adjourned Synod, summoned to assemble the first moneth of the year ensuing; the issue whereof, after our relation of Lamachus condition, shall appear in every circumstance to life portrayed.    [   This Gentleman by his infinite industry and studious privacy, raised his improvement to a high proficience in political and [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) wise knowledge; which he afterwards imploy'd to his great advantage.  ] Lamachus was a Gentleman of good Extraction, great Industry, and singular Animosity, the very right hand to Climenes in all his atchievements, but sinister to Charicles in all his proceedings. After the brunt of these Wars, and much blood inhumanely shed, he appeared the onely man of merit and esteem in Climenes account. No honour nor reward held sufficient to gratifie his service: Nay it was very observable, that Climenes , after such time as his fortunes had raised him to the absolute Soveraignty of an Arbitrary power: a step higher then ever distressed Charicles could ascend, and held to bear the face of a Tyrannick Government, during the unfortunate reign of those lineally descending Princes. After this height of his commands, I say, whereto his numerous victories had perch'd him, and wherewith this strong alliance had irresistibly setled him: Climenes , who partak'd no less of Fox then Lion , was never known to meet Lamachus without an indeered embrace, or veneration rather, as both his demean and expresses signified; saluting him not onely by the name of fellow Souldier, but of Prince, Champion, and Chieftain of his Army: without whose help, the whole fabrick of that State had shrunk under its own Grandeur. For he had got the art of shaping himself to any feature, having compassionate eyes to vie in tears with the Crocodile, and deceiving Fauns to gloze with the Hyene . Now the strength of his alliance derived from the persons with whom he matched were these: Lucapius espoused the eldest; a gallant jovial Lady, who in her very posture knew how to personate her qualified honor, and how to ingratiate an obsequious servant: though in the end she became an incomparable Convert; being one, to whom the discovery of her Fathers tyrannick actions appeared most odious. Fotoweldus took the second; a young Foster-mother of strange opinions. Seblasius the third; a modest Maid, and of a composed carriage. The fourth and last was matched to Chirus ; one whose accidental infirmities had made useless for a Nuptial Bed. These became additaments to his swelling Power; but nothing in comparison to the influence he had over his numerous Army. Upon his confidence whereof he became transported to such unbounded height (an humor commonly incident to those who rise from lower grounds to mountanous fortunes) as he grew infinitly apt to pick quarels at his best friends; being such, from whom he had received formerly his strongest assistance; and to whom he had expressed seemingly his nearest indearments. Amongst whom, howsoever he pretended, none appeared more odious to him then his sometime bosom-friend faithfull Lamachus . Which distast arose from Lamachus just opposition, and from this occasion. Climenes arched thus with strong alliance, on whom he had conferred the eminentest Offices and places of Command within the whole Island; as likewise with other considerable Forces, understood sufficiently how nothing now remained undone for compleating the absolute work of his Soveraignty, whereto his ambitious thoughts with much politick secrecy aspired, saving onely the Title of Regality: which though he seem'd outwardly to decline, there was nothing that he did more inwardly desire. He perceived upon vote how Lamachus was the onely man who opposed the conferment of that Title; which he objected, Climenes could not with honour accept: having before the face of his Army disavowed the acception of any such style: for otherwise the true lineal Regal Race had never been extirpated, nor their memory extinguished. 2. That an Aristocratical and no Monarchical Government was intended in all their proceedings; and this sworn to, if either Fidelity or Oaths could oblige them. 3. That he could not see but as many of them had been equal sharers in the hazard; so they might by Law of Arms become equal sharers in the quality of Honour. These objections were with more boldness pressed, then they could be possibly by his weak strength or assistance seconded. For though sometimes his fair usage and stout courage had strongly possest him of the hearts of the Souldiery, his late retirement and privacy, by his affecting a rural life, had quite estranged their endeerments from him, being onely devoted most to his service, whereby they had most hope of pay: which Climenes spirit to his great advantage ever strove to make good; for though his Exchecquer grew lean, being exhausted by sundry unfortunate attempts, pursued to his apparent dishonour, with the loss of his eldest and experientest souldiers: yet such was his ambition, cloathed with an avaritious disposition, which had sprung to that height, as he would digg Pluto out of Hell for gold, as exactions and onerous imposts, unknown to the State of Candy , before his time, returned ever fresh and free supplies to the daring Souldier, on whose shoulders he reer'd the structure of his usurped honour. Neither did it much trouble him to impair the Subjects state, so he might improve the Souldiers strength, whose sinews were his supportance. Now, those bold expresses of Lamachus could not be so privately delivered, but they were as soon discovered. Climenes gathered from hence how the game went. This it was which broke the long continued League betwixt Climenes and his Chieftain Lamachus (for so was he wont to call him:) and to expedite his revenge, he adviseth with his Councel, depraved and active enough to put on his design, though his own vindicative spirit needed no such fiery Instruments, how and in what manner he might requite his kindness; which his incensed thoughts prompt him to answer with all violence, as appeared afterwards by sundry particulars of high consequence. Climenes could not be readier to propose, then these vicious Councellors were to suggest: It was revenge which he pursued, and they to time it, were as apt to excite him to it. Themistocles saying pleased these corrupters of Justice better then the impartial censure of that just Father, who being requested to bear himself indifferently in his censure, answered, Be it farre from me not to pleasure my friends in all things . This fire burst out into that violent and impetuous heat, as his first design was, to clip Lamachus wings by abridging his power; which he executed to purpose, by taking from him the Command which he had given him in reward of his hazardous service over the Epirian Horse, a great addition to his strength and annual revenues, which dishonour so highly trenching upon Lamachus , this subtile Sinon, Climenes pretended to be the Act of his Councel, and not of his, which he was pleased to signifie upon every occasion; never meeting Lamachus without a dissembling hugge, and a treacherous imbrace. Neither could he, for all his subtilty, so palliate the inward hate he bore him, but even in Table-discourse he would make Lamachus usually the subject of his Story; inquiring how he bestowed himself in his Country life, and what imployments so deserving and active a Spirit could address it self to, being so full of heroick thoughts and matchless gallantry. And being then answered, 'That he had got into the esteem of a rare Limner, and an excellent Florist: Go to, replied Climenes , let him ply his work, and fall to his setting of Citrons, and Melons, and Pumpions; but I could wish that precious Wall-flower to beware, lest his dainty Griffs, like ambitious Ciens, grow above their due stature and proportion, lest the cunning Gardiner cause me to play the [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=18010001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE497C5&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Primer.' Thus was this politick Usurper, who of a Plebeian Souldier was become an absolute Commander, apt to play the Imposter with his best Friends. Notwithstanding all this, though Intelligence abroad, and Assistance at home, might seem to secure him against the policy of all private designes, or power of publick attempts; yet what security, where there lodgeth a secret enemy? There was a Foe within him, though he had no visible hand to assail him. For all the happiness he could promise himself in this assumed freedom of his infant Soveraignty, consisted in the injoyment of a confined Liberty: His very Pallace became his Prison, and himself a Jaylor to himself. Rare were his visits into the City, for he knew well how the Citizens did generally hate him, and that his own ears could not chuse but be witness of their odious censure. And for his Summer Progresses, they were accompanied with such fears & jealousies, as every Bush represented to his feavourish thoughts a Bugbear. Thus were his Recreations made his Afflictions; this bulk of honour a burden to himself; though sometimes amongst his Infantry he would pretend to mirth, purposely to delude the conceit of a Court- visitant. As for his princely Port, (if penury might be held princely) the face of his Court presented so mean a garb, as it relished no more of State, then his imposthum'd heart of Grace. But we are to return now to that grand Convene, whereof there was such great expectance; but what this Mountain brought forth, you shall hear in order, as things occurred, duly related. [   Dies Mercurialis maxim e fatalis, quia eo die gravissima Incolis Candiae obtigisset clades. Annal. Cand.  ] The first day of their Convene had been ever held fatal and ominous, from that great Massacre acted under Leopaldus . But observation of dayes was by them accounted superstitious. Climenes , as became a profest Zelot, whereto none ever more publickly pretended, nor more covertly dissembled; with farre more privacy then state entred the Pr aetorian or great Hall; and after him the body of the whole Assembly, a gallant prudent Synod, distinguished into two eminent Societies, of Lords and Commons. Wherein you are to note, that those were only Titular Lords, and nominally so created by the hand of the Sword, but not by descent, some few only excepted; who standing upon their priviledge of Birth, held it a derogation to their honour, to be ranked among those who were only Titular. For those Mushrom surreptitious Peers might be, for their denomination, properly compared to those Flyes bred neer to the River Hymerus , that were but of one dayes continuance, nay, no sooner bred then dead:    [   Quorum Familia sicut ignota, ita Progenies eorum an legitima, a plerisque fuit ambigendum.  ] So as in very deed in their discoverie of the Accedents of Armory, they might justly acknowlegde themselves more beholden to their Titles of Honour by Accident then Antiquity. Whereof one of that prime House so highly prized himself in his late acquired purchase of Honour, as he stick'd not to vie with the chiefest of the Peerage, yet was his extraction well known to all the City, being found in his Infancy laid swathled in a Church-yard, left wholly to the care and provision of the Parish.   [   Alii enim in Coemteriis impliciti Cunis, alii in publicis viis sine integumentis reperti fuerunt nudi, in Sacrarum aedium liminibus alii, in agris & areolis Hortorum alii, Parochiali Curae traditi, ut nullius filii. ] Others likewise of this leaven there were, who in their childhood had been found without succour or harbour in the publick streets, fields, and garden-alleys, and afterwards highly advanced in these times of distraction, for their service, by Climenes grace and favour: And these would usually beard the eminentest of their Nobility, and not so only, but contend with them for Offices of high concern, and Places of command, magnifying their actions, and saying; That their assayes had deservingly raised them from low extractions to degrees of Honour; Whereas the pusillanimity of those, whose descents had made them low in the esteem of Fame, had aspersed upon their names an indeleble tincture, which the length of time would not raze out, nor the splendor of their Family repaire, and that their House, though built up only to the first story, would appear more glorious to the eye of Posterity,    [   O generosa Heroum Progenie.  ] then ancient high Structures grounded on shrinking foundations; and that theirs would stand, when those vast piles of declining Nobility should sink: With these and such like affronts would these Sprouts of adventitious Honour shamelesly encounter their chiefest Peers; which those tame Lords had more Patience to indure, then Prowess to oppose. And this redounded highly to Climenes content, whose Honour was his Souldier, by whose assistance, were it right or wrong, if the distracted Synod should fall in pieces, he promised to himself security. These Members being now, according to their distinct qualities, orderly seated and disposed; Climenes stood up, and in a Preamble, for further he did not go; (so as all might safely conclude, that the porch was larger then the building) he expressed the necessity of that Grand Meeting, with some Complements, apt enough to ingratiate the Members (in which Art he was singularly school'd;) which done, he inlarg'd himself no farther; transmitting his sense, and what he held most consequent to be insisted on for the benefit of the publick, to a Worthy Person of the Assembly (as he term'd him) to be more fully communicated unto them the next day, Siennefius was that Worthy Person, on whose weak shoulders Climenes had laid the burden of that day; whose long-lung'd Speech breathing more Church then State, appeared lesse curt and Laconick then his Commanders, but farre more intricate; for to this hour there was none of all that great Auditory, that could discover Climenes sense by that Speech without a Clavis ; and it seem'd the key was lost, so as they might justly despair of the opening of it; the only word that gave way to the unlocking of one ward, was supplies; a term of such hard digestion, as it highly disrelished some persons, and those eminent Ones, of that Assembly, who, it seemed, either wholly sleighted, or lightly resented Climenes necessity. The very next day, to discover their disgusts, and satisfie their doubts, two grave and judicious Counsellors, by name Ventilano and Collino , were purposely sent from the Higher Order of those Conscript Senators, to present to Climenes two Requests in the name of the whole Synod. The first was, That he would declare his own sense by publication of his own Speech. The second was, That he would render an account of the expence of all those vast sums, by which the State had been so impoverished, and the Royall Exchequer exhausted: Whereto Climenes with an haughty and imperious deport, without any civility at all shown to those Counsellors of State, replyed; That they were in a great error, if they expected to receive a Transcript from his hand of any Speech that he had delivered, for it had never been his use, either to imploy his own Pen, nor any other Amanuensis in order to his Expresses, but that it was a divine Providence inspiring him, whereon he relyed, and the only Directory by which he regulated the subject of his Discourse. And in answer to their second request, as their expectance of an Account from him, discovered in them an unexemplary boldness, so would his acquiescence to their demand in that particular argue his weakness; with which irresolute answer they returned lesse satisfied, but more exasperated then before. But little cared Climenes for their incensement, his hand was upon his Sword, as Tideus layd his upon his Shield; his highest design was, his Souldiers pay, which procured, he hoped ere long to pay them home who opposed him. Climenes had read, no doubt, that Story of Hannibal , and knew well how to make singular use of it. Of whom it was observed, that the neerer he approaced in his march to the City of Rome ,    [   Strabo, Suidas, Stob aeus, Dion. Rosardus. ] the Senatours grew lesse prudent, their Orators lesse eloquent, and the Citizens lesse valiant. The memory of so eminent an example, probably induced him to give command, that sundry parties of Horse, in good number, should march to and fro close by the Senate gate with light matches, purposely to beget a Feaver in the House, and consequently in all their Votes to correspond with his desires and dangerous designs. And some of these feaverish spirits, like wise Politicians, were carried away with such imaginary fears of death, which they understood to be in the power of the Sword; and that it argued small discretion to enter into dispute with force and fury, as they cunningly acted the part of Metius Suffetius , [   In aspectum Atr ae Virgae , ut prodigium Naturae, contremuerunt.  ] turning down right Succoits Merashites , or Neutrals: These trembled at the sight of the Black Rod , as a fatal Prodigy: They knew death to be the King of fears, and fear of Kings, much more of inferiour Creatures, whose happiness was their liberty, and from others heavier censure an impunity. Others there were of more fiery spirits, who spake home, and were as homely rewarded. Bellonius to his advantage was not addmitted to be a Member of the Synod; and if he had, it was generall thought, his presence had been to small purpose; for though a profest enemy to Climenes proceedings, yet he was ever held a Person of more abilities for a pitcht Field, then a Council of State. And for Lamachus , though much was expected, he had learn'd so much Councel of Harpocrates , as to lay his finger on his mouth, and teach his tongue to keep silence. Of all this great Assembly, there appeared very few to acquiesce to Climenes supplies, though the occasions and necessities of the Kingdom were vehemently pressed, and that the constitution of the State could no way subsist without them. Neither could it avail him to bend his Bow, wanting sinews and strings to expedite his shot. Highly incensed was Climenes with this unexpected result from the Assembly, but principally from the City; wherein, though there were many Indian Merchants, who, as he supposed, had feathered their Nests sufficiently, yet would they find no Supplies to accommodate his urgent necessity, which appeared not only in his publick imployments, and constant disbursements, in the continuance of a standing Army, and a straying Navy, but likewise in relation to his private ingagements, by marrying his Daughters to eminent Persons, with fair promises, but slow performance. Climenes having taken notice of the disaffection of such, on whom he had relyed, with the prevalent power and increasing strength of those, by whom he stood opposed; so as it appeared wholly improbable to him, how any expediences should be for his accomodation procured, or ought condescended to as he desired, without more ado: As one transported with an implacable passion, not without some menaces of revenge, he entred the Senate House, and with a rough furrowed countenance, dissolv'd that great Councel; determining all those weighty Resolves and Results of the Pretorian in one peremptory period; concluding, that the late disorders of that Assembly, had begot more distractions in the State of Candy , then many years before, during all their civil Warrs, had ever produced; and that those domestick divisions fomented in the breast of a factious House, would breath a fresh vein to the effusion of more new bloud then the late civil Warrs, by their fatal influence, to the irreparable ruine of that State, had formerly occasioned: This storm, said he, with a countenance no lesse stormy, appears yet in a cloud, but it would shortly break forth into a violent tempest, which the misfortunes of a distempered State might more easily bemoan then prevent; incounter then divert. It was the opinion of some judicious Members, that the dissolving of this Grand Councel redounded highly to Climenes disadvantage; for if his passion would have given way to reason, it was verily thought, that the Senate would have acquiesced to his Demands. But truth is, it was high time for Climenes to provide for his own safety, being so dangerously ingaged, that if he had not seasonably dissolv'd this Great Council, it would in few dayes have taken course to dissolve him, by forcing him to act his last Scene on the Scaffold, as he had done to many others, and to submit his head to Bonnardus Hatchet, by paying his life tribute to the funeral Obsequies of a fatal Mortality; for his many insolencies, heavy impositions, and insuccessive adventures, had quite razed out the memory of his former Victories, and resolv'd his imperious height into mortal hate. Neither did his words only but his actions give his Adversaries occasion to fear the heat of his fury; for the whole Bastile Royal became stored with his dis-affected Instruments. There was none, to his apprehension, that bare him or his Adherents the least hate, which he revenged not with semblable spite. Neither was his fury thus bounded, for remembring those undigested affronts and indignities which he had received from the City, he devised how to lay heavy burdens upon the Citizens, not only in relation to their trading or commerce, which by Pyracies, and other Marine Occurrents, became obstructed, but even to their buildings, which to the improvement of his own Coffers, or the advance of his Souldiers, were highly inhanced. Neither was the City slow in requiting these discurtesies, whereof as they were very sensible; so in these times of their sufferings there was an opportunity offered them for acting what their thoughts had privately designed. About this time there chanced to arise a great difference betwixt two eminent Families within the City, the Cervisiarii and Dispensatorii . Now Climenes stood wholly for the former, but the City, in opposition of him, for the latter; so as there fell no place nor office of command within the walls, wherein the Dispensatorii upon election were not preferred, and the Cervisiarii rejected. This nettled Climenes heart above all others, being so nearly concerned in his Relations to the Family of the Cervisiarii , as he ever ingenuously acknowledged even in the height of his fortunes, that his Extraction originally received breath from that Family. But this disgust, were it never so justly grounded (as indeed they could not wound them, but it must passe through his sides) those that were the prime Commoners, holding the greatest stroak and sway in the City, slighted his threats, and disesteem'd his frowns: For though he ruled all by the power of the Sword, yet they knew how to oppose him by the strength of their Charter, the priviledges whereof he had constantly protested to maintain, even unto death. Now the express words of their antient Charter, continued by many Centuries of years, in the Ordination of all Civil Offices, admitted a free Election, excluding ever those three fearful Precipices, Fear, Favour and Reward. Besides all this, so inveterate was the Plebeian hate to Climenes , as his Lady Adipa , (a meer stranger to a Princely posture) could never make her visits in the City, but the refuse and off-scum of those streets, where she occasionally passed, would not stick publickly to revile her, aspersing the fowlest terms of infamy and disgrace upon her; yet when inquiry was made, the Authors could not be found. So hard it is to return a remedy, where Authority inclines to a partial connivence; cordially intending, whatsoever is pretended, to give way, be it never so much pursued, for the Offenders impunity. Howsoever this ancient uncivilized Lady appeared as great a Stranger to Climenes crimes, as she was in her own person to all courtly State, moulding her self neerer to her own rural Education, then the majesty of that superlative condition, whereto she was so lately advanced; and indeed, neither was her Person nor Breeding sutable for courting. By this time, Climenes growing jealous of the affection of his Souldiery, who seemed much discontented with the unexpected dissolution of the Senate, convened before him all the Major-Generals and prime Officers of his Army, to whom; drawing aside the hangings of his lodging-chamber, he communicated his troubled thoughts in this manner: [   Climenes Speech to the Prime Officers of his Army.   ] 'Fellow Souldiers, it cannot be but I should know most of your faces, nor is it possible but most of you should be known to me; neither can you be ignorant, how the Superiour Power, by which all our humane actions are directed, and to their proper period reduced, has from time to time gone along with us, owned us, and given us success above hope in our highest assayes, and most hazardous adventures, The Sun shone ever cheerfully, and the winds blew prosperously upon us: The Champaign accommodated our Army with all conveniencies sutable for our undertakings: All the Elements fought for us, to make our Atchievements more glorious, our continued Victories more numerous. Neither shall I blush, from a grateful recollection of my own condition, to acknowledge the Providence of Heaven, in raising me from a low ground to this gradual ascent, whereto by step and step I have mounted; Gradually I may properly say; for without ascribing any thing to my self, I shall ingenuously confess it, that in my first initiation and exercise of Armes, I was as one of you, nay lower in account then the lowest of you; and by what staires did I ascend to this height, or by whose hands was I lifted up to this Seat? I call the Heavens to record, in whose presence I stand, that it was not my ambition, but your unanimity and free Election, which farre above my thoughts, or hopes, raised me to this condition. It was your joynt voice and vote that layd upon me these Commands; they were put upon me, and not sought. And must my actions now be questioned, that have been ever cast in that mould, and acquainted with no other end then preservation of the Subjects ancient Liberties, Royal Priviledges, the life of the Laws, the just maintenance of our Honour, with the safety of our Person, the security whereof I have many times neglected, as your selves well know, for advancement of the Publick? Now resolve me, will it become you to entertain jealous thoughts touching your Commander, whose highest endeavours have been ever so constantly tender of your Honour? Trust me, fellow-Souldiers, Climenes desires thirst after nothing so much as the knowledge of your affection. Deal clearly with me; unrivet your bosoms freely, and do not double with me. If you have a love for me, retain it, it shall be my aim to deserve it; if otherwise, discover it. Lay down your Commissions, whosoever you be, that have no mind to serve me. Upon my reputation I vow it, your dis-service, and desertion of me, shall not distaste me: Nay, if you should imbody your selves in an Army, I could do no lesse then smile at your folly, and cheerfully imbattle you, and make your own blood satisfactory for my injury. Neither do I speak this to incense them, whose impoysoned thoughts harbour some jealous opinions concerning me; but to declare to the world how lightly I weigh them, who vapour forth their undigested griefs without grounds, desiring nothing more then to imbroile the State, and involve our late reduced Nation in a new Warre. I shall only tell these disaffected Ones, that I should rather have chused to keep Sheep on an hill, then born Command over such Incendiaries, whose designs secretly act for shedding more innocent bloud, then all their Sympathetick powders have power to stanch. As for those that will be intirely mine, they shall have that interest in me, and influence over me, that though I be their Commander, they shall be Commanders of my affection, and receive ample remonstrances of their alacrious service and fidelity towards me. 'Go on then, fight for me, or against me; as the one may oblige me, so the other shall not affright me. Resolution can no way suffer, where true Valour gives Convoy to the Port of Honour.' This Speech wrought attention on some with applause, which was manifested by their Hum; but the discontented Party went away unsatisfied as they came. Which Climenes quickly observing, resolved to take another course, and in such a way as might accommodate him in three main respects, both for securing his Person, strengthening his Commands, and raising him to the highest pitch of his Ambition. And to expedite his designs, seeing himself inclosed with such straits at home, he seeks how to purchase himself Friends abroad. Ferrara he finds to be no firm Friend to rely on; his aime therefore was to fall off from their association, and ingratiate himself by Embassies, with other indearing tenders of affection, into the Alliance of Hetruria , a long continued Enemy to Ferrara ; imagining, as he might well, that the Hetrurian might prove more useful for his interest then the uncertain Amity of Ferrara : But for all his solicitancy, the Hetrurian was too wise to give ear to a reconciled Enemy (and such an one had Climenes profest himself during all these Civil warrs) in adheering and strongly assisting Ferrara , their mortal Foe against them. Climenes being thus disappointed of their Alliance, which had been of infinite consequence to the settlement of his affairs, he determines to set up his rest upon one especial design, which he had been long in hatching, but now came to acting; for so the necessity of his condition, wherewith he was straitened, presently required; and to make a tryal of his conclusion, knowing by long experience, that more advantage would accrue to his addresses by dispatch then delay, one morning betimes, when they least expected, he calls up his Cabinet Councel, communicating himself freely unto them in this sort. 'My prudent and faithful Counsel, it were not possible that I should appear either so insensible of mine own former condition, or so unmindful of your vigilant care and approved affection, as not to retain in memory the sundry straits, whereto the giddy wheel of Fate has in these agitations of State reduced me; with what promptness and alacrity your great Wisdoms have seasonably contributed in those extreams to my relief. To whom then should I make my address, but where I have found such opportunate redresses? And I must freely acquaint you, that my condition is such, as your advice could never be more useful to me in the Receit, nor more grateful in the Application. But those wounds have been ever held of a malignant quality, that expect cure without a discovery. I intend therefore with much freedom and confidence to unbosom my self before your Honors: You cannot but observe how variously disposed their affections are towards me, who owe themselves unto me: This dissent in Opinions has begot these divisions, and different distractions. This great City Thamipolis , the glory of Nations, Candies ancient Metropolis , whose sinews gave supplies to our Forces in all these Civil Wars against Rosicles , and his Successor Charicles , are lately fallen from us; standing wholly for a State- Government , others for a Democracy , others for a Platonick Community : Whereas your Prudence, who sit at the Sterne of the State, has ever stood constantly to a Monarchical Soveraignty ; whereto I have been many times by your grave advice seriously invited, and solicitously courted; but through a native modesty, being flat against those Principles, which I had fought against and protested, I seemingly declined. 'But, my good Lords, the urgent necessities of these times, with those threatening combustions and approaching storms, which every where ingage our care for a timely prevention, have so strongly wrought upon our thoughts, as we are resolved for the acception of that Imperial Title , if your assents, as you have ever formerly expressed, give way unto it. 'Sundry Statizing Libels have been by malignant spirits in sundry corners dispersed, highly tending to the derogation of our Honor, and Prerogative of State: All which, our present condition being reft of a Titular Power , we were necessitated to connive at, as if it had not concern'd us. These with many other State-maladies, may, as we conceive, become capable of a speedy cure by your joynt assent to our admittance of this Style. 'Neither has Ambition, but the States preservation, pitcht me upon these Resolves; for HE, in whose presence I stand, has ever dictated to me this good Counsel;  2 Let Reason go before every Enterprize, and Counsel before every Action : Which Precept I have to my seriou'st thoughts oft proposed; and it shall be my content to suffer in the highest measure, rather then decline from it. 'I desire no more of you, nor can I expect lesse from you, then to pursue what you did attempt; your foundations, have taken up a great deal of room. Do but accomplish and make good what you have undertaken; and handle those things which you have devised and mused of with your selves. [   Sen. ad Lucil.  ] 'My Lords, you have a great share in me, under which notion I must freely tell you, that I have been more wearied with Commanding then Conquering: Yea, so dispassionately has my patience been transported with the guidance of this People, as I should have holden my condition more happy in being a Shepherd, then leading such wild Cattle: And to inlarge my self more, had not the high interest and necessity of this State received such commanding influence over me, and laid these servile Manacles (for lesse I cannot hold them) upon me, I should have taken into my thoughts that opinion of Seleucus ; That if any one should but consider what thorny cares were interwoven in a Crown, he would not hold it worthy taking up, if it lay in the street. But this care is exacted of me, and I must become a principal sharer in it: this yoak is imposed on me, and I must bear it. 'Now, that I may be the fitter moulded for it, and better inabled to support it, be it your goodness to lend me your heads, as I shall upon all occasions render you my hands. Action and Policy must make up the Diapason in this State-harmony; for where the Gown and Gantlet are manag'd with discretion, and in a Symmetrial order, they cannot chuse but come off with honour, and by their fair deportment present actions corresponding with the constitution of a Senate, and the Title of an Emperour.' His Cabinet Counsel was so fitly moulded to his bent, as they knew well how to sooth his humour. So as, though some of them had highly disgusted Climenes rash Act of dissolving the Synod without the privity or approvement of his Councel; they not only with joynt vote assented, but strongly importuned him to expedite his Resolve in this acceptation of the Imperial Crown. This was the Lure which they applied, and whereon his attractive appetite quickly baited. Neither did Climenes retard their desires: For though dayly swounings arising from an ill-limited swinge of passion, and fury of opposition had much enfeebled him: nay, though nightly fears and jealousies, usher'd in with terrible visions had greiviously startled him; yet so strongly had Ambition seiz'd upon his thoughts, as nothing could be with more winged speed accelerated, then the pursuit of his Imperial Investiture; which within few dayes after, was with more privacy then publick solemnity accomplished in this manner. The Prince Ferrara by his Proxie was highly courted to be there present, but affairs of more obliging concern had ingaged him. The Dukes too of Florence and Millain were expected; but upon a Provincial Diet being otherwise imployed, they excus'd their absence.    [   Climenes was a Person incomparably passionate, and of a vindicative nature, which brought him to pay his debt to Nature the sooner.   ] And well might Forraign States be dispenced with, when the ancient Peerage of Candie were taken with such an Epidemical distemper, as none of all these could be seen at this great Solemnity, conceiving, as might be collected probably, that such an immerited honour was unfittingly conferred on a pretended Power, shadowed with the Robe of an usurped Majesty; which Climenes quickly observing, he in great choler passionately vowed, that he verily thought all the Nobility of that Island was taken with the Calenture, but he would find a way to cure their distemper. [   For his jealousie had caused many of his Life-guard to be secured. ] All this fore-slowed not his design: All hands were imployed; all things with much state and magnificence prepared, though the Confluence appeared thin to accompany it. The Imperial Ebor or Chair of State was erected: An Arch- Flamin, by whom these Regal Ceremonies were to be performed, readily attended: An Imperial Diadem adorned with the pretioust Stones that the East afforded. Where Climenes , as if he had put on a new face, answerable to the person wch he was to represent, asceded to his Throne with an unwonted state, upon the Cornish whereof he found these words written in a little Scedule: In terram, Diadema si tollas, a terra in terram tolleris, antequam geres . On earth, if thou takest a Crown, thou mayst receive it, but from earth thou shalt return to earth before thou wear it . This upon his first reading of it did not a little amaze him; but afterwards holding it to be the device of some dis-affected person, or rather some Magical Spell or Inchantment, he wholly slighted it; though shortly after this incantation prov'd a true divination. For scarcely had that Imperial Crown impaled his head, till (as if it held it self too worthy a Receit for such a Guest) he sunk down suddenly, and so expired. The report of this unexpected change was presently bruted abroad through all the Garrisons, designed for the guard of his Person, and safeguard of the Pallace, which were numerous, and in several places disposed; so many were the fears, jealousies, and affrights, which usually encountred him; being, indeed to the judgement of all those who knew him, a constant terror, or rather a prison to himself; wherein he exercised his imperious Soveraignty, and Syracusan Tyranny, till this adventitious Fate (which occasioned more grounds of joy then tears) cut him off from acting more cruelty, by imposing a period to his usurped Power, and closing it with a tragick and disconsolate Catastrophe. Neither had this report of his death only possest the Guards, for by this time it had sounded loudly in the ear of the Roman Regiment, who were ever held the strength and sinews of his Army. These, as they were Souldiers of Fortune, no sooner heard of Climenes fall, then they stood up for anothers rise.    [   Charicles priusquam Regale Solium ascenderat mortem obiit; a cujus discessu, illius frater Jagonius, Princeps egregi ae indolis, eximiae mentis, invicti Spiritus, infatigabilis industriae, militibus perquam charus, communi omnium arbitrio , Imperiali Titulo censebatur dignissimus . Ficin. Sect. 2\. parag. 7\. Some vary in this Relation, saying, that Charicles dyed before he ascended the Regal Throne ; and that his Brother Jagonius , a Prince of an undanted spirit, and by all the Souldiery infinitely loved, lineally succeeded him; which is by the approvedst Centurists opposed.   ] And the late unfortunate and proscribed Charicles must be the man; which they publickly attested, and with joynt clamour ecchoed forth in these words: REVOCETUR CHARICLES AB EXILIO, IN REGALI CONSTITUATUR SOLIO: Let Charicles be recalled from Exile, and restored to his Empire . This startled the Counsel of State; but holding it no discretion to dispute with Power, after a short Consult (for the heady Regiment would permit no long debate) it was by joynt vote concluded, and with the Signal Manual of the Senate consigned, that a Commission General so sealed should be recommended to the care and transaction of an Eminent Person for that purpose elected and authorized, with qualified Hostages deposited: the purport of which Instrument bore this face; That it was the universal consent and desire of the State of Candie , that Charicles should be recalled from Banishment, and re- invested in his hereditary Rights, and Imperial Throne; That Security was already given, by considerable Hostages, for his safe arrival and access to his Metropolitan City Thamipolis , and his Royal Pallace Leucoma , a too accurate Seat for an usurping State. These pleasant tidings came no less unexpectedly then seasonably to the ear of Charicles , being at that time divided betwixt hope and fear; but over- ballanced were his hopes with feares, having such weak Forces visibly appearing to advance his hopes. Time would admit no delay in pursuit of so fair an opportunity; so soon therefore as he could prepare himself with conveniencies sutable for so important an Expedition, he resolved to take his leave of the Court of Ferrara , and address his course for Candy . Many dayes were not past, till all things were provided according to his desires, and every way corresponding with his occasions. Along then, with his disconsolate Mother, a Lady of singular piety, with others of his Relation, he commits himself to the mercy of the Sea, where, by the assistance of prosperous winds, within short time after he landed in Meloces an Haven in Crete , anciently famous for confluence of Merchants and plenty of Traffick; from whence he was with all Princely state, and a gallant retinue of Peers, (such as had been seldom seen in the presence of Climenes ) with all cheerfulness and alacrity conducted towards Thamipolis . Some half a league before he came to his Pallace of Leucoma ; where he first intended to shew himself to his Court and People, he alighted from his Chariot, and taking the Queen-Mother by the hand; Madam, said he, will your Highness be pleased to take Horse? It will give satisfaction to the longing expectance of our affectionate Subjects. She inclin'd to his motion; and drawing neer to the sight of the Aceschein or Refectory , mounted prospectively above the Court gate: Charicles casting his eye aside, sent forth a deep sigh. What may occasion that, said Irina , arriving so near your own? Madam , replyed he, this was fetcht from the sad memory of mine own; the crimson circle of that unhallowed place made your Grace a Widdow, and us Orphans; this was that Perfidious plat, where in the sight of his own, he was deserted of his own, and weakly bemoaned by his own, the sable Stage where he performed that last Act, which rest you of an Husband, us of a pious Father . This relation Irina plenteously imbathed in tears; but high and consequent affairs injoyn'd their divertisement from a pursuit of passion, to such a composure or moderation, as might suit better with the necessity of their addresses. The very next day after Charicles repaire to Leucoma , his inauguration was with all Princely magnificence and solemnity performed; wherein it was a wonderful thing to observe, with what promptness (to omit the incomparable care and sedulity of his Courtiers) that Neutral City, which so lately before had dis-obliged their absolute Soveraign, by impoverishing themselves to strengthen the sinews of an Usurper; with what alacrity, I say, these Protean Proselytes or State-Chamelions, having changed their hearts as well as habits, manifested their Zeal to this late inaugur'd Prince, not only in acclamations, publick shows, presentments, and Bone-fires, with Conduits running freely with all sorts of Wines, but in precious and rich presents; implying demonstratively, that though their Treasuries had been long time shut from the seizure of an Usurper, they could readily find keyes to open them to their Hereditary Prince and lineal Emperour. This incomparably ingratiated him, and advantaged them in the confirming their Charter, which by their miscarriage had run it self upon a shelf of irreparable danger, had not the Princes indulgency past over the highness of their delinquency: which in the judgment of that time appeared to be a singular argument of clemency in Charicles , who had far greater cause to revenge then remit, not only the private designs, but publick attempts of many self-interested Citizens of Thamipolis , who profest themselves constant Favorites to Climenes , during the pursuit of all those Civil Wars; which affectionate adherency they were ever ready to manifest in their ample and voluntary contributions upon all occasions, as likewise in their promptness of Recruits, affording fresh supplies to the Rebels assistance with more quickness then it was required. Yet the memory of all these insupportable injuries by the Princes piety became buried; so highly was he taken with those visible testimonies of their submission and humble desires of reconciliation, as his benign disposition made revenge a a stranger to his thoughts, receiving them into his Favour, whose actions had merited the heaviest weight of his displeasure. Truth is, it was not possible that any occasional disgust could be so implacable, as not to be in some measure attempered or mollified by their seasonable application, and free agnition of their disallegiance towards him, and by what person principally those disrepects had been fomented: And this was one Salino , who had been the only disciplinary Martialist for the City. A man seemingly appearing of a clear and serene temper, but cordially factious, and of a turbulent nature; which being aggravated by sundry instances, brought him to a shorter period then his Complices desired, though nothing sooner then his actions deserved; being executed on the Artillery Round, where his perfidious Head-piece had moulded the platforms of many dangerous divisions: So easie it was for one contagious Member to infect a whole Society, and by poysonous ingredients distemper the constitution of a Loyally-affected City. For had not the sinister influence of such as these operated strongly upon the principles of Thamipolis , it had never fallen into such dangerous conclusions, nor profest it self either hostile or neutral to a lineal Soveraignty. After this unexpected juncture by the Prince his gratious acceptance of the Citizens into his favour and protection, there past not one day without some Presentment or other set forth to the best beauty and advantage that either Art or Invention could devise. Amongst which there was one only Satyrical Conceit, which took infinitely above the rest; and this was presented in a dance of Sylvans, wherein the chiefest Sylvan, attired in Princely habit, after the end of the Antick, bearing the vivid Effigies, both in countenance and personage, of Climenes , sat mounted in a Chair of State, to whom was presented a Coronet of pure gold; and having his head ready to be impaled with it, there appeared an hand out of a Cloud snatching at the Coronet so presented, and in a Chrystal Ovally form'd, containing this Impresse, DETUR DIGNIORI . This was no sooner shown, then the Sylvan was with much disgrace forc'd out of that Chair, wherein he was formerly placed, and another more Princely or Majestick Sylvan, holding a neer resemblance both in favour and feature to Charicles , was set in that Chair of State, and dignified with the Coronet. This Invention infinitely contented the well-affected, which was generally so, or pretending to be so. Though Charicles forth of a native modesty, either seem'd not to observe it, or would take no cognisance of it, being much below his scorn to impe his wings with scattered feathers, or to triumph in the dishonour of a deceased Foe, whose ignominy, though it deserv'd no pity, yet he held it ignoble to rub over the wounds of a blasted memory. Neither did this his gallant compassion, extend it self only to his deceased Enemy, but even to his Posterity, to as there were none of his Relations, who did not amply taste of it; only it was his pleasure with much mildness to tax his Daughter Salacia , a Lady infinitely spritely, and a compleat Curtezan, of her too much liberty, wishing her to be more tender of her honour; wherein he exprest rather the office of a Father then a stranger. So as Alexander , that universal Monarch, could never shew more Princely clemency nor affability to Darius Wife and his Children, after his Conquest, then Charicles did to the Relations of Climenes after his death. True it is, that though Climenes layd great taxes; assesses, and impositions upon the Candiots , pretending, that the constitution of the State could not otherwise subsist, which pressures begot him a general Odium amongst the Natives, whose necks had been formerly free of such servile yoaks; yet these allegations of his appear'd to be, after his death, meer pretences;    [ Neither, indeed, could Charicles , in respect of his absolute Command, and Climenes numerous oppressions, incurre the censure of injustice, if he had converted his Enemies rich Coffers to the furnishing of his poor Exchequer. ] for his Coffers were full of treasure, besides the Banks he had stored up in other Nations; which by report of some Merchants imployed in those parts, and neerly interested in his Commands, were of high consequence. Now collect hence the rare temperance and moderation of Charicles amidst these attractive Baits. Power enough he had to seize on them, and to convert them to his own Treasury; yet neither could the memory of an Enemy, nor his own resistless Authority, induce him to act ought that might detract from the splendor of Justice, or appear light in the scale of Equity. Whatsoever those, who had relation to Climenes , impropriate to themselves, he not only left untoucht, but publish'd it as his express Command, that none, under what colour or pretence soever, should seize upon any such treasure, substance, or utensils, but leave them to the injoyment of his Successors without disturbance: Which Princely compassion not only gave wings to his Fame, but won those to his affection, whose hearts had been before Aliens to his devotion, and private obstructers (for further they durst not go) to his late investiture and inauguration. But to the end he might declare himself in a more satisfactory manner to his Peerage and Commons, he propos'd a fixt day, wherin he intended to communicate his thoughts and designs relating to the State in general; as likewise touching some eminent Persons, of whose different opinions and affections towards him, he had received both by intelligence, and personal interests, ample demonstrations, which in a Princely demean and well-beseeming posture (as none could deliver his mind with a more majestick presence, nor propriety of express) he returned in this sort. 'My Lords and Commons; and to you first, who hold the first place in my thoughts, nay, to whom I owe my self, in recollection of my late condition, and your approved zeal; which your loyal desires no lesse opportunely then compassionately exprest, when my necessities required them most, being in the depth of my extremes, and the lowest ebbe of my fortunes; yet as in the purest Minerals there is to be found some ground-foyle, and impurer metal; so there were some among you, whom I shall leave to the scrutiny of their own breasts) who, though their Extractions were antiently good, yet the corruption of these times had depraved them, and by degenerating principles made them evil. These were such, as neither the apprehension of my calamitous condition could reclaim them, nor their own sufferings, being slaved to a tyrannick Government, reduce them. These were no refined metal, no gold of Peru , for they would not abide the touch, but adulterate; Neutrals at the best, if not profest Enemies to the equity of my Cause. 'I should be loth to dart a glowing blush on any of their faces by my discovery; I leave them to a sensible remorse of their obliquities, and a bosom-agnition of their own disloyalty. By the word of a Prince, so they redeem the time they have lost, and teach their thoughts to be regulated by his Commands, whose just Soveraignty they stand obliged to obey, their former failings shall be past over with all impunity: To have it in ones power to punish, and not to inflict it, I have ever held it Princely. 'But let not this Clemency be abused, lest it return with the heavier stroke; injoy your own, so long as with fidelity you own him whom you ought to serve, and from whose allegiance in the least iota to decline, is to lose your selves. 'But it will not hold with reason, that all should be admitted to this Indulgence: Some have had their hands deeply imbrewed in the innocent blood of a pious Prince, our indeered Father, and to remit these, were to forget the memory of a Father. 'Yet in relation to that Fact, the unexemplary cruelty whereof no Age may parallel, we are not wholly ignorant, how those Assacinates (for otherwise we cannot possibly brand them) were of a several and distinct qualification in that tragick and tyrannick Scene; some being only Assenting, and those traduced by error; others Active, and those possessed with rankor, whose irregular fury deserves an higher censure. 'For the former, we have a bosom opening to mercy; but for the latter, as they had active hands in depriving their Native Prince of life, and us of a Father; it cannot be otherwise holden then a mild severity, and a temperate act of Justice, if we abridge their liberty, by confining them to a perpetual restraint: Our well-affected Party has been confined for their conscientious obedience, well may these suffer in the same manner for their dis-allegiance. 'As for that prime Moulder and Fomenter of these mischiefs, more exquisite tortures had been inflicted on him, if his sudden death had not prevented our revenge. 'Others there be, who, though our too much intimacy and bounty oblig'd them to us, yet were they made Intelligencers against us. No passage in our Cabinet- Counsel, were it never so important, could promise secresie, nor to our Person security, through their interests and intercourse of Letters with our mortal Enemy: Some of these State-timists we have formerly discovered, and laid it open unto them, shadowing their excuse with silence; for no other defence could they pretend for their dis-service; only some formal arguments of remorse were afterwards shown by them which allay'd our heat, injoyning them no other pennance then their absence for our satisfaction. Our Resolves stand fixt; they must hold themselves strangers to our Court. Fruits being once corrupted at heart, appear they never so specious, cannot prove sound. 'For you, my Commons, we impute your neglect of obedience to that common error of Plebeian ignorance; we are confident that your disloyalty clos'd in that low degree, as it scarcely deserv'd to fall under the notion of Treason; you were carried along with the strong current of the time; applying your weak interests to the peremptory commands of your Superiours. It was your sole desire to sit quietly under your own Vine, and to partake of the fruit of your own Olives; whereof, by this injoyment of peace, you may amply receive the benefit. 'Rely on the reputation of his word, under whose Soveraignty you live, that you cannot be more dear to your selves then you shall be unto us, so popular Faction divide you not from us. Nor do we doubt it, for we see that cheerfulness in your faces, as it assures us, that nothing but Characters of loyalty can be writ in your hearts: From which assurance, we have signed your pardon with the Signet Manual of our pity. 'Now for you the Citizens of our great Thamipolis , we cannot be ignorant of your free contributions to our disadvantage, your purses were never straitened, nor your hands contracted, so you might by the emptying of your Coffers strengthen the sinews of the publick Enemy, in the defiance of your Princes soveraignty. Notwithstanding all this, you shall know that our resolves are steered rather by Reason then Passion; and that the relish of Remorse has stronger influence over us then the spirit of revenge: nay, that it shall be ever the lowest of our scorn, to lift up our hand to strike, where Princely Clemency invites us to spare; nor to use Corrasives, where we hope that Cordials may cure; we appear here in this Pretorian, where we have been lately re-invested in our lineal right, ready to receive you with an indulgent bosom, and lodge you in the armes of mercy. In a word, our compassion shall acquaint you, that as our feet be slow in attempting, so we are none of those Syracusan Furies, whose hands were heavy in inflicting. And to cement your hearts more individually to us, our request shall be this unto you all, that you would use your Swords for us, so long as we govern justly, and to unsheath them against us, when we act ought deviously, or contrary to the rule of Equity. 'Mean time we give way, that your Charter, Liberties, Priviledges, and Immunities be confirmed in as large and ample manner, to all intents and purposes, as they were first granted; for it is not our meaning, that you should lose any thing by your late opposition, so you redeem the time, and repair your fame by subsequent Evidences of your loyalty and affection.' The Citizens, with the rest of the people there assembled, being able to contain themselves no longer, exprest their universal joy with this joynt Applause and Acclamation: Long may CHARICLES rule over us; long and prosperously may He and his Royal Posterity flourish, and peaceably reign over CANDIE . ROYAL ROMANCE and Observer of the Revolutions of those fatal times) we find how one Darchirus succeeded Climenes ; a Person of pleasure, naturally addicted to Hunting, Hawking, and other generous Recreations: So as being either wearied with the unsuteable burden of State-affairs, or the apparent disgust of some neerallying Competitors, or out of a conscientious resentment of the unjust usurpation of his Father, and injurious deprivation of Rosicles , he begun to cast his eye upon the true Line, surrendring his Crown, and betaking himself to the innocent freedom of a Country life.
