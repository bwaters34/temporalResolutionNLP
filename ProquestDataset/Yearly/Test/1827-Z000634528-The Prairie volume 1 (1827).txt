By Captain the Hon. George Keppel. All the Magazines and Reviews have united in giving this work the highest character. ELEMENTS of the PHILOSOPHY of the HUMAN MIND. By Dugald Stewart, Vol. III. Just Published \--- AMERICAN QUARTERLY REVIEW, No. I. second edition. With regard to the subjects which are embraced in the design of the American Quarterly Review, its title and the common and known contents of the existing models bespeak them sufficiently. Preference must be given to works and materials, to principles and opinions, specially interesting and useful to our own country, whether they be of domestic or foreign origin. Mere party or local politics, polemical theology, involving injurious and irritating imputations, and whatever tends to disturb essential morals, fundamental Christian faith, or republican theory, will be rigorously excluded. As the work is not meant to be devoted to the views or favourite ends of any member or section of the Union, neither will it be to any exclusive or partial doctrines in any of the admitted subjects. The utmost latitude of opinion and discussion will be allowed, that is compatible with the limits, temper, and general merit to be required in each article. The resources and connexions of the proprietors are such, as to place within their reach copious information of the cotemporary literature and public concerns of the principal countries of Europe and America; and they will sedulously avail themselves of all the means of the kind which they can command, for the enrichment of the Review. They scarcely need to add, that the work will be truly American in spirit and drift; patriotism, alert, emphatic, resolute, militant even under certain circumstances, is a trait which should distinguish it and every similar production of this country. Terms of Publication .---It will be handsomely printed in octavo, and will appear on the first of March, June, September, and December. The price will be $ 5 per annum.

Most assuredly there is no need of German horrors and improbabilities to excite our emotions, when ordinary life teems [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf057v1&image=057-010.jpg) \- external link  - Advertisement. ] with such melancholy events.

This volume is designed to display, in a succinct and cheap form, and in a correct and comprehensive manner, the actual state of scientific improvement as it is at present applied to the productive industry of this empire; not as the same knowledge already exists in books, but as it is actually found in workshops and manufactories of the highest character.

The strongest proof of the value and popularity of this volume, is the rapid sale of two large editions in the course of a few months. "It is a really practical book.
