 sharpnesse, but that they wil say, I haue taken a pride, or lust to be bitter, and not my yongest Infant but hath come into the world with all his teeth; I would aske of these supercilious Politiques , what Nation, Society, or generall Order, or State I haue prouokd? what publique Person? whether I haue not (in all these) preseru'd their dignity, as mine owne person, safe? My WORKES are read, allow'd, (I speake of those that are intirely mine) looke into them, what broad reproofes haue I vsd: Where haue I bin particular? Where personall, except to a Mimick; Cheater, Baud, or Buffon, creatures (for their insolencies) worthy to be tax'd? or to which of these so pointingly, as he might not, either ingeniously haue cofest, or wisely dissembled his disease? But it is not Rumour can make me guilty, much lesse entitle me, to other mens crimes. I know, that nothing ca be so innocently writ, or carried, but may be made obnoxious to costruction; mary, whilst I beare mine innocence about me, I feare it not. Application, is now, growne a Trade with many; and there are, that professe to haue a Key for the deciphering of euery thing, but let wise and noble Persons take heed how they bee too credulous, or giue leaue to these inuading Interpreters to be ouer-familiar with their fames, who cunningly,  & often, vtter their owne virulent malice, vnder other mes simplest meanings. As for those, that wil (by faults which charity hath rak'd vp, or coomo honesty coceald) make theselues a name with the Multitude, or (to drawe their rude, and beastly clappes) care not whose liuing faces they intrench with their petulant stiles; may they doe it, without a riuall, for mee: I chuse rather to liue grau'd in obscuritie, then share with them, in so preposterous a fame. Nor can I blame the wishes of those graue, and wiser Patriotes , who prouiding the hurts these licentious spirits may do in a State, desire rather to see Fooles, and Diuells, and those antique reliques of Barbarisme retriu'd, with all other ridiculous, and exploded follies: then behold the wounds of Priuate men, of Princes, and Nations. For as Horace , makes Tre batius speake, in these. \--- Sibi quisque timet, quanquam est intact us, & odit. And men may iustly impute such rages, if continu'd, to the Writer , as his sports. The encrease of which lust in liberty, together with the present trade of the Stage, in all their misc'line Enterludes , what learned or liberall soule doth not already abhor? where nothing but the garbage of the time is vtter'd,  & that with such impropriety of Phrase , such plenty of soloecismes , such dearth of sense. so bold prolepse's , so rackt metaphor's , with brothelry able to violate the care of a Pagan , and blasphemy, to turne the bloud of a Christian to water. I cannot but be serious in a cause of this nature, wherein my fame,  & the reputations of diuerse honest, & learned are the question; when a Name , so full of authority, antiquity, and all great marke, is (through their insolence) become the lowest scorne of the Age : and those Men subiect to the petulancie of euery vernaculous Orator , that were wont to be the care of Kings , and happiest Monarchs . This it is that hath not onely rap't mee to present indignation, but made mee studious, heretofore, and, by all my actions, to stand of, from them; which may most appeare in this my latest Worke : (which you, most learned Arbitresses , haue seene, iudg'd,  & to my crowne, approu'd) wherein I haue labourd, for their instruction, and amendment, to reduce, not onely the antient formes, but manners of the Scene , the easinesse, the propriety, the innocence, and last the doctrine, which is the principall end of Poesy to informe men, in the best reason of liuing. And though my Catastrophe may, in the strict rigour of Comick Law, meete with censure, as turning back to my promise; I desire the learned, and charitable Critick to haue so much faith in me, to thinke it was done off industrye: For with what ease I could haue varied it, nearer his scale (but that I feare to boast my owne faculty) I could here insert. But my special aime being to put the snafle in their months, that crie out, we neuer punish vice in our Enterludes &c. I tooke the more liberty; though not with out some lines of example drawne euen in the Antients themselues, the goings out of whose Comoedies are not alwayes ioyfull, but oftimes, the Baudes, the Seruants, the Riualls, yea and the maisters are mulcted: and fitly, it beeing the office of a Comick \- Poet to imitate iustice, and instruct to life, as well as puritie of language, or stirre vp gentle affections. To which, vpon my next opportunity toward the examining  & digesting of my notes , I shall speake more wealthily, and pay the World a debt. In the meane time ( most reuerenced Sisters ) as I haue car'd to be thankefull for your affections past, and here made the vnderstanding acquainted with some groud of your fauors; let me not dispayre their cotinuance, to the maturing of some worthier fruits: wherein, if my Mvses bee true to me, I shall raise the dispis'd head of Poetry againe,  & stripping her out of those rotten and base ragges, wherewith the Times haue adulterated her forme, restore her to her primitiue habite, feature, and maiesty, and render her worthy to be imbraced, and kist, of all the great and Maister Spirits of our World. As for the vile, and slothfull, who neuer affected an act, worthy of celebration, or are so inward with their owne vicious natures, as they worthely feare her; and thinke it a high point of policie, to keepe her in contempt with their declamatory, and windy inuectiues: shee shall out of iust rage incite her Seruants (who are Genus iritabile ) to spout inke in their faces, that shall eate, farder then their marrow, into their fames; and not Cinnamvs the Barber, with his art, shall be able to take out the brands, but they shall liue, and be read, till the Wretches die, as Things worst deseruing of themselues in chiefe, and then of all mankind. From my house in the Black-Friars this II. of February. 1607\.
