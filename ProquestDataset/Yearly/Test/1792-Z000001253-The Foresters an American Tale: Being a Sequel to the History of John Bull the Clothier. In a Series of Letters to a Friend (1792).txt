DEAR SIR, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-010.jpg) \- external link  - Page 003. ] To perform the promi[s]e which I made to you before I began my journey, I will give you [s]uch an account of this, once fore[s]t, but now cultivated and pleasant country, as I can collect from my conver[s]ation with its inhabitants, and from the peru[s]al of their old family papers, which they have kindly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-011.jpg) \- external link  - Page 004. ] permitted me to look into for my entertainment. By the[s]e means I have acquainted my[s]elf with the [s]tory of their fir[s]t planting, con[s]equent improvements and pre[s]ent [s]tate; the recital of which will occupy the hours which I [s]hall be able to [s]pare from bu[s]ine[s]s, company and [s]leep, during my re[s]idence among them. In reading the character of John Bull , which was committed to paper [s]ome years ago by one who knew him well, you mu[s]t have ob[s]erved, that though "he was in the main an hone[s]t, plain dealing fellow, yet he was choleric and incon[s]tant, and very apt to quarrel with his be[s]t friends ." This ob[s]ervation you will find fully verified in the cour[s]e of the narrative; and as the opinions and manners of [s]uperiors have a very great influence in forming the character of inferiors, you need not be [s]urpri[s]ed if you find a family likene[s]s prevailing among the per[s]ons who[s]e history I am about to recite, mo[s]t, of whom [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-012.jpg) \- external link  - Page 005. ] were formerly re[s]idents in Mr. Bull's hou[s]e, or apprentices in his [s]hop. There was among the appendages to John's e[s]tate, a pretty large tract of land, which had been neglected by his ancestors, and which he never cared much about, excepting that now and then [s]ome of his family went thither a hunting, and brought home veni[s]on and furs. Indeed this was as far as I can find the be[s]t pretence that John had to call the land his; for he had no legal title to it. It was then a very woody country, in [s]ome parts rocky and hilly, in other parts level; well watered with brooks and ponds, and the whole of it bordered on a large lake, in which were plenty of fi[s]h, [s]ome of which were often [s]erved up at John's table, on fa[s]t days. The [s]tories told by one and another of the[s]e adventurers, had made a deep im [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-013.jpg) \- external link  - Page 006. ] pre[s][s]ion on the mind of Walter Pipeweed , [1] one of John's dome[s]tics, a fellow of a roving and projecting di[s]po[s]ition, and who had learned the art of [s]urveying. Walter having frequently li[s]tened to their chat, began to think within him[s]elf, "If the[s]e fellows make [s]o many pence by their excursions to this wild [s]pot, what might not I gain by [s]itting down upon it? There is plenty of game and fi[s]h at hand, for a pre[s]ent [s]upply; plenty of nuts and acorns to fatten pigs, and with [s]ome [s]mall labour I may be able to rai[s]e corn and feed poultry, which will fetch me a good price at market.---I can carry bi[s]ket enough in my pockets, to keep me alive till my fir[s]t crop comes in, and my dog can live upon the offals of the game that I [s]hall kill.--- Be[s]ides, who knows what trea[s]ures the land it[s]elf may contain---perhaps [s]ome rich mines! \---od zounds!---then I am made for this world. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-014.jpg) \- external link  - Page 007. ] Full of this dream, Walter applied to his ma[s]ter one day for a lea[s]e of part of the fore[s]t , as it was called. Bull at fir[s]t laughed at the propo[s]al, and put him off; but Walter followed it up [s]o clo[s]e, and told what advantages might be gained by [s]ettling there, and promi[s]ed, if he [s]hould [s]ucceed, to turn all his trade into his master's hand, and give him the refu[s]al of whatever he might bring to market, and withal [s]hewed him [s]ome draughts, which he had made with chalk, from the reports of the hunt[s]men, that Bull began to think of the matter in good earne[s]t, and consulted his lawyer upon the [s]ubject, who, after due confideration of the premi[s]es, and [s]troking his band, advi[s]ed him as follows. "Why yes, Mr. Bull, I don't [s]ee why you ought not to look about you as well as your neighbours. You know that old Lord Peter lays claim to the whole country, and has a[s][s]umed to parcel it out among his devotees. He has given all the we[s]tern part of it, where this fore[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-015.jpg) \- external link  - Page 008. ] lies, to Lord Strut , and he has a large manor adjoining to your fore[s]t, which, they [s]ay, yields him a fine rent, and who knows but this may bring you in as much, or more?---Then there is old Lewis , the cudgel player, and Nic Frog , the draper, who have, perhaps, (I [s]ay perhaps , Mr. Bull, becau[s]e there may be a little doubt on both [s]ides, and in that ca[s]e, you know [s]ir, it would not become gentlemen of our cloth, to [s]peak po[s]itively) as good a claim as your honor to this land; but then it is a maxim, you know, that po[s][s]e[s][s]ion is eleven points of the law, and if you once get your foot upon it, they cannot ou[s]t you without a proce[s]s, and your honor knows that your pur[s]e is as long as theirs, and you are as able to [s]tand a [s]uit with them as they are with you. I therefore advi[s]e you to humour your man Walter, and give him a lea[s]e, and a pretty large one---you may find more advantages in it than you are aware of---but lea[s]e it, lea[s]e it at any rate." Upon this he was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-016.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] ordered to make out a lea[s]e; and Walter being thus inve[s]ted with as good authority as could be obtained, filled his pockets with bread and chee[s]e, took his gun, powder fla[s]k, and [s]hot of various kinds, with a parcel of fi[s]hing lines and hooks, his [s]urveying in[s]truments, and a bag of corn on his [s]houlders, and off he trotted to his new paradi[s]e. It was [s]ome time before he could fix upon a [s]pot to his liking, and he at fir[s]t met with [s]ome oppo[s]ition from the bears and wolves, and was greatly expo[s]ed to the weather, before he could build him a hut; once or twice the [s]avage animals had almo[s]t devoured him, but being made of good [s]tuff, he [s]tood his ground, cleared a little [s]pot, put his [s]eed into the earth, and lived as well as [s]uch adventurers can expect, poorly enough at fir[s]t, but supported as all new planters are, by the hope of better times. After a while he began to thrive, and his ma[s]ter Bull recommended [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-017.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] a wife , [2] whom he married, and by whom he had a number of children. Having found a new [s]ort of grain in the fore[s]t, and a certain plant of a narcotic quality, he cultivated both, and having procured a number of black cattle , he went on pretty gaily in the planting way, and brought his narcotic weed into great repute, by [s]ending a pre[s]ent of a quantity of it to his old ma[s]ter, who grew exce[s][s]ively fond of it, and kept calling for more, till he got the whole trade of it into his own hands, and [s]old it out of his own ware hou[s]e to old Lewis, Nic Frog, and all the other tradesmen around him. In return he [s]upplied Walter with cloths and [s]tuffs for his family, and uten[s]ils for his hu[s]bandry; and as a reward for being the fir[s]t, who had courage to make a [s]ettlement in his fore[s]t, and in token of his high e[s]teem of him as a cu[s]tomer, as well as for certain other rea[s]ons, he made it a practice every year, to pre[s]ent him with a waggon load of or [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-018.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] dure, [3] the [s]weepings of his back yard, the [s]crapings of his dog kennel, and contents of his own water clo[s]et. This was a mark of politene[s]s which John valued him[s]elf much upon. "It may [s]eem odd ([s]aid he one day to a friend) that I make [s]uch a kind of compliment as this to my good cu[s]tomer; but if you con[s]ider it aright you will find it a piece of refined policy--- for by this means I get rid of a deal of tra[s]h and rubbi[s]h that is nece[s][s]arily made in [s]uch a family as mine; I get a cur[s]ed [s]tink removed from under my no[s]e, and my good friend has the advantage of it upon his farm, to manure his grounds, and make them produce more plentifully that precious weed in which we all [s]o much delight." Walter was often [s]een, on the arrival of Bull's waggon, to clap his handerchief to his no[s]e; but as he knew his old ma[s]ter was an odd [s]ort of a fellow, and it was his intere[s]t to keep in with him, he generally turned off the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-019.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] compliment with a laugh, [s]aying, good naturedly enough, "Let him laugh that wins," without explaining his meaning, though it might admit of a double entendre \--- and calling [s]ome of his [s]ervants, he ordered them to [s]hovel out the dung, and make his black cattle mix theirs with it--- and when [s]pread over the land, the air took out mo[s]t of the [s]cent, and the [s]alts were of [s]ome advantage to the [s]oil. After Walter Pipeweed had got his affairs into tolerable order, he was vi[s]ited in his retirement by Cecilius Peter[s]on , [4] another of Bull's apprentices, who had taken a fancy to the [s]ame kind of life, from a di[s]gu[s]t to [s]ome things that had happened in the family. He had not been long with Walter before he found it would not do for him to remain there. Peter[s]on was [s]uppo[s]ed to be a natural [s]on [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-020.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] of old Lord Peter , after whom he was nick named. He had the [s]ame affected airs, and a tincture of the high flying notions of his reputed father. The[s]e made him rather di[s]gu[s]tful to Walter, who had learned his manners of Mr. Bull's mother, when [s]he was in her [s]ober [s]en[s]es, and between her and Lord Peter there had been a long variance. When Peter[s]on perceived that his company was not de[s]ired, he had [s]o much good [s]en[s]e as to leave Walter's plantation, and paddling acro[s]s a creek, [s]eated him[s]elf on a point of land that ran out into the lake. Of this he obtained a lea[s]e of his old ma[s]ter, and went to work in the [s]ame manner as Walter had done, who, liking his company be[s]t at a di[s]tance, was willing to [s]upply him with bread and meat till he could [s]cramble for him[s]elf. Here he took to hu[s]bandry, rai[s]ing corn and the narcotic weed, and buying up black cattle , and after a while turned his produce into his old ma[s]ter's ware hou[s]e, and received from him the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-021.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] annual compliment of a waggon load of dung, excepting that when there had not been [s]o much as u[s]ual made, he and Walter were to [s]hare a load between them. To ingratiate him[s]elf [s]till farther with his old ma[s]ter, he accepted of a girl out of his family for a wife, (for John was always fond of his tenants marrying for fear of their doing wor[s]e) he took as little notice as po[s][s]ible of his reputed father, and dropping, or di[s]owning his nick name of Peter[s]on, he a[s][s]umed that of Marygold , which old Madam Bull under[s]tood as a compliment to one of her daughters. He al[s]o made his court to the old lady by kneeling down and ki[s][s]ing the fringe of her embroidered petticoat, as was the fa[s]hion of that day. This ceremony, though a trifle in it[s]elf, helped much to recommend him to Mr. Bull, who was a very dutiful [s]on, and took his mother's advice in mo[s]t parts of his bu[s]ine[s]s. In [s]hort, Cecilius was too much of a politi [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-022.jpg) \- external link  - Page 015. ] cian to [s]uppo[s]e that filial affection ought to [s]tand in the way of a man's intere[s]t, and in this he judged as mo[s]t other men would have done in the fame circumstances.

Sickne[s]s and delirium of Mr. Bull ' s mother.--- Adventures of  Peregrine Pickle.--- John Codline.---Humphry Ploughshare.---Roger Carrier , and Tobias Wheatear . DEAR SIR, About the time in which the[s]e fir[s]t attempts were making, and the fame of them had rai[s]ed much jealou[s]y among [s]ome, and much expectation among others, there happened a [s]ad quarrel in John Bull's  family. His mother, [5] poor [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-023.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] woman, had been [s]eized with hy[s]teric [s]its, which cau[s]ed her at times to be delirious and full of all forts of whims. She had taken it into her head that every one of the family mu[s]t hold knife and fork and [s]poon exactly alike; that they mu[s]t all wa[s]h their hands and face preci[s]ely in the [s]ame manner; that they mu[s]t [s]it, [s]tand, walk, kneel, bow, [s]pit, blow their no[s]es, and perform every other animal function by the exact rule of uniformity , which [s]he had drawn up with her own hand, and from which they were not allowed to vary one hair's breadth. If any one of the family complained of a lame ancle or [s]tiff knee, or had the crick in his neck, or happened to cut his finger, or was any other way [s]o di[s]abled as not to perform his duty to a tittle, [s]he was [s]o far from making the lea[s]t allowance, that [s]he would frown and [s]cold and rave like a bedlamite; and John was [s]uch an obedient [s]on to his mother, that he would lend her his hand to box their [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-024.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] ears, or his foot to kick their back[s]ides, for not complying with her humours. This way of proceeding rai[s]ed an uproar in the family; for though mo[s]t of them complied, either through affection for the old lady, or through fear, or [s]ome other motive, yet others looked [s]our, and grumbled; [s]ome would openly find fault and attempt to remon[s]trate, but they were answered with a kick or a thump, or a cato'nine tails, or [s]hut up in a dark garret 'till they promi[s]ed a compliance. Such was the logic of the family in tho[s]e days! Among the number of the di[s]affected, was Peregrine Pickle , [6] a pretty clever [s]ort of a fellow about his bu[s]ine[s]s, but a great lover of [s]our crout, and of an humour that would not bear contradiction. However, as he knew it would be fruitle[s]s to enter into a downright quarrel, and yet could not live there in peace; he had [s]o [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-025.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] much prudence as to quit the hou[s]e, which he did by getting out of the window in the night. Not liking to be out of employ, he went to the hou[s]e of Nic Frog  , [7] his ma[s]ter's old friend and rival, told him the [s]tory of his [s]ufferings, and got leave to employ him[s]elf in one of his work[s]hops till the [s]torm [s]hould be over. After he had been here a while, he thought Nick's family were as much too loo[s]e in their manners as Bull's were too [s]trict; and having heard a rumour of the Fore[s]t, to which Nick had [s]ome kind of claim, he packed up his little all, and hired one of Nick's [s]ervants who had been there a hunting, to pilot him to that part of the Fore[s]t to which Nick laid claim. But Frog had laid an anchor to windward of him; for as Pickle had [s]aid nothing to him about a lea[s]e, he [s]uppo[s]ed that when Peregrine had got into the Forest he would take a lea[s]e of his old master, Bull, which would [s]trengthen his title, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-026.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] and weaken his own; he therefore bribed the pilot to [s]hew Peregrine to a barren part of the Fore[s]t in[s]tead of that fertile place [8] to which he had already [s]ent his [s]urveyors, and of which he was contriving to get po[s][s]e[s][s]ion. Accordingly the pilot having conducted Pickle to a [s]andy point which runs into the lake, Â it being the du[s]k of the evening, [9] bade him good night, and walked off. Peregrine, who was fatigued with his march, laid down and went to [s]leep, but waking in the morning, [s]aw him[s]elf alone in a very dreary [s]ituation, where he could get nothing to live upon but clams, and a few acorns which the [s]quirrels had left. In this piteous plight the poor fellow folded his arms, and walking along the [s]andy beach, fell into [s]uch a [s]oliloquy as this. "So much for travelling! Abu[s]ed by Bull, cheated by Frog, what am I at la[s]t come to? Here I am alone, no creatures but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-027.jpg) \- external link  - Page 020. ] bears, and wolves, and [s]uch vermin around me! Nothing in the [s]hape of an human being that I know of, nearer than Pipeweed's plantation, and with him I cannot agree; he is [s]o devoted to old Dame Bull that he and I cannot live together any more than I could with the old woman. But, why [s]hould I de[s]pair? That is unmanly; there is at lea[s]t a po[s][s]ibility of my living here, and if I am di[s]appointed in my worldly pro[s]pects, it is but right, for I profe[s][s]ed not to have any. My wi[s]h was to have my own way without di[s]turbance or contradiction, and [s]urely I can here enjoy my liberty. I have nobody here to cur[s]e me, or kick me, or cheat me. If I have only clams to eat, I can cook them my own way, and [s]ay as long a grace over them as I plea[s]e. I can [s]it or [s]tand, or kneel, or u[s]e any other po[s]ture at my devotions, without any cro[s]s old woman to growl at me, or any hectoring bully to cuff me for it. So that if I have lo[s]t in one way I have gained in another. I had better [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-028.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] therefore reconcile my[s]elf to my [s]ituation and make the be[s]t of a bad market. But company is good! Apropos! I will write to [s]ome of my fellow-apprentices; I know they were as di[s]contented as my[s]elf in old Bull's family, though they did not care to [s]peak their minds as plainly as I did. I'll tell them how much happine[s]s I enjoy here in my [s]olitude. I'll point out to them the charms of liberty, and coax them to follow me into the wilderne[s]s; and by and by, when we get all together, we [s]hall make a brave hand of it." Full of this re[s]olution, he [s]at down on a wind-fallen tree, and pulling out his inkhorn and paper, wrote a letter to John Codline, Humphry Plough[s]hare  , and Roger Carrier , three of his fellow-apprentices, informing them of the extreme happine[s]s he enjoyed in having liberty to eat his [s]canty meals in his own way, and to lay his [s]welled ancles and [s]tiff knee in whatever po[s]ture was mo[s]t ea[s]y to him, conjuring them by their former friend[s]hip, to come [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-029.jpg) \- external link  - Page 022. ] to join them in carrying on the good work [s]o happily begun, &c. &c. As [s]oon as he had fini[s]hed the letter, (which had deeply engaged his attention) a hunt[s]man happened to come along in que[s]t of game. This was a lucky circum[s]tance indeed, for Peregrine had not once thought of a conveyance for his letter; it proved al[s]o favourable to him in another view, for the hunt[s]man taking pity on his forlorn situation, [s]pared him [s]ome powder and [s]hot and a few bi[s]cuit which he happened to have in his pocket; [s]o taking charge of the letter, he delivered it as it was directed. This letter arrived in good [s]ea[s]on, for old Madam had grown much wor[s]e [s]ince Pickle had left the family: her vapours had increa[s]ed, and her longings and aversions were much [s]tronger. She had a [s]trange lurch for embroidered petticoats and high waving plumes; her Chri[s]tmas pies mu[s]t have double the quantity of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-030.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] [s]pice that was u[s]ual; the [s]ervants mu[s]t make three bows where they formerly made but one, and they mu[s]t never come into her pre[s]ence without having curled and powdered their hair in the pink of the mode, for [s]he had an aver[s]ion to every thing plain, and an high reli[s]h for every thing gaudy. Be[s]ides, [s]he had an high mettled chaplain [10] who was con[s]tantly at her elbow, and [s]aid prayers night and morning in a brocaded ve[s]t with a gilded mitre on his head; and he exacted [s]o many bows and [s]crapes of every one in the family, that it would have puzzled a French dancing ma[s]ter to have kept pace with him. Nor would he perform the [s]ervice at all unle[s]s a verger [s]tood by him all the while with a yard-wand in his hand; and if any [s]ervant or apprentice mi[s][s]ed one bow or [s]crape, or made it at the wrong time, or dared to look off his book, or [s]aid Amen in the wrong place, rap went the [s]tick over his head and ears or knuckles. It was in vain to appeal from the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-031.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] chaplain or the old Dame to their ma[s]ter, for he was [s]o obedient a [s]on that he suffered them to govern him as they pleased; nay, though broad hints were given that the chaplain was an emi[s][s]ary of lord Peter, and was taking advantage of the old lady's hy[s]terics to bring the whole family into his intere[s]t, John gave no heed to any of the[s]e in[s]inuations. As [s]oon as the letter of Peregrine Pickle arrived, the apprentices, to whom it was directed, held a con[s]ultation what they [s]hould do. They were heartily tired of the conduct of the chaplain; they lamented the old lady's ill health, and wi[s]hed for a cure; but there was at present no hope of it, and they concluded that it was be[s]t to follow Pickle's advice, and retire with him into the Fore[s]t. Though they were infected with the [s]pirit of adventure, yet they were a [s]et of wary fellows, and knew they could not with [s]afety venture thither unle[s]s they had a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-032.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] lea[s]e of the land. Happily, however, for them, Bull had a little while before that put the affairs of the Fore[s]t into the hands of a gentleman of the law, [11] with orders to [s]ee that the matter was properly managed, [s]o as to yield him [s]ome certain profit. To this [s]age they applied, and for the proper fees, which they clubbed for between them, they obtained a lea[s]e, under hand and [s]eal; wherein, for "sundry cau[s]es him thereunto moving, the [s]aid Bull did grant and convey unto John Codline and his a[s][s]ociates, [s]o many acres of his Fore[s]t, bounded [s]o and [s]o, and which they were to have, hold, and enjoy for ever and ever, yielding and paying [s]o and [s]o, and [s]o forth." When this grand point was gained by the a[s][s]i[s]tance of the lawyer and his clerks , who knew how to manage bu[s]ine[s]s, the adventurers [s]old all their [s]uperfluities to the pawn brokers, and got together what things they supposed they [s]hould want, and leaving be [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-033.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] hind them a note on the compter, [12] to tell their ma[s]ter where they were bound, and what were their de[s]igns: they [s]et off all together and got [s]afe into a part of the Fore[s]t adjoining to Pickle, who hearing of their arrival, took his oaken [s]taff in his hand and hobbled along as fa[s]t as his lame legs could carry him to [s]ee them, and a joyful meeting indeed they had. Having laid their heads together, it was agreed that Codline [s]hould [s]end for a girl whom he had courted, Â and marry her, and that he [s]hould be con[s]idered as the lord of the manor, that Pickle [s]hould have a lea[s]e of that part which he had pitched upon, and that Plough[s]hare and Carrier [s]hould for the pre[s]ent be con[s]idered as members of Codline's family. John had taken a great fancy to fi[s]hing, and thought he could wholly or chiefly [s]ub[s]i[s]t by it; but Humphry had a mind for a farm; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-034.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] [s]o after a while they parted in friend[s]hip. Humphry, with a pack on his back and a [s]pade in his hand, travelled acro[s]s the Forest till he found a wide meadow with a large brook [13] running through it, which he [s]uppo[s]ed to be within John's grant, and intended [s]till to con[s]ider him[s]elf as a distant member of the family. But as it fell out otherwi[s]e, he was obliged to get a new lea[s]e, to which Mr. Frog made [s]ome objections, but they were over ruled; and [s]oon after another old fellow [s]ervant, Tobias Wheatear , Â came and [s]at down by him. They being [s]o much alike in their views and di[s]po[s]itions, agreed to live together as intimates, though in two families, which they did till Wheatear's death, when Plough[s]hare became his [s]ole heir, and the e[s]tate has ever [s]ince been his. This Humphry was always a very indu[s]trious, frugal, [s]aving hu[s]band; and his wife, though a formal [s]trait laced [s]ort [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-035.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] of a body, yet always minded her [s]pinning and knitting, and took excellent care of her dairy. She always clothed her children in home[s]pun garments, and [s]carcely ever [s]pent a farthing for outlandi[s]h trinkets. The family and all its concerns were under very exact regulations: not one of them was [s]uffered to peep out of doors after the [s]un was [s]et. It was never allowed to brew on Saturday, left the beer [s]hould break the Fourth Commandment by working on Sunday: and once it is [s]aid the [s]tallion was impounded a whole week for having held crim. con . with the mare while the Old Gentleman was at his devotions. Bating the[s]e peculiarities, (and every body has [s]ome) Humphry was a very good [s]ort of man, a kind neighbor, very thriving, and made a re[s]pectable figure, though he lived a retired life, and did not much follow the fa[s]hions, yet he rai[s]ed a good e[s]tate, and brought up a large family, who knew how to get their living wherever they could find land.

Codline [s]urveys his Land; takes  Robert Lumber under his protection--- Begins a [s]uit with the Fishermen of  Lewis , which, with other incidents, excites the jealou[s]y of Mr  . Bull . DEAR SIR, After Plough[s]hare's departure, John Codline with his family kept on their fi[s]hing and planting, and sometimes went a hunting, [s]o that they made out to get a tolerable [s]ub[s]i[s]tence. John's family grew, and he [s]ettled his [s]ons as fa[s]t as they became of age, to live by themselves; and when any of his old acquaintance came to [s]ee him, he bade them welcome, and was their very good friend, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-037.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] as long as they continued to be of his mind , and no longer; for he was a very pragmatical fort of a fellow, and loved to have his own way in every thing. This was the cau[s]e of a quarrel between him and Roger Carrier  , for it happened that Roger had taken a fancy to dip his head into water, [14] as the mo[s]t effectual way of wa[s]hing his face, and thought it could not be made [s]o clean in any other way. John, who u[s]ed the common way of taking water in his hand, to wa[s]h his face, was di[s]plea[s]ed with Roger's innovation, and remonstrated again[s]t it. The remon[s]trance had no other effect, than to fix Roger's opinion more firmly, and as a farther improvement on his new plan, he pretended that no per[s]on ought to have his face wa[s]hed till he was capable of doing it him[s]elf, without any a[s][s]i[s]tance from his parents. John was out of patience with this addition, and plumply told him, that if he did not reform his principles and practice, he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-038.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] would fine him, or flog him, or kick him out of doors. The[s]e threats put Roger on inventing other odd and whim[s]ical opinions. He took offence at the letter X, and would have had it expunged from the alphabet. [15] He would not do his duty at a military mu[s]ter, becau[s]e there was an X in the colours. After a while he began to [s]cruple the lawfulne[s]s of bearing arms, and killing wild bea[s]ts. But, poor fellow! the wor[s]t of all was, that being [s]eized with a [s]haking pal[s]y, Â which affected every limb and joint of him, his [s]peech was [s]o altered that he was unable to pronounce certain letters and [s]yllables as he had been u[s]ed to do. The[s]e oddities and defects rendered him more and more di[s]agreeable to his old friend, who, however, kept his temper as well as he could, till one day, as John was [s]aying a long grace over his meat, Roger kept his hat on the whole time. As [s]oon as the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-039.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] ceremony was over, John took up a ca[s]e knife from the table, and gave Roger a blow on the ear with the broad [s]ide of it, then with a ri[s]ing [s]troke turned off his hat. Roger [s]aid nothing, but taking up his hat put it on again; at which John broke out into [s]uch a pa[s][s]ionate [s]peech as this--- "You impudent [s]coundrel! is it come to this! Have I not borne with your whims and fidgets the[s]e many years, and yet they grow upon you? Have I not talked with you time after time, and proved to you as plain as the no[s]e in your face that your notions are wrong? Have I not ordered you to leave them off, and warned you of the con[s]equence, and yet you have gone on from bad to wor[s]e? You began with dipping your head into water, and would have all the family do the [s]ame, pretending there was no other way of wa[s]hing the face. You would have had the children go dirty all their days, under pretence that they were not able to wa[s]h their own faces, and [s]o they mu[s]t have [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-040.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] looked like the pigs till they were grown up. Then you would talk your own balderda[s]h linguo, thee and thou, and nan forfooth  \---and now you mu[s]t keep your hat on when I am at my devotions, and I [s]uppo[s]e would be glad to have the whole family do the [s]ame! There is no bearing with you any longer---[s]o now---hear me, I give you fair warning, if you don't mend your manners, and retract your errors, and promi[s]e reformation, I'll kick you out of the hou[s]e. I'll have no [s]uch refractory fellows here: I came into this forest for reformation , and reformation I will have." " Friend John ([s]aid Roger) do[s]t not thou remember when thou and I lived together in friend Bull's family, how hard thou did[s]t think it to be compelled to look on thy book all the time that the hooded chaplain was reading the prayers, and how many knocks and thumps thou and I had for offering to u[s]e our liberty, which we [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-041.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] thought we had a right to? Did[s]t thou not come hitherunto for the [s]ake of enjoying thy liberty, and did not I come to enjoy mine? Wherefore then do[s]t thou a[s][s]ume to deprive me of the right which thou claime[s]t for thy[s]elf?" " Don't tell me (an[s]wered John) of right and of liberty---you have as much liberty as any man ought to have. You have liberty to do right, and no man ought to have liberty to do wrong." " Who is to be judge (replied Roger) what is right or what is wrong? Ought not I to judge for my[s]elf? or, Thinke[s]t thou it is thy place to judge for me?" " Who is to be judge ([s]aid John) why the book is to be judge---and I have proved by the book over and over again that you are wrong, and therefore you are wrong, and you have no liberty to do any thing but what is right." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-042.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] " But friend John ([s]aid Roger) who is to judge whether thou ha[s]t proved my opinions or conduct to be wrong---thou or I?" " Come , come, ([s]aid John) not [s]o clo[s]e neither---none of your idle di[s]tinctions: I [s]ay you are in the wrong, I have proved it, and you know it; you have [s]inned again[s]t your own con[s]cience , and therefore you de[s]erve to be cut off as an incorrigible heretic." " How do[s]t thou know ([s]aid Roger) that I have [s]inned again[s]t my own conscience? Can[s]t thou [s]earch the heart?" At this John was [s]o enraged that he gave him a [s]mart kick on the po[s]teriors, and bade him be gone out of his hou[s]e, and off his lands, and called after him to tell him, that if ever he [s]hould catch him there again he would knock his brains out. Roger, having experienced the logic of the foot, applied to the feat of honor, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-043.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] walked off, with as much meekne[s]s as human nature is capable of, on [s]uch occasions; and having travelled as far as he [s]uppo[s]ed to be out of the limits of John's lea[s]e, laid him[s]elf down by the [s]ide of a clear rivulet, which flowed down a hill; here he compo[s]ed him[s]elf to [s]leep, and on his awaking found [s]everal bears about him, but none offered him any in[s]ult. Upon which he [s]aid, and minuted it down in his pocket book, "Surely the bea[s]ts of the wilderne[s]s are in friend[s]hip with me, and this is de[s]igned by Providence [16] as my re[s]ting place; here, therefore, will I pitch my tabernacle, and here [s]hall I dwell more in peace, though [s]urrounded by bears and wolves, than when in the mid[s]t of tho[s]e whom I counted my brethren." On this [s]pot he built an hut, and having taken po[s][s]e[s][s]ion, made a vi[s]it to his old ma[s]ter Bull, who gave him a lea[s]e of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-044.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] place, with an i[s]land or two in an adjoining cove of the great lake, and recommended to him a wife, by whom he had a few children; but his plantation was chiefly increa[s]ed by the flocking of [s]trangers to him; for he was a very ho[s]pitable man, and made it a rule in his family not to refu[s]e any who [s]hould come, whether lame or blind, [s]hort or tall, whether they had two eyes or one, whether they squinted or [s]tammered, or limped, or had any other natural defect or impediment; it was another rule that every one [s]hould bear with the infirmities of his neighbours, and help one another as they were able. Once as I was pa[s][s]ing through Roger's plantation I [s]aw one man carrying another on his [s]houlders, which, at fir[s]t, I thought a very odd fight; upon coming up to them, I perceived that the lower one was blind, and the upper one was lame, [s]o as they had but one pair of eyes, and one pair of legs between them, the lame man availed him[s]elf of the blind [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-045.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] man's legs, and he of the other's eyes, and both went along very well together. I remember al[s]o, that as I pa[s][s]ed along, the fences were in [s]ome places made of very crooked, knotty rails; but the crooks and knots were made to fay into each other [s]o cleverly, that the fences were as tight as if they had been made of [s]tuff [s]awed ever [s]o even; a circum[s]tance which convinced me that very crooked things might be put together, to advantage, if proper pains were taken. When John Codline had [s]ettled the controver[s]y with Roger, by kicking him out of doors, he began to look about him to [s]ee what his neighbours were doing. Having found a young fellow on his north ea[s]tern limits, who had come thither without his knowledge or permi[s][s]ion, he took it into his head to [s]urvey the extent of his grounds. The words of his lea[s]e were rather ambiguous, and by virtue thereof he thought it convenient to extend his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-046.jpg) \- external link  - Page 039. ] claims over the lands on which Robert Lumber  (for that was the name of the young fellow) had [s]ettled. [17] It [s]eems that Bob had been [s]ent by [s]ome of John Bull's family to erect a fi[s]hing [s]tage on the borders of the lake, and the lawyer who had the care of the fore[s]t not being acquainted [s]o much as he ought to have been with the [s]ituation of the lands, or having no knowledge of the art of [s]urveying, had made out a lea[s]e which lapped over Codline's; [s]o that each of them had a claim upon the [s]ame land. In [s]ome circumstances this might have been deemed unfortunate, but as it happened it proved lucky for poor Bob---his employers had left him in the lurch, and he would have [s]tarved to death if John had not taken him under his wing and [s]ent him provisions to keep him alive. He al[s]o lent him a hand to clear up the bu[s]hes, and furnished him with materials to build a [s]aw [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-047.jpg) \- external link  - Page 040. ] mill. This [s]et Bob on his own legs, and he proved a [s]turdy faithful fellow. He was of great [s]ervice to John in killing bears and wolves that infe[s]ted his plantation; and when he him[s]elf was in danger, John lent him powder, [s]hot, and flints, and [s]ent hands to help him, and in [s]o doing he [s]erved him[s]elf as well as his neighbour, which was no breach of morality. Thus they lived pretty peaceably together, till after a while Bob's old owners found the land was grown good for [s]omething, and then (without paying John for his a[s][s]i[s]tance in making it [s]o) appealed to Mr. Bull, and got it away , and took a large [s]lice of John's land into the bargain. [18] This was a matter which [s]tuck in John's throat a great while, and if I am rightly informed he has hardly [s]wallowed it yet. He did not think himself fairly dealt by, though he had all Peregrine Pickle's land put into a new lea[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-048.jpg) \- external link  - Page 041. ] which Bull gave him. To be [s]hort, John Codline and John Bull never heartily loved one another; they were in their temper and di[s]po[s]ition too much alike; each was eternally jealous of the other: and this jealou[s]y was kept alive by a variety of incidents which it would be too tedious to enumerate. One of them, however, was of [s]o [s]ingular a nature that I think it de[s]erves to be remembered. It was this. Old Lewis had erected a fishing [s]tage and ware hou[s]e [19] on the north ea[s]t, which interfered with Codline's favorite employment. Without consulting his old Ma[s]ter Bull, or waiting for his advice or orders, Jack [s]ent a bailiff with a writ of intru[s]ion to the fi[s]hermen and began a [s]uit in law; Mr. Bull hearing of it, was glad to take advantage of the circumstance and fee council in the cau[s]e, which finally went in his favour. But though the i[s][s]ue of the cau[s]e was of [s]o much advantage to him; yet he ever [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-049.jpg) \- external link  - Page 042. ] after looked upon Codline as a forward, [s]aucy fellow, for running on that errand before he was [s]ent; and there were not wanting per[s]ons who were continually buzzing in his ear, to keep a good look out on that impudent jackanapes, or he would [s]oon begin to think him[s]elf as good a man as his ma[s]ter.

DEAR SIR, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-050.jpg) \- external link  - Page 043. ] In my la[s]t letter I had got a little too forward in my [s]tory, in point of time; but as I write by piecemeal, and often in a hurry, you mu[s]t excu[s]e chronological inaccuracy. I now go back to tell you, that between the lands occupied by Marygold, and tho[s]e on which Ploughshare had made his [s]ettlement, was a large tract of wa[s]te, where none of Mr. Bull's [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-051.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] family had ever been; but the report of the plantations which one and another of them had made, drew the attention of Bull's neighbours. Among the[s]e, Nicolas Frog  [20] was not an idle [s]pectator. He was as [s]ly a fellow as you will meet with in a [s]ummer's day, always attentive to his intere[s]t, and never let [s]lip an opportunity to promote it. Ob[s]erving that Mr. Bull was rather carele[s]s of the Fore[s]t, and tru[s]ted his lawyers and [s]ervants with the management of it, and knowing there was a large [s]lice of it unoccupied, he clande[s]tinely [s]ent out [s]ome [s]urveyors in the di[s]gui[s]e of hunters, to make a description of the country, and report to him at their return. Another good neighbour, Gu[s]tavus the ironmonger  Â was gaping after it, and gave out word among his journeymen, that if any of them would adventure thither and [s]et up their trade, he would uphold them in their preten[s]ions, and lend them any a[s][s]i[s]tance in his power. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-052.jpg) \- external link  - Page 045. ] Accordingly one of them, by the name of Ca[s]imir , ventured to make a beginning on the [s]hore of a navigable creek; [21] but did not care to penetrate far into the country, on account of the wolves and bears, which were very numerous thereabouts. As [s]oon as Frog heard of this, he picked a quarrel with Gu[s]tavus, and in[s]i[s]ted that the land was his by po[s][s]e[s][s]ion, becau[s]e he had already [s]ent [s]urveyors thither. It happened, however, that the place which Frog's people had pitched upon was at the mouth of another creek,  Â at a con[s]iderable di[s]tance; where they had built a hut, on a point of land, and farther up the creek had erected a kind of lodge or hunting hou[s]e, [22] for the convenience of collecting game. On this plantation Frog had placed Peter Stiver , a one-legged fellow, as his over[s]eer. As [s]oon as Peter heard of the quarrel between his ma[s]ter and Gu[s]tavus, he thought the quicke[s]t way of ending it was the be[s]t; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-053.jpg) \- external link  - Page 046. ] and therefore, without waiting for orders or ceremony, he went and commanded Ca[s]imir off the ground; and with one of his crutches beat his hou[s]e to pieces about his ears. The poor fellow [s]tared at this rough treatment; but was glad to escape with whole bones, and humbly requested leave to remain there with his tools, promi[s]ing to follow his bu[s]ine[s]s quietly, and become an obedient [s]ervant to Mr. Frog; upon the[s]e conditions he was permitted to remain, and the whole tract was reputed Frog's property. While the[s]e things were doing, John Bull was confined to his hou[s]e with a violent fever and delirium, [23] under which he laboured for a long time, and his imagination was the [s]eat of every wild freak and [s]trange vagary. One while he fancied him[s]elf an ab[s]olute monarch; then, a pre[s]byterian clergyman; then a general of hor[s]e; then a lord protector: His noddle [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-054.jpg) \- external link  - Page 047. ] was filled with a jumble of polemic divinity, political di[s]putes, and military arrangements, and it was not till after much blood letting, bli[s]tering, vomiting and purging, that he began to mend. Under this [s]evere, but whole[s]ome regimen, he at length grew cool and came to him[s]elf, but found on his recovery that his affairs had gone behind hand during his sickness. Be[s]ide the lo[s]s of bu[s]ine[s]s, he had phy[s]icians' and apothecaries' bills to pay, and tho[s]e who had attended upon him as nur[s]es, watchers, porters, &c. all expected wages or douceurs, and were continually haunting him with, How does your honour do? I am glad to [s]ee your honour [s]o well as to be abroad. Some one or more were continually putting them[s]elves in his way, and if they did not directly dun him for payment, their looks were [s]o [s]ignificant that a man of le[s]s penetration could ea[s]ily have gue[s][s]ed what was their meaning. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-055.jpg) \- external link  - Page 048. ] Bull was [s]omewhat perplexed how to an[s]wer all their demands and expectations. He was too far behind hand to be able to [s]atisfy them, and withal too generous to let them remain unpaid. At length he hit on this expedient: "The[s]e fellows, [s]aid he to him[s]elf, have [s]erved me well, and may be of u[s]e to me again. There is yet a con[s]iderable part of my fore[s]t unoccupied. I'll offer to lea[s]e them tracts of land which co[s]t me nothing , and if they will accept them at a low rent, they may prove u[s]eful [s]ervants, and I [s]hall be a gainer as well as they." Having come to this re[s]olution, he began to enquire into the affairs of his fore[s]t, and found that his neighbours had intruded upon his claim. Lewis had taken po[s][s]e[s][s]ion at one end; [24] Lord Strut at the other;  Â and Nic Frog in the middle, Â§ and his own tenants had been quarrelling with their new neighbours, as well as among them [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-056.jpg) \- external link  - Page 049. ] [s]elves. "Hey day! [s]ays John, this will never do; I mu[s]t keep a good look out upon the[s]e dogs, or they will get the advantage of me." Away he goes to Frog, and begun to complain of the ill treatment which he had received. Frog, who had no mind either to quarrel, or to cry peccavi, like a fly, eva[s]ive whore [s]on as he was, [s]hrugged up his [s]houlders, disowned what his [s]ervants had done, and [s]aid, he [s]uppo[s]ed they only meant to kill game, and did not intend to hold possession. Bull was not to be put off [s]o; his blood was up and he determined to treat Frog's [s]ervants as they had treated Casimir. So, calling a tru[s]ty old [s]tud out of his compting hou[s]e, "Here Bob, [25] [s]aid he, take one of my [s]ervants with a couple of blood hounds, and go to that part of the fore[s]t where Peter Stiver has encroached, give him fair warning; tell him the land is mine, and I will have it; if he gives up [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-057.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] at once, treat him well and tell him I'll give him leave to remain there; but if he offers to make any re[s]i[s]tance, or he[s]itates about an an[s]wer, [s]et your dogs at him and drive him off; kill his cattle and [s]et his hou[s]e on fire; never fear, I'll bear you out in it." Away goes Bob and delivered his me[s][s]age; Peter at fir[s]t thought it a matter of amu[s]ement, and began to divert him[s]elf with it; but as [s]oon as the dogs opened upon him he found his mi[s]take, and rather than run the ri[s]k of being driven off, he quietly [s]ubmitted to the conditions propo[s]ed. "Hang it, [s]aid he to him[s]elf, what care I who is my landlord? Gain is my object; I have already been at great expen[s]e, and have a prospect of getting an e[s]tate. To remove will ruin me; I'll therefore [s]tay here, and make money under Bull, or Frog, or any other ma[s]ter that will let me [s]tay." In a [s]ub[s]equent quarrel which happened between Bull and Frog---the latter [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-058.jpg) \- external link  - Page 051. ] [s]eized upon this plantation again, and Peter recognized his old ma[s]ter; but upon a compromi[s]e it was given up to Bull in exchange for a tract of [s]wamp [26] which lay far to the [s]outhward. Peter continued on the ground through all the[s]e changes, and followed his bu[s]ine[s]s with great diligence, collecting game and pelts, and vending them [s]ometimes to Mr. Bull, and [s]ometimes to Mr. Frog. However, Bull thought it be[s]t, that in token of [s]ubjection, Stiver [s]hould change his name; to which he con[s]ented, and partly to plea[s]e his new ma[s]ter, and partly to retain the remembrance of his old one, he a[s][s]umed the name of Bullfrog . The whole tract which was thus gotten from Frog, was thought too large for one plantation, and therefore Mr. Bull, in pur[s]uance of the plan which he had formed appropriated the rents of the plantation, on which Bullfrog was feated, to his brother, and the other was leaf [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-059.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] ed to two of his [s]ervants, Cartrut and Bareclay , and [s]ometime after another tract was [s]et off to William Broadbrim , who[s]e father had been an assiduous ratcatcher in Mr. Bull's family; but more of this hereafter. Cartrut and Bareclay agreed to divide their land into two farms, which they called the ea[s]t and we[s]t farms; [27] but when they came to run the divi[s]ion line, their compa[s][s]es differed [s]o much that they could not fix the boundary. This was one cau[s]e of di[s][s]ention. Another was the different humors and di[s]po[s]itions of their families. Tho[s]e on the Ea[s]t farm were brought up under Mr. Bull's [s]i[s]ter Peg ,  Â and as it is well known that [s]he and her brother had long been at variance, [s]o their dome[s]tics had got tinctured with the notions and prejudices of their re[s]pective families. The family on the We[s]t farm was made up of per[s]ons who were [s]ubject [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-060.jpg) \- external link  - Page 053. ] to the epidemic ague or [s]haking pal[s]y; [28] with [s]ome [s]truggles from Bullfrog's and Ca[s]imir's families. From this diver[s]ity of con[s]titutions and humours aro[s]e bickerings and quarrels, a di[s]inclination to work and [s]ubmit to family government. The[s]e di[s]orders continued a long while, and bu[s]ine[s]s went on very [s]lowly, till at length the heads of both families agreed to give up their [s]eparate lea[s]es, and take a new one of the whole, and let Mr. Bull appoint an over[s]eer. By the[s]e means peace was re[s]tored, and the new over[s]eer, who was [s]uppo[s]ed to be a de[s]cendant of Julius Caesar , gave the name of his ancestor to the farm, which has ever [s]ince been called Caesarea . There was another portion of the forest, which lay [s]outhward of Walter Pipeweed's plantation, and which no per[s]on had yet taken up, though [s]ome had made attempts and had been driven off by the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-061.jpg) \- external link  - Page 054. ] numberle[s]s mu[s]quitoes and [s]and flies, which abounded in tho[s]e places. Mr. Bull was [s]till de[s]irous to reward his friends in the cheape[s]t-manner , and at the [s]ame time to keep his neighbors from encroaching upon him, and [s]ecure the possession of the fore[s]t to him[s]elf. In pursuance of his plan, and to make [s]hort work of it at once, he lea[s]ed the whole of this [s]outhern extremity to Charles Indigo , [29] who was expre[s]sly ordered to take under his care and into his family all persons who had attended Mr. Bull, in his late [s]ickne[s]s, in quality of nur[s]es, druggists, apothecaries, laundre[s][s]es, upholsters, porters, watchers,  &c. &c. By this order Charles found him[s]elf at once surrounded by a large body of retainers of various ranks and qualities, and being a [s]peculator him[s]elf, he employed a speculative man, Mr. Padlock , who had written a large treati[s]e upon Ideas , to draw up fome rules, for the management of [s]uch a family, intending when he [s]hould [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-062.jpg) \- external link  - Page 055. ] build an hou[s]e, to pa[s]te it up in the parlour, as a directory to his wife. Accordingly Mr. Padlock went to work, and with an exqui[s]ite mixture of political and metaphysical knowledge, di[s]tingui[s]hed between the hall, the parlour, the dre[s][s]ing room, the gallery, the mu[s]ic room, the bed chambers, the chapel, the kitchen, the water clo[s]et, &c. [s]hewing what was to be done in each, and the proper subordination of one to the other, all which would have been of excellent [s]ervice in a palace, and among people who had got to a high degree of re[s]inement, but was ill [s]uited to the circum[s]tances of new adventurers in a fore[s]t. They rather needed to be instructed in the method of felling trees, draining [s]wamps, digging clams, guarding again[s]t mu[s]quitoes, killing wolves and bears, and erecting huts to keep off the weather. To the[s]e nece[s][s]ary affairs they were obliged to attend, and Mr. Padlock's fine [s]pun rules were laid by and little thought of. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-063.jpg) \- external link  - Page 056. ] Charles had pitched upon a [s]andy point, between two brooks, for his mansion hou[s]e, and had made a [s]mall beginning, when his repo[s]e was di[s]turbed by one Augustine , [30] a lubberly fellow, who had taken a lea[s]e of Lord Strut, and lived farther [s]outhward. This Strut was the large[s]t landholder in the country, and was never [s]atisfied with adding field to field. He had already got much more than he could manage, and had greatly impoveri[s]hed his home[s]tead by attending to his extra territories. His tenants were infected with the [s]ame land fever, and wi[s]hed to have no neighbors within fight or call. From this envious di[s]po[s]ition Augu[s]tine collected a rabble of lou[s]y fellows, and was coming to di[s]po[s][s]e[s]s Charles, thinking him too weak to make a defence; but Charles was a lad of too much [s]punk to be brow beaten. He armed all his people with [s]ome weapon or other, and advanced till he came within fight of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-064.jpg) \- external link  - Page 057. ] place where Augu[s]tine was, who on seeing him, took wit in his anger, and went back, without attempting any mi[s]chief. Another difficulty which Charles expected to encounter was from the wild bea[s]ts; but luckily for him, the[s]e creatures got into a quarrel among themselves, and fought with each other till they had thinned their numbers considerbly, [s]o that Charles and his companions could venture into the woods, where they caught [s]ome few and tamed them, as was the u[s]ual practice among all Mr. Bull's tenants at that day.

DEAR SIR, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-065.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] You mu[s]t have remarked in your acquaintance with the life and character of Mr. John Bull, that he is very whimsical, and as po[s]itive as whim[s]ical. Among other advantages which he expected from the [s]ettlement of his Fore[s]t, one was, that the wild animals whom nature had made ferocious and untractable in the highe[s]t degree, would be rendered tame and ferviceable, by receiving in[s]truction and education from the nurturing hand of humanity. He had conceived a notion that every creature has certain latent principles and qualities which form a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-066.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] foundation for improvement; and he thought it a great piece of inju[s]tice that the[s]e qualities [s]hould be [s]uffered to remain uncultivated: he had a mind that experiments [s]hould be attempted to di[s]cover how far this kind of cultivation was practicable, and what u[s]e could be made of the animal powers under the direction and control of rational government. Full of this idea, he came to a re[s]olution, that it [s]hould be the duty of every one of his tenants to catch wild bea[s]ts of various [s]orts, and di[s]cipline them [s]o as to find out their [s]everal properties and capacities, and u[s]e them accordingly; and this kind of [s]ervice was mentioned in their re[s]pective lea[s]es as one condition of the grants. Some of the tenants, particularly Peregrine Pickle, John Codline, and Humphry Plough[s]hare, entered zealou[s]ly into the mea[s]ure from principle. They had, during Mr. Bull's [s]ickne[s]s and delirium, before [s]poken of, formed an a[s][s]ociation [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-067.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] for their mutual [s]afety. [31] The object of their union was two fold: fir[s]t, to endeavour by all fair means to tame and discipline the wild bea[s]ts; and [s]econdly, in cafe of their proving refractory, to defend them[s]elves again[s]t their attacks. The other tenants did [s]omething in the [s]ame way; [s]ome from one principle, and [s]ome from another. Peter Bullfrog, who was as cunning as any of them, made u[s]e of tho[s]e which he had tamed as his caterers, to provide game for his table, of which the feathers and furs [s]erved him as articles of traffic, and brought him in a profitable return. The principal con[s]ideration ([s]etting a[s]ide intere[s]t) which induced the more zealous of the Fore[s]ters to enter into this bu[s]ine[s]s, was an idea, that the[s]e animals were a degenerated part of the human [s]pecies, and might be re[s]tored to their proper rank and order if due pains were taken. The grounds of this opinion were [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-068.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] the[s]e: Among the traditions of the ancient Druids there was a [s]tory, that out of twelve families which inhabited a certain di[s]trict by them[s]elves, ten had been lo[s]t, and no account could be given of them; and, Where, [s]aid they, is it more likely to find them than in this fore[s]t, in the [s]hape of [s]ome other creatures? e[s]pecially, if the doctrine of TRANSMIGRATION, which the Druids held be true. Another tradition was, that one of Mr. Bull's great great uncles, by the name of Madok , had many years ago di[s]appeared, and the la[s]t accounts which had been received of him was, that he had been [s]een going towards this fore[s]t; hence it was concluded that his de[s]cendants mu[s]t be found there. In confirmation of this argument, it was alleged, that the [s]ounds which [s]ome of the[s]e creatures made in their howlings, re[s]embled the language [s]poken in that day: nay, [s]ome were po[s]itive that they had heard them pronounce the word Madokawando ; [32] and one hunter roundly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-069.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] [s]wore that he had [s]een in the den of a bear, an old book which he [s]uppo[s]ed to be a Bible written in the Celtic language, and this book they concluded mu[s]t have been left there by Madok , who could read and [s]peak no other language. Another very material circum[s]tance was the di[s]covery of a rock by the [s]ide of a brook, [33] inscribed with [s]ome characters which bore no re[s]emblance to any kind of writing, ancient or modern; the conclu[s]ion from hence was, that it mu[s]t be of the remotest antiquity: this rock was deemed an unaccountable curio[s]ity, till a certan virtuoso took into his noddle, fir[s]t to imagine, and then to become extremely positive that the characters were Punic ; and finally this in[s]cription was tran[s]lated, and affirmed to be nothing le[s]s than a treaty of alliance and commerce between the Phenicians and the fir[s]t inhabitants of this fore[s]t. From all the[s]e premi[s]es it was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-070.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] inferred, with [s]ome plau[s]ibility, and more po[s]itivene[s]s, that one [s]pecies at lea[s]t of the [s]avage animals was de[s]cended from Madok , and that the others were the po[s]terity of the long lo[s]t ten families, who were well known to have had a commercial connexion with the Phenicians , and that the[s]e probably found out their haunt, and followed them for the [s]ake of their former friend[s]hip. What happy light do modern di[s]coveries and conjectures thrown on the dark pages of antiquity! From the[s]e principles, as well as from motives of humanity and of intere[s]t, [s]ome of the Fore[s]ters entered with zeal on the con[s]ideration and practice of the be[s]t methods to fulfil this condition of their grants, the di[s]ciplining the [s]avage animals, and they certainly de[s]erve prai[s]e for their hone[s]t endeavours; but, others who pretended to the [s]ame zeal, it is to be lamented, made u[s]e of this pretence to cover their vanity or their avarice. Had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-071.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] none but gentle means been u[s]ed, it is probable more good might, on the whole, have been produced; but as it often happens that many a good project has been ruined for want of prudence in the execution, [s]o it fared with this; for while the new comers were bu[s]y in putting up their huts, and preparing the land for cultivation, both which were nece[s][s]ary before they could attend to any other bu[s]ine[s]s, [s]ome of the [s]avage tribe would be a little impertinent, either by peeping into the huts, or breaking up a ne[s]t where the poultry were hatching, or carrying off a chick or a go[s]ling. The[s]e impertinencies bred frequent quarrels, and the poor creatures were [s]ometimes driven off with bloody no[s]es, or obliged to hop on three legs, or even laid sprawling and [s]lyly covered with earth, no service or ceremony being [s]aid over the carcass, and no other epitaph than "Poh, they are nothing but brutes, and where's [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-072.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] the harm of killing them!" or in rhyme thus: "Tit for tat, tit for tat, "He [s]tole my chick and I broke his back." Whatever plau[s]ible excu[s]es might have been made for the[s]e proceedings, they [s]erved to render the creatures jealous of their new neighbors; but in[s]tead of abating their appetite for mi[s]chief, it sharpened their invention to take more [s]ly methods of accompli[s]hing it. The more wary of them kept aloof in the day timd, and would not be enticed by the arts which were u[s]ed to draw them in; however, they were [s]ometimes pinched for food, and the new inhabitants u[s]ed to throw cru[s]ts of bread, handfuls of corn, and other eatables, in their way, which allured them by degrees to familiarity. After a while it was found that nothing [s]ucceeded [s]o well as molaffes . It was therefore thought a capital manoeuvre to drop a train of it on the ground, which the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-073.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] creatures would follow, licking it, till they had in[s]en[s]ibly got up to the doors of the hou[s]es, where, if any body held a bowl or a plate be[s]meared with the liquor, they would come and put their no[s]es into it, and then you might pat them on the back and [s]ides, or [s]troke them, [s]aying, "Poor Bruin, poor I [s]grim, poor Reynard, poor Pu[s]s," and the like, and they [s]hould suffer them[s]elves to be handled and fondled till they dropped a[s]leep. When they awaked they would make a moan and wag their tails as if they were a[s]king for more, and if it was denied them, they would retire to the woods in di[s]gu[s]t, till the [s]cent of the molaffes operating on their depraved appetites, invited them to return where it was to be had. This was upon repeated trial found to be the mo[s]t effectual way of taming them, as they might be taught to imitate any kind of tricks and ge[s]tures if a di[s]h of molaffes was held out as a reward. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-074.jpg) \- external link  - Page 067. ] The Fore[s]ters knew that they could not ingratiate them[s]elves better with their old ma[s]ter Bull, than by humouring his itch for projects. They therefore took care to rai[s]e reports and write letters from time to time concerning the wonderful [s]ucce[s]s which they had met with in civilizing the [s]avage animals. Bull was greatly plea[s]ed with the[s]e reports, and made a practice of [s]ending pre[s]ents of trinkets to be di[s]tributed among them; [s]uch as collars, earrings, and no[s]ejewels. Several times [s]ome of the mo[s]t [s]tately and be[s]t in[s]tructed of them were carried to his hou[s]e for a [s]how, where he had them dre[s][s]ed up in [s]carlet and gold trappings, and led through all his apartments for the entertainment of his family, and fea[s]ted with every nicknack which his cook and confectioner could procure. He was [s]o fond of being thought their patron and protector, that he u[s]ually [s]poke of them as his red children , from the colour of their hides. It is not many years [s]ince one of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-075.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] them, after being led through [s]everal families and plantations of the tenants, was carried home to Mr. Bull's own hou[s]e, dre[s][s]ed in the habit of a clergyman , having been previou[s]ly taught to lift his paw and roll his eyes as if in the act of devotion. This trick was [s]o well carried on that the managers of it picked up a large pocket full of pence, by exhibiting him for a raree [s]how, and the money was applied toward building a menagerie , where bea[s]ts of all kinds might be brought and tamed. This project, like many [s]uch whims, has made more noi[s]e than profit; for mo[s]t of tho[s]e who were [s]uppo[s]ed to be tamed and dome[s]ticated, after they had been [s]ent back to their native woods, with a view to their being in[s]trumental in taming their fellow [s]avages, have returned to their former ferocious habits, and [s]ome of them have proved greater rogues than ever, and have done more mi[s]chief than they could otherwi[s]e have been capable of. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-076.jpg) \- external link  - Page 069. ] Mr . Bull him[s]elf was once [s]o full of the project, that he got his chaplain and [s]ome others to form them[s]elves into a club; the profe[s][s]ed object of which, was to propagate knowledge  among the[s]e [s]avage creatures. After [s]ome trials which did not an[s]wer expectation, old Madam Bull conceived that the money which was collected might as well be expended in teaching Mr. Bull's own tenants them[s]elves a little better manners; for [s]ome of them were rather awkward and [s]lovenly in their deportment, while others were decent and devout in their own way . Madam, as we have before ob[s]erved, was a great zealot in the cau[s]e of uniformity , and had a va[s]t influence over her [s]on, by virtue of which the attention of the club was principally directed to the promoting this grand object. Accordingly, every one of the tenants was furni[s]hed with a Bible and a Prayer Book, a clean napkin, ba[s]on, platter, and chalice, with a few devotional tracts, and [s]ome young adventurers who [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-077.jpg) \- external link  - Page 070. ] had been educated in the family, were recommended as chaplains; who had al[s]o by orders to keep a look out toward the [s]avage animals, when they [s]hould fall in their way. The chaplains were tolerably well received in mo[s]t of the families; but [s]ome, particularly Codline and Plough[s]hare, who gloried in being able to [s]ay their prayers without book , always looked sour upon them, and would frequently [s]ay to them, "Go, take care of the [s]avage objects of your mi[s][s]ion, and don't come here to teach us, till you have learned better your[s]elves." The chaplains in di[s]gu[s]t, and perhaps in revenge, for they were but men of like pa[s][s]ions, would pout and [s]well and call fchifmatic and other canonical nick names, of which there is extant a large vocabulary, and would frequently write letters, much to the di[s]advantage of their opponents. It is not many years [s]ince they, with the club which [s]ent them, were [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-078.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] pretty [s]everely handled by one of Codline's own chaplains, and it is [s]uppo[s]ed that they have ever [s]ince been more modest; certain it is that they are now on better terms with their neighbors than formerly; this may, in part, be owing to Mr. Bull's de[s]erting them and refu[s]ing to pay them for their [s]ervices ever [s]ince the time that he began to quarrel with his tenants. On that occa[s]ion [s]ome of them removed their quarters; others kept their old places and have got along as well as they could without the help which they formerly received.

Adventures of Charles Indigo and Peter Pitch .--- Character of William Broadbrim .--- His projects, principles, and a [s]pecimen of his harrangues  . DEAR SIR, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-079.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] I HAVE ob[s]erved, in a former letter, that the lea[s]e which Mr. Bull gave to Charles Indigo, obliged him to receive into his family all [s]uch per[s]ons as had been attendants on Mr. Bull during his [s]ickne[s]s, and for whom he had no other means of providing. This general indulgence procured to Charles the reputation of a very friendly, ho[s]pitable per[s]on, and induced great numbers of other people of various characters, views, and intere[s]ts, to [s]eek an a[s]ylum within his limits. About this time old Lewis had grown [s]ick and peevi[s]h, and had [s]everely cudgelled [s]ome [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-080.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] of his apprentices, becau[s]e they did not make their P's and Q's exactly to his mind. [34] The poor fellows, to prevent wor[s]e treatment, fled from his hou[s]e, and took refuge with Mr. Bull, who treated them civilly, and recommended them to the Fore[s]t, where they di[s]per[s]ed themselves in the [s]everal families of his tenants, and a large party of them took up their abode with Charles, to whom they proved an indu[s]trious, profitable acqui[s]ition, though [s]ome of the family looked a little [s]ourly upon them. This facility of admitting [s]trangers produced an effect which had almo[s]t proved fatal to the reputation of the family; for a number of highwaymen Â al[s]o [s]ought [s]helter there, and by means of their gold and [s]ilver, which they had in plenty, made friends in the hou[s]e, and were admitted by night at a back door. After a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-081.jpg) \- external link  - Page 074. ] while they grew more bold, and came in the day time, under the di[s]gui[s]e of pedlars, with packs on their [s]houlders. One of them actually took his [s]tand behind a corner of one of the fences, from whence he [s]allied out on travellers; this corner obtained, from that circum[s]tance, the name of Cape Fear; and as the fir[s]t names of places are not ea[s]ily got rid of, it retains the name to this day, and perhaps will ever retain it. Here the ra[s]cal intended to have built him[s]elf a lodge, and taken up his quarters for life; but the matter was now grown [s]o public, that Charles, for the honour of his family, ordered all stragglers to be [s]eized, and this fellow in particular, after a fevere [s]truggle, was apprehended and brought to ju[s]tice. The [s]ame [s]pot was afterward taken po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of by Peter Pitch , [35] a poor fellow who got his living as he did his name, from collecting the re[s]inous juice [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-082.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] of the numerous pines which grew thereabouts. He had to work hard and fare hard, and go a great way for his victuals and clothes; but after he had lived alone for [s]ome time, he picked up one or two acquaintances of his own [s]tamp, and they formed a family, which was at fir[s]t rather di[s]orderly. Farther di[s]covery of the lands, and the advantage of the water carriage, induced [s]ome other people to [s]it down by him, and in proce[s]s of time he became [s]o re[s]pectable as to be noticed by Mr. Bull, who, though he never gave him a lea[s]e in form, yet let him have cloth and haberda[s]hery upon credit, and took his pitch in payment as fa[s]t as he could collect it. This kept him in a dependent [s]tate, and [s]ubjected him to impo[s]itions from Bull's clerks and journeymen. About twenty years ago, Bull [s]ent him a taylor to try on a new coat, [36] which was [s]o [s]trait that it [s]plit in [s]everal places, and never could be altered [s]o as to fit him; but he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-083.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] was obliged to wear it rather than quarrel with his patron. This [s]ame taylor was remarkable for cabbaging , as Peter Bullfrog and Humphry Plough[s]hare have [s]ince had large experience. To fini[s]h what relates to Charles Indigo, I [s]hall ob[s]erve, that the land on which he began his plantation, was in general [s]o wet and miry, that it was unfavourable to the production of wheat, and it was for [s]ome time doubtful whether he would be able to rai[s]e his own bread. Chance at length effected what labour and ingenuity could not: a bird of pa[s][s]age having dropped [s]ome kernels of rice in his dung, it was found to thrive exceedingly well; from whence the hint was taken, and rice became the [s]tandard grain of the plantation. By the cultivation of this, and of a weed which, was ufeful to the dyers, he grew rich, and made a fightly figure among his neighbours in point of dre[s]s and equipage; though his countenance is [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-084.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] rather [s]allow, and he is [s]ubject to frequent returns of the intermittent fever. By the exten[s]ive lea[s]e given to Indigo and his a[s][s]ociates, mo[s]t of Mr. Bull's dependants and attendants were provided for, and their [s]ervices recompen[s]ed with a [s]hew of genero[s]ity on his part, and of satisfaction on theirs. I have before ju[s]t hinted at a grant made to William Broadbrim , [37] of which I [s]hall now give a more particular account. His father had been an old [s]ervant of Mr. Bull, and had been employed in the very laborious and nece[s][s]ary bu[s]ine[s]s of catching and killing rats. In this employment he was [s]o very dexterous and successsul, that he recommended him[s]elf highly to his ma[s]ter, who not only allowed him large wages, but promi[s]ed him farther recompen[s]e. During Mr. Bull's [s]ickne[s]s, the care and diligence of this faithful [s]ervant had been unremitted, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-085.jpg) \- external link  - Page 078. ] his merits were thereby increa[s]ed, [s]o that Mr. Bull, on his recovery, found him[s]elf deeply indebted to him, and he [s]till continued his [s]ervices; till worn out with age and infirmity, he died and had an honorable funeral. His [s]on William then became his heir, and [s]olicited for payment of the arrears due to his father, which Mr. Bull, according to the maxim he had laid down for him[s]elf, and urged by the nece[s][s]ity of the occa[s]ion, propo[s]ed to di[s]charge by a lea[s]e of part of the Fore[s]t. This happened to fall in, exactly, with William's views, which were of a [s]ingular nature. About this time a nervous di[s]order appeared in Bull's family, which went by the name of the [s]haking pal[s]y . [38] We [s]hall not pretend to trace the cau[s]es of it, as the origin of [s]uch things is often ob[s]cure and impenetrable; but the effects were, a trembling of the nerves, a [s]ti[s][s]ne[s]s in the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-086.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] neck and [s]houlders, and a he[s]itancy in the [s]peech, [s]o that it was impo[s][s]ible for the patients to pronounce certain words and [s]yllables, [s]uch as Sir, Madam, your Honor, my Lord, &c. nor could one of them rai[s]e his hand to take off his hat, or hold it on the book when an oath was to be admini[s]tered. Mr. Bull's choleric temper misinterpreted this natural infirmity into a fullen di[s]re[s]pect. When he found a change in the behaviour of the[s]e dome[s]tics; that in[s]tead of bowing to him they [s]tood upright as a maypole, and in[s]tead of Sir, and your Honor, they could utter nothing but Friend , he grew angry, and made a pretty free u[s]e of his fi[s]t; and when he found that they could not be cured by [s]uch means, he thru[s]t [s]ome of them into a dark clo[s]et, and [s]hut them up till they [s]hould, as he termed it, "learn better manners;" and it is [s]uppo[s]ed he would have carried his re[s]entment much further, but for this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-087.jpg) \- external link  - Page 080. ] circum[s]tance; William Broadbrim, who had him[s]elf [s]trong [s]ymptoms of the disorder, whi[s]pered to Mr. Bull, that if he would give him time to ripen a project, which he had conceived, he would rid him of all trouble with the[s]e people. William had a plodding genius, and the [s]cheme with which his head was pregnant at this time, was nothing more or le[s]s than to make a [s]ettlement in the fore[s]t, and take all the[s]e people with him. Bull, who was glad to get rid of them, and of the debt which he owed to William, readily fell in with the project; and a grant was made out under hand and [s]eal, wherein William Broadbrim, and his heirs, were inve[s]ted with the right of [s]oil, and all other privileges of proprietor[s]hip, in a certain part of the fore[s]t, between the plantation of Marygold and that of Cartrut and Bareclay, being in the neighborhood of the [s]pot where Ca[s]imir had rebuilt his hut, and lived in an ambiguous [s]ituation, not knowing who was his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-088.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] landlord. With him William made a peaceable compromi[s]e, [s]aying, "Friend, I will do thee no violence, there is room enough for us both." Ca[s]imir was glad of [s]o good a neighbor, and he had rea[s]on to be, for he throve more rapidly after this than before. William pitched upon a level piece of ground, where two large brooks met, for the [s]ituation of his man[s]ion hou[s]e, and went to work to draw up rules for the government of his family. One of which was, that no per[s]on [s]hould be refused admittance into it, or di[s]turbed in it, or ca[s]t out of it, on account of any natural infirmity. Another was, that no arms, nor ammunition, [s]hould ever be made u[s]e of on any pretence whatever. The fir[s]t of the[s]e rules gained William great reputation among all [s]en[s]ible men; the latter was a notion which candor would lead us to [s]uppo[s]e proceeded from a love of peace, and the exerci[s]e of good will [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-089.jpg) \- external link  - Page 082. ] toward his fellow creatures; though [s]ome were [s]o illnatured as to imagine that it was an effect of the di[s]order in his nerves. When any of William's neighbors, who were of a different way of thinking, [s]pake to him of the impolicy of this rule, and a[s]ked him how he expected to defend him[s]elf and his family again[s]t the wild bea[s]ts, if they [s]hould attack him; William, who was fond of harangue, would an[s]wer thus---"There is in all creatures a certain in[s]tinct, which di[s]po[s]eth them to peace. This in[s]tinct is [s]o [s]trong and fixed, that upon it, as upon a foundation, may be erected a complete [s]y[s]tem of love and concord, which all the powers of anarchy [s]hall not be able to overthrow. To cultivate and improve this in[s]tinct is the bu[s]ine[s]s of every wi[s]e man, and he may rea[s]onably expect that an example of this kind, if [s]teadily and regularly adhered to, will have a very exten[s]ive and beneficial influence, on all [s]orts of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-090.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] creatures; even the wild bea[s]ts of the fore[s]t will become tame as the lambs, and birds of prey as harmle[s]s as doves. Do[s]t thou not [s]ee, friend, what influence my example has already had on tho[s]e creatures which are deemed [s]avage? I go into their dens with [s]a[s]ety, and they enter my habitation without fear. When they are hungry I feed them, when they are thir[s]ty I give them drink, and they in return bear my burdens, and do [s]uch other kind offices as they are capable of, and I require of them. I have even tamed [s]ome of them [s]o far, that they have [s]old me the land on which they live, and have acknowledged the bargain by a mark made with their toe nails on parchment. They are certainly [s]ome of the be[s]t natured creatures in the world; their native in[s]tinct leads them to love and peace, and sociability, and as long as I [s]et them a good example I have no doubt they will follow it. When [s]uch is my opinion and expectation, why [s]hould I be anxious about [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-091.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] what may, and I tru[s]t never will happen? Why [s]hould I put my[s]elf in a po[s]ture of defence again[s]t tho[s]e who may never attack me? or, why [s]hould I, by the appearance of jealou[s]y and di[s]tru[s]t on my part, offend tho[s]e who now put confidence in me? No, no, I will not [s]uppo[s]e that they will ever hurt me. I will not [s]uffer the carnal weapon to be [s]een in my hou[s]e, nor [s]hall one of my family ever learn the dete[s]table practice of pulling the trigger. I leave the in[s]truments of destruction to the offspring of Cain and the [s]eed of the [s]erpent; while I meekly imitate the gentlene[s]s of the lamb, and the innocence of the dove." With [s]uch harrangues William would frequently entertain him[s]elf and his friends, and he was [s]o [s]anguine in his benevolent project, that in[s]tead of having his own name, as was u[s]ual, written over his door, he had the words BROTHERLY LOVE, tran[s]lated into the Greek language, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-092.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] and in[s]cribed in golden characters, as a [s]tanding invitation to per[s]ons of all nations and characters to come and take [s]helter under his roof.

His family was sometimes compared to the Ark of Noah, because there was [s]carcely any kind of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-094.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] being, of whatever [s]hape, [s]ize, complexion, di[s]po[s]ition, or language, but what might be found there. He had al[s]o the art to keep them pretty well employed. Industry, frugality, and temperance, were the leading principles of his family; and their thriving was in a ratio compounded of the[s]e three forces. Nothing was wanting to make them as happy a family as any in the world, but a di[s]po[s]ition among them[s]elves  , to live in peace. Unluckily, however, this de[s]irable ble[s][s]ing, on account of the variety of their humours and intere[s]ts, was [s]eldom found among them. Ambition, jealou[s]y, avarice, and party [s]pirit, had frequent out breakings, and were with difficulty quelled. It is needless to enter into a very particular discussion of the grounds or effects of the[s]e dissentions: family quarrels are not very entertaining either at home or abroad, unless to [s]uch as delight in [s]candal. But there was one cau[s]e of di[s][s]ention which it would be improper not to notice, becau[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-095.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] I have already hinted at the principle from which it proceeded. William's aver[s]ion to fire arms was [s]o [s]trong, that he would not [s]uffer any of his family to mole[s]t the wild inhabitants of the fore[s]t, though they were ever [s]o mi[s]chievous. While the family was [s]mall, the [s]avage animals who lived in the neighborhood being well fed, were tolerably tame and civil, but when the increa[s]ed number of the family had penetrated farther into the fore[s]t, the haunts of the natives were dissturbed, and the [s]traggling labourers were [s]ometimes [s]urpri[s]ed, and having nothing to defend them[s]elves with, fell a [s]acrifice to [s]avage re[s]entment. Remon[s]trances were pre[s]ented to Mr. Broadbrim one after another, but he always in[s]i[s]ted on it that the [s]ufferer mu[s]t have been the aggre[s][s]or, and that "they who take the [s]word mu[s]t expect to peri[s]h by the [s]word." At length the dead corp[s]e of one of the labourers, mangled and torn in a dreadful manner, was brought and laid at the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-096.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] door of William's parlour [39] with a label affixed to the brea[s]t, on which were written the[s]e words, "Thou thy[s]elf mu[s]t be accounted my murderer, becau[s]e thou did[s]t deny me the means of defence." At [s]ight of this horrid [s]pectacle, Broadbrim turned pale! the eye of his mind looked inward! Nature began to plead her own cau[s]e within him! he gave way in [s]ome degree to her operations, though contrary to his preconceived opinion, and with a trembling hand [s]igned a permi[s][s]ion for tho[s]e to u[s]e the carnal weapon ,  Â who could do it without [s]cruple; and when they a[s]ked him for money to buy guns, powder and ball, he gave them a certain [s]um to provide the nece[s][s]aries of life , leaving them to put their own con[s]truction on the words. By degrees his [s]queami[s]hne[s]s decreased, and though it is imagined he has [s]till [s]ome remainder of it, yet nece[s][s]ity has [s]o often overcome it, that there is not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-097.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] much [s]aid on the [s]ubject, unle[s]s it be very privately and among friends . During the time of which we have been [s]peaking, Mr. John Bull had undergone another [s]ickne[s]s, [40] not [s]o long nor [s]o violent as the former, but much more beneficial in its effects. His new physicians had admini[s]tered medicines which compo[s]ed his nerves; he eat, drank, and [s]lept more regularly; and he was advi[s]ed to marry again, for his former wife had died of a con[s]umption a little before this [s]ickne[s]s came on. By the[s]e means his vigour was renewed, but [s]till his whimsical di[s]po[s]ition remained, and broke out on [s]everal occa[s]ions. When he viewed his exten[s]ive fore[s]t, now planted and thriving, under the hone[s]t hand of industry, he thought within him[s]elf that [s]till greater advantages might be derived from that territory. There was yet a part of it un[s]ettled between the plantation of Charles Indigo, and the dominions of Lord Strut; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-098.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] and Bull thought it a pity to let [s]o much remain a wilderne[s]s. The other plantations had been made by di[s]contented servants and needy adventurers, who, struggling with hard[s]hips, a [s]teady perseverance had [s]urmounted many difficulties, and obtained a comfortable living. "Now, [s]aid Bull, if the[s]e fellows have done [s]o well, and got [s]o far aforehand, without having any capital of their own to begin with, what cannot be done by the force of my great capital? If they have performed [s]uch wonders, what greater wonders may be brought into view by my own exertions, with all the advantages which it is in my power to command? To it, boys, I vow I'll have a farm of my own that [s]hall beat you all!"---Having hit upon this project, his brains immediately became pregnant with ideas; but according to the rule which he had lately pre[s]cribed to him[s]elf, he communicated the matter to his wife. This good lady was not free from an ambitious turn of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-099.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] mind. She was extremely fond of having it thought that [s]he had great influence over her hu[s]band, and would [s]ometimes gratify his humour at the expen[s]e of her own judgment, rather than not keep up this idea. His expectations from his new project were very [s]anguine. The land on which he had ca[s]t his eye was enough for a large farm; it had a [s]outhern exposure, it was warm, rich and fertile in [s]ome parts, and in others boggy or [s]andy. He had conver[s]ed with [s]ome foreigners, who told him that it was proper for the cultivation of wine and [s]ilk, and he imagined that if he could but add the[s]e articles to the li[s]t of his own productions, there would be a great [s]aving in the family. Mrs. Bull too was plea[s]ed with the idea of having her [s]ilk gowns and ribbands of her own growth, and with the expectation of having the vaults filled with wine, made on her own plantation; for the[s]e and other good rea[s]ons, her thereunto moving, madam gave her con[s]ent to the proj [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-100.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] ect. The per[s]on appointed to carry it into execution was George Tru[s]ty , [41] a sensible well bred merchant, but one who had only [s]peculated in the [s]cience of agriculture, and knew nothing of it by experience. Having collected a number of poor people who were out of employment, he [s]ent them to the [s]pot, with [s]trict orders to work fix days in [s]even, to keep their tools free from ru[s]t, and their fire arms in readiness for their defence. Whatever they [s]hould earn was to be their own as long as they lived, and after their death their possessions were to de[s]cend to their [s]ons , and in default of male i[s][s]ue to revert to the orriginal grantor. They were not allowed to u[s]e black cattle in the labour of the field; and were expre[s]sly forbidden to drink grog. Their bu[s]ine[s]s was to cultivate vines and mulberry trees, and to manufacture wine and [s]ilk. Upon this project another was grafted by the very [s]agacious Doctor Squintum , who cho[s]e this new plantation as the mo[s]t convenient [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-101.jpg) \- external link  - Page 094. ] [s]pot in the world for a charity [s]chool, where Orphans might receive the be[s]t education and be fitted to be the pillars of church and [s]tate. But notwith[s]tanding the [s]ums which Bull [s]o freely lavi[s]hed out of his bags for the [s]upport of the vine and mulberry plantations; and notwith[s]tanding the collections which Squintum made among his numerous devotees, the[s]e projects were either [s]o impracticable in them[s]elves, or [s]o ill conducted in the execution, that neither of them an[s]wered the expectations of the projectors. For want of black cattle, the [s]oil could not be properly tilled; and for want of grog, the labourers fainted at their work; the right of inheritance being limited to the male line, women and girls were not fond of living there, and the men could not well live without them; land, cattle, women and grog, were to be had el[s]ewhere, and who would be confined to [s]uch a place? The land, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-102.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] too, was claimed by Lord Strut, who [s]ent them writs of ejectment. As to the Charity [s]chool, it was, on trial, found that the co[s]t was more than the profit, and the building which had [s]wallowed up thou[s]ands of charity money, was finally con[s]umed by fire. Poor George Tru[s]ty was di[s]couraged, and begged Mr. Bull to take the plantation into his own hands; however, Bull continued to [s]upply him with ca[s]h, and he kept making attempts. Alterations were made in the terms of settlement, the re[s]trictions were removed, cattle and grog were allowed, Lord Strut was ou[s]ted, and po[s][s]e[s][s]ion held; the [s]wamps were drained; rice and indigo were cultivated in[s]tead of [s]ilk and wine; and upon the whole, con[s]iderable improvements were made, though at [s]uch a va[s]t expen[s]e, that Mr. Bull never [s]aw any adequate returns. The ill [s]ucce[s]s of this adventure did not deter him from another project. He [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-103.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] was extremely fond of Trout, [42] and thought if he could have them regularly catched and brought to his table, he [s]hould exceed all his neighbours in delicate living; and now and then be able to [s]end a me[s]s to his particular friends. Lord Peter's family too, he thought, would be glad to buy them, as they were very u[s]eful in the long lents, and frequent meagre days observed by them. There was a part of the fore[s]t on the north-ea[s]t quarter, which was very conveniently [s]ituated for this employment.  Â It had been occupied by Alexander Scotus , a purblind fellow, who had [s]traggled thither no one could tell how; and it was matter of doubt whether he derived his right from Bull, or Lewis; for both of them laid claim to the land, and their claims had not been fairly decided in law. To make [s]ure of the matter, Mr. Bull, by advice of his wife, [s]ent a waggon to bring off the family of Scotus, whom he di[s]tributed a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-104.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] mong the other families of his tenants; and in their room [s]ent thither [43] a parcel of naked, half [s]tarved people, who could live no where el[s]e, and [s]upported them for [s]everal years with provi[s]ions, furnished them with [s]kiffs, lines, hooks and other implements to carry on the fi[s]hery; but every trout which they catched, co[s]t him ten times as much as if he had bought it in the common market; nor could he, after all, get half what he wanted for his own con[s]umption. His trout fi[s]hery, and his mulberry plantation, rendered him the laughing [s]tock of his neighbours, nor could he ever gain even the intere[s]t of the money he had laid out upon them; while the fore[s]ters who had [s]ettled at their own expen[s]e, grew rich and became respectable. He had indeed, the benefit of their trade, which kept his journeymen at work, and obliged him to enlarge their number; for the fore[s]ters had a re[s]pect [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-105.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] for their old ma[s]ter and landlord, and when they had any thing to [s]ell, they always let him have the refu[s]al of it, and bought all their goods of him. But though he called him[s]elf their father, and his wife their mother, yet he began to abate of his parental affection for them; and rather looked on them with a jealous eye, as if they were aiming to deprive him of his claim and [s]et up for independence. Had he been contented with the profits of their trade, as was certainly his intere[s]t, they might have remained his tenants to this day; but ambition, avarice, jealou[s]y and choler, inflamed by bad coun[s]ellors, have wrought [s]uch a [s]eparation, that it is thought Mr. Bull will go mourning all the remainder of his days, and his grey hairs will be brought down with [s]orrow to the grave.

Mr. Bull had no le[s]s than fourteen tenants who held under him, and were [s]ettled on lands which he claimed as his own, and which he had granted to them in [s]eparate parcels. Their names, and the enigmatical letters by which they di[s]tingui[s]hed them[s]elves, were as follows: Alexander Scotus,  N. S. ------ Robert Lumber,  N. H. John Codline,  M. Roger Carrier  R. I.

It was ob[s]erved, that of all the adventurers, tho[s]e generally were the lea[s]t thriving  , who received mo[s]t a[s][s]i[s]tance from their old ma[s]ter. I cannot tell whether it was owing to their being employed in bu[s]ine[s]s to which they had not [s]erved a regular apprentice[s]hip, or to a natural indolence, and a di[s]po[s]ition to continue hangers on where they had got a good hold; for it mu[s]t be noted, that Mr. Bull was very generous to [s]ome persons, and on [s]ome occa[s]ions where it suited his fancy, and this di[s]po[s]ition in him [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-108.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] was [s]o prevalent, that they who kenned him, and would humor his whims, could work him out of any thing which they had a mind to. On the other hand, tho[s]e adventurers who came into the fore[s]t on their own hook, and had no a[s][s]i[s]tance at all from their old ma[s]ter, nor any thing to help them[s]elves with, but their four limbs and five [s]en[s]es, proved to be the mo[s]t industrious and thriving, and after a while told up a good e[s]tate. They all [s]eemed to have an affection for Mr. Bull, and it was generally believed to be [s]incere. His hou[s]e was u[s]ually [s]poken of by them as their home . His ware hou[s]e was the centre of their traffic; and he had the address to engro[s]s the profits of their labour and draw their earnings into his own fob. To [s]ome of them he would now and then make a pre[s]ent, to others he would lend a pack of his hounds, [44] when he was out of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-109.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] the humor of hunting; but they were generally u[s]ele[s]s to them for the purpo[s]e of [s]couring the woods, tho[s]e who could afford it kept dogs of their own, who were better trained to the game, and could better [s]cent the fore[s]t, being native curs, and not [s]o [s]pruce and delicate a breed as Bull's grey-hounds. It has been before ob[s]erved, that each end of the fore[s]t was occupied by Bull's rivals. His old neighbour Lewis had got the north end, and Lord Strut the [s]outh. Bull's tenants had [s]eated them[s]elves chiefly on or near the [s]hore of the lake, and had not extended very far back, becau[s]e of the bea[s]ts of prey; but Lewis, like a cunning old fox, had formed a [s]cheme to get footing in the interior parts of the country, and prevent the[s]e planters from penetrating beyond the limits which he intended to a[s][s]ign them. His emi[s][s]aries had been [s]ent [s]lily into the di[s]tant parts of the forest, under pretence of taming the[s]e bea[s]ts [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-110.jpg) \- external link  - Page 103. ] of prey; but in fact they had halved the matter with them, and had them[s]elves become as [s]avage as the bea[s]ts had become tame. They would run, leap and climb with them and crawl into their dens, imparting to them a lick of mela[s][s]es out of their calaba[s]h, and teaching them to [s]cratch with their paws the [s]ign of a cro[s]s. They had built [s]everal hunting lodges on the mo[s]t convenient pa[s][s]es of the brooks and ponds, and though thus [s]cattered in the wood, were all united under one overseer, called Onontio, [45] who lived in the man[s]ion-hou[s]e of St. Lewis's Hall. It was matter of wonder among Bull's tenants, for [s]ome time, what could be the rea[s]on that the wild bea[s]ts had grown more [s]urly and [s]nappi[s]h of late than formerly; but after a while, [s]ome hunters made a di[s]covery of the new lodges, which the emi[s][s]aries of Onontio had erected, and the de[s]ign of them being apparent, a general alarm was rai[s]ed in the plantations. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-111.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] On the fir[s]t news, Walter Pipeweed [s]ent his grand[s]on George , [46] a [s]mart, active, lively youth, acro[s]s the hills, with his compliments to the intruders, de[s]iring them to move off, and threatening them with a writ in ca[s]e of non compliance. This mode[s]t warning being ineffectual, it was thought that if an Union could be formed among the tenants, they might make a [s]tand again[s]t the[s]e encroachments. A meeting was held at Orange Hall ,  Â but no efficient plan could be hit on, without a previous application to their landlord, who hearing of this meeting, conceived a jealou[s]y with regard to this union which [s]eemed to be their object, and thought it was better to retain the management of the matter in his own hands, and keep them divided among them[s]elves, but united in their dependence on him. He therefore [s]ent them word that "he had a very great affection for them, and would take care of their intere[s]t, which was al[s]o [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-112.jpg) \- external link  - Page 105. ] his own; that he would not [s]uffer old Lewis to [s]et his half tamed wild bea[s]ts upon them, nor eject them from their possessions, but that he would immediately take advice of his council, learned in the law, conjuring them by the affection which they profe[s][s]ed to bear towards him, to be aiding and a[s][s]i[s]ting in all ways, in their power, towards bringing the controver[s]y to an i[s][s]ue. At this time, the [s]teward, to whom Mr. Bull entru[s]ted the care of his business, was not a per[s]on of that di[s]cernment and expedition which the exigency of affairs required. He had committed divers blunders in his accounts, and it was suspected that he was a defaulter in more re[s]pects than one. It cannot, therefore, be expected, that in conducting a controversy of this magnitude, he [s]hould exactly hit on the right methods, nor employ the be[s]t council which could be had. The fir[s]t [s]tep which was taken was to [s]end [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-113.jpg) \- external link  - Page 106. ] Broadoak [47] the bailiff, with a writ of intrusion, which he was ordered to [s]erve volens nolens , upon one of the me[s][s]uages or hunting [s]eats of Lewis. This bailiff, proceeding ra[s]hly and again[s]t the be[s]t advice into the fore[s]t, not a [s]tep of which he was acquainted with, found his progre[s]s impeded in a way wholly unexpected. For Onontio had taken care to place a number of his half tamed wild cats and wolverenes on the boughs of trees, which hung over the path, and as [s]oon as the bailiff came within reach, having fir[s]t wetted their tails with their own urine, they whi[s]ked it into his eyes till they blinded him. This manoeuvre put a [s]top to the proce[s]s for that time. Several other attempts of the like kind were made without [s]ucce[s]s, and Lewis at one time had almo[s]t got po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of Orange Hall .  Â Not only the fore[s]ters them[s]elves, but even Bull's own dome[s] [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-114.jpg) \- external link  - Page 107. ] tics, complained bitterly of the[s]e ineffectual mea[s]ures, and their clamors at la[s]t prevailed to make him di[s]charge his old [s]teward, and put another into his place. The new officer [48] [s]oon changed the face of affairs; he employed no attorneys, nor bailiffs, but tho[s]e of tried and approved abilities, men of enterprize and re[s]olution, by whom the [s]uit was pro[s]ecuted in good earne[s]t. In every action Bull recovered judgment, and got po[s][s]e[s][s]ion. When Lord Strut came in to the aid of Lewis, Bull ca[s]t him al[s]o, and took away his manor of Augu[s]tine, which, with the whole tract of land, where Onontio pre[s]ided, was annexed to his e[s]tate. The agents who had been employed in this arduous [s]ervice, were not only well paid for doing their duty, but, with the [s]teward, who employed them, were honored according to the ancient, but whim[s]ical cu[s]tom of Bull's family, by having their effigies portrayed on [s]ign boards, pocket handkerchiefs, [s]nuff [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-115.jpg) \- external link  - Page 108. ] boxes, and punch bowls; [s]o that while the fit la[s]ted, you could not walk the [s]treets, nor blow your no[s]e, nor take a pinch of [s]nuff, nor a draught of punch, but you were obliged to [s]alute them. Whenever Bull's [s]teward called upon the fore[s]ters for their quotas of aid, towards carrying on this heavy law[s]uit, they always readily afforded it; and [s]ome of them were really almo[s]t exhau[s]ted by the efforts which they made, to do more than their [s]hare. The [s]teward was [s]o [s]en[s]ible of their merit, that on due con[s]ultation with Mr. Bull's wife, and her taking him in the right mood, he was prevailed upon to reimbur[s]e the extra expen[s]e to them, and mutual complacency reigned between the landlord and tenants all the time this [s]teward remained in office. But the[s]e times were too good to la[s]t long; there were [s]ome who envied the [s]teward his reputation, and rai[s]ed [s]tories to his disadvantage, which highly affronted him. At [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-116.jpg) \- external link  - Page 109. ] this time Mr. Bull was [s]o much off his guard, as to give heed to the[s]e reports, and take a ra[s]h [s]tep in a hurry, which he had occa[s]ion to repent of at his lei[s]ure. He accepted the re[s]ignation of this tru[s]ty [s]ervant, and put one of his [49] [s]i[s]ter Peg's ca[s]t off footmen into his place; whereby he laid a foundation for his own di[s]grace, and the di[s]memberment of his e[s]tate, of which I [s]hall give you a particular account hereafter.

It is well known that he was of a choleric habit, and that tho[s]e who were acquainted with his humor and pa[s][s]ions, could manage and impo[s]e upon him at their plea[s]ure. Had he been let alone to pur[s]ue his own bu[s]ine[s]s him[s]elf , his plain, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-118.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] natural good [s]en[s]e, and genero[s]ity of mind, would have kept him clear of many difficulties; but he had his advi[s]ers, his hangers on, his levee hunters, his toad eaters, and [s]ycophants, forever about him, who, like a parcel of blood [s]uckers, could never have enough to glut their voracity. When the fore[s]t was fir[s]t occupied by the tenants, Bull had a wife [50] who minded her own dome[s]tic bu[s]ine[s]s, and did not concern her[s]elf with his landed intere[s]t. The lea[s]es and grants were made out in his name, and he was [s]uppo[s]ed to be the owner or proprietor; but the lady whom he had married after his [s]econd [s]ickne[s]s was very a[s][s]uming, and in[s]i[s]ted on having her hand in the management of all his affairs. She vi[s]ited the compting hou[s]e, and made the clerks [s]hew her their books; [s]he overhalled the [s]teward's accounts, and in[s]pected his corre[s]pondence; [s]he not only looked after the rents and incomes of the fore[s]t, but even intruded into the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-119.jpg) \- external link  - Page 112. ] hou[s]ehold concerns of the tenants, and affected to call her[s]elf their mother , because [s]he had taken [s]ome care of one or two of them in their fir[s]t fetting out, although mo[s]t of them [s]carcely ever had [s]een her face, or had any acquaintance with her, but by hear[s]ay. It mu[s]t be ob[s]erved, al[s]o, that this woman had engaged Mr. Bull in [s]ome expen[s]ive law[s]uits and [s]peculations, which had got him deeply into debt , and he was obliged to hire money of u[s]urers to carry her [s]chemes into execution. Had [s]he, at the [s]ame time, introduced that frugality and economy into the family, which her duty ought to have prompted her to, this debt might have been kept down; but the [s]warm of harpies which were continually about her, and the cour[s]e of gambling which was carried on under her connivance and direction, [s]wallowed up all the profits of the trade, and incomes of the land; while the luxury and di[s][s]i [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-120.jpg) \- external link  - Page 113. ] pation of the family in crea[s]ed, in proportion as the means of di[s]charging the debt de crea[s]ed. In [s]hort, Mr. Bull was reduced to that humiliating condition, which, by whatever fa[s]hionable name it may now go, was formerly called petticoat-government . During the law[s]uit with Lewis and Lord Strut, [51] concerning the fore[s]t, there had been a great intercour[s]e with the tenants. Many of Bull's [s]ervants and retainers, who were employed as bailiffs and attornies, and their deputies, had been very conver[s]ant with them, and were entertained at their hou[s]es, where they always found whole[s]ome victuals, jolly fire [s]ides, and warm beds. They took much notice of every thing that pa[s][s]ed, a[s]ked many que[s]tions, and made many remarks on the goodne[s]s of the land, the plea[s]ant [s]ituation of the hou[s]es, the clean and thriving condition of the children, who [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-121.jpg) \- external link  - Page 114. ] were always ready to wait them, to clean their boots, hold their [s]tirrups, open and [s]hut the gates for them, and the like little nece[s][s]ary [s]ervices, as well bred children in the country are wont. The remarks which the[s]e per[s]ons made, when they got home, favored rather of envy, than of gratitude or affection. Some of them would [s]ay: "Tho[s]e fellows live too well in the fore[s]t; they thrive too fa[s]t; the place is too good for them; they ought to know who is their ma[s]ter; they can afford to pay more rent; they ought to pay for the help they have had; if it had not been for Ma[s]ter Bull, and the a[s][s]i[s]tance which he has lent them, they would have been turned out of doors; and now they are to reap the benefit of his exertions, while he, poor man, is to pay the co[s]t." There were not wanting [s]ome, in the families of the Fore[s]ters them[s]elves, who had the meanne[s]s to crouch to the[s]e fellows, and [s]upplicate their favour and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-122.jpg) \- external link  - Page 115. ] interest with Mr. Bull, to recommend them to [s]ome po[s]ts of profit, as under[s]tewards, collectors of rent, clerks of receipts, and the like pretty offices. The[s]e beggarly curs would repeat the [s]ame language, and hold corre[s]pondence with the bailiffs, attornies, &c. after they had got home. Whenever any trifling quarrel happened in the families of the tenants, they would magnify it and fill their letters with complaints of the licentiou[s]ne[s]s of the people, and plead for a tighter hand to be held over them. Such [s]peeches as tho[s]e were frequently made, and [s]uch letters read, in the hearing of Mr. Bull's wife and [s]teward. Their language grew by degrees to be the current language of the family, and Bull him[s]elf li[s]tened to it. His choler ro[s]e upon the occa[s]ion, and when his hangers on ob[s]erved it, they plied him with [s]tronger do[s]es, till his jealou[s]y and hatred were excited, and a complete revolution in his temper, with regard to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-123.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] his tenants, took place, agreeably to the mo[s]t [s]anguine and malevolent wi[s]hes of his and their enemies. The fir[s]t effect of this change was, that his clerks were ordered to charge not only the prices of the goods, which the tenants [s]hould purcha[s]e, but to make them pay for the paper [52] on which their bills of parcels and notes of hand were written, and that at a very exorbitant rate. This was [s]o intolerable an abu[s]e, and withal [s]o mean, pitiful, and beggarly an expedient to pick their pockets, that they held a meeting among them[s]elves, and re[s]olved not to buy any more of his goods, as long as this impo[s]ition la[s]ted; and by way of contempt, they hanged and burned the effigies of the [s]teward, and other per[s]ons who were [s]u[s]pected of having advi[s]ed to the[s]e new mea[s]ures. The re[s]entment [s]hewn by the tenants on this occa[s]ion was quite unexpected. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-124.jpg) \- external link  - Page 117. ] The [s]ecret favourers, and real authors of the mi[s]chief, began to be afraid that they had gone too far for the fir[s]t attempt. Bull's journeymen were in an uproar about it, left by the failure of his trade, they [s]hould be out of bread; and to [s]horten the [s]tory, he was obliged to give up the point of making them pay for the paper, though Madam had the [s]ingular mode[s]ty to make a declaration, that it was a mere matter of expediency , and that [s]he had the [s]ole power and right of dominion over them, notwith[s]tanding Mr. Bull's mo[s]t gracious conce[s][s]ion at that time. [53] This was con[s]idered by the tenants as a mo[s]t impudent and barefaced assumption; for whatever rights Mr. Bull might pretend to have, as their old ma[s]ter and landlord, yet they never had any idea of a mi[s]tre[s]s over them; and though they very complai[s]antly returned him their thanks for his pre[s]ent goodne[s]s, yet as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-125.jpg) \- external link  - Page 118. ] they [s]u[s]pected that there was more mischief hatching, they began to inquire more narrowly than ever into his right and title to the land, on which they lived. They looked over old parchments and memorandums, con[s]ulted council learned in the law, and after due deliberation, they were fully convinced, that their own title was, at lea[s]t, as good as his, and that they had a right to refu[s]e him any rent or acknowledgment, if it were prudent for them to exerci[s]e it. Mr . Bull's jealou[s]y was now increa[s]ed with regard to their intentions, and his [s]cribbling retainers frequently accu[s]ed them of ingratitude and di[s]obedience, and a long premeditated de[s]ign to [s]et up for independence; a thing which they had not yet thought of, and probably never would, if this abu[s]ive treatment had not put it into their heads. But though by tho[s]e means they were led into an inquiry, and a train of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-126.jpg) \- external link  - Page 119. ] thinking, which were quite new to them; yet as old habits are not ea[s]ily broken, and their affection for their ma[s]ter was very [s]trong, they endeavoured, with a candor which did them honor, to transfer the blame from him to his wife and [s]teward, to who[s]e machinations they knew he was a dupe. The[s]e bad coun[s]ellors [s]oon renewed their attempts in another [s]hape, by rai[s]ing the rent, and putting an advanced price upon the goods, and by means of additional clerks, packers, porters, watchmen, draymen, &c. who were continually in waiting, and to all of whom fees were to be paid, the trade laboured under great embarra[s][s]ments, and [s]ome of the fore[s]ters were quite di[s]couraged, others were vexed and impatient, while [s]ome of the better tempered of them, endeavoured to persuade the re[s]t to keep up the communication as long as they could. They were loth to quarrel with their old ma[s]ter, and yet could not pocket the affronts and abuses to which they were daily expo[s]ed. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-127.jpg) \- external link  - Page 120. ] During this [s]ullen interval, many letters pa[s][s]ed, many books and precedents were examined, and much ink was [s]hed, in a controver[s]y, which, however incapable of a deci[s]ion in this way, might have been compromi[s]ed , if Mr. Bull's fir[s]t thoughts had been as good as his [s]econd; but he was [s]o completely under management, as not to [s]ee his true intere[s]t. It was a common [s]aying among his neighbors, "John Bull's wit comes afterward;" and in fact it did not come in this ca[s]e, till too late, for, when a cau[s]e once gets into the law, there are [s]o many quirks, eva[s]ions, demurs, and procra[s]tinations, that it is impossible to make a retreat, till one or both of the parties have [s]everely [s]marted for their temerity.

DEAR SIR, I SUPPOSE you are by this time impatient for the [s]tory of the lawfuit; how it began and how it was carried on and ended. I will give it to you as briefly as [s]o long and intricate a matter will bear to be told; and I am apprehensive you will think that Mr. Bull was [s]o ill a politician, or [s]o badly advi[s]ed, as actually to pick a quarrel with his be[s]t customers. But facts will [s]peak for themselves. Know then, that by the advice of his dear wife and her gambling junto, Mr. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-129.jpg) \- external link  - Page 122. ] Bull was prevailed upon to [s]end a dozen pounds of tea to each of his tenants, as a pre[s]ent  , in token of his extreme good will to them, and becau[s]e he knew that they loved it, and at the [s]ame time to order his clerks to charge three pence per pound for the paper and pack thread in which this exhilarating weed was wrapped. This trifling [s]um he expected would be paid on demand, in acknowledgment of their good will to him as their kind and generous landlord, who had protected and defended them again[s]t all oppo[s]ers, and would [s]till continue to protect and defend them as his beloved children and obedient humble [s]ervants. The knowledge of his intention happened to come to them [s]ooner than the pre[s]ent, and they began to argue thus among them[s]elves---"Ha! how comes this? What is freer than a gift? If Mr. Bull really intends the tea as a prefent, why does he exact three pence? Had he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-130.jpg) \- external link  - Page 123. ] offered it to us as an article of merchandise as u[s]ual, we might have taken it if we had liked the price, or left it if we had not; but this is a new way of trading to which we have not been accu[s]tomed. There is a de[s]ign in this. If we receive this present and pay the trifling acknowledgment of three pence, by and by we [s]hall have a pre[s]ent with [s]ix pence annexed, and another with a [s]hilling, and [s]o on. If we once e[s]tabli[s]h a precedent there is no knowing where to [s]top, and by the[s]e pre[s]ents we may be gulled out of all our loo[s]e corns, and afterwards our real e[s]tates may be demanded! No, it is better to prevent an evil than to cure it. We will have none of your pre[s]ents, Mr. Bull, if this is to be the con[s]equence. We have paid our debts well---you have had the exclusive benefit of our trade, and have become rich by it, and now in your old age you are grown tricki[s]h---It is time for us to be on our guard and keep a [s]harp look out, for if a man does not take care of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-131.jpg) \- external link  - Page 124. ] him[s]elf who can he expect will take care of him?" Fortified with the[s]e arguments they waited for the approach of the messengers which were on the road with the pre[s]ent. One of them came to Charles Indigo's hou[s]e, and with Mr. Bull's compliments begged his acceptance of a package of tea---"Throw it into that cellar, [s]aid Charles, and let it lie there till I have con[s]idered of the matter." Another came to William Broadbrim--- but as the way to William's mansion was through a long, crooked, miry lane, he had ordered the porter to [s]top him, and give him liberty to return without delivering his me[s][s]age. Peter Bullfrog did the [s]ame, but [s]ome part of the tea being [s]muggled into the hou[s]e, as [s]oon as Peter knew it he threw it into the gutter. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-132.jpg) \- external link  - Page 125. ] John Codline had the greate[s]t difficulty about Mr. Bull's pre[s]ent. He would gladly have [s]ent back the messenger, but unluckily for him the gate which led to his hou[s]e was held fa[s]t by Bull's under [s]teward, who con[s]tantly watched and attended there to ob[s]erve who went in and out, which [s]ervice he was more particularly fond of, becau[s]e he expected a douceur for opening and [s]hutting the gate. Having admitted the me[s][s]enger and received his penny , he [s]tiffly refused to let him out again without having delivered the pre[s]ent. The [s]ee was tendered, but this could not prevail; the family were unea[s]y, they were loth to a[s][s]ront Mr. Bull, and yet determined not to receive his pre[s]ent. They could not account for the conduct of the understeward on any other principle than this, that he expected to get a [s]hare of the three pence per pound, and of all other profits ari[s]ing from future pre[s]ents; and was afraid he [s]hould lo[s]e it if he let the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-133.jpg) \- external link  - Page 126. ] me[s][s]enger return. The family was called together in the chapel, where they held a long con[s]ultation, [s]ent [s]everal me[s][s]ages to the under [s]teward, who held fa[s]t the gate, and finally refu[s]ed to open it. They were driven at length to an extremity and threw the tea into the vault, where it peri[s]hed, at the [s]ame time prote[s]ting that the whole blame ought to be charged on the under [s]teward, as they had no intention of injuring Mr. Bull if they could have avoided it. As [s]oon as this was known in Mr. Bull's family, his wife fell into a violent hy[s]teric fit, and in her raving phrenzy denounced all the vengeance which it was in her power to execute, on the[s]e refractory, ungrateful tenants, who would not accept a pre[s]ent when it was [s]o freely offered to them. But when [s]he came a little to herself, [s]he was per[s]uaded by her gambling companions not to attempt any thing against the whole body of the tenants, le[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-134.jpg) \- external link  - Page 127. ] they [s]hould be driven by nece[s][s]ity to form an union among them[s]elves, which might defeat the plan; [s]he therefore propo[s]ed to Mr. Bull to [s]ingle out one of the mo[s]t refractory of them, and [s]hew his re[s]entment in a particular manner to him , hoping that the others would be intimidated and let him [s]uffer alone, and be glad to get off [s]o well them[s]elves. The per[s]on [s]ingled out for the object of re[s]entment was John Codline, and the mode of re[s]entment was as ridiculous as it was malicious, for it was nothing more nor le[s]s than to [s]end a bailiff, with a pack of blood hounds, to [s]tand before the great gate that led to the front of his hou[s]e. This, it was thought, would [s]trengthen the authority of the under [s]teward who had the key of the gate, and would reduce the family to this dilemma, either to receive no company and carry on no bu[s]ine[s]s, or el[s]e to [s]ubmit to Mr. Bull's new mode of trading. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-135.jpg) \- external link  - Page 128. ] The rea[s]on a[s][s]igned for this particular mode of revenge was, that Mr. Bull, as lord of the manor, claimed a kind of [s]overeign right to the high way. He had for a long time exacted an acknowledgment from all pa[s][s]engers; whenever they happened to meet any of his hor[s]es or carriages on the road, whether he was there him[s]elf or not, they were obliged to dou[s]e the hat, or they might be [s]ure of receiving a [s]troke of the whip, if not of being run down by his [s]ervants, who had [s]pecial orders not to let any omi[s][s]ion of this nature pa[s]s unpuni[s]hed. In con[s]equence of this manoeuvre on the part of Mr. Bull, every per[s]on who had any bu[s]ine[s]s to do with John Codline was [s]topped in the road, and ordered to go back, or pa[s]s by like the Prie[s]t and Levite, on the other [s]ide. However, tho[s]e who had a mind to [s]ee him, found means to climb over the fence, or to go up a narrow lane, which, by the help of a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-136.jpg) \- external link  - Page 129. ] [s]tile and a foot path, led them to Codline's back door. This [s]pecies of puni[s]hment expo[s]ed Mr. Bull to the ridicule of all his neighbors. It al[s]o proved quite ineffectual to the purpo[s]e for which he de[s]igned it. Instead of hindering company from coming to Codline's hou[s]e, it brought more; and he received many letters from tho[s]e who could not come in per[s]on. But, what was of more [s]ervice to him than letters or visits was this, that many who were indebted to him came and made payment, and tho[s]e who had at various times received favours from him when they were in distress, [s]ent him pre[s]ents, and encouraged him to keep up a good heart, promi[s]ing to [s]tand by him to the la[s]t extremity, if he [s]hould be reduced to it. It has been ob[s]erved, that one advantage which Mr. Bull expected would ari[s]e from this [s]pecimen of his refined policy [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-137.jpg) \- external link  - Page 130. ] was, that it would di[s]unite the tenants, and frighten [s]ome or perhaps all the others into a compliance with the new mode of traffic. This expectation was grounded on one of the Fables of E[s]op, which relates, that a fox who had been caught in a trap, and di[s]engaged him[s]elf by the lo[s]s of his tail, whenever he appeared among the foxes, was the object of their ridicule; upon which he endeavoured to per[s]uade them that he had been travelling to learn fa[s]hions, and that the newe[s]t fa[s]hion was for foxes to cut off their tails as a u[s]ele[s]s and burden[s]ome appendage, and boa[s]ted how much more light and nimble he had become [s]ince he had parted with that encumbrance; to which an old fox replied, that if he would do ju[s]tice to his argument he ought to produce the [s]hears with which he had cut off his tail, for the conviction of his brethren. This fable, and the moral couched under it, rai[s]ed a great deal of vain [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-138.jpg) \- external link  - Page 131. ] expectation and triumph in the family of Mr. Bull; but the fore[s]ters had another of their own making, which was a match for it. A man meeting a [s]erpent in the field, [s]truck at him with a [s]tick, and there being but one in his view he thought to kill him immediately; but the [s]nake [s]et up [s]uch a hi[s]s as brought a dozen more out of their holes, who attacked the proud murderer in front, rear, and flank, and obliged him to take to his heels for [s]afety. This fable was [s]o much admired among the fore[s]ters at that time, that they had an engraving made on all their me[s][s]age cards, of a wounded [s]erpent, with this motto, Join or die  . Adieu . The quarrel begins in earne[s]t and is carried into the Law.---Conduct of the Managers on both [s]ides.---The fir[s]t verdict in favour of the Fore[s]ters given at  Saratoga Hall . DEAR SIR, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-139.jpg) \- external link  - Page 132. ] The in[s]ult which the fore[s]ters [s]uppo[s]ed to be put on them by the obstruction of the road, as mentioned in my la[s]t, cau[s]ed a [s]erious alarm, and induced them to call a meeting of the heads of the [s]everal families to con[s]ult for their own [s]afety. The re[s]ult of this meeting was to endeavour by all peaceable means in their power to effect an accommodation; but if that [s]hould fail, to prepare, in the be[s]t manner they could, to a[s][s]ert and maintain their rights, po[s][s]e[s][s]ions and properties. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-140.jpg) \- external link  - Page 133. ] In pro[s]ecution of the former part of their plan, they wrote letters to Mr. Bull, and to [s]everal members of his family; and with re[s]pect to the latter part, they came to a re[s]olution to buy nothing more of him till he [s]hould change his mode of conduct, and treat them as he had formerly done. In the letters which they wrote on this occa[s]ion, though they profe[s][s]ed a great deal of re[s]pect and affection for the old gentleman him[s]elf; they omitted to [s]end their compliments to his wife. This was more than madam could bear. She therefore, after con[s]ulting with her gambling companions, determined upon the two following points; fir[s]t, that no answer at all [s]hould be given to the letter; and [s]econdly, that an action at law [s]hould be entered, and the tenants ejected from their po[s][s]e[s][s]ions. She would not however have come to this latter determination, if [s]he had not been a[s][s]ured by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-141.jpg) \- external link  - Page 134. ] persons who pretended thoroughly to understand their family [s]ecrets, that the foresters would not dare to defend their title in law;  but on the fir[s]t appearance of a legal proce[s]s, would [s]ubmit to any terms of accommodation which her lady[s]hip might think proper to impo[s]e. Full of this idea, [s]he roundly [s]wore that [s]he would [s]ee them pro[s]trate at her feet , before [s]he would make up the matter with them on any terms whatever. Influenced by her pa[s][s]ions, Mr. Bull's choler ro[s]e to the highe[s]t pitch. As lord of the manor, he placed bailiffs and blood hounds in the high way, and denied all pa[s][s]age to any per[s]ons without his licen[s]e. He then called upon all the coun[s]ellors and attornies to whom he had given a retaining fee, and who were very numerous, to exert all their learning and eloquence in maintaining his cau[s]e, promising them not only a regular payment of their [s]ees, but a generous allowance for [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-142.jpg) \- external link  - Page 135. ] di[s]bur[s]ements and incidental charges, to be paid at [s]ight by a draught on his banker. These [s]agacious gentlemen, many of whom were of Madam's own junto, finding that they had a fat client, contrived to hu[s]band the job , and [s]pin out the cau[s]e [s]ecundum artem . They were old prosicients in the [s]cience, and knew very well how to take double receipts of their stationers, bailiffs, me[s][s]engers, and other retainers, i. e. one receipt for the exact [s]um paid, and another for double the [s]ame [s]um; the[s]e latter were always produced as vouchers in the [s]ettlement of accounts, and in the glorious uncertainty of the law were admitted under the name of duplicates . It would divert you to [s]ee the numberle[s]s items which they crouded into their bills of co[s]ts, and the various pleas and pretences which were formed for demurring and continuing the cau[s]e from one [s]e[s][s]ion to another; while they were [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-143.jpg) \- external link  - Page 136. ] feeding their client with the hope that in every next [s]e[s][s]ion it would be decided. On the other hand, the fore[s]ters finding that Mr. Bull had retained [s]o many learned coun[s]ellors, [s]ergeants and barri[s]ters in his [s]ervice, and that he had by far the longe[s]t pur[s]e, were obliged to u[s]e the greate[s]t economy in conducting their defence. On looking round to [s]ee who was the mo[s]t prudent, the mo[s]t deliberate, and the mo[s]t determined among them, and to whom they might with [s]afety commit their cau[s]e, they unanimou[s]ly pitched upon Walter Pipeweed 's grand[s]on George ; who, being elected their chief attorney, mode[s]tly accepted the office on this generous condition, that they [s]hould not in[s]i[s]t on his receiving any fee or reward, becau[s]e he conceived that in [s]erving them he was doing no more than his duty. This in[s]tance of magnanimity was interpreted by them as a [s]ure omen of [s]ucce[s]s. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-144.jpg) \- external link  - Page 137. ] George was a man of good understanding and true [s]punk; he had made con[s]iderable progre[s]s in the [s]tudy of the law for his own amu[s]ement, and had practised at the bar in the defence of his own family claims again[s]t the encroachments of old Lewis. His abilities were of [s]uch a nature as to ri[s]e and [s]hine with the opportunities which called them into action. This was al[s]o the ca[s]e with divers other per[s]ons in the families of the fore[s]ters; who would perhaps never have thought of engaging in the [s]tudy of the law, had not this controver[s]y been agitated; but would have remained in the [s]tate which is thus elegantly de[s]cribed by the poet. "Full many a gem of pure[s]t ray [s]erene, The dark unfathomed caves of ocean bear; Full many a flower is born to blu[s]h un[s]een, And wa[s]te its [s]weetne[s]s on the de[s]art air." This circum[s]tance was predicted in the hearing of Mr. Bull's wife, by a very learned and hone[s]t gentleman, who would [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-145.jpg) \- external link  - Page 138. ] have di[s][s]uaded her from giving her husband [s]uch bad advice as to plunge himself into that "deep ditch," the law, out of which there is no coming till the la[s]t farthing be paid. "If there are any [s]eeds of genius, [s]aid this faithful advi[s]er, they are drawn into action by public ferments and troubles; but might have remained in time of tranquillity forever u[s]ele[s]s and unknown, perhaps at the plough, under a [s]hed, or among the lowe[s]t cla[s]s of mechanics." [54] This [s]age hint was totally di[s]regarded, becau[s]e, as I before observed, too much confidence was placed in a [s]et of advi[s]ers, who pretended to know all the family [s]ecrets of the fore[s]ters. But the prediction was fully verified when this law[s]uit brought to the bar one from his farm, and another from his merchandi[s]e, one from his [s]hed, and another from his [s]hop, Â till in fact they became a match, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-146.jpg) \- external link  - Page 139. ] in point of numbers at lea[s]t, for the whole ho[s]t of Mr. Bull's attornies. The fir[s]t action was brought again[s]t John Codline, who was deemed the mo[s]t [s]urly and refractory of the whole number. It was thought if he could be ca[s]t, the others would of cour[s]e [s]ubmit. In this way of proceeding, Mr. Bull acted like that [s]pecies of dog which bears his name, and which is known to attack his enemy by the head. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-147.jpg) \- external link  - Page 140. ] The cau[s]e was learnedly argued at the Court of Bunker hall , and the arguments in favour of the fore[s]ters made a very unexpected and very deep impre[s][s]ion on the managers for Mr. Bull. They found it a much more [s]erious affair than they had imagined, and thought it be[s]t to [s]top [s]hort and have the ca[s]e hung up , that they might con[s]ult their books over again, and prepare them[s]elves by better authorities and allegations at the next hearing. After a long time they contrived to [s]hift their ground  , [55] and let John alone. They advised Mr. Bull to [s]end for [s]ome lawyers out of Germany, who had been more u[s]ed to this game, and to lay an attachment on the e[s]tate of Peter Bullfrog, and the farm called C ae[s]area; where they expected to gain [s]ome greater advantage, partly because the tenancy was different, being founded on courte[s]y and not on lea[s]e, and partly becau[s]e of the diffentions which they heard were [s]ub[s]i[s]ting in the[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-148.jpg) \- external link  - Page 141. ] families. In this interval al[s]o Madam Bull's re[s]entment was rai[s]ed [s]o high, that [s]he [s]wore point blank that not one of the[s]e refractory [s]coundrels [s]hould enter her hu[s]band's doors nor have the lea[s]t connection with him, but that [s]he would drive them off from the land, and repeople the fore[s]t with another [s]et of men. When they had heard of this resolution, the heads of all the families in one of their con[s]ultations, came to a determination to publi[s]h an adverti[s]ement, [s]etting forth the various abu[s]es and grievances which they had [s]uffered from Mr. Bull, his wife, and her junto; and declaring that they looked upon the country as their own  , and them[s]elves as free from any obligations to him, and at liberty to look out for other markets, and invite other merchants to form connexions with them. This tran[s]action was [s]o important an era in the controver[s]y, that the fourth of July , the day on which the adverti[s]ement was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-149.jpg) \- external link  - Page 142. ] dated, has ever [s]ince been celebrated as a day of fe[s]tivity. The morning of that anniver[s]ary is u[s]hered in with a firing of guns and fluttering of pigeons. At noon you may hear [s]ome young lad [s]pouting a declamation in favour of free trade; which is generally followed by a bowl of punch and a rump of beef, and the day is concluded with a [s]ong and a dance. In the progre[s]s of the action, [s]everal points of law were argued at different times with much [s]kill and learning. On one of the[s]e occa[s]ions George was reducto a dilemma, and his opponents thought him ab[s]olutely [s]ilenced; but [s]uddenly recollecting him[s]elf, he ro[s]e [s]uperior to them, [56] and compelled them again to move for a continuance. Thus the cau[s]e was kept [s]u[s]pended till the third year was almo[s]t clo[s]ed. At length a vaunting braggadocio of a barri[s]ter on Mr. Bull's [s]ide, who thought to carry all before him, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-150.jpg) \- external link  - Page 143. ] was [s]o completely an[s]wered and confuted in an ob[s]tinate argument, that a verdict was given at Saratoga hall in favour of tho[s]e plantations, which had been [s]ued for in the northern part of the manor. This verdict relieved the fore[s]ters in [s]ome degree, and it was hoped would prove a good precedent for the deci[s]ion of the other [s]uits which were meditating against their brethren in the [s]outhern part. The unfortunate barri[s]ter was [s]everely reflected on by Mr. Bull's wife, for not doing his duty; and he was obliged to ju[s]tify him[s]elf by producing his instructions, and by telling a number of [s]erious truths re[s]pecting the fore[s]t and the foresters, which Mrs. Bull had often heard before but would not believe. The relation of the[s]e truths was [s]o very offen[s]ive, that [s]he influenced her hu[s]band never more to employ him; and as he could get: [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-151.jpg) \- external link  - Page 144. ] no other bu[s]ine[s]s in the law, he has [s]ince betaken him[s]elf to writing plays and romances.

DEAR SIR, You may well [s]uppo[s]e that a three years law[s]uit was a very expen[s]ive undertaking on both [s]ides; and you will wonder how the fore[s]ters, circum[s]tanced as they were, could [s]truggle with [s]uch an antagoni[s]t; e[s]pecially when the high way was [s]o ob[s]tructed that they could not carry their provi[s]ions to market to procure them ca[s]h. The truth is, that though they were [s]erved gratis by their prime coun[s]ellor, yet they were obliged to give [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-153.jpg) \- external link  - Page 146. ] promi[s][s]ory notes to the attornies, scriveners, bailiffs, and me[s][s]engers, whom they employed under him; but as the prospect of payment was di[s]tant, the notes pa[s][s]ed at a di[s]count, and the only remedy in their power was to i[s][s]ue more , which in[s]tead of le[s][s]ening increa[s]ed the difficulty. They had early fore[s]een this difficulty, and applied privately to Mr. Lewis, Mr. Frog, and Lord Strut, to borrow money on intere[s]t. The[s]e old curmudgeons, though each of them looked with an envious eye on Mr. Bull, and [s]ecretly wished he might lo[s]e the cau[s]e, yet were induced by various con[s]iderations to evade the que[s]tion propo[s]ed to them by the fore[s]ters. "We mu[s]t, [s]aid they, keep up appearances with our old neighbour; we have accounts open with him, as well as claims upon [s]ome portions of land, to which our title is no better than his; we may draw our[s]elves into a [s]crape, and fet [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-154.jpg) \- external link  - Page 147. ] our own tenants a bad example, for who knows but the [s]ame arguments may avail with them to refu[s]e their rents to us? Besides, how do we know whether the[s]e fellows will ever be able to pay? They offer to mortgage the manor to us, but the title is yet in di[s]pute, and how do we know whether it be theirs or Mr. Bull's?" The[s]e were the [s]ecret rea[s]ons which induced them to evade a direct an[s]wer to the me[s][s]engers; and, like true courtiers, "To [s]queeze their hands, and beg them come to-morrow." But as [s]oon as the verdict was given at Saratoga hall, they began to change their mind, and wi[s]h not only to make them debtors, but even to enter into contracts to a large amount. Mr . Lewis was the fir[s]t to make advances, and meeting the me[s][s]engers one day on 'change, he acco[s]ted them thus: "Your [s]ervant gentlemen---I congratulate you on your [s]ucce[s]s; you are welcome to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-155.jpg) \- external link  - Page 148. ] my hou[s]e, and warehou[s]e, and table. I will lend you a few livres to help you to fini[s]h the controver[s]y; and if Mr. Frog will advance a few [s]tivers, I will give him my bond for [s]ecurity. Be[s]ides, I will con[s]ent that my own coun[s]ellors, barristers, and attornies, whom I have retained, [s]hall a[s][s]i[s]t you at the next [s]e[s][s]ion, and I will [s]ee if I cannot open the high way, that you may bring your produce to market. When you [s]ee Lord Strut, give my compliments to him, and tell him what I have promi[s]ed, and I dare [s]ay he will, out of friend[s]hip to me , and for the [s]ake of our old family compact , give you [s]ome a[s][s]i[s]tance; for look ye, gentlemen, I will be hone[s]t with you, I mean to promote my own intere[s]t by [s]erving you, and I am [s]ure he has the [s]ame meaning." This change in the [s]entiments and language of Mr. Lewis was immediately made known to Mr. Bull, by means of [s]ome running [s]ootmen, who frequently carried [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-156.jpg) \- external link  - Page 149. ] news from one hou[s]e to the other. Consternation [s]eized the whole family, and Mrs. Bull her[s]elf began to think it a very [s]erious matter, and that it was nece[s][s]ary to do [s]omething immediately to prevent wor[s]e con[s]equences. She therefore held a curtain conference with Mr. Bull on the [s]ubject, thus--- Mrs. B. Well, my dear, what do you think of the conduct of your neighbour Lewis? Mr. B. Why I think he is a deceitful dog and means to ruin me. If the[s]e fellows get him for their friend, he will draw in Lord Strut and Nic Frog, and I [s]hall have them all to contend with at once; and therefore I think we had better compromi[s]e the matter with the tenants and let them take the land, if they will, and go to the D---l; why [s]hould I keep on throwing away good money after bad; I am damnably in debt now, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-157.jpg) \- external link  - Page 150. ] I wi[s]h to [s]top where I am, without getting any deeper into the law. Mrs. B. I agree with you, my dear, that he is a deceitful dog, and I wi[s]h the tenants could know his true character; if they did, I am per[s]uaded they would not put any confidence in him. There is a number of very [s]en[s]ible per[s]ons among them, and by the di[s]cour[s]e which I have had with [s]ome who know their [s]ecrets, I believe that means might yet be found to divide them, and to detach them from the intere[s]t of Lewis; and if you will let me manage the matter, I have no doubt that I [s]hall be able to accompli[s]h it. Poor John [s]etched a deep [s]igh, and [s]aid inwardly \---Ah, I have let you manage my matters [s]o long, that you have almo[s]t brought me to ruin! Then rai[s]ing his voice and wiping his eyes, he replied, Well, my dear, I have told you my mind plainly, but if you think you can do any thing to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-158.jpg) \- external link  - Page 151. ] [s]ave me, pray be [s]peedy; I would gladly keep the tenants attached to me, for the benefit of their trade, which is a matter of more con[s]equence than their rent, and if I [s]hould finally lo[s]e the land, I wi[s]h to be again connected with them in bu[s]ine[s]s. Mrs. B. Never fear, I do not doubt but we [s]hall find means to keep the land and have the trade too. I know how to [s]weeten them and bring them to good humour again. As [s]oon as this conference was ended, [s]he wrote a billet in a very complai[s]ant [s]tile, but in a hand [s]carcely legible, [57] and was in [s]uch a hurry to [s]end it, that [s]he could not wait for one of the clerks to copy it, prefenting Mr. and Mrs. Bull's compliments to the gentlemen tenants, informing them that it was not intended to trouble them any farther for the payment of paper and pack thread, which had been the occa[s]ion of the controver[s]y; but to [s]ettle all [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-159.jpg) \- external link  - Page 152. ] matters by a reference, and that [s]uitable persons [s]hould [s]oon be deputed to confer with them, or any of them, on the premises. This billet was hurried away by an expre[s]s, and actually arrived before the fore[s]ters had heard of Mr. Lewis's intended kindne[s]s to them. But they received it with contempt, and gave no other an[s]wer to it than this, "Let Mr. Bull withdraw his action and clear the road, and we will talk with him ; but as to his wife , we will have nothing to do with her ." After they had given this an[s]wer, word was brought them of the good will of Mr. Lewis, which was received with the greate[s]t joy imaginable. He was accounted the fine[s]t gentleman in the whole country, and all the [s]tories which they had heard of him through the medium of Bull's family, were [s]et down as lies. He was regarded as the protector of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-160.jpg) \- external link  - Page 153. ] injured, the helper of the di[s]tre[s][s]ed, and the friend of the rights of mankind. While the prai[s]es of Lewis were thus echoed from hou[s]e to hou[s]e, the deputies of Madam Bull arrived. They were instructed by her lady[s]hip to enter into free conver[s]ation with the fore[s]ters, or any of them, publicly or privately; to tell them that they were greatly deceived if they took Mr. Lewis for their friend; that he was an arch, fly, deceitful fellow, and that no tru[s]t ought to be put in him; that Mr. and Mrs. Bull were very amicably di[s]po[s]ed toward them, and willing to forget and forgive all that was pa[s]t, to renew the former intercour[s]e, to take off all the charges and burdens which had been complained of; to help them pay the debt which they had incurred by the lawfuit; and as the greate[s]t proof imaginable of Mrs. Bull's particular favour to them, [s]he would admit any of them to vi[s]it her in her own drawing room, and give [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-161.jpg) \- external link  - Page 154. ] them a [s]eat at her card table. As a token of her [s]incerity in the[s]e profe[s][s]ions, [s]he [s]ent [s]everal pre[s]ents to their wives and daughters, and gave the deputies a large pur[s]e of money to be di[s]tributed privately among the mo[s]t in[s]luential per[s]ons in the [s]everal families. The deputies had [s]carcely alighted before they [s]ent their footman to the door of the hou[s]e where the heads of the families were a[s][s]embled, with a me[s][s]age of compliments to announce their arrival, and a[s]k permi[s][s]ion to make a friendly vifit. The porter refu[s]ed entrance to the footman, and he returned, without having delivered his me[s][s]age. The deputies then wrote the purport of their errand and [s]ent it to the porter, who delivered it, and the following an[s]wer was returned--- " Gentlemen , we cannot hear any invectives again[s]t our good friend Mr. Lewis. If your ma[s]ter is in earne[s]t, tell [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-162.jpg) \- external link  - Page 155. ] him that he mu[s]t withdraw his action and clear the road. This is all from your humble [s]ervants, The Foresters ." Disappointed and chagrined, but not wholly di[s]couraged, the deputies attempted privately to get into [s]ome of the hou[s]es; but they were refu[s]ed entrance. They wrote letters and threw them in at the windows, or put them into the key holes, but all to no purpo[s]e. The firmness and inflexibility of the fore[s]ters astonished them, and they were obliged to return with aching hearts, and tell their ma[s]ter and mi[s]tre[s]s that the fore[s]t was lo[s]t forever. And now was verified the old [s]aying, "Earth has no cur[s]e like love to hatred turn'd; "Hell has no fury like a woman [s]corn'd."

What, not admit my deputies into their hou[s]es! Did ever any woman suffer [s]uch di[s]grace? Well, faith I will be revenged, and they [s]hall feel the power of my vengeance. I will pro[s]ecute them to the utmo[s]t extremity of the law; ay, and beyond law too, for I will [s]et their hou[s]es on fire over their heads, and drive them off the land! And as to that deceitful dog of a Lewis, I will rai[s]e [s]uch a hornet's ne[s]t about his ears, that he [s]hall repent his bargain! If Lord Strut attempts to help him, I'll lay an attachment upon his riche[s]t farms. And as for Nic Frog, if he lends them money, I will break up his warehou[s]e, and [s]ell all his goods by auction. I will [s]atiate my vengeance on the whole pack of them, and if I fall my[s]elf among the general wreck, I [s]hall have the glory of dying like Samfon in the ruin of my enemies." The rage which Mrs. Bull indulged on this occa[s]ion, and the noi[s]e which [s]he [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-166.jpg) \- external link  - Page 159. ] made in her raving fits, rai[s]ed a great alarm in the family, and as hy[s]terics are [s]aid to be catching, [s]o the di[s]temper [s]pread into the two next families, viz. into tho[s]e of [s]i[s]ter Peg and brother Patrick. The former imagined that it was Mr. Bull's intention to call in Lord Peter to his aid, becau[s]e he had been of late somewhat complai[s]ant to tho[s]e of his natural children, which re[s]ided in the family; and the latter expected that he [s]hould be treated in the [s]ame manner as the foresters, becau[s]e he had complained of [s]ome re[s]traints and impo[s]itions from his brother John Bull, in re[s]pect to his trade and business, which was that of a linen draper. Old jealou[s]ies and grudges were revived on this occa[s]ion, and the whole neighbourhood was in confu[s]ion. The dogs in Peg's family kept a con[s]tant howling and barking, and were an[s]wered by tho[s]e of Mr. Bull. Several of them actually ran mad, [58] and Bull was obliged to place guards at [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-167.jpg) \- external link  - Page 160. ] his doors and gates, who attacked the curs with clubs and killed [s]everal on the [s]pot. In the mid[s]t of this hurly burly, his hou[s]e was [s]et on fire, and was actually [s]een blazing in thirty [s]ix places at once; [59] the fire even penetrated madam's drawing room, and her card party were obliged to hand buckets and pump the engine; and it was not without the greate[s]t exertions that the whole man[s]ion was [s]aved from utter de[s]truction. A DIFFLCULTY al[s]o aro[s]e from another quarter, where it was little expected. The mea[s]ure which Mr. Bull had adopted of [s]topping the high way provoked all the neighbours, who thought it a great infringement of their common rights; but as he was a per[s]on of [s]o much wealth and power, they were afraid openly to conte[s]t that point with him. At length an elderly widow lady, of large property, with whom he had always lived on friend [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-168.jpg) \- external link  - Page 161. ] ly terms, and who generally went by the name of Madam Kate , took the liberty to tell him, that [s]he could no longer [s]uffer her neighbours and her[s]elf to be [s]o imposed upon; that the high way was common to all; that he had no right to [s]top pa[s][s]engers and examine them, but that every body ought to go about their lawful bu[s]ine[s]s without let or hindrance, and that [s]he was determined to form a combination [60] with Mr. Frog, Mr. Lewis, Lord Strut, and all the other neighbours, to remove the incumbrances which Mr. Bull had thrown in the way, and clear the pa[s][s]age. This combination extended to other objects, be[s]ides clearing the high way. They were all di[s]po[s]ed to help the foresters again[s]t Mr. Bull, though in different ways. Lewis had already lent them money and feed lawyers to plead for them. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-169.jpg) \- external link  - Page 162. ] Lord Strut, though rich in landed interest, yet generally anticipated his revenues, (or as the vulgar phra[s]e is, ate the calf in the cow's belly) he therefore had no money to [s]pare; but to oblige his friend Lewis, he laid an attachment on a southerly corner of the fore[s]t, which formerly belonged to him, and which from the numerous flowers with which it abounds, had got the name of Terra Florida . At the [s]ame time he attached one of Mr. Bull's favourite hunting [s]eats, [61] which commanded an exten[s]ive pro[s]pect, and was [s]ituate extremely convenient for hunting, fowling, and fi[s]hing. It had formerly belonged to Strut, but he had fooli[s]hly lo[s]t it by [s]taking it in a game of whi[s]t , which he played with Mr. Bull. It was a doubt in law whether real e[s]tate could be held by [s]uch tenure, but Bull had po[s][s]e[s][s]ion , and that you know is eleven points of the law. At any rate, it would oblige Bull to defend; and that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-170.jpg) \- external link  - Page 163. ] would co[s]t him money, and divert [s]ome at lea[s]t of his lawyers from the bu[s]ine[s]s of the fore[s]t. A SECRET corre[s]pondence had for [s]ome time been carried on between the fore[s]ters and Mr. Frog, for a loan of ca[s]h and a mercantile contract. Bull had suspected it, but could not prove it, till one night, his myrmidons caught a me[s][s]enger from the fore[s]t and [s]earched his pockets, [62] in which were found certain letters and other papers, which were [s]uppo[s]ed to amount to full evidence. Upon this occa[s]ion an adverti[s]ement was publi[s]hed, according to fa[s]hion, justifying the mea[s]ures about to be taken, and deploring the evils which were connected with them. However [s]mall a [s]hare of credit the[s]e publications obtain, it is generally as much as they de[s]erve. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-171.jpg) \- external link  - Page 164. ] To make [s]hort work with Frog, Mr. Bull got a [s]earch warrant, and [s]ent a bailiff to his riche[s]t warehou[s]e, [63] who entered it, per fas aut nefas , tumbled over the merchandi[s]e under pretence of [s]earching for [s]tolen goods; and having taken away as many as he plea[s]ed, by a writ of venditioni exponas  , he put them up at auction, and it is [s]aid made a fortune by this job. Mr. Lewis was [s]o exa[s]perated at the outrage thus committed on his friend Frog, that by a writ of [s]cire facias he laid claim to the ware hou[s]e and its contents, and brought in Bull for damages. In [s]hort, Mr. Bull now found him[s]elf [s]ou[s]ed over head and ears in that "deep ditch," the law. Like I[s]hmael of old, his hand was again[s]t every man, and every man's hand again[s]t him. Look which way [s]oever he would, he found enemies, and his own family were continually [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-172.jpg) \- external link  - Page 165. ] buzzing in his ears that he would bring his affairs to ruin. By the a[s][s]i[s]tance derived from the loans which they had negotiated with Lewis and Frog, and the additional coun[s]ellors and attornies which Lewis employed for them, the fore[s]ters pur[s]ued the controversy with as much vigor as the forms, delays, and uncertainty of the law would permit. No le[s]s than four years longer were con[s]umed in this expen[s]ive quarrel, and Mr. Bull's numerous retinue of lawyers were employing them[s]elves in the various chicanery and tergiver[s]ations of their profe[s][s]ion, all the while fattening on the profits of the [s]uit; whil[s]t his debt was growing at [s]uch a rate that he was at his wit's end to keep the intere[s]t from accumulating as well as the principal. At length, by a capital manoelig;uvre of Pipeweed's grand[s]on George, aided by the coun[s]ellors of Lewis, the cau[s]e was brought to a hearing at York court, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-173.jpg) \- external link  - Page 166. ] the arguments were of [s]uch efficacy that a [s]econd verdict was given in favour of the fore[s]ters, with large damages. This verdict came [s]o near to a final deci[s]ion, that all Mr. Bull's friends were convinced he could no longer maintain an action again[s]t the fore[s]ters; and [s]ome tru[s]ty old servants ventured to whi[s]per in madam's ear that it was high time to end the controversy, for that it could not po[s][s]ibly be carried any farther without bringing the family and the trade to total ruin. " Look ye, madam, [s]aid they, how all the [s]chemes which you have laid have been uniformly defeated; you have professed to know the family [s]ecrets of the[s]e fore[s]ters; but tho[s]e fellows who pretended to give you this information have deceived you. In fact they have no [s]uch [s]ecrets as your lady[s]hip imagines. What has been openly told you all along is the truth, and you ought long ago to have believed it. Now the conviction has [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-174.jpg) \- external link  - Page 167. ] forced it[s]elf upon you, and you can no longer with[s]tand it. The fore[s]ters have been defending their title in the law, and they have made it appear [s]o plainly, that no jury in the world will ever give a verdict again[s]t them. All who are acquainted with new lands know that the labour attending the improvement of them is worth ten times more than the land; and in fact gives the be[s]t title to it. If our ma[s]ter will now end the matter by a compromi[s]e, he may yet [s]ave [s]ome part of the manor at the northward, where is the be[s]t of hunting and fi[s]hing; but if he pur[s]ues the matter any farther he will lo[s]e it all." These faithful remon[s]trances, enforced by the nece[s][s]ity of the ca[s]e, began to have [s]ome effect on the turbulent mind of madam. She [s]aw that it was in vain to contend again[s]t the opinions of all mankind, and therefore in her next curtain lecture [s]he held a [s]hort dialogue with Mr. Bull, thus--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-175.jpg) \- external link  - Page 168. ] Mrs. B. My dear, I have been thinking whether it would not be be[s]t for you to come to a [s]ettlement of this long controversy. Mr. B. (groaning inwardly) So then you have changed your mind, have you? Mrs. B. Yes , my dear, I find I have been deceived with fal[s]e information, or I would never have advi[s]ed you to prosecute the matter [s]o far. Mr. B. Well , but how like a fool [s]hall I appear to the world, if, after I have threatened and hectored the[s]e fellows, and [s]pent [s]o much money to recover my right, I [s]hould give it up at this time of day? Mrs. B. Why you know, my dear, that you have formerly made concessions to them, becau[s]e I judged it expedient . [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-176.jpg) \- external link  - Page 169. ] Mr. B. Ay , then I retained my claim of right; but that will not do now Mrs. B. True , my dear, you mu[s]t give up your right and title to about two thirds of the fore[s]t; but you may [s]till hold the other third, and I dare [s]ay nobody will conte[s]t your right to that. And as for that part which you give up, you may [s]ay by it as old Lewis did of that which you once took from him. "Hang it, it is not worth the keeping; it has always been a bill of co[s]t to me," and the like. Mr. B. I wish , my dear, you had given me this advice [s]ome years [s]ooner, I [s]hould have [s]aved my money and my credit too. Mrs. B. Why , my dear, I tell you I was deceived; I am as [s]orry as you are for the lo[s]s of the money and of the fore[s]t, but as the ca[s]e is now circum[s]tanced, I think a compromi[s]e would be be[s]t. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-177.jpg) \- external link  - Page 170. ] Mr. B. Well , I will con[s]ider of it. When Mr. Bull had taken the matter into con[s]ideration, he thought it be[s]t to wait the i[s][s]ue of the [s]uit with Lord Strut about the hunting [s]eat, for he was loth to lo[s]e that; and happily for him, when that cau[s]e came to tryal, it was argued [s]o forcibly by his lawyers, that Strut was obliged to give it up. As [s]oon as Bull heard of that, he cried out, "Now is the moment of victory---now is the time for peace." So calling one of his clerks, "Here, [s]ays he, go and [s]ettle the matter with the foresters, or their deputies, on the be[s]t terms that you can." The deputies and the clerk [s]oon came to an agreement, and a quitclaim deed was drawn, de[s]cribing the butts and bounds of the fore[s]t, and distinguishing what he gave up to them from what he retained. This quitclaim being properly engro[s][s]ed, he with a trembling hand and aching heart [s]ub[s]cribed it, while madam, [s]tanding behind him, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-178.jpg) \- external link  - Page 171. ] could not help [s]hedding a tear at the [s]ight of a tran[s]action to which [s]he would never have con[s]ented but from dire necessity.

DEAR SIR, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-179.jpg) \- external link  - Page 172. ] I was loth to break the thread of my narration in my former letters, and you know that we prattling folks love to tell our [s]tories in our own way, which we are under great advantage to do when we are writing letters. But I will now go back to tell you [s]omething of the manner in which the fore[s]ters managed their domestic affairs during the controver[s]y with Mr. Bull, and for [s]ome time after it was clo[s]ed. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-180.jpg) \- external link  - Page 173. ] When they had broken their connexion with him, it was uncertain what connexions they might form abroad, but it was judged expedient for them to be united among them[s]elves, that no one family [s]hould connect it[s]elf in trade with any merchant or factor, without the con[s]ent of the others. In [s]hort it became nece[s][s]ary for them to enter into a partner[s]hip for their mutual intere[s]t and convenience. To do this was a nice point, and required much delicacy. It was to them a new [s]ubject, and they had an untrodden path before them. After much con[s]ultation and inquiry, their ingenuity [s]ugge[s]ted to them the idea of an original [s]ocial compact. "Why [s]hould we, [s]aid they, look abroad for precedents, when we have enough among our[s]elves? See the beavers in our own brooks and meadows, how they work in complete partner[s]hip, each family has its own cell, and a number of cells are placed in one pond. They carry on their operations with peace and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-181.jpg) \- external link  - Page 174. ] unanimity, without even the appearance of a ma[s]ter . Here is a perfect republic, a complete equality, a [s]triking example of order without [s]ubordination, of liberty without jealou[s]y, of indu[s]try without coercion, of economy without par[s]imony, of [s]agacity without overbearing influence. Every one knows his own bu[s]ine[s]s and does it, their labour goes on with regularity and decency; their united efforts [s]erve the common cau[s]e, and the intere[s]t of every one is involved in that of the whole. Let us go and do likewi[s]e." The hint took, and a plan of CONFEDERATION, as it was called, was drawn up on principles of the pure[s]t equality; each family retaining the entire control of its own domestic concerns, without any interference of the others, and agreeing to contribute voluntarily its proportion of labour and money to [s]upport the common intere[s]t. This was, in theory, a very pretty device, exactly [s]uited to a [s]et of people who [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-182.jpg) \- external link  - Page 175. ] thought them[s]elves completely virtuous. But as it often happens that great ingenuity exi[s]ts without much judgment or policy, [s]o it proved here. The[s]e foresters did not con[s]ider that their intellects were not, like tho[s]e of the beavers, confined to a few particular objects; that they were not like the beavers, void of pa[s][s]ions and prejudices, void of ambition, jealou[s]y, avarice and [s]elf intere[s]t. With all the infirmities and vices of humanity, they were expecting to e[s]tabli[s]h a community on a plan [s]imilar to that in which no [s]uch deformities can po[s][s]ibly find admittance. Though for a while, and during the period of the law[s]uit, when common danger impelled them to keep them[s]elves clo[s]e together, this plan an[s]wered the end better than none; yet in fact the notion of independence had [s]o intoxicated their minds, that having ca[s]t off their dependence on Mr. Bull, they thought [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-183.jpg) \- external link  - Page 176. ] themselves independent of all the world be[s]ide. When they had got entirely clear of the controver[s]y with him, they were in the condition of a young heir ju[s]t come of age, who feels proud of his freedom, and thinks he has a right to act without control. Each family felt its own importance, and expected a degree of re[s]pect from the others in proportion to its numbers, its property, its exertions, its antiquity , and other trifling con[s]iderations, which ought never to have had any place in a partner[s]hip of complete equality; and in con[s]equence of this intoxicating idea of independence, each family claimed the right of giving or withholding its consent to what was propo[s]ed by any or all of the others. In the club room, among a number of ingenious devices, there was a clock, of a mo[s]t curious and intricate con[s]truction, by which all the common concerns of the partner[s]hip were to be regulated. It had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-184.jpg) \- external link  - Page 177. ] one bell, on which thirteen di[s]tinct hammers [s]truck the hours. Each hammer was moved by independent wheels and weights, each [s]et of wheels and weights was enclo[s]ed in a [s]eparate ca[s]e, the key of which was kept, not as it ought to have been, by the per[s]on who repre[s]ented the family at club, but in each man[s]ion hou[s]e; and every family claimed a right either to keep the key at home or [s]end it to club, when and by whom they plea[s]ed. Now as this clock, like all other automatons, needed frequently to be wound up, to be oiled and cleaned, a very nice and particular adju[s]tment of circum[s]tances was necessary to pre[s]erve the regularity of its motions, and make the hammers perform their functions with propriety. Sometimes one or two of the hammers would be out of order, and when it came to the turn of one to [s]trike it would be [s]ilent; then there mu[s]t be a running or [s]ending home for the key, and the hou[s]es being at a con[s]iderable di[s]tance, much time was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-185.jpg) \- external link  - Page 178. ] [s]pent in waiting. Sometimes the messenger arrived at an un[s]ea[s]onable hour, when the family was a[s]leep, or abroad in the fields, and it would take up a considerable time to collect them, and lay the ca[s]e before them, that they might deliberate and determine whether the key [s]hould be [s]ent or not; and before this could be done, the clock would get more out of order. By this means, the club was frequently perplexed; they knew neither the hour of the day, nor the day of the month; they could not date their letters nor adju[s]t their books, nor do bu[s]ine[s]s with any regularity. Besides this there was another inconvenience. For though they had a [s]trong box, yet it was filled with nothing but bills of parcels and accounts pre[s]ented for payment, contracts of loans and indentures for [s]ervices. No money could be had from any of the families but by their own voluntary con[s]ent; and to gain this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-186.jpg) \- external link  - Page 179. ] con[s]ent there was great difficulty. Some had advanced what they [s]uppo[s]ed to be more than their proportion; others had paid le[s]s. The former would give no more till the latter had made up their quotas, and there was no authority which could call any one to account, or make him do his duty. Their whole e[s]tates were mortgaged for the money which they had borrowed of Mr. Lewis and Mr. Frog; and yet they could carry on no bu[s]ine[s]s in partner[s]hip. In fact they had formed [s]uch an unheard of kind of partnership, that though they could run them[s]elves in debt, yet they could not oblige one another to rai[s]e any money to di[s]charge their debts. Each family however carried on a separate trade, and they contrived to undersell each other, both at home and at market. Each family al[s]o had a [s]eparate debt, which [s]ome were providing means to di[s]charge, and others neglected. In [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-187.jpg) \- external link  - Page 180. ] one or two of the families they went to loggerheads among them[s]elves. John Codline's family was for [s]everal days a [s]cene of confu[s]ion and di[s]order; nothing was [s]een or heard but cur[s]ing and calling names, kicking [s]hins and pulling no[s]es. John at fir[s]t tried to [s]ilence them by gentle means, but finding the[s]e ineffectual, he at length drew his [s]cymitar, and [s]wore he would cut off the ears of the fir[s]t that [s]hould dare to make any more noi[s]e. This threatening drove two or three turbulent fellows out of doors, after which the hou[s]e was tolerably quiet. Something of the [s]ame kind happened in Robert Lumber's family, but he made [s]o good a u[s]e of his fi[s]t as quelled the di[s]turbance at once. In the family of Roger Carrier there [s]eemed to be a predominant lurch for knavery, for he publicly adverti[s]ed that he was ready to pay his debts by notes of hand [s]ubject to a di[s]count, the amount of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-188.jpg) \- external link  - Page 181. ] which was indefinite, becau[s]e continually increa[s]ing; and that whoever did not take his pay when thus offered, might go without. The other families were alarmed at his conduct; but had no power to oblige him to deal hone[s]tly, and he carried his roguery [s]o far as to bid them all defiance. In this [s]tate of debility and di[s]traction, it became nece[s][s]ary to con[s]ult on [s]ome mea[s]ures for a better plan of union. They began to be convinced that they were not beavers , nor capable of subsisting in [s]uch a [s]tate of [s]ociety as had been adopted from them. Something more energetic was wanted to compel the lazy, to check the knavi[s]h, to direct the industrious, and to keep the hone[s]t from being impo[s]ed upon. It had been often in contemplation to amend the mode of partnership; but now the di[s]orders in [s]ome of the families became [s]o alarming, that though they had been quelled for the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-189.jpg) \- external link  - Page 182. ] pre[s]ent, it was uncertain whether they would not break out again, e[s]pecially as one whole family [s]eemed determined openly to patroni[s]e roguery. The[s]e confiderations [s]erved to ha[s]ten the change which had been contemplated. It was accordingly moved in the club, that each family [s]hould appoint one or more persons to meet together, and con[s]ult upon [s]ome alterations and improvements in the partner[s]hip. This meeting was accordingly held, and the re[s]ult of it [s]hall be the [s]ubject of my next letter. Adieu. A new plan of partner[s]hip is propo[s]ed.--- Arguments pro and con.---It is established.--- A Chief Steward appointed, with inferior officers.---Hunting too much in fa[s]hion.---A new [s]pecies of rats introduced.--- Two families added to the number of apartments  . DEAR SIR, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-190.jpg) \- external link  - Page 183. ] It is not in my power to give you a particular detail of the whole proceedings of the meeting which was held to reform the plan of partner[s]hip in the manner of your parliamentary journali[s]ts, who make [s]peeches for the members, perhaps better than [s]ome of them make for them[s]elves; but I will endeavour to give you a [s]ummary of the principles on which they proceeded. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-191.jpg) \- external link  - Page 184. ] The profe[s][s]ed de[s]ign of the meeting was to reform and amend the plan; but in fact when they came to examine it they found them[s]elves obliged to pa[s]s the [s]ame [s]entence on it that was once delivered concerning the famous poet, Alexander Pope, who[s]e u[s]ual ejaculation was, G---d mend me!  "Mend you," [s]aid a hackney coachman, (looking with contempt on his dwarfi[s]h form and hump back) "it would not be half [s]o much trouble to make a new one." A NEW one was accordingly entered upon, and the fundamental principle of it was, not to [s]uppo[s]e men as good as they ought to be, but to take them as they are. "It is true, [s]aid they, that all men are naturally free and equal; it is a very good idea, and ought to be under[s]tood in every contract and partner[s]hip which can be formed; it may [s]erve as a check upon ambition and other human pa[s][s]ions, and put people in mind that they may [s]ome [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-192.jpg) \- external link  - Page 185. ] time or other be called to account by their equals. But it is as true that this equality is de[s]troyed by a thou[s]and cau[s]es which exi[s]t in nature and in [s]ociety. It is true that all bea[s]ts, birds, and fi[s]hes are naturally free and equal in [s]ome re[s]pects, but yet we find them unequal in other re[s]pects, and one becomes the prey of another. There is, and always will be, a [s]uperiority and an inferiority, in [s]pite of all the [s]y[s]tems of metaphy[s]ics that ever exi[s]ted. How can you prevent one man from being [s]tronger, or wi[s]er, or richer than another? and will not the [s]trong overcome the weak? will not the cunning circumvent the fooli[s]h, and will not the borrower become [s]ervant to the lender? Is not this noble, free, and independent creature man, nece[s][s]arily [s]ubject to lords of his own [s]pecies in every [s]tage of his exi[s]tence? When a child, is he not under the command of his parents? [s]end him to [s]chool, place him out as an apprentice, put him on board a [s]hip, enrol him in a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-193.jpg) \- external link  - Page 186. ] company of militia, mu[s]t he not be subject to a ma[s]ter? Place him in any kind of [s]ociety whatever, and he has wants to be [s]upplied, and pa[s][s]ions to be [s]ubdued; his active powers need to be directed, and his extravagances to be controled, and if he will not do it him[s]elf, [s]ome body mu[s]t do it for him. Self government is indeed the mo[s]t perfect form of government in the world; but if men will not govern them[s]elves, they mu[s]t have [s]ome governors appointed over them, who will keep them in order and make them do their duty. Now if there is in fact [s]uch an inequality exi[s]ting among us, why [s]hould we act as if no [s]uch thing exi[s]ted? We have tried the beaver [s]cheme of partner[s]hip long enough, and find it will not do. Let us then adopt the practice of another kind of indu[s]trious animals which we have among us---Let us imitate the bees , who are governed by one [s]upreme head, and under that direction conduct their [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-194.jpg) \- external link  - Page 187. ] whole economy with perfect order and regularity." On this principle they drew up an entire new plan, in which there was one chief [s]teward, who was to manage their united intere[s]t, and be re[s]spon[s]ible to the whole for his conduct. He was to have a kind of council to advi[s]e and direct him, and [s]everal inferior officers to a[s][s]i[s]t him, as there might be occa[s]ion; and a certain contribution was to be levied on the trade, or on the e[s]tates of the whole, which was to make a common [s]tock for the [s]upport of the common intere[s]t; and they were to erect a tribunal among themselves, which [s]hould decide and determine all differences. If nine of the families [s]hould agree to this plan, it was to take place; and the others might or might not adopt it; but if any one [s]hould finally refu[s]e, or if any [s]hould adopt it and afterward fall from it, he was to be looked [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-195.jpg) \- external link  - Page 188. ] upon as an outca[s]t, and no per[s]on was to have any connection with him. The meeting having continued a long time, every body became extremely anxious to know what they were about; the doors were kept [s]hut, and no per[s]on whatever was let into the [s]ecret till the whole was completed. A copy was then [s]ent to each family for them to con[s]ider at their lei[s]ure. Though curio[s]ity was now gratified, yet anxiety was not relaxed. The new plan of partner[s]hip went by the name of the fiddle; tho[s]e who were in favour of it called them[s]elves fiddlers , and tho[s]e who oppo[s]ed it were [s]tiled antifiddlers . The former [s]aid it was the be[s]t plan that human wi[s]dom had ever contrived. The latter imagined it pregnant with mi[s]chief of every kind. The former compared it to a [s]trong [s]ence about a rich field of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-196.jpg) \- external link  - Page 189. ] wheat. The latter compared it to the whale that [s]wallowed up Jonah. In each family a con[s]ultation was held on the que[s]tion, Whether it [s]hould be adopted or not? and liberty was given for every one to [s]peak his mind with the utmost freedom. The objections, an[s]wers, replies, rejoinders, and rebutters, which were produced on this occa[s]ion, would make a curious collection, and form an important page in the hi[s]tory of man. The fiddlers were extremely fond of having it examined, becau[s]e they [s]aid it was like a rich piece of plate, which the more it be rubbed [s]hines the brighter. The antifiddlers [s]aid it was like a worm eaten bottom of a [s]hip, the defects of which would more evidently appear the more it was ripped to pieces; they were therefore for rejecting it at once, without any examination at all. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-197.jpg) \- external link  - Page 190. ] When they were urged to point out its defects, they would [s]ay, "It is dangerous to put [s]o much power into the hands of any man, or [s]et of men, le[s]t they [s]hould abu[s]e it. Our liberty and property will be [s]afe whil[s]t we keep them our[s]elves, but when we have once parted with them, we may never be able to get them back again." If the plan was compared to a hou[s]e , then the objection would be made again[s]t building it too high, le[s]t the wind [s]hould blow it down. How [s]hall we guard it against fire? how [s]hall we [s]ecure it again[s]t robbers? and how [s]hall we keep out rats and mice? If it was likened to a [s]hip , then it would be a[s]ked, how [s]hall we guard it against leaking? how [s]hall we prevent it from running on the rocks and quick-sands? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-198.jpg) \- external link  - Page 191. ] Sometimes it would be compared to a clock , then que[s]tion was, how [s]hall we secure the pendulum, the wheels and the balance from ru[s]t? who [s]hall keep the key, and who [s]hall we tru[s]t to wind it up? Sometimes it was repre[s]ented by a pur[s]e , and then it was [s]aid to be dangerous to let any one hold the [s]trings. Money is a tempting object, and the be[s]t men are liable to be corrupted. In [s]hort, the whole [s]um and [s]ub[s]tance of the arguments again[s]t it might be summed up in one word---JEALOUSY. To [s]hew the [s]utility of the[s]e arguments it was ob[s]erved by the oppo[s]ite party, that it was impo[s][s]ible to put it into any man's power to do you good, without at the [s]ame time putting it into his power to do you hurt. If you tru[s]t a barber to [s]have your beard, you put it into his power to cut your throat. If you tru[s]t a baker to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-199.jpg) \- external link  - Page 192. ] make your bread, or a cook to dre[s]s your meat, you put it into the power of each to poi[s]on you; nay, if you venture to lie in the [s]ame bed with your wife, you put it into her power to choak you when you are a[s]leep. Shall we therefore let our beards grow till they are long enough to put into our pockets, becau[s]e we are afraid of the barber? Shall we [s]tarve our[s]elves becau[s]e the baker and the cook may poi[s]on us? and [s]hall we be afraid to go to bed with our wives? Fie, fie, gentlemen, do not indulge [s]uch whims: Be careful in the choice of your barbers, your bakers, your cooks, and your wives; pay them well and treat them well, and make it their intere[s]t to treat you well, and you need not fear them. After much debate and di[s]cu[s][s]ion, [s]ome of the families adopted it without exception, but in others the oppo[s]ition was [s]o [s]trong that it could not be made to pa[s]s, but by the help of certain amend [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-200.jpg) \- external link  - Page 193. ] ments which were propo[s]ed; and of the[s]e amendments every family which thought proper to make any, made as many as they plea[s]ed. The new plan, with its appendage of amendments, cut [s]uch a grote[s]que figure, that a certain wag in one of the families, like Jotham the [s]on of Gideon, ridiculed it in the following parable. "A CERTAIN man hired a taylor to make him a pair of [s]mall clothes; the taylor meafured him and made the garment. When he had brought it home, the man turned and twi[s]ted and viewed it on all [s]ides; it is too [s]mall here, [s]aid he, and wants to be let out;it is too big here, and wants to be taken in; I am afraid there will be a hole here, and you mu[s]t put on a patch; this button is not [s]trong enough, you mu[s]t [s]et on another. He was going on in this manner, when his wife entered the room---Have you put on the [s]mall clothes, my dear, [s]aid [s]he---No, [s]aid he. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-201.jpg) \- external link  - Page 194. ] How then, replied [s]he, can you po[s][s]ibly tell whether they will fit you or not? If I had made [s]uch objections to a gown or a pair of [s]tays before I had put them on, how would you have laughed at my female wi[s]dom? The man took his wife's advice and faved the taylor a deal of trouble." In like manner, the new plan of partnership was tried on , and was found to fit very well. The amendments were thrown by for future confideration, and if ever adopted, will be [s]o few and [s]o trifling as to make no effential difference. As [s]oon as a [s]ufficient number of the families had adopted the plan, they began to fet it in operation; and unanimou[s]ly cho[s]e for their chief [s]teward and manager, George, the grand[s]on of Walter Pipeweed. He had ferved them [s]o faithfully and generou[s]ly in conducting the lawfuit again[s]t Mr. Bull, that no per[s]on was higher [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-202.jpg) \- external link  - Page 195. ] in their confidence. As he would take no reward for his former [s]ervices; [s]o he began this new bu[s]ine[s]s with a declaration of the [s]ame kind, and a prote[s]tation that nothing could have induced him to quit the [s]weets of retirement for the toils of public bu[s]ine[s]s but a di[s]po[s]ition to oblige his numerous friends who had united their [s]uffrages in his favour. Every one who knows him is fully convinced of the sincerity of his declarations, and he has perhaps as large a [s]hare of the e[s]teem and affection of the people in the[s]e families as any per[s]on ever could expect from a cour[s]e of faithful and friendly offices. Besides him there is an under [s]teward, a council of advice, a chief clerk, a ca[s]hier, and a ma[s]ter of the hounds. The under [s]teward is a per[s]on of a grave deportment, much reading and [s]trict integrity, and was largely concerned in effecting the compromise with Mr. Bull. The council of advice are cho[s]en from the feveral [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-203.jpg) \- external link  - Page 196. ] families, and con[s]i[s]t of per[s]ons of the be[s]t education, abilities, and popularity. The chief clerk has the care of the mo[s]t important papers, and the ca[s]hier keeps the key of the [s]trong box, which now has [s]omething in it be[s]ides paper. By his advice the debts of the company are put in a fair way of being paid, though [s]ome grumbling [s]till [s]ub[s]i[s]ts among tho[s]e who were obliged to [s]ell their notes at a discount. The ma[s]ter of the hounds is an officer, who it was at fir[s]t thought would have very little bu[s]ine[s]s; but as the wild bea[s]ls of the fore[s]t have of late grown very trouble[s]ome, it is [s]uppo[s]ed that he will have his hands full. There is too much of a lurch for hunting among many of the fore[s]ters; and [s]ome have not been ashamed to expre[s]s their wi[s]hes that the whole race of wild creatures was exterminated from the face of the earth. There are others who [s]till continue of the mind, that the[s]e animals are a degenerated part of the human [s]pecies, and might yet be [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-204.jpg) \- external link  - Page 197. ] recovered if proper methods were u[s]ed to tame them; but it is greatly feared, that while the rage for hunting continues, all [s]uch benevolent projects will fail in the execution. In [s]ome late hunting matches, the[s]e wild animals di[s]covered [s]o much art and courage, that [s]everal of the hunters were laid to [s]leep in the bed of honour; and the re[s]t were obliged to take to their heels, that they might "live to hunt another day." Some perfons are of the mind that it is not be[s]t to [s]eek the[s]e bea[s]ts in their dens, but rather to guard the fields and take care of the poultry at home. Others are for pur[s]uing them to the thicke[s]t [s]hades of the fore[s]t, and this [s]eems at pre[s]ent to be the prevailing opinion. What the [s]ucce[s]s of it will be time mu[s]t determine. "The child that is unborn may rue, "The hunting of that day." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-205.jpg) \- external link  - Page 198. ] Since the new partner[s]hip has been e[s]tabli[s]hed, hu[s]bandry and trade have been carried on bri[s]kly; the hou[s]es are full of good things, and the children are well clad and healthy; but there is one inconvenience which u[s]ually attends a full hou[s]e, and that is, that rats are very numerous, and a new [s]pecies of them have lately found their way thither. [64] Some of them are very fat and [s]leek, and are not afraid to appear in open day light; though it is [s]uppo[s]ed they burrow under ground, and have [s]ubterraneous communications from hou[s]e to hou[s]e. This is an inconvenience again[s]t which no remedy has yet been found; though [s]ome people, from their apparent voracity , are of the mind that they will either prey upon one another, or el[s]e eat till they bur[s]t. I HAD almo[s]t forgot to tell you that two new families have lately been added to the number of partners. One is that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-206.jpg) \- external link  - Page 199. ] of Ethan Greenwood , [65] a [s]tout, lu[s]ty fellow, born in the family of Robert Lumber, but married into that of Peter Bullfrog, from whom, after a long di[s]pute, he has got a good tract of land, which originally belonged to his own father, but was [s]urreptitiou[s]ly taken po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of by his father in law. The other is Hunter Longknife  ,  Â he was bred in the family of Walter Pipeweed, and has a large [s]hare of his [s]pirit of adventure. Having taken up his re[s]idence in the out[s]kirts of the fore[s]t, he has had many a [s]cuffle with the wild bea[s]ts, who are extremely fond of his green corn and young chickens, whenever they can get a ta[s]te of them.

Pre[s]ent State of Mr. Bull.---His wife and bis mother.---Story of the everla[s]ting taper.--- Some account of Mr. Lewis.---His new wife and ca[s]t off mi[s]tre[s]s.---Conclusion  .

To begin with Mr. Bull. Though he has given a quitclaim of that part of the fore[s]t where his old [s]ervants and be[s]t [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-208.jpg) \- external link  - Page 201. ] customers have po[s][s]e[s][s]ion, yet he retains the northern part, together with [s]ome hunting feats which he promi[s]ed to give up to the fore[s]ters. The chief produce of this northern territory is the furs, which are brought to his warehou[s]e and wrought up by his trade[s]men. Notwith[s]tanding the lo[s]s of his title to the lands of the fore[s]ters, they have not wholly for[s]aken him as a trader. He keeps his fulling mills at work, and [s]upplies them with cloths of various kinds, but they feel them[s]elves at liberty either to purcha[s]e of him or his neighbours, or to manufacture for themselves. He is rather more complai[s]ant to them in his own [s]hop than his factors are in [s]ome of his di[s]tant warehou[s]es, where they are not allowed to carry their produce to market, nor to receive co[s][s]ee, cotton, and [s]ugar, as formerly. However, they have found out other places where they can buy the[s]e commodities without a[s]king his permi[s][s]ion. And as for that capital article TEA, which was the occa [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-209.jpg) \- external link  - Page 202. ] [s]ion of beginning the controver[s]y, they now [s]etch it directly from the original warehou[s]e of old Cang-hi , where it is manufactured. They purcha[s]e their [s]ilks and mu[s]lins of the fir[s]t makers and dealers, and get their wines directly from the vineyards. I HAVE before told you that Mr. Bull formerly u[s]ed to [s]end the ordure made in his family to enrich the plantations of the fore[s]ters; but [s]ince his quarrel with them he has been [s]omewhat at a lo[s]s how to di[s]po[s]e of it. At fir[s]t he threw it into the gutter [66] before his door. But there was [s]uch a large quantity of it, and the [s]tench which it cau[s]ed was [s]o offen[s]ive, that this expedient would not an[s]wer the end. He then thought of [s]ending it to a place where [s]ome of his family had been employed in botanizing ,  Â in hope that by adding to the fertility of the [s]oil, they would find more encouragement to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-210.jpg) \- external link  - Page 203. ] prosecute their inquiries, and that he [s]hould in time receive [s]ome rent or recompen[s]e; but this [s]cheme, like [s]ome others, the product of his fruitful brain, has been hitherto attended with more co[s]t than profit. What will be his next contrivance to di[s]po[s]e of his ordure no one can conjecture. He has been obliged, in deference to the opinion of his neighbours, to [s]ing [s]mall about his right to [s]topping the high way; and it is thought that he will not revive his preten[s]ions to an exclu[s]ive title to that kind of [s]overeignty. As to his dome[s]tic affairs, his wife [s]till rules him according to her u[s]ual maxims, and keeps up her gaming club, where [s]he wins and lo[s]es alternately; but between the [s]hop and the drawing room, there is enough gained to pay the intere[s]t of his debt, though it is not imagined he will ever be able to pay the principal. This, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-211.jpg) \- external link  - Page 204. ] like a mill[s]tone about his neck, mu[s]t finally [s]ink him. You may po[s][s]ibly be curious to know what is become of his mother , whom I have formerly mentioned to you as having had [s]ome [s]way in his family. The truth is, that [s]ince he married his pre[s]ent wife, the old lady found her influence decreasing and retired to her chamber, where [s]he has been for many years confined, and is now wholly bed rid. Mr. and Mrs. Bull indeed treat the old lady with much decency, and [s]uffer none to intrude upon her but [s]uch company as [s]he is fond of. Old Madam has all the infirmities of age about her. She will not [s]uffer her[s]elf to be touched nor turned in her bed; nor the room to be aired, nor her linen [s]hifted. She keeps her window [s]hutters clo[s]ed, and will not admit the lea[s]t ray of light in her apartment, but what proceeds from her own candle, which having been once dipped in con[s]ecrated water, is [s]uppo[s]ed to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-212.jpg) \- external link  - Page 205. ] po[s][s]e[s]s all the virtues of an everla[s]ting taper. Now I have [s]poken of madam's taper, perhaps you will be amu[s]ed with [s]ome account of it. It is a wax candle of a common [s]ize, [s]et in an old fa[s]hioned silver candle[s]tick, richly embo[s][s]ed and gilt, but the ru[s]t and du[s]t of it are [s]o [s]acred, that it is never permitted to be [s]coured. The tradition is, that this candle[s]tick formerly belonged to St. Peter, and the candle fir[s]t placed in it is [s]uppo[s]ed to have been lighted at the SUN, and by a mysterious kind of uninterrupted [s]ucce[s][s]ion , has been kept burning ever [s]ince. By the light of this taper, old madam reads her bible and books of devotion, which always lie on a table by her bed[s]ide. Some per[s]ons of an incredulous turn of mind, have pretended to call in question this my[s]tery; but it is [s]till held [s]acred by the old lady, and by mo[s]t of Mr. Bull's own family. There are [s]ome even [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-213.jpg) \- external link  - Page 206. ] among the fore[s]ters of the [s]ame opinion; and [s]uch is the liberality in the[s]e families, that no one is mole[s]ted in the indulgence of any innocent whim, which does not affect the peace of the families, nor the intere[s]t of the partner[s]hip. It was not long after the ree[s]tabli[s]hment of harmony between them and Mr. Bull, that the[s]e per[s]ons [s]ent two candles in one lantern, and one in another, to be lighted at this venerable taper, and dipt in the consecrated water. Two of them were actually lighted in old Madam Bull's presence, and to her great [s]atisfaction. The other was lighted at a taper [s]uppo[s]ed to be derived from the [s]ame original, but "hid under a bu[s]hel" in one of fi[s]ter Peg's out hou[s]es, it not being permitted to burn publicly in her family, where the only candles allowed are of the manufacture of Geneva. There has been as long a controver[s]y between different opinioni[s]ts on this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-214.jpg) \- external link  - Page 207. ] subject, as between the fectaries in Liliput, about breaking the egg at the big or little end. But it is ea[s]y enough to accommodate the matter by granting that St. Peter's candle, as well as tho[s]e from Geneva, were originally lighted at the SUN; that the [s]ame [s]ource of light is open to all; and that it is of no con[s]equence of what materials tapers are made, nor in what kind of candle[s]ticks they are placed, nor by who[s]e hands they are lighted, provided they give [s]o clear a light as to an[s]wer the purpo[s]es of vi[s]ion  . It remains only that I give you [s]ome account of Mr. Lewis. The adventures in his family have been very [s]ingular. I formerly told you that he feed lawyers to plead the cau[s]e of the fore[s]ters. The[s]e [s]ubtile practitioners [s]oon found that the [s]ame arguments which they were obliged to u[s]e in favour of the fore[s]ters, would apply with equal propriety to the ca[s]e of Mr. Lewis's own family. He had long [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-215.jpg) \- external link  - Page 208. ] been a widower, and the family was governed by a [s]ucce[s][s]ion of kept mi[s]tre[s][s]es, who minded only their plea[s]ures and the enriching of their own relations and dependants. The tenants were abu[s]ed, the man[s]ion hou[s]e was dirty and out of repair, and though the rents were paid into the hands of the [s]teward, yet much oppression and embezzlement, and little economy, were the con[s]tant topics of complaint. After the alteration, produced by the a[s][s]i[s]tance of Lewis's lawyers in the fore[s]t, they began to think it was high time to do [s]omething of the [s]ame kind at home. The only peaceable remedy which they could imagine, was to per[s]uade Mr. Lewis to marry a reputable woman, who would be agreeable to the family. After much argument he was at length brought to [s]ee the nece[s][s]ity of the ca[s]e; and to prevent a law[s]uit, with which they threatened him, he con[s]ented to take the wife [67] which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-216.jpg) \- external link  - Page 209. ] they recommended. She is a lady of good [s]en[s]e and polite manners, and treats him with the greate[s]t deference and propriety. She has had the man[s]ion thoroughly repaired, the floors and windows cleaned, and the walls whitewa[s]hed, and is not afraid to let her inmo[s]t apartments be vi[s]ited by the [s]un and air. The building is now commodious, whole[s]ome, and plea[s]ant, and the dirty dog kennel, [68] which [s]tood near the door, is demoli[s]hed. It is [s]u[s]pected by [s]ome that Lewis [s]till has a hankering after his old connexions, but he profe[s][s]es love to his new wife in the [s]tronge[s]t terms imaginable. His ca[s]t off mi[s]tre[s]s has had the audacity to in[s]ult the newly married lady, and tell her that [s]he has no bu[s]ine[s]s to occupy her apartments; that all Mr. Lewis's profe[s][s]ions are in[s]incere and that [s]he [s]till po[s][s]e[s][s]es his heart. If the[s]e ladies [s]hould go to pulling caps, Mr. Lewis will be in a critical [s]ituation, as indeed every man is when [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-217.jpg) \- external link  - Page 210. ] two women are contending for him. It is [s]aid that [s]ome of the neighbouring gentlemen, who prefer concubinage to matrimony, have taken the part of the late mi[s]tre[s]s, and in[s]i[s]t on her re[s]toration to bed and board; but how this matter will terminate can be decided only by futurity. He has al[s]o been very unfortunate in [s]ome of his di[s]tant plantations and factories. His black cattle have caught the horn di[s]temper; [s]ome of his farm hou[s]es have been burnt, and it is thought that [s]everal years will intervene before his affairs will be [s]et to rights. Thus , my friend, I have endeavoured to fulfil my promi[s]e, by giving you [s]uch an account as I have been able to procure of the fore[s]ters and their connexions. I a[s][s]ure you I am extremely delighted with the country and its improvements, which exceed by far the expectations of every [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf005&image=005-218.jpg) \- external link  - Page 211. ] per[s]on who travels this way, and has formed what he may think a ju[s]t idea of the country, by [s]taying at home and hearing the reports of others. There is no possibility of conceiving what a fine country it is without actually [s]eeing it; I therefore recommend to you a journey hither, for a two fold purpo[s]e, viz. to cure you of the [s]pleen, and to convince you how much human indu[s]try and ingenuity can perform in a [s]hort time, when nature has already done her part toward making a good country and a happy people.
