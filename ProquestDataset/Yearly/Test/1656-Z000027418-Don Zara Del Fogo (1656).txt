They travelled so long down these stayres, that Zara (who now repented his rash option) imagined himself con-centred in the Earth, and now they beheld an exceeding high Wood, whose top seemed to touch the Clouds, every Tree had its branches laden with a kind of swarthy Fruit resembling Cucumbers, each of them including a damned soul, who were incessantly tormented in the bowels of these Cucumbers, without hope of Infranchisement: Having past this Wood, they arrived at the very brink of the River Styx, whose dark waves evaporated a thick smoak; here they found Charons Boat (with onely one Oar in it) fastned to part of that Cottage where the grisly Ferriman resided, but no Boat-man to be met with; the occasion of Charons absence was this, Pluto had newly married his eldest daughter Tenebrosa to the great Duke Marathron, whose Territories extended from Phlegeton to the Lake Avernus, having under his command sixty Legions; and this wither'd Water-man had imployment as Pilot in Pluto's chief Galeon, to convey the Princely pair and their Retinew over Acheron to their own Dominions; the Inchantress was extreamly vexed to find Charon a non-resident, insomuch that she was once resolved to punish Hell and Heaven, as culpable of a contumacy, when behold Charons Consort ( Fatua ) a Matron of much gravity, and daughter to Chaos and Nox, fell at the Inchantress feet, beseeching her not to be offended at her husbands absence, relating that his Prince had summoned his service, withall intreating her to approach her homely Mansion; Lamia and the Champion were not shie to enter this homely Pavillion, where they found a candid Reception from the aged Fatua, who upon their entrance threw a kind of Gum into the fire (made of a kind of Pumice, much resembling the Brittish Turf) by vertue whereof, the Room where they were seemed more luminous then the House of Sol, they received celestiall Visions, and fancied themselves equal with the Gods, they had not long injoyed this beatificall Vision, but they heard the aged Ferrimans voyce, who sang the following Canticle, walking upon the Surges.  (Sporting in cold Tellus lap) Alwayes scraping, alwayes scoring, Alwayes drinking, alwayes whoring, you spend your lives, with wag-tayl'd Wives, While the subtill Syrens rock ye, Till your proud flesh make ye pockey.

Drink and drab, study and stare on, You must all conclude with Charon. By this time the grey-bearded Oarman had gained his Hive, and with a chearfull hum saluted Lamia and the Champion after his rustick manner, who returned him more Complementall Retribution: The Inchantress had no need to inform him of her design, ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Sentence.  ] None ever toucht the Strond of Styx, but they ballasted Charons Boat: wherefore taking leave of Fatua, they immediately Imbarqued themselves, the tough old Siegnior (having been well feasted in the Court of Pluto ) tugg'd at the Oare like any Terrestriall Barge-man against Wind and Tide; but by that time they were half way over Styx, they espyed an aged ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) He is very oblivious that knows not this old mans name See Apuleius his Golden Calf, li. 6. p 12.  ] person all naked, of a venerable Aspect (very neer them) crying out for help, for that he was in danger of drowning: The Champion (moulded of a noble mind) was proffering him his hand, had not Lamia hindered him, who related unto him briefly what this old man was, and how inevitable a ruine had ensued, in case he had afforded him aide; ere her Caution found period, they were within sight of shoar, where they landed, giving Charon his usuall Sallary, who (wondring what Mister Wights these were, since he had not above thrice before had experience of the like) took his leave with more Ceremony then usuall, and returned to his Wherry. The place where the Sorceress and our Champion now were, seemed a Marish ground, or rather a perfect Quagmire over-grown with blasted Reeds, and withered Sedge, yet of so solid a surface, that they trampled as upon Scythian Ice; being past this Bog, they presently came to the very Gates of Barathrum, fashion'd of burnisht Brass, which (contrary to Ancient and Modern belief) were fast locked, for that the God of Ghosts had lately made Proclamation.

nor were his internal indowments incompatible with his shape, for (comming to years of discretion) his language and comportment proclaimed him rather the son of a Plaisterer then a Prince, the sons of Noble men he would shun, to accompany the sons of Citizens and Car-men, nor could ever be brought to the knowledge of Letters by all the endeavours that could be used, to the extream grief of Paraclet, and the unspeakable torment of Maulkina, yea, to the general sorrow of the whole Realm, the people whispering in corners, that this Incubus could not be the son of the great Jupiter, but rather the spurious seed of some Swabber; these wild reports brought Paraclet to his wits end, and not knowing how to extinguish this fire without scorching his fingers, he resorted to the Oracle at Delphos, where after Celebration of the usuall Ceremonies) he received this Answer:  By subtile Goblins fraud, The reall Child of Maud, Was changed in the Cradle, By ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 13 Tom, sirnamed Ladle, (Who is the master Elf, And does what list himself) But the true Son of Jove About the world does rove, (Not knowing of his Right) Being call'd the Fairy Knight;

It were needless to recite with what astonishment Prince Paraclet (and all with him) received this Answer from Apollo, but hasting back to No-Land, Paraclet summoned his whole Nobility, who unanimously attending his pleasure, he declared unto them what the Oracle had spoken, demanding their speedy and serious advice, some councell'd one thing, some another, but after much hesitation, they voted as one man, that this prodigious Changeling should be conveyed into some Wilderness, and there left to the acceptation of his Elvish parents, whose advice (though Maulkina swayed with a groundless commisseration withstood it) was suddenly put in practice, and this Perken Warbeck being denuded of his greatness, resigned to the protection of those Goblins who gave him being; this action was diversly disputed on by the Vulgar, some applauding, some condemning, and all censuring; they were silenced by the arrivall of Emansor ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [ ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) For it was about the Spring of the year.  ] with 30.

The Celestiall Powers (quoth Zara ) I perceive are Favourers of thy Prince and People, that thus opportunely thou hast met with him, who will seat Paraclet and Emansor above fear or danger, and chastise the pride of that Duke LA-FOOL, else may Kill-za-Cow faile me in my greatest extremity, and Founder-foot make a Halt, when I am riding to the Redemption of some Imprisoned Kings; The substance of this refulgent Shaddow shall bear the Bell from all Ladies that ever yet had a being, or shall illuminate the Earth for the future: But how neer are we to Prince Emansors Court, or must we expect a tedious Travaile ere we gain the sight of his Glorious Palace: My Lord, said she, some two Leagues hence (in a direct line with your nose) you shall finde a Ship (in Safe Harbour) riding at Anchor in the  Ægean Sea, owned by a Merchant of No- Land, who will think himself happifide in having the Honour to transport your selfe and Soto your Squire; it is but four houres Sayle (though I confesse those Seas are something dangerous,) from thence to Zardoniapola-Mancha, the Metropolis of No-Land, where Prince PARACLET and EMANSOR reside in their gorgeous Pavillions: My self (my Lord) must yet further by Land: Having said this, she took her leave in a most submissive manner, receiving a friendly Farewell from the CHAMPION, who now mended his pace towards the Ocean, for thet he perceived Cynthius began to hide his countenance. End of the Second Book. Don Zara del Fogo: The Third Book.  The Champion and Soto imbarque themselvs for No-Land, being on Board, he opens the Casket that Lamia had sent by Lapida at his departure from Mount Mongibell, wherein he finds a Charmed Belt, together with an Epistle warning him of future events.

While things were in this confusion, Don Zara was sitting in his Cabin, in very serious contemplation, conceiting (as indeed he had cause) that his Love Lamia had procured this storm on purpose to plague him, this cogitation remembred him of the Casket that Lapida presented him with when he left Lamia, hitherto not thought on; which fatall over-sight might (for ought any man knows) have cost him his life, had not the celestiall Powers indulged their Darling with divine ayde; but now (as to the present business all-too-late) he opens the Carkanet, wherein he found a hilt borrowed from the hide of a Buck, lined with Magicall Characters, and Metricall Incantations, promising safety to the Wearer, though invironed with Millions of Enemies,  & thrust at with thousands of swords; Tradition tells us that this was the Cincture which the mighty Son of Thetis, swift-foot Achilles, used to wear, by vertue whereof he became invulnerable; this Girdle was given to Ulysses with Achilles Armour (for he had not slaughtered the Woers else) he dying, left it as an inestimable Legacy to his Son Telemachus, from whose custody the Inchantress Lamia ravisht it by the potency of her Spells; one of the most efficacious Charms that was embossed in this Belt, spoke thus in Hexameter Verses:  Oswald, Paradine, Thulo, Hugo, Hubert, Aribert, Astragon, Hurgonill, Orgo, Ulfinor, Goltha, Tybalt. Thus Interpreted:  Ye mighty Dukes of Darkness, let no wrong Happen to him, who wears this Charmed Thong. With this protection there was also a Letter directed to the Champion in these words: Heroick Champion, that of Theseus, Æneas, Paris, or Ulysses, to Ariadne, Dido, Ænone, or Circe, for which your name (with theirs) should de hangd, drawn, and quartered, by the common Executioneress Fame, yet so great is the love I yet retain towards you, that it not onely commands my forbearance from hurting you, but injoyns me to put your person (which shall be exposed to many hazzards) above the reach of danger; the Belt that this box incloses, if girt about you, will prove your protection better then a Coat of Male, or the most inpenetrable Armour, nor indeed can you be wounded while you wear this; but this gone, you are but the same Zara you were; My Art informs me that your Destiny shall decree you for No-land, appointing your passage through a turbulent Sea, but by no means imbarque your self for that Ship (Passengers and all) shall become a prey to the barbarous Element; when you arrive in No-land, many shall be your dangers, some shall fight you, some flout you, and others fawn upon you, but your Girdle shall give you victory over all your Enemies; Parting from thence, you shall visit many strange Countries, and see more Monsters then Mandevile, but at a certain time you shall find a winged Hog, grazing in a Green-plat, him ceize upon (for he has been used to the snaffle) and make him yours, giving the Gods and me thanks, who have made you Master of one of the rarest Beasts in the world: Thus imploring you would not altogether forget her who shall alwaies remember you, I commit you to your Fate, remaining the sorrowful Lamia. The Champion was exceedingly vexed at his own stupidity, that he had not read this Epistle before, and so prevented the present danger, but yet he would not seem to be amated; How was he smitten with astonishment at this unparalell'd affection of Lamia? how did he repent him of his sullen and sudden departure? By this time the Ship was shaken almost to pieces, Thunder rent the Ayr, the Sea roared hideously, the misshapen monsters of the Deep were congregated in great numbers, expecting a Feast of flesh and marrow, and the dying Vessell is even now ready to give up the Ghost, the unhappy Passengers preparing themselvs to take the way of all Fish, yet the Champion views all these horrors unmoved, and while others are sighing, he and Soto were singing the ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) There is much controversie amongst Expositors about this place, some will have walsingham others Troy Town, and a third sort the Merchants daughter of Bristoll.  ] heavenly tune of Walsingham; By this time the Ship (having bin a long time sick of a Surfeit) being over-burthened; now, with what before supported her, becomes founder'd down-right; when, behold, while magnanimous Zara, and his fearless Soto were standing on the Deck, threatning defiance to Neptune, and all the Marine Powers, a boysterous wave whirls them into the Sea above a Cables length. O Neptune, Saron, and all ye watry Deities, what now shall become of our Sea-Champion, shall the Sword-fish wound him, the Dog-fish bite him, or the Whale devour him.

They were now in a Rockey Iland, here and there a Tree, and (in some places) neer the Rocks, good store of ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [ ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) But withall very scurvey. see Dr. Trigs Treatise of purging Ale.  ] grasse, here they feared as much to be famished as before to be drowned; yet (by the favour of Mavors ) our Champion had his good Sword girt to his voluminous waste; nay more, his Charmed Girdle, Casket, and all safe lodged in his pocket; Soto had on his Brest-plate and Helmet, and his steel-pointed piece of Ash, fast in his fist, which instrument of defence he had such care of all the time he was sowced in the salt Ocean, that (as C aesar swimming with one hand, and with the other preserving his Papers from pickle) he still kept it above water; but the loss of Founder-foot unspeakably grieved our Champion, so that he hardly refrained from tears. ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [  Zara's complaint for the lose of his Steed. ] Ah Founder-foot, Founder-foot, said he, have these hands of mine so often fed thee at Rack and Manger, with Oats, Grains, Beans and Barley for this, to fatten the ravenous Fishes of the Sea, and have thy hide cut out into more Thongs then the skin of Didoes Bull, to make Harness for Neptunes Coach-Mares; Farewell the glory of thy kind, thou Soveraign of Steeds, Prince of Palfrays, and honestest of all Horses:  ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Founder-foots Elogie.  ] Whose name shall live free from all black reproaches, While there are wincing Jades, or Hackney-Coaches. Soto bore a part in his Masters sorrow, for the losse of Founder-foot, though his grief had a very different originall from that of Zara's, for he (grown a perfect Thracian ) wisht him there rather to feed on, then ride on, and indeed his Sea-sickness made an Apology for the eagerness of his appetite, all know what a civill war the tumbling of the vessell creates in the small guts, and that those who have not been inur'd to Hoyes and Hulks, are very hainously harrassed the first time of their gaze upon the garulous Ocean. Long time they travailed up and down in hope to finde some shed of shelter, but Fortune was not so favourable to further their wishes, so that wet and weary as they were (their carkasses curdled with cold, and their wembs repleat with water) they sat down at the root of a blasted Oak, wishing for immediate death, rather then a lingring destruction: Being thus reduced to the very brink of dispair, and every minute in expectation to become a prey to some ravenous Wolf, or blood-thirsty Tyger, they might hear the showtings (as they thought) of Shepheards, but indeed Fishermen, who had even then surprized somthing (stiled by them a Fish) of weighty importance, so that they were forced to summon in the adjacent Fish-takers, with whoopings and hallowings, who understanding the occasion of their clamour, soon incorporated themselvs with them; no tongue can tell, or Pen propose, how much the ship- wrackt Zara, and his sorrowfull Servitor, were rejoyced at these ecchoings, and therefore they rose up, and (as neer as they could guess) trod that path that might lead them to the place where they heard these noyses, so much were they favored by Fate, that in a short time (as if they had taken notice of the track for many Ages) they arrived where they found not onely Mortals but Mansions, Fabricks as well as Fishermen, to their infinite contentment they saw the Fish-finders corroborated in one lump, clubbing all their nets and strength to boot, to make themselvs Masters of some unwonted prize, some crying out they had caught a Whale, others that they had fastned upon some Chest stuffed with Treasure; others, that they should make some strange discovery, to the wonder of the world; Zara and Soto stood as spectators all the time, while by main strength and Herculean Fortitude they brought to shoar what they had so long laboured for, but (to their astonishment) instead of Fish, were saluted with flesh; ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) O strange and never equall'd accident, that as Zara surpassed al knights in the world for courage & true Magnanimity, so he might be furnished with Warlike Habiliments, as never any worthy save himself was.  ] Behold, a Panoplia, a Coat of Armour richly gilded, with a Shield, and a stately Steed (of a Chesnut colour, his Main curiously curled, a blue Star in his fore-head, a fair, white spot upon either foot,  &c.) and other Martiall Utensils; the Sea-Swaines were as much grieved, as our Champion comforted, to peruse their Draught, insomuch that they were minded to return their gains to him that gave them, had not Zara stept in, and (after the Narration of his late Ship-wrack) besought them to confer the Horse and Armour upon him, they all heard him attentively, and as freely answered his demands, departing every man to his Cottage. The duskish shades of night had now inveloped the world, and Zara (by the suffrage of one of the Fishermen Piscatorio ) was conducted (with his new acquired Courser, and warlike Furniture) into a sedgie Cot, where he was kindly received by Piscatorio's wife, and set to supper with a Cods head, and a Salmons tayle, wheron he and Soto fed like Farmers, nor was drink wanting (a kind of Sider ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [ ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) This must needs be a comfortable kind of drink ] made of Alder-Berries and Wildings) whereof (having cured their Garments of the Dropsey) they drank merrily, till the time of night warned them to their rest, they therefore came to their lodging of clean Rye-straw, with Battavian Blankets, where we will leave them to their Repose.  Zara arrives at Zardona-pola-Mancha, the chief City of No-Land, the Religion of the No-Landers. Zara comes to Court, and joyns himself with the rest of the Knights and Champions; they present their Swords, Shields,  &c. at the feet of Maulkina and Dowcabell; their exquisite Impressa's and Devices. Zara's Motto more taken notice of then any: With other accidents.  the Champion (rowzing Soto from his rest) appareled himself with exceeding cheerfulness, being now assured that the Destinies did own his resolvs by a peculiar approbation, having so miraculously provided him a case for his skin, with a horse seeming of the Bucephalian breed, he longed to see himself once more in Armour, and to manage his proud Palfray, as none but Zara could do; Soto was soon ready, and the honest Fisherman also, who (burthening his board with the best Provant his Cottage could afford, and the Champion and Soto having fed as men doubting a future repast) took his leave of the Champion, being exceeding joyous, that it was his fortune to be one of those whom Fate had ordained as a consolatory Instrument for the furthering of so noble a Nephew of Mars; Our Knight (having received instructions from his courteous Host, which way to betake himself) mounted Soto behind him, to make his way with the more celerity, not ceasing to hasten his horses pace til he beheld the great City Zardona-pola-Mancha, the Metropolis of No-Land, whose argent Spires being beaten upon by the Sun-beams, rendred a most fulgent delight to the gazer; In this City there were no less then ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) By this may be gathered the numberless number of Inhabitants up-risers and down-lyers in this mighty City.  ] nine hundred thousand Churches, the No-lands worshipped a God, they called in their language Porco, the reason that they not onely abstained from Swines flesh, but by publike Edict made it death for any to kill those kind of creatures, imbracing the Society of Scots and Jewes with the highest regard; Zara who had never yet resided in so populous a place, was on the sudden surprized with (I know not what) anxiety, so that ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [ ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Caution mixt with courage caused this Dilemma, our Champion being as wise as valiant.  ] he sat a long time on his horse back in a profound study, but perceiving Soto (who was just now restored to his feet) to eye him with a very strict regard, he rode on, and came to the very Gates of the City, whose streets he found paved with Aggats, the houses twelve stories high, all of Alablaster, and every shop-keeper clad in Persian Silks, their wives in cloth of Gold, whose bodies were even burthened with precious Stones; the Citizens ran out in heaps to gape upon this strange Knight, so that if the Champion had not had a brow more solid then Brass, he had been brought to ruine by very bashfulness; it was not long ere he attained the sight of the Palace built of Parian Flint, and Podian Free-stone, with such admirable Art, that it was justly accounted the eighth wonder of the World; its inside was all of Ophyr Gold, the Beds, Stools, and Dresser-boards of Ivory; on the top of the Palace (after the old Roman manner) were many rare gardens, watered with Chrystalline Rivulets, wonderfull to behold: The very day that our Champion visited the Court, were all those Knights that were met together on the behalf of Maulkina and Dowcabell (whose history we lately gave you) assembled in the Palace-yard, a place of that magnitude, that Xerxes might there have mustered his Army; Prince Paraclet, Emansor, the Princesses Maulkina and Dowcabell, with all the prime Nobles and Ladies of the Court, in their richest Adornments, sat in a Theater contrived on purpose for this business, beneath Canopies of state, the walls of the Theater being hung with Velvet, enamelled with Gold, whereon were curiously pourtrayed many ancient stories, the Expedition of the Argonauts for the Golden sheep, the Labours of Hercules, Deucalions Flood, the Destruction of Troy, Medea and Jason, with ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Or Hero and Leander  ] the Loves of Dorastus and Fawnia, the Knights were all on foot (which caused our Champion also to alight, giving his Steed to Soto ) their Squires (who were all clad in Crimson Taffaty) holding their Steeds in one hand, and their Shields in the other; each Champion had his Sword girded about him, with his Spear in his hand, as prepared for present encounter, Zara not excepted; which solemnity being ended, they one after another presented their Swords, Spears, and Shields, at the feet of divine Maulkina and the beauteous Dowcabell; the first was a Knight of Phrigia, whose Device (ingraven on his Shield) was a Dog biting his Fleas, very busily, with this Motto:  [  The Knight of the Dog. ] There is no trust unto the Winds or Seas, Those that lye down with Dogs, shall rise with Fleas. The next was a Knight of Transilvania, the son of a great Duke named Sharkino, his Device was a Lion Rampant, but without Teeth or Nayls, with this Motto:  [  The Knight of the toothless Lion. ] The Kingly Lyons Teeth have left his jawes, His voyce can kill, though wanting teeth or claws. The third was a Knight of Malta, a man very eminent for his valour against Ottaman, his Device was a Jack Pudding dancing on the Ropes, with this Motto:  [  The Knight of the Pudding. ] He who dares wear a face that bites like Mustard, I'le maul, as Pudding macerates his Custard. The fourth was a Knight of Sardinia, of an excellent form, insomuch that Maulkina and Dowcabell had their eyes continually fixed upon him, his Device was a Jack-an-Apes, playing upon a Jews-trump, with this Motto:  [  The Knight of the Jackanapes. ] Play on melodiously (magnifick Jack ) Untill my Sword shall win thee Nuts to crack. The fifth was a Shentleman of Wales, Ap Shon, ap Owen, ap Richard, ap Morgan, ap Hugh, ap Brutus, ap Sylvius, ap Æneas, his Device was a large Cheese slit asunder in the midst, toasting before a fire of Turf, with this Motto:  [  The Knight of the tosted Cheese. ] If her ploud be up twice and ones, Take very many heeds to hide her pones; Merlin her Country-man, Witness for her can; God plesse her, none in Heurope can appease, Her anger's like a piece of toasted Cheese. The sixth was a Knight of Muscovia, a big man, but of a very Masculine Aspect; this was he that stole aaway the Infanta of Spain in a Moonshine night, maugre all her Guards, and married her to his son Lurdanio, his Device was a Civet-Cat disburthening her self a posteriore into the Helmet of a Knight in shining Armour, who held forth his Head-piece very handsomly, his Motto:  [  The Knight of the Civet Cat. ] True typs of her, whose breath's perfum'd I find, Whether she vent it forward or behind. Then came Zara (for it would be tedious to relate all) with a Majestick pace, and was received by Maulkina and Dowcabell, with a lowd laughter, a favour they had not yet afforded to any save himself, his Device was an Owl in an Ivie-Bush, with this Motto:  [  The Knight of the Owl in an Ivie-Bush. ] Ravens and Daws in troops put on, But Owls and Eagles flye alone, My Shield, Horse, Armor, Helm & Sword, Are own'd by Pallas and her Bird. This Device was much laught at by some of the Noble-men and Ladies, and derided by the Knights of little knowledg, which our Champion wel enough perceived, and wisely winked at, though within himself he vowed a sudden and sharp revenge; but the truth is, our Don (being utterly a stranger to Letters) was wholly ignorant of the matter, else no doubt his sagacitie had sought out some other Emblem more suitable to his own serenity, and yet this (seemig) despicable Badge will not want a second owner, which shall occasion the most dreadfull Duell that has bin foughten since the Creation, as the Process of the History will inform: This Solemnity over, the Knights were admitted to lay their lips to the Lilly hands of Maulkina and Dowcabell, and after the thanks of Paraclet and Emansor, were conducted to a stately Pavillion, being feasted after the most sumptuous manner; then they fell to Dancing, but Zara excused himself from that imployment, as an effeminacy he never affected, who had rather fight then frisk, but for owning and celebrating Healths he was not inferiour to any, till the intoxicating fumes so buffetted his brains, that he was forced to disgorge himself even at the Table, which some queazie appetites were angry at, but the stronger sort of constitutions bore withall, as a thing incident to tottering Mortality; And that nothing might be wanting to an accomplished Entertainment, a Masque was this night presented in the Royall Theater. A splended, pompeous, & delightful Show, (Some say) by Johnson, Jones, or Inigo.  The presentation of a never-equall'd Masque, Don Pantalone (resolving to Quarrell Zara ) imployes Don La-Fisk to bear his Challenge, &c.  Dowcabell, with all the Nobles and Madams of the Court, being seated each according to their degree; the Knights Errant were also placed according to their severall Gradations, and the Musick having charmed their sences with a Celestiall Dyrathamb, they were presented with a curious Contrivance, called The Frontispiece was a thick-grown Wood, repleat with Lions, Tygers, Bears, Antilopes, Panthers, and other Beasts of prey; Sylvanus, Priapus, Pan, and other Wood-Gods, cracking of Nuts, and eating of Apples, while the following Song was sung to the Tabor.  All the Sylvans do obey; Had those above fed like to you, (On Acorns and on Rain-bow Dew) When the World lay in its Cradle, And there was no fiddle faddle, Saturn had still kept his Throne, And not been outed by his Son; 'Tis head-strong Wine, And Manchet fine, That irritates Ambitious pates: Pan never quarrels with Sylvanus, (For every Wood-god worships Janus ) The beauteous Nymphs are all in common, None's the better Gentlewoman; With a baneless love they greet, Horns, and nayls, and cloven-feet. Then unto the Woods let's wander, To find out Hero and Leander.  This Song ended, twelve Nymphs, and as many Satyrs cast themselvs into a figure for the Dance; which done, the Wood-gods, with the Nymphs and Satyrs withdraw, and the Goddess Venus with her Son Cupid, and her Hand-Maids the Graces are discovered. Nay, by my Altars that are reaking, And those Lovers that are sneaking, Homeward after full enjoyment, Either accept of this imployment, (Froward Boy) or else Ile strip thee, And with Rods of Roses whip thee; I have often (to my sorrow) Felt the Launcinge of thy Arrow, Jove and Juno, Hermes, Hebe, Mavors, Bacchus, yea and Phebe, With the God that guides the Surges, (Riding like a Belgick Burgess) Will rejoyce (like to inferiors) While I plow up thy Posteriors, Take away his Bow and Darts, While I scourge him till a' smarts. Bare his breech. Thalia \--- \---had I Tane the counsell of my Daddy (Whom you cuckold every hour) By this I might have scornd your power. Cannot Mars his steely chine, (Who has almost lost his eyne With over-doing) nor Anchyses, With his Piltrums and his Spices, (To heighten Appetite) nor Peleus Sate your conduct to Cornelius; But Adonis must be brought on, To a thing he never thought on. Impious Elf ( Æ neas broher) What's that to thee who rides thy Mother, Horse him Thalia. \--- \---Spare, O spare (Great Goddess) this thy son & Heyr, Lest on a Clown he make me doat-a, I dare not touch his silken Coat-a. Do't, if thou despise thy duty, I'le make thee fetch a Box of Beauty, From the bottom of black Hell, As Pshyche did (as stories tell.) Here the Graces ceaze upon Cupid, and prepare him for the lash. Hold, (sweet Honey-Mother) hold, I confess I've been too bold, If I live but till to morrow, (As Gods can't die) I'l send an Arrow Into Adonis Marble brest, Headed with a Hornets nest. On this condition take thy ramble, To make the wombs of Ladies wamble, But fail not as thou lov'st my smile, Now I'le take Coach for Cyprus Ile. Venus, Cupid, and the Graces being gone, Adonis (like a Huntsman) is seen with his setting Dog. Come my Caniculo (sweet Cur) In thy throat thou hast a bur I fear, thy voyce was wont to ring, With redoubled ecchoing; "Strange thing, when Dogs forget their tones, And Letchers leave their Marrow-bones Unbroken, in this shady Wood," (Where shaggy Satyrs use to scud) I reign sole Monarch of content, And ne'r think what my father spent, To get and breed me; Pox a' wooing, 'Tis fulsom to be alwayes doing; My life is strict, and right Laconick, That love is best that is Platonick: To hunt the swift-foot Stag, & follow The furius Bear wth whoop & hollow Is my best delight,---So---ho, Follow me Caniculo.

Adonis being wounded, Cupid goes off, leaving him to his Love passion.

How now, my dear Adonis, what? With thy self in busie chat? When, when O when shall Venus find, The flinty-soul'd Adonis kind. Squeeze me like to Milky Curds, Drain all my sappy bulk affords, Let me dwell upon your ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [ ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Venus is much praised by Ancient Poets for her Mole, &c.  ] Spot, You shall find me cold and hot; But must not fail in Retribution, When you find my constitution. Come then (my Paramour) let's sally To my Rosie Bower, and dally, Till our kexey joynts complain, Then we will take breath again. Venus and Adonis being gone, the wild Boar, who (according to Theocritus ) was deeply in love with Adonis, is seen. I must enjoy thee (upon any score) Adonis, or else cease to be a Boar; I that despise the Javelin & the Spear, Whose murthering Tusks the sternest Mortalls fear, Do stoop unto a stripling, had I thee Within my power, thou sightles Deity I'd crumble thee to attoms, & devour Thy laughing Mother in her flowery Bower. Mast will not down, I loath my wonted Food, The unseen flame does set on fire my blood, Licks up my moysture, and so loud I grunt, My voice is heard hence to the Helespont. Twas long ( Alcides ) e'r thy back was right, Having mounted fifty Virgins in one night. Voracious Venus (void of ruth) Has had no mercy on my youth. Beauteous Adonis, hark; how long in vain, Unto thy seal'd up ear shall I complain, Thy scorn will kill me; Nature cannot save His life, whom Love shall lead unto the Grave. O pitty my perplexity, though rude In form, my heart is full of gratitude; My mind's as smooth as pibble, though my hide Be rough, & I have other gifts beside, May sign my Patent for a Ladies clip, Though I confess my hair will hurt her lip: What ere this Wood affords shall call thee Lord, So thou wilt deign but love for love t'afford. Hence brisled Monster, canst thou hope My love, I'l first imbrace a Rope; And on some fatall Yeugh resign My life, foul Monster, filthy Swine; I will procure a Guy of Warwick, Though I explore from hence to Barwick (If thou desist not) that shall wear, Thy head upon his charmed Spear. Nay, then tis time to cast of al remors For when intreaties fail, to practice force, Is Orthodox Adonis, by the Gods, And their celestiall ever-blest abodes, I must enjoy thee.--- Here the Boar endeavouring to express love to Adonis, wounds his tender skin with his Tusk, which kills him. \---O I'm slain, This bawdy Boar hath wrought my bane. Out alas, what have I done? He is dead as sure as Gun, Faln like some Poplar (in his pride) Planted by a Rivers side, Wounded by a Pelean Ax, In Heaven now a Paralax.

Here he was wont to go, and here Tellus being proud to bear So rich a burthen,---O my heart, When with Adonis I did part: Just such a sigh I fetcht in sooth-la I hope Jove will protect the youth-la from scathe; sad thoughts do clog my soul, Which like to Neptunes waves do roul And ride on one anothers backs, My nether parts do melt like Wax, or Butter in a Basting-ladle. What do I see,---do my eyes dazzle? Or is Adonis drown'd in gore? O Fortune thou most damned whore, What hast thou done? lift heaven hier Good Gaffer Atlas, that my fire Of rage may have ful vent; no stone is More cold then my (once dear) Adonis,   [  The Goddess falls upon the dead body of Adonis. ] His Nerve that wont to heave & stand Stiff as a stake at my command, Now droops and hangs the head, his wounds Do yawn like chapt & parched grounds. What Monster more then fel with fang Of ruine, would destroy so young, So fair, so smooth, so deft a Lad, Of whom such comfort Venus had. O I am wild with rage; thy bulk (Dear boy) in a rich Urn shall skulk, With rich perfums, & whit-bred crums Rich Odours, and Sabean Gums. Take up the precious load my Graces But ware he piss not in your faces; For so (some say) dead people do, This fatall Wilderness shall rue Thy ruine Adon, Tempests shall, Tear up the Oaks, the Elms, the small, The great, the fruitful, and the barren, With a Hors-pox and a Murren. Lead on & weep till ye are blind, the while We seat Adonis on his Funerall Pile. Venus and the Graces (carrying the dead Adonis ) being gone off, Tempests and storms destroy the Wood, and nothing appears but a thick Stage, and a thin-jaw'd Poet, who thus Epiloguizes.  Thus have you seen Adonis dreary Fate, The Boars ill luck, & Venus wretched state Masqus are no common things, specially such As this, that leans upon no staff or crutch; The Poet stands within biting his nayls, Somtimes his hope, somtimes his fear prevails: Troth he's a prety man, and comes as neer Tom Nabs (whose Microcosmos has no Peer) As any be alive;   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) A Mocke Masque intended for the Press.  ] If this don't like ye, Next time Cupido coms, & Madam Psyche. This Masque (as how could it chuse) found a generall applause, not so much as one crittick in so great a crowd; but by this time half the night was spent, so that Prince Paraclet, Emansor, Maulkina and Dowcabell, betook themselvs to their rest, whose example the Courtiers of both sexes followed, onely the Knights ( Zara excepted) resorting to the place place where they had supped some hours before, resolve to salute Somnus with a bowl of Bacchus his blood, drinking so deep, that ye would have thought every man there Master of more ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) A kind of shining pibble found in the Desarts of Devon shire, which whosoever shall butter and bury in his belly in a morning fasting, shall be sure to shun drunkenness that day.  ] Amethists then one, so that the place where they were, seemed the very Bower where the blyth Delphick God tipples Sack, and keeps his Bacchanalias; but while they were quaffing, Zara was sleeping, but he little imagins what plots are even now (at this ominous hour of night) contriving against him, for the Knights Errant being now (in their own conceits) discreeter then Socrates or Solon, and valianter then Achilles or Alexander the Great, began every man to pride himself in his own praise, and to enumerate the many Combats and perillous Atchievments they had bin guilty of; this man having vanquished the Knight of the Moon and Seven Stars, who had nine fingers upon each hand, was ful six yards in height, and was thought able to rout a Royall Army; this having taken in that Cittadell, maugre the opposition of a thousand men; a third having rescued the Persian Sophy, when surrounded with twelve millions of Turks, who were leading him captive to Constantinople; these vapours dissipated, they began to discourse every man of his Horse, Armour, and Shield,  &c. each maintaining his own for the most Authentick: This discourse put 'um in mind of our Champion Don Zara, whom every one censured as he listed, onely the Knight of the PUDDING (for so was Don Pantalone the Knight of Malta called, because of the Jack-Pudding in his Shield) was most vehement, who articled against him as a man both insipid and incapacious as to Military Atchievments; this was the Knight whose Horse, Armour, Shield,  &c. was made Zara's by miracle, being (by an unparalell'd providence) drag'd to shoar by Fishermen, and by them conferr'd on our Champion, as the first Chapter of this Book has inform'd; for Don Pantalone (being bound for No-land ) was shipwrackt on those very Seas where our Champion was cufft over-board, and was the onely mortall except a Spartane Spaniell) that escaped the danger (as it seems) by the agility of his arms, and now this most dangerous and degenerate Knight (envying the boon of Heaven) would recover those Emoluments by force, which (no doubt) were worthily torn from him by the fraud of Fate, openly owning the Horse, Armour, and Shield, and execrably protesting that he would be Master of them within forty hours, or leave his dead body as a witnesse of his Devoyre; this Resolve was highly praised by some, and as much cryed down by others; but Pantalone was too proud to hearken to dehortments, and therefore (betwixt drunk and sober) he wrote a Challenge, desiring the Knight of the Ape (for so was Don-La-Fisk the Knight of Sardinia called, because of the Ape playing on a Jewes-Trump in his Shield) to carry it about ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [ ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) The time that all Challenges ought to be carried, or not at all. See the Ordinance concerning Duells.  ] eight in the morning to our Champion Don Zara; This done, (being scarce able to tipple any longer) the Knights adjourned their House for some hours.  Don Zara first appears in the Lists, where Don-la-Fisk presents him with Pantalones Challenge; His stern reply. Duke-la-Fool with two thousand armed Knights enters the Lists, and is totally routed by Zara. He is deeply enamoured on the Lady Madona-del-Simplicia, to whom he directs an Epistle, &c.  Heraulds (by sound of Trumpet) warned the Knights Errant to meet in the Palace-yard, there to betake themselvs to the businesse of the day, but those intoxicating fumes that usually attend ebriety, had so sealed up their senses, that you would have thought Knight Errantry both dead and buried, had not the truely valiant and most redoubted DON ZARA DEL FOGO appeared (with SOTO ) compleatly Armed, mounted on his couragious Courser, whom he called after the name of his late lost Palfray, Founder-foot, and brandishing his bright weapon (like another Actorides ) he seemed to denounce Defiance to all under the Cope; nor, indeed, was he over-confident of his Abilities, though having had but little experience hitherto of his own Fortitude; for by instinct (as it were) he on the sudden became sensible of the wondrous vigour absconded in the mysterious folds of his Charmed Belt, which (as by a providence unthought of, or unseen) could protect him from the edge of ravenous steel, though Tilted at him by the same ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 14 man that tore off Achelous his horn, and (being in a rage) threw it into Troy-novant, where being taken up (as if it had been sent from Heaven) it became the ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Cornucopia  ] City badge, though (I know not for what cause) it be not quartered with their Arms; he had not long travers'd the lists, but the Knight of the Ape, Don la Fisk, on foot, onely with his Battle-Ax and bastinado, saluted him, proposing a written paper unto him, which put our Champion into much perplexity, not that he dreaded a Challenge from the most approved Knight in the World, but lest he should be lyable to the castigation of the censorious, as one not acquainted with Alphabeticall Tables; but his ingenuity (by a most apt contrivance) prevented the murther of his Fame, for (as despising so triviall an imployment) he called for Soto with as much indignation as haste, who came tremblingly to receive the mandates of his Master; the Champion gave him a check for his non-residency, but yet with so calm a countenance, that he might behold him without blasting: Here, quoth Zara, read the contents of this Paper, which done, fold it up for Bum-fodder; Soto receiving the Scrole, found it fraught with this very language:  SYRRAH, attainedst those gllorious Arms, that Achillean Shield, and that strong Steed, yet I will make it good on thy Carrion Corse, that thou camest Felloniously by them; they are mine, and as mine I demand their speedy surrender, as thou wouldst escape being beaten, abhominably beaten; I will not raile on ye, but I will Cudgell and kick ye most Heroick Champion; therefore (if thou beest wise) speedily un-case and dismount thy self, sending my Horse, Armour, and Shield, else expect no mercy, from DON PANTALONE.  Soto was so amazed with the terrible tenor of this Epistle, that he could scarce prolong his breath to pronounce his name that thus menaced his Master; but from Zara's eyes you might perceive flashes of subtil lightning, incessantly streaming, ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [ ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Zara's Indignation, having heard Pantalones Defiance.  ] his face was strangely altered, Death sat upon his front in a new shape, more dreadful then ever Painter yet fancied him, so that Don-la- Fisk (a man otherwise stout enough) was lost to his wonted courage, and began to repent him of his ready undertaking so mortall a Message, to whom after a bite of the lip, and a little pause, our Champion returned this Answer.  my justice in sacrificing thy life (lost man) who hast had the boldnesse to present me with this putrid Paper, from him whose limbs shall shortly feast the Fowls of the Ayr; did ever so voluminous a vaunt find foundation on so vain a confidence? What is this fellow? or from whence? but No-land shall not shelter him from my vengeance, were he Wall'd in with Dragons, and arm'd with the same Thunder that Jove is; as for you, though you have justly merited the weight of my anger, yet I will adjourn your Fate, for no other reason, but that you return my Answer to the Slave that sent you.  Having uttered this (in a tone that sufficiently manifested the mightiness of his wrath) he put spurs to his horse galloping up and down the Lists with such fury, that the ground groaned under his Horses hoofs, when behold Don Pantalone (as eager of Combat as himself) rode up to him with the highest Valour and Resolution, charging him with his drawn Sword; Our Champion (who would fain have been fighting with any man) imagined that this was he who had so grosly abused him, and had there put a period to his life, had not Duke La-Foole with two thousand armed Knights just then entred the Lists; Duke-la-Foole was armed much like that haughty Pagan King Feragus, of whom the most excellent of our English ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 15 Poets thus sings:  \------With a Shirt of Mayle, A Helmet of strong Brass upon his head, A Shield of the same Mettal, which to fail, Was not ordain'd, a Sword two handfuls broad, instead Of ponderous Club, he bore a well-grown Oak, Which threatned certain death at every stroak. This caused the two Knights to forbear one another, and turn their fury upon these Strangers, what Homericall or Virgillian Pen can perfectly paint the admirable deeds done by Don Zara, who (being invulnerable) had soon sent five hundred of Duke-la-Fools Knights to Dis; so that Prince Paraclet, Emansor, and the Nobility of No-land (being awakened by the trampling of Horses, and the clashing of Armour) forsook their beds, and stood to behold the conflict on the Battlements of the Palace, imagining that Mars himself was descended from Heaven, in the shape of a man; How did they praise his Prowesse? how magnifie his Magnanimity? By this time the Knights had taken the Allarm, and as one man came to their assistance; But O ye vindictive Powers, what a slaughter was then commenced! Here some lay spewing out their hearts blood, there others headless; here one without armes, there another without legs, invironed with a Lake of blood; nor did the fury of the Fight take any to mercy, save Duke-la-Fool himself, and 6 more, who being made captive, were carried to Prince Paraclet and Emansor, who immediatly rewarded their treachery with the loss of their heads.    [  Duke La-Fool beheaded. ] Twelve of Paraclets Knights were slain in this bloody encounter; but Zara (covered over with blood and sweat, by a Messenger from the Princes) was singled out from the rest, and brought before Prince Paraclet, Emansor, Malkina, and Dowcabell, who affording him the respects due to a Deity, attributed the Victory, together with their preservations (in so eminent hazard) meerly to his Valour, enquiring his name and Countrey, to the first he yielded a ready responsion, but to the other he answered in very obscure terms; the Princes and all there admire the mans valour, but more his modesty, imagining him a Saint as well as a Souldier, for what Syntax is there betwixt a Helmet and a Cap of Maintenance; the Princess Maulkina gave him many amorous glances, and no doubt had fixed her affection on him, had she not doubted his acceptation, being deceived with the colour of his countenance; indeed a warlike Ammunition face, yea so preter-naturall, that it seemed rather a Vizzard then a face, but his mind more smooth then pollished Pewter, and softer then the Ravens feather, as may appear by his being surprized (even now in the height of his anger, when his illustrious soul moved in the very Apog aeum of death and vengeance, so much was he incensed against the Knight of the Pudding) with one of the Princess Waiters, named Madona-del-Simplicia, a creature of a most excellent form:  Her gallant grey eyes, Like Stars in the skies, Denoted the whiteness of her two thighes. Her face Rivalling the fairest of the Fatall Sisters; this is the Goddess to whom our Champion offers his vows, to this fair Idea he paid his zealous Orisons, calling her the Throne of Pleasure, and the very Promontory of perfection, yet (such a bashfulnes was he born withal) could not our Champion (though he earnestly endeavoured it) compell his tardy tongue, to deliver of what his heart dictated, though his soul (which brought its own sacred fire with it) did (mentally) present her with a wounded Oblation, burning on her brick Altar, offered up with as reall a devotion as ever Cupid elevated any; but his love was very ill placed, for Simplicia, though fair of face, had a heart more rough then the Posteriors of a Bear, nor did she so much as return one smile to the Champion, who for a long time had earnestly gazed upon her, a thing that Prince Paraclet and all there took speciall notice of, but were more stricken with wonder, when they beheld the Champion (without so much as taking his leave) fling away, and mount himself with as much haste, as he had even then bin Petitioned by some pensive Lady, for the infranchisement of her captivated Lord held in durance by some horrible Gyant. ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) The Author is in a pittifull plight for his good Champion.  ] O Zara, Zara, these memorable Loves mentioned in those Authentick Histories of Parismus, The Knight of the Sun, or the Ingenuous Don Qnixot-de-la-Mancha, upon the barren Mountains of Morenna, bewailing the disdain of the Lady Dulcina-del- Toboso, are but Leaden Legends, compared with thy more solid sufferance, in whose brest the little God seems solely to have seated himself, as in some Magnificent Metropolis, where he keeps his Court and gives Laws to the Nations of the earth. But while the Princes and the rest were diversly censuring this Act of Zara's, he (with an Arrow in his bosome) had gained his lodgings, Love that in others causes affability, has in him a clean contrary operation, ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) 16 as the language of his face sufficiently demonstrated, looking so furiously that none durst speak to him, his Secretary Soto excepted, who took the priviledge to talk to him, and demand the cause of this so sudden change. Ah Soto, Soto, said the Champion, he whom neither Duke La-Fool nor his thousand Knights, whom the Knight of the Pudding Don Pantalone, nor all the Champions, Gyants, Monsters, Satyrs, Devils, and Dragons can vanquish, is now overcome with the looks of a weak, and (for ought I know) wanton woman, her face is continually in my fancy, and I must enjoy her, or cease to be mortall. Sir, said Soto, this is no such prodigie as you would insinuate; your Predecessour the great Hercules, after all his Victories and Conquests, became a slave to his own Codpiece, and (by Omphales appointment) spun Shooe-makers thread, which imployment he plyed to purpose all the day, not wishing any Sallary but to unravell at night: Was not the good Sir Guy flouted by Philida into a bondage, cost him much blood and sweat ere he could wriggle himself into her imbraces? Jove himself has been a Bull ere now, meerly to back Io the white-faced Cow? If then the greatest of Gods, and the most eminent among men, have been Vassals to Venus, and captives to Cupid; it had been strange if you (my Lord) who are a God, a Heroe, and what not, should not (at least) taste what they fed on almost to a surfeit, nor need you dispair of a prosperous success, for what woman (though Mistress of more beauty then Loves Queen, or dignifi'd with more soveraign command then Semiramis ) would not meet your motion halfway, and bless that Fate that furnished her with such Magnetick perfections, to attenuate the love of so brave a man. Thou art excellent, quoth Zara, at versification, pen me presently a Copy of Verses, such as may gain thy self a never-fading Fame, and me the fruition of her who is my Fate, upon whose smiles or frowns my Destiny depends. ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Soto's extream modesty, who though a most excellent Poet, will not vaunt himself of his own abilities.  ] My Lord, quoth Soto, I have onely sipt of Helicon, and taken a nap or two upon Pernassus, but as I can, I will; so having taken off a bowl of Mereotick Wine, he took Pen in hand, and wrote these numbers.  Whose face does set the World on fire; Within whose brow (above the beak) The Graces play at Barly-break, Whose every curle a Cupid hides, And many a sightlesse God besides: Let not, O let not thy dire scorn, Make me wish th'hadst nere been born, Or boing born (since I am shotten) Ere this thou hadst been dead and rotten I am no vulgar Suppliant (Sweet) No Parish-child found in the street; My name is Zara, who of late Encountering La-Fool, broke his pate, And sent his Errant Knights (poor men-a) Unto the bottom of Gehenna; Thou mayst be proud of this my proffer, For 'tis my first and onely offer; The Love I prostrate unto thee, The mightiest Queens have beg'd of me; Marthesia was once my Mistris, With Antiopa, and Thalestris, Women that did great fame deserve For handling Sword as well as Nerve: O let not then thy coynesse plunder His life, whom nought can kill but thunder. Your Beauties Vassale, DON ZARA DEL FOGO.  These deathless Verses having had Zara's approbation, were seal'd up in the form of an Epistle, and thus superscribed: del Simplicia. Soto himself was the Messenger, being hastned by Zara to a speedy departure.  Soto comes to Court and delivers his Masters Letter to the Lady Madona del Simplicia. Her scornfull Reply. The Champion (being transported, with passion) strikes Soto on the face. Soto turns upon his Master: A cruell Combat betwixt them.

Soto's death and revivall.  came to the Palace where he found the Lady Madona-del-Simplicia with the Princesses Maulkina and Dowcabel at dinner, and was forced (to his great grief) to wait in the Lobby till the time of exercising the teeth was over; the custome of the No-landers, being quite different from that of other Nations, they never inviting any stranger to eat or drink, out of a conceit (it seems) that by their so doing they should prejudice the sellers of Roast or Boyled in the City, who paid great Taxes to the Prince, and were ever the first who ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) As his Life- guard.  ] waited upon him to the Warres at their owne Charges; so that Soto having attended long with much impatience, was admitted to the presence of the Lady Simplicia, to whom (after many mannerly cringes) he presented his Masters Letter; the Lady, though she courteously received it, did not seem the least taken with the tenour, but having afforded a slight perusall, she ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) But though the Lady seemed to slight his Verses in publike, she often made use of them in a Privie place.  ] put it (not as SOTO expected in her bosome) in her pocket, returning the Champion this Answer:  That she did wonder a man of a strange Countrey, who for ought she knew was no more then a pretender to Arms, should be possessed with so bold a confidence to court her by Letter, whom he had never so much as spoken to; she willed him to forbear for the future any more to sollicite her by Letter, lest he involved himself in a Labyrinth, out of which he could not escape, but with the forfeiture of his life, adding that if it were he (as she beleeved it was) who departed from the Presence in the morning, in so mad, or rather Clownish a manner, she could not think him fit for any Society, save those of the Black-Guard, being either not well in his wits, or a Coridonicall Coxcombe.  Having said this, she flung away, her Gesture expressing the highest disdaine, leaving SOTO in as much amazement as Ulysses his followers, when they felt themselves gradually giving up their manly shapes for that of Swine. What should poor SOTO do? to return to his Master with this nipping Answer, were to endanger his skin, and for to stay in this Inhospitable place were to starve his stomack; for a long time he stood like a man Soul-lesse; but at last his hunger overcame the thought of danger, and hee set forward towards his Masters Lodgings, who guessed the very event of the businesse by his face, but wisely disguising his fear, he cheerfully demanded what Answer the Lady had sent him. My Lord, said Soto, such an one as neither befits me to relate, nor you to hear, suffice it, she is a proud, disdainfull, contumacious woman, and is as likely to be won by your endeavours, as it is probable for me to make Minerva my Minion: This rather increased then mitigated the Champions inquiry, who commanded him, as he would avoid his wrath, to declare the whole carriage of the business. Since you will have it so, said Soto, know that she not only condemned your confidence for daring to importune her, but bespattered you with the odious epithets of Clown and Coxcomb. Death of my soule! said Zara, thou art alwayes (like the Raven) croaking my infortunity and disgrace, and I believe a cherisher rather then a confronter of those that calumniate me, in saying this (being transported with choller) he gave Soto so grievous a blow on the face, that it made him ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [ ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) The Champions invincible strength  ] totter thirty paces from him, the blood gushing out of his nose very violently; so that Soto, who (as it seems) had never before seen any such sauguinary flux, imagined himself wounded mortally, beyond all hope of escape, the grief whereof so exasperated him, that it gave him (as it were) a new soul, just when he lookt for no less then a seperation of soul and body, and (O villany!) he resolved to take vengeance on his Master as his Murtherer, and accordingly (with the highest courage) came up to the teeth of Zara, ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) The outragious Conflict between Don Zara and his servant Soto.  ] striking him twice or thrice on the chaps, in a most butcherly manner; it was long ere the Champion (so great was his astonishment at this impudence of Soto ) could believe both what he saw and felt, but having pregnant proof that Soto was indeed in earnest, and of a Secretary and an assistant was become a Serpent and an Assasinate, he redoubled his blowes with inexpressible indignation, which Soto not onely received, but retorted with almost equall force, so that the Combat grew both dangerous and dreadfull, and it was hard to determine which of they two should first purchase the Palm of Victory, for Soto (firmly conceiting that his latest hour was come) had sworn to his own soul to take his Master with him to Tartarus; this cruel contest continued for half an hour, till the Champion (as scorning to struggle any longer with his slave) closing with Soto, ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [ ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Being acquainted (it seems) with that sleight of heel which Wrestlers cal the Cornish Hug.  ] compelled him to the earth; and now having this Typhon down, good reason that he overwhelm him with a mountain, therfore he loaded his brest with the weight of his bulk, ever and anon affording him a cuff or two, which Soto not knowing how to retalliate but with his teeth, at one snap snatcht away the tip of the Champions nose, which (with a Sardinian smile) he forced in his face, who now was skrew'd up to the highest key of anger, and therefore drawing his knife, he cruelly cut off both the ears of Soto, attempting (O Scythian ferity) to cram the new- cropt dowcets down his throat; by this one act of Barbarity he for ever disabled Soto, who now concluded himself as dead as a pickled Herring, and accordingly postured himself as one fit for Funeall, which caused the Champion (who ever abhominated to insult over a dejected, or dead Foe) to forbear the further prosecution of his rage, and imagining he had most certainly slain his servant and Secretary, he presently harnessed himself, and mounting his strong Steed (as if haunted with Furies, like Orestes or Orlando ) he put spurs to his Palfray (all bedewed as he was with Soto's blood) with a resolve to find out Don Pantalone, the Knight of the PUDDING and in one day to rid the world of two of his terriblest Enemies; his eyes had scarce lost the sight of his Lodgings, where he beheld Pantalone riding towards him in shining Armour, his Sword drawn in his hand. Zara was something abashed to meet him so pat, yet scorning to have his Man of War sunk by a Sculler, he also drew his blade, and comming within six yards of him, said, Art thou that unmanner'd and degenerate Knight, that but yesterday didst send me a defiance by the Knight of the Jackanapes, challenging this Steed, Arms, Shield, and Sword, as thine, and threatning to cudgell and kick me, in case I delivered them not up into thy custody, as the true owner. Yes, said Pantalone, I am that very man, and will justifie that challenge, proving with my life, that thou art an Errant Thief, and no Knight Errant, the shame of Knighthood and the stain of honour. In saying this he gave his Steed a prick with his spur, who (as Pantalone had educated him) took a leap, which conveyed his Rider so neer our Champion, that striking him on the mouth with his hand and Gauntlet, he dislocated no less then four of his formost teeth, what can we fancy how much our Champion was exasperated with this trecherous indignity; therefore spitting his useless Grinders in Pantalones face (with such fury, that he had almost unhorsed him) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) The dreadfull Combat between Don Zara & Don Pantalone.  ] he gave the Knight of the Pudding so manly a blow on his Helmet, that he had cloven him to the waste, had not his Cap of steel been created by the Chalybes, and dipped in the River of Bilboe; Pantalone (who had never before felt such force) sate upon his horse back with a shivering amazedness, but at length recollecting himself, he seemed to make ample amends for his late stupidity, by giving Zara a wide wound on his right arm, which could not have hapned had our Champions Belt been girt about him, by vertue whereof he defied the dint of Sword, but (by the appointment of some malevolent power) that miraculous Girdle (being broken in the midst by the vigorous motion of his body while he encountred with Duke La-Fool and his 10000. Knights) fell from his waste the day before, so that now (like the slack-sinew'd Hebrew Gyant, with his hair off) he was no more then a very Mortall, and yet the greatnesse of his spirit for a long time supplied that insupportable loss, and he received wound upon wound with incredible patience; Nor was the Knight of the Pudding wholly exempted from danger (for to a Knight on hors-back, as is storied of the Centaurs, he that wounds the beast gashes the man) his Courser being wounded in the neck, and having a considerable cut over the nosthril, so that Pantalone was every minute in fear that his Steed should swown under him, and lye down with loss of blood; in the mean time Zara's wounds were multiplyed, yet his heart not mollified, resolving rather to dye couragiously, then to make a cowarly Resignation of his Horse, Armour, Shield and Sword, and which was more then all, his person; besides he had sufficiently tired himself (one would think) in the late Battall against Duke la-Fool and his confederates, add to this his dismal Ingagement with Soto, and therefore ought to have been excused from Warlike imployment (at least) for some months. What could Themistocles, Cleomenes, Hanniball, Al xander, or the mighty Montelyon, Knight of the Oracle have done more; the excessive loss of blood so enfeebles him, that he is scarce able to brandish his blade, or to keep the Saddle, unless he grasp the pummell; which Pantalone perceiving (like a good and gracious Knight) exhorted him to yield himself, and with the price of his Sword, Steed, Armour and Shield, to purchase a delivery from eminent death; I will, quoth Pantalone, not onely spare thy life, but be thy conduct to thy Lodging, thy wounds shall be sowed up by skilfull Chyrurgions, and thy body brought to a warm bed; Our Champion is now more ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Zara's remarkable placability.  ] vanquished by courtesie then by strength, being so much taken with this kind proffer of Pantalone, that alighting (though with much ado, by reason of his faintness) he took his Horse by the bridle, and humbling himself at Pantalones feet: Lo here, quoth he, what not all the steel of Toledo, nor![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) A German Fencer having a hundred hands.  ] Bryareus, though each hand of his had managed a Sword could have compassed, is effected by thy peerless candour, receive this Shield, this good Sword, these Arms, and this sturdy Steed as my gift (my worth will command more where ever Destiny shall drive me.) The Knight of the Pudding (with a smile) received what our Champion so willingly surrendred, and seating himself on Founder-foot, afforded Zara a being at his back, leading his owne horse in his hand (a thing that administred some cause of distast to our Champion, but having taken a Truce with his Enemy, he would not be the first should break it) riding on till he came to Don Zara's Lodgings, the people gazing upon him all the way very wistly, and whispering vituperatively, which our Champion heard well enough, but discreetly took no notice, being now become the very Emblem of the Golden Age, when a Pidgeon shal converse with Vultures; nor was Pantalone perfidious, but (in order to his promise) very courteously caused a skilfull Chyronist to be called, himself beholding those wounds which his hands had lately given carefully closed up, and the bruised Champion laid in his bed, of whom having taken leave, he returned (with his Horse, Armour, Shield, and Sword) to the Knight of the Ape, and his other Companions. It were needlesse to narrate what flouting, and what fleering there was amongst the bundle of Knights about this business of Don Zara, every man censuring as his fancy guided. The course of the History commands us to leave them to the guidance of their Fate, and return to Soto (earless Soto ) whom we lately left dead on the floor all be-mangled by his Master; long time it was (though he felt the palpitations of his heart and pulse, and that he was as warm as a new-beaten Bailiff) before Soto could be convinced of his Heresie, or believe himself to be alive, ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [ ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Soto's Resurrection.  ] first he moved an arm, then a leg, and at last took such heart of grace, that he couragiously leapt upon his feet, but the sight of his new-lopt ears had almost laid him along again; neverthelesse (with trembling) he at length took up his Lugs, and having heedfully wrapt them up in paper, put them in his pocket, till time should furnish him with opportunity to afford them the Rites of Sepulture; being thus out of all doubt, that he was now as other Mortalls, save for some maymes which he was resolved to keep from being seen by the help of his hair, he began to be somewhat comforted; but that very sort of sorrow which in others occasion drought, causes in him hunger, a sharp appetite to meat; he therefore began to consider what was become of his Master Don Zara Del Fogo, and to curse himself for opposing him as an equall, whom he ought to have adored as a Soveraign; having therefore resolved to finde him out, (and if it were possible) to reconcile himself, he resorted to the Host of the house where his Master resided, and very demurely demanded whether Don Zara del Fogo his Lord and Master were at home or abroad, in the Camp or the Court, answer was made, that he was just now conveyed to his bed (being much wounded) by a strange Knight, who seemed no other then he that had fought with him; Soto therefore enquiring what manner of man he was, and what Arms he wore, knew assuredly, that it was the Knight of the Pudding, Don Pantalone; he therefore resolutely went up to his Masters Chamber, but found the door fast locked, for the Champion having had his wounds bound up, and being laid in a soft bed, had betaken himself to rest; Soto knocked twice or thrice very soberly, but receiving no answer, he multiplied his stroaks, so long till Zara being awakened, demanded who was there; Soto retorted, Your Servant and Secretary SOTO;    [  Zara takes Soto for a Ghost. See Felthams Resolvs the third Century, pag. 100000. ] at which the CHAMPION (imagining by this time he had been laid in Earth), became much amazed, and in a distracted tone cryed out: I beseech thee, thou Spirit of wronged Soto, return to thy rest, and vex not him with thy clamours who shall shortly visit thee in the other World. Soto replyed: My Lord, we are both more happy then you conceit, I am alive, and Master of the same faculties of flesh that you are. At this the Champion scrambled out of his bed, and opening the door, Soto supported him to his former station, where being laid he enquired of Soto how and by what meanes he escaped, who related to him every particular both of his death and Revivall: I shall the more cheerefully welcome Death, said the Champion, that thou art alive; he then began to discourse what had hapned lately betwixt him and the Knight of the Pudding, and in the close of all commanded meat to be brought, and was confirmed that Soto was no Ghost by his eating: By this time it grew late, Cynthia being mounted in the highest of her five and twenty Mansions, the Champion therefore, having imbraced Soto, permitted him to depart, and slank down into his bed the second time.  The Champion recovered of his wounds, but inwardly vexed at Simplicia's scorn, is comforted and restored by Soto's excellent Oratory. He and Soto forsake their Lodging to avoid an after reckoning. Having left No-land, they arrive in a continent where the Champion finds the winged Hog, promised him by Lamia; He and Soto mounting their bristled Beast, are carryed through the Ayre, meeting with many strange Adventures.  cure, were not his interiours mortally vexed with the vigorous pangs of Love, the scorn of his Mistris Simplicia stuck Needles at his heart; his sick soule is surrounded with dolour, each thought is a thrust, and every cogitation a Carbonado. ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Zara's dolefull Complaint.  ] O Love, Love, said he, thou least of bulk, but greatest in strength of all the Powers immortall, what has Don Zara done unto thy Deity, that thou art so partiall in thy dispensations, emptying thy Quiver at his brest, and not ayming so much as one Arrow at her whose heart is more hard then Scythian Ice, or the scales of Dragons; Did not Gylo wash my head with warm Urine, and Simplicia slight my Addresses as I had rather been a Lowt then a Lord, a Coxcomb then a Champion, and a Knave Rampant then a Knight Errant; were my strength equall to my will, I would break thy Bow and Bolts about thy eares, and write thy Elegie with a Quill pluckt from thy own wing. With these and the like fascinorous fancies, he wearied himself almost all that night, but Phoebus flinging about his Rayes to illuminate the world, Soto resorted unto him, using all possible perswasion to asswage his grief, but (alas) to no purpose, for the Fistula of Love had seized upon his very fundamentals, so that though he grew every day more and more healthy, being now able to eat and drink devoutly, and traverse his Chamber as nimbly as a Berkshire Squirrell, yet within he was more sickly then a Subburb Letcher, or a drawl'd Prostitute, fitting her self for Fluxation, which Soto perceiving, thought it his duty to take him to task, and to endeavour to drive this Devill of Paphos out of him. How now my Lord, said he, will you cast away that life which was given you to redeem others from death and destruction ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [ ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) The Author disclaims this Invective as none of his, but Soto's.  ] for a Fis-gig, a flurt, a fickle, fantastick, fallacious, foolish Female? What do we get by these Gim-cracks? Satiation of our lusts: What is this fruition we so much covet, but a kind of fulsome Recreation, that flags our Crests, and makes us look worse then stale Drunkards, or losing Gamesters that have sat up all night to undo themselvs? Be your self (my lord) the Son of Mars, and not the slave of Venus; these whim-crown'd tumors un-man us all, and are at best but coveted calamities. This Satyricall Oration so much prevailed with the Champion, that he was now quite changed into another man; his heart which before was as soft as Curds, is now totally petrifide, and more obdurate then steel or Hangmen, so that he who some minutes since was Loves creature, is now more then his Conquerour; tis true, he shed abundance of tears, sighing and sobbing, as was pittifull to see; but these showers were but the preludiums to Thunder-cracks. My Arms (quoth he) O my Arms, my Sword, Shield, and Mace, but above all my Belt, the sad vicissitudes of two dayes have laid a foundation of misery for many Ages, bitten by a Bear, baffled by Gylo, reproached by Simplicia, and denuded by Don Pantalone; what horrour has Fortune yet to inflict? My Lord, said Soto, Fortune was ever a foe to noble minds, letting others pass as not worthy her notice; the tallest Trees and highest Towers are sometimes levell'd, when sheds and shrubs remain untoucht: Engineers are sometimes blown up with their own Mines, when Mous-trap-Makers dye meerly with sickness or age; Dukes and Marquesses fall by the Bullet or the Ax, when Dunghill-Rakers and Maulsters out-live themselves; Did you ever know a Gnat perish of the Pox, Goats and Monkeys destroy themselves with Doing; that then which you look upon as the Indignation of Heaven, is the Indulgency of Jove, witness wise Seneca:  Prosperity and happy Fortune finds Out Tapsters, Tinkers, & untutor'd Hynds O who can sufficiently express the force of Eloquence! Our Champion is so charmed with Soto's Philosophicall Elocution, that he cares now no more for a Sword, then an Ape for a clog; or for a Shield, then a Slave for a Bulls- pizzle; Armour is but a kind of honourable luggage, the confidence whereof causes Cowardice; and for Charmed Belts, and for such kind of Infernall securities, he said that the Devils word and his Oath were alike, and he was most safe that had least to do with him; as concerning a Courser (he alleadging that it was both dangerous and despicable to travell ou foot) Soto informed that the very High-wayes and Hedges, but especially Meads and Marish grounds would afford them a pair of Palfrays; Heightned with these Heroick Rudiments, the Champion and Soto (each grasping a staffe or Truncheon in his hand) resolved to forsake No-Land, as a Continent onely fertile in Fatallities, and to travell to the remotest parts of the Earth, but they would finde men more faithfull, and women more flexible; One morning therefore, while Aurora was combing her Crisped Curls, Sol being yet soundly sleeping in the Lap of Thetis, they thought it fit to convey them, selves out of Zardona-pola- Mancha- before their Host, or any of the houshold were stirring, the course of the Countrey carrying them through a Myrie Lane, almost three furlongs in length, to their exceeding turmoyle, but by the help of their Staves they vaulted over many deep Shloughes and Boggs, which otherwise might have been very banefull unto them. Having brought this Land to a period, they found themselves entered into a large, but very pleasant Wood, here were Trees of Rosemary, farre taller and bigger of bulk then any Brittish Elme, with Beds of Camomile six yards high, the Grasse no gowtier then that of other Climates, yet so incomparably stubborn, that the CHAMPION and SOTO passed over their tops without the least depressing of them, as on a Marble Pavement: In the midst of this Grove there ran a Rivulet, not so Chrystalline as they could have wished, in which were infinite numbers of Flying-Fishes, which sometime fought with one another in the Ayre with incredible fiercenesse, many being slain on both sides, but dropping into their native Element they are recovered again. These Feuds were maintained by these Aquatillians, meerly to please the Genius of the place, called Diclon, who sate (invironed with a Guard of Spectars) at the root of a Palme Tree, but his shape was so dreadfull, that neither the Champion nor Soto durst stand him, and therefore they departed towards the East side of the Grove, where the Champion espied that rare Beast which Lamia the Inchantresse had prophesied he should meet withall; this wondrous Creature had the shape of a Hogg, but farre bigger then an ordinary Horse, two wings expanding themselves on either side of him; his Saddle (very sumptuously imbossed with Gold) on his back, and his Bridle hanging loosly about his neck; he was feeding very voraciously on the verdant Grasse, his teeth serving as a Sickle with which he mowed down all before him. The CHAMPION was so overcome with joy to behold this Beast, that he remained for a time speechlesse, but at length recovering himselfe; See SOTO, said hee, where the winged Hogg (that gift of the Gods) long since assigned me by Lamia, offers himself to my disposall: He had no sooner said this, but (like a couragious Knight) he made up to this plumed prodigie, who seemed to fawn on him like a Spaniell, and to be desirous of his service; The CHAMPION finding him so gentle, immediately put the bit into his mouth, and leaping into the Saddle, commanded SOTO to get up behind him, who was once in the mind rather to desert his Master, then hazzard his person in so eminent a danger; but at length (O man of desperation!) he forced himselfe to a compliance, and loaded the Crupper of this volatile Swine, who no sooner found himself burthened, but he quitted the Earth, and (like some flitting Fowle) made way with waving Wings, through the moyst Ayre, while the CHAMPION (like another Bellerophon) was carried over Land and Sea, to the infinite astonishment of all that beheld him, the people forsaking their houses, followed him in heaps, to feast their eyes with so unparallell'd an object; some thinking him to be Hermes, others some Magitian, such as Agrippa or Faustus, having thus travelled many hundred leagues, he gave his Hog a check, who gently saluted the Earth, the CHAMPION finding himself in the in- most parts of Africk, in one place he saw those kind of Devils called Onoscelli, with leggs like unto Asses, in another place ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) Incubi and Seccubi, that leap upon men and women in their sleep; S me ignorant Physicians say that these are nothing else but a Disease.  ] Ephialt ae and Hyphialt ae, those very things that in the shapes of men and women, allure the very Mortalls of both Sexes to Venery, whence it comes to pass that we have many Hermaphrodicall Monsters amongst us even at this day, being (indeed) half men and half Devils, but whether by the fathers or the mothers side, is not materiall. No marvell if our Champion were not very well pleased with this place which afforded nothing for food, unless he would have fed upon the haunches of a Hyppocentaure, or feasted on the fore-quarter of a Fiend; he therefore having seated Soto once more behind him, gave his winged Beast the Rein, who forsaking this duller Earth, cut a passage to the Clouds, travelling over the tops of Steeples and Towers, with admirable celerity. Ah Zara, Zara, had thy rude Father moystned thy minority with the Elements of the Arts; till thou hadst grown tall and tough in Scientificall knowledge, what excellent Cosmographicall Volumes had the World been witness of? and thou (with Julius C aesar ) have been as famous for thy Goose Quill in after Ages, as thou art now eminent for thy wondrous Hogg, and Heroick Resolution to visit strange Countries, but it's bootless to bewail a helpless ill, and to weep over the Bier will not bring the dead man to life again: Proceed we therefore with the Narration of our Champions admirable Adventures, who (as did Soto ) ![](/images/inline/ast.gif)   [   ![](/images/inline/ast.gif) The emptiness of the craw causes the heaviness of the carkass. See Marriots Madrigals, and Wood of Kents Aphorism.  ] grew more and more ponderous every minute, so that the Swine began to abate much of his swiftness, and to flye but with a feeble wing, which caused the Champion (though much against his will, for he had not yet perused a place pat for his purpose) to salute the Earth a second time, but with the same fortune he found before; this was part of Lybia, but not so full of Serpents as in Cato's time, by reason that the River Nylus had broken that way, and made a fair riddance of these foule creatures; here they found men and women with heads like Dogs barking at one another most bitterly, and sometimes howling in a most hideous manner, the comfortable Sun, nor the continent Moon never beautifide these barren grounds, onely a certain Star appeared in the East part of the Horizon, which afforded a glimmering Lucency; the Champion and Soto were exceedingly perplexed to finde themselves now amongst Doggs, as lately among Divels, insomuch, that had they worn Swords, ten to one but they had slain themselvs, but making a vertue of necessity (the Champion leading the winged Hog in his hand) they footed it with much swiftness till they came within ken of a Castle, scituate upon a Rock, invironed with many pleasant Trees; how joyous our Champion and Soto were to behold this Mansion (in all probability) made for Mortalls to make merry in, let those that have been sensible of their sufferances relate.  Here Time trips up the heels of thy bright story, Renowned Don, vext at thy Valours glory; Dragons may now securely sleep, and ugly Deformed Orks seem to look smooth and smugly; Gyants may wield their Maces and their Oakes, And knock down Knighthood with their strenuous stroaks: Who now shall cure those Castles that are haunted? Affording ayde to men and Beasts Inchanted?
