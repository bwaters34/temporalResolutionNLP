 is usually ten Syllables, but sometimes when there are Dactyles , it is extended to eleven or twelve , as in this Verse of Dryden . Thee Saviour, Thee the Nations Vows confess . [In our Stanza's , according to the different Kinds of them the Measure differs. Two of our Poets , have writ long Poems in Stanza's, Spencer , and Sir William Davenant . The Stanza of Sir William Davenant is, what they call the Quaternion , which consists of four Pentameters with alternate Rhyme . The Stanza of Spencer consists of nine Verses, the eight first of which are Pentameters , and the ninth is an Alexandrine or an Hexameter . But the Stanza is certainly very improper for long and noble Poems . It seems to belong in a peculiar manner to our Lyrick Poetry. The Measures of our Lyrical Stanza's are as different as the Odes which are writ in those Stanza's . There is the Regular Stanza and the Irregular. The Irregular Stanza belongs to the Ode which is vulgarly called Pindarick , in which no one Stanza unless by chance answers exactly to another. The Regular Stanza is that, whose Measures and the different Placing of its Rhymes answer exactly to every one of the same Ode ; and even of these there is a vast Variety, as every one knows who is acquainted with our Poets who have writ Odes and Songs ; as Suckling, Waller , Cowley, Sedley, Wilmot, Sackvile , with a long et ceteri . To treat of Cadence as one ought to do, would require an entire Treatise. The Word seems to me to be a Metaphor drawn from the Dancing School , where it properly signifies a Pause or a Fall from Motion to Rest: Taken metaphorically, it signifies a Pause in Sound, or a Fall from Sound to Silence, or from a stronger Sound to a softer, and is regulated by the natural Stops of the Sense, and influenced by the Accents . In our most musical Pentameters or Heroicks , the Pauses which are most remarkable, are those which are in the Middle of a Verse, or those which are at the End of it. The Pauses in the Middle of the Verse, are either upon the fourth Syllable, as in these Verses of Denham ; Tho' deep, yet clear, tho' gentle, yet net dull , Strong without Rage, without oreflowing full . Or upon the Sixth, as in the following Verse of Roscommon ; Vain are our Neighbours Hopes, and vain their Cares . The Pause at the End of a Verse ought to be greater than any Pause that may preceed it in the same Verse, and the Pause at the End of a Couplet ought to be greater than that which is at the End of the first Verse. But it is not necessary that the Pause at the End of a Couplet should be a full one, that is a Point; it is often a Colon , often a Semicolon , often a Comma only. But if the Rhyme is carried on to the third Verse, which causes the three to be called a Triplet , then it is necessary there should be a full Pause, that is a Point; especially if the last Verse of the three is an Hexameter , as it often happens. I Come now to say something of Rhyme that Gothick Pretence to Harmony. Rhyme then is nothing but a Similitude of Sound between the last Syllable or Syllables of one Verse, and the last Syllable or Syllables of another Verse, either immediately following the former, or following at the Distance of two or three Lines at the most. For if the first Syllable of the intended Rhyme be lost to the Ear before the second reaches it, there either can be no Rhyme , or at the best but a very imperfect one. Rhymes are either single, or double, or treble; but because double and treble Rhymes are confined to one Sort of Poetry , which is seldom writ now by People of this World, unless it be to advance the Glory of one who has been several Years in the other; I shall be contented to treat of single Rhymes alone. A single Rhyme then is a Similitude of Sound between the last Syllable of one Verse, and the last Syllable of another ther Verse following it at the fore-mentioned Distance. And single Rhymes are divided into half and imperfect Rhymes , and whole and perfect ones. A half and imperfect Rhyme is, where there is a Similitude with a Difference. The Difference lies chiefly in the Pronunciation, but sometimes too in the Orthography. We have an Example of both these Differences in fix Verses of Walkr , which are in the Copy, which the Country is supposed to present to the Countess of Carlisle . A rural Judge dispos'd of Beauty's Prize , A simple Shepherd was preferr'd to Jove , Down to the Mountains from the partial Skies Came Juno, Pallas, and the Queen of Love , To plead for that , which was so justly giv'n To the Bright Carlisle of the Court of Heav'n . Now here are two imperfect Rhymes ; the Syllables of the first Rhyme , Jove and Love , agree in the Orthography, but differ in the Pronunciation. The Syllables of the second Rhyme , giv'n and Heav'n , differ both in the Pronunciation and the Orthography. But then this Passage of Waller , is so spiritual, so courtly, and so gallant, and the Numbers considered apart from the Rhymes are so very good, that the Reader abandons himself to the Pleasure they give him, and is not at Leisure to consider any Imperfection of the Rhyme . If there is any Thing amiss in this Passage it is, that it is a great deal too courtly and too gallant for the Country. But Mr. Waller is so happy a Genius, that his very Faults are great Beauties. Another Thing that renders the Rhyme imperfect is, when one of the Words, whose last Syllable helps to constitute it, is a Polysyllable, and the Accent does not lie on the last Syllable. As for Example, we find the following Lines in Waller's Translation of Part of the Fourth Book of Virgil ; Her Resolution to dispatch and die , Confirm'd by many a horrid Prodigy . Now here the latter Syllable of the Rhyme is not half pronounced, and consequently the Rhyme is imperfect, or the Accent must be wrongfully laid upon the last Syllable, which must make the Reader appear to be an Ignorant Person. A whole or perfect Rhyme is, where there is a Similitude of Sound without any Difference, or in other Words, where there is a thorough Identity of Sound, which appears in pronouncing the two Syllables which make the Rhyme , though perhaps they may differ something in the Orthography; as in these Lines of the fore-mentioned Verses of Waller ; Carlisle, a Name which all our Woods are taught , Loud as their Amaryllis , to resound : Carlisle, a Name which on the Bark is wrought Of every Tree that's worthy of the Wound . Now here Taught and Wrought , though they differ in the Orthography, yet agree perfectly in the Pronunciation, which latter ought chiefly if not solely to be regarded in framing the Rhymes . The two Lines of Waller immediately following the four which were last mentioned have a perfect Rhyme , whose Syllables agree both in Orthography and Pronunciation. From Phoebus Rage , our Shadows and our Streams May guard us better , than from Carlisle' s Beams . But these perfect Rhymes are more or less sweet, or more or less sonorous, as they are more or less composed of Mutes and Liquids , or Vowels or Diphthongs . Thus, Sir, in complaisance to you, have I gone through the four Things which have been thought to conduce to the Harmony of modern Poetry , which are Numbers, Measure, Cadence, and Rhyme; of these the three first consist of several different Sounds which are dependent one of another. Rhyme , as I observed heretofore, is wholly Independent of the other three, and consists in the greater Poetry , but
