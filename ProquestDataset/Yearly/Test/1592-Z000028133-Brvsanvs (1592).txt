Your louing Cosyn who wisheth you all happines, Barnaby Rich, read and profitable for some to follow, written by Barnaby Riche seuen or eight yeares sithens, and now published by the great intreaty of diuers of his friends. Myletto King of Hungaria had a sonne and a daughter, the sonne called Brusanus the daughter Leonida. At that time when the most renowned Liberius gouerned the empire of Constantinople holding the parts of Cayre Soria, Calypha, and all Grecia in the most christian & catholicke faith, at that very instant ther raigned likewise in Hungaria ye noble king Myletto a prince of such iustice as he neuer thought him selfe priuiledged in being a prince, nor did measure greatnes by any thing but by goodnes. This prince was so fauoured and fostered vp by fortune, his estate so established with honour, so beautified with wealth, so deckt with the diademe of dignitie, and so indued with fortunate prosperity, that he semed to want nothing which either fortune or the fates might aforde him, so that he was honoured with the sacred titles of good, iust, merciful, with many other like vertuous additions: But as the vices of children are swords which passe through ye harts of their parents, so the happiness of Myletto was greatly surcharged with this heauines, for hauing to wife a lady called Paulina, by byrth royall, by nature faire, by education learned, & by vertue famous, by this lady Myletto in the prime of his yeares had two children, the one a sonne called Brusanus, the other a daughter named Leonida, so perfect in complextion, so pure in constitution, so adorned with outward beuty, and so indued with inward bounty, as her very countenaunce was full of bashfulnesse, loue and reuerence. Brusanus on the other side, was so contrarie to his sister (though not in state of body, yet in the stay of his minde) as it made al men maruell how two so contrary stems could spring of a selfe same stocke, yet his parsonage was most comelie, euery lineament gallantly proportioned, his face and countenance sweet and amiable, with an intising louelines to as many as did behold it: But in the quality of his minde, hee was so spotted with voluptuousnesse so nusled in wantonnes, so giuen ouer to licentiousnesse, so linked to wilfulnesse, and so caried away with all kind of wickednesse, that neither the feare of god, the displeasure of his parents, the sundry admonitions of his carefull and louing friendes, nor the regard of his owne honour could make him desiste, or driue him from this detestable kind of life: the day he consumed in such ryot, excesse, dronkenesse, dicing, gaming, swearing & swashing, as whole millions of gold, were insufficient to maintaine the expences of so witles prodigality: the night he spent in masking, muming, dauncing, banqueting and hooring: do you thinke then there wanted ruffians, roysters, flaterers, brokers, bawdes, and such other like to follow him? O no be sure there wil be to many counterfaites to imitate the naturall vice of princes but the good king his father hauing many times wasted his wind in fruitles exhortations to his sonne, being still gauled with this continuall griefe, fearing that after his death, his sonnes lascyuious life would be the ouerthrow of his house, the consumer of the kingdome, the wracke of the common weale, and the very man that should bring the state to mischeife and miserie, determined eyther to cut of the course of his liuing or of his life, thinking it better to want a sonne, then neuer to want sorrow, hauing soe gratious a daughter to whome he might leaue the inheritance of his crowne, in whose issue the kingdome might bee made more happye: but firste determined to seeke all other possible meanes. He caused his sonne to be sent for, to whom he said as foloweth. The fatherlie exhortation of Myletto to Brusanus. Calling to mind ( Brusanus ) first the royall race fro whence thou art descended, the vertuous education wherein thou hast beene nurtered, the sundry holsome preceptes where with thou hast beene instructed: with the lewed and shamles demeanure wherein thou art daily nusled, as I can but lament thy misfortune, so I must more wonder at thy follye, and yet the more I thinke, the more cause I haue of thinking & the lesse hope of thy amendment. Haue thy friendes hoped so long for a plentiful haruest, & now shalbe constrained to gather weedes, hast thou from thy youth beene trained vp in learning, and after thou hast giuen a good scape to the payle, thou shouldest kicke it downe curstly with thy heels, O how much better had it beene for thee neuer to haue rypened, then so soone to haue rotted: thou seest ( Brusanus ) my white heaires are blossomes for the graue, and thy fresh coulour, fruit for time and fortune, so that it behoueth me to think how to dy, & for thee to care how to liue: my crowne I must leaue by death, and thou enioy my kingdome by succession: it is then requisite for thee so to fortifie thy minde with strong reasons, graue sentences, and learned preceptes of wisdome, that thy weake seedes of vertue be not drowned in the floudes of vaine delights: For as the prince being the head of his people, and most excelent of all: hee muste therfore by his good example be a paterne to al. What honor is it for a prince, to go farre beyonde the common sorte in pretious stones, beaten gold, coulloured silcks, and great traines of seruantes, when he shall be inferiour to all in vertues and honesty of life: For to instrucke his people by precepts, is a longe and difficult way, but to teach them by example, is very shorte, and of greater efficacy, for where they shall see vertue after a liuelie sorte imprinted in a visible paterne, and that the princes life is suche an example, they become wise of their one accord, then is force, constraint or threatning, needlesse to bring them to their dutie: O consider my sonne the difference between a vertuous king and a vitious prince, the one striueth to inrich his subiectes, the other to destroy them, the one spareth the honor of good women, the other triumpheth in their shame: the one taketh pleasure to be freely admonished, the other misliketh nothing so much as wise and vertuous councell: the one maketh great acompt of the loue of his people, the other is better pleased with their feare: the one is neuer in doubt of his owne subiectes, the other standeth in awe of none more then them: the one burdeneth them but as litle as may be vpon publique necessitie, the other gnaweth the flesh from their bones to satisfie his vaine pleasures, the one in time of warre hath no recourse but to his subiectes, the other keepeth warre but only with his subiects: the one is honored in the time of his life and mourned for after his death: the other is hated in his life with perpetuall infamie after his deathe: A crewell prince will make a slaughter house of his common wealth, a hooremaister will make it a stewes, a prodigall will sucke the marowe of his subiectes, to glut some halfe dosine flattering parrisites, that wil be about his parson, disguised in the habit of fidelity: A good prince must not dedicate the common wealth to him selfe, but must addicte him selfe to the common wealth, and because no man asketh accompt of him in his life, hee ought to be so much the more stirred vp to demand a streighter rekoning of him selfe: hee must liue as it were vppon an open Theatre where he is seene on euery side, so that his life will be a discipline and instruction of good or ill liuing vnto others, therefore let him seeke to excell those whome he ruleth and to surmount them as farre in vertue, as hee surpasseth them in riches and honour. But what is to be hoped for from that prince, that only accompanieth him selfe with curtesans, flatterers, drunckards, diceplaiers, dauncers and inuenters of pleasures, breiflie in the midst of such caytiffes amongst whome he learneth nothing but pleasure, delight, pride, vanitie and such other. Why shouldest thou make such accompt of the beautie of thy bodye, which hauing inclosed in it the soule which is defiled with ougly vice & monsterous sinne, is nothing els but a proud sepulcher vnder which is contained a stinking and putrified carrion: Forsake such vaine delightes ( Brusanus ) and let vertue be thy guide if thou wilt attaine to happye honour. For honor is the onely reward of vertue, and onely vertue must open the gates of honour. The Romanes builded two temples ioyned to gether, the one being dedicate to vertue the other to honor: but yet in such sorte, as no man could enter into that of honor, except hee first passed through that of vertue, which is the onely thing whereof al the greatnes, glory and honour of men dependeth, and not in the dignitie wherein they are placed: A small want to bragge of the scutchyons and armes of our auncestors, when (to speake trulie) there is no righte nobillitie but that which springeth of vertue: He boasteth in vaine of his great linage, that seeketh to be esteamed for the nobillitie and vertue of his ancestors, and hath no goodnes in him selfe: for what is it to vaunt of Hercules race, and not to follow his workes, which made him so famous through ye world: Despise not my sonne thy fathers louing admonitions, for (as the wise man saieth) he that honoreth his father shall haue ioy of his owne children, and when hee maketh his praier he shall be hard: he that feareth the lord honoureth his parents, and doth seruice to his parents as to the lord: The blessings of the fathers establish the houses of the children, and the mothers cursse rooteth out the foundations: He that forsaketh his father shall come to shame, and he that angreth his mother is cursed of god: To conclude, there is no praier which god heareth more willingly then that of the father, which hee maketh for his child: O my sonne while thou hast yet time, apply thy selfe to that now in thy youthe, which will be profitable for thee in thy olde age, namely to the attaining of vertue and knowledge, which will procure vnto thee, honour, praise, safetie, happines, rest and tranquilitie in this life, and will in the end guide thee to eternall life. The demeanure of Brusanns after his fathers exhortations, and how he was handeled by Petrona a curtizane. The carefull old father, hauing discoursed thus far to his carelesse yoong sonne, was here interrupted with the abundance of teares which streamed downe his cheekes, but Brusanus who that very morning had appointed with certaine of his companions, to meete in the Citie at a curtezans house, where great reuell was appointed for, was all this while so busyed in the contemplation of his pleasures, that hee vnderstood neuer a worde what his father had deliuered, and was therfore able to make him no manner of answere, but seeking his best oportunity to giue his father ye slip, in the end, conuaid himselfe away to his appointed place, where he found his companions attending his comming: The father wounderfully perplexed at his sonnes demeanure, had the narrower watch to the rest of his proseedinges, and finding his course of life rather to waxe worse then any whit to better, resolued himselfe of this last experyment, which was to cut him from all manner of meanes whereby to maintaine his lauish expences, and not only by shutting vppe his owne purse, but also by straight proclamation through his whole kingdome, he prohibyted all vnder great penaltie, neither to lend him mony, nor to render vnto him any manner of reliefe. But could there be a greater griefe to Brusanus then so sodainly to be brought to so extreame want, his father would affoord him no manner of allowance, the rest were restrained by the late proclamation, hys companions that hitherto had followed him in all his follyes, that were the very ministers of all his mischiefes, amongst whome he had consumed whole millions of treasure, and many of them made rich by his idle expences, did not onely refuse to helpe him in this necessity, but also lefte him alone, and refused to come in his company. Brusanus being nowe driuen to hys last refuge: calling to his rememberance an old acquaintance, called by the name of Madona petrona, a curtyzane that him self had aduaunced from base parentage, who by his prodigalitye was wonderfully inriched, both in apparell, Iewelles, and great store of money which she put out to vsurye, thinking to find her as kind of her coine as she was of her honesty, he imparted vnto her the extreamitye of his want, but shee hauing had former inteligence how matters had passed betweene hys father and him, and finding him now to bee growne so bare, determined to shake handes with his acquaintaunce, and notwithstanding the many benefites which before he had bestowed of her, she rather resolued to see him begge, then shee would part with one crowne to doe him pleasure, but yet for her better excuse she answers him thus: Three yeares are fully expired (my Lord Brusanus ) since you tooke the first frutes of my body, sith which time I haue remained altogether at your disposition, so often as it pleased your selfe to commaund, yet not without great infamye and slaunder to my person, beeing discredited through the whole Citie, by your continuall recourse and repayre to my house, and although I must confesse you haue bestowed of me many liberall rewardes, and from time to time haue gratified me with rich and costly presentes, yet sir when you shall consider well of your penyworthes, I haue greatest cause to complaine of my market, when the bargaine hath cost me the price of my maidenhead, my payne of pleasaunt yeares spent at your deuotion, with my name and reputation for euer infamed: where otherwise my beautie might haue proued a bayte to haue intangeled some amorous gentleman or other rich marchant, that might haue maintained me and made mee his wife, where nowe that hope were more then vaine to looke for: what resteth then for poore Petrona but to hold that shee hath, and to make account of no more, then what she doth allready possesse. Brusanus, who all this while had listened to her speaches, was not a little pinched to heare her conclusion, but minding to make no other replye, imbrasing her in his armes he gaue her a frendly busse, adding these fewe words as followeth: I perceiue my Petrona, the old prouerbe must be newly veryfied, which saith, that pouertie will part good company, thou knowest I haue loued thee, and now I must leaue thee, but if thou thinkest I haue bought thy chaffer to cheape, blame but my fortune, which hath rather conducted me to craue new credite, then to paye old debts: with this hee gaue her an other frendly kisse, making semblaunce as though he would haue taken his leaue, thinking that for a farewell Petrona at the least would haue relieued him with some fiue hundered crownes, who had bestowed of her (as seuerall times) a great manye thousandes, but shee more lauishe of her lippes, then shee was of her purse, to shift him off by a prettyer meane replied in this manner. Alas Brusanus and must wee needes part, if (as you say) there bee no other remedy, knowe this by the way, Petrona cannot liue by kisses, but if you loue me as you haue protested in wordes, I hope I shall finde it confirmed in your deeds, and being fitted nowe by occation to make triall of your kindnesse, I stand in want at this instant of a thousande crownes, the which (my Brusanus ) I hope you will not denye me for a farewell, being the last gifte (as I perceiue by your owne wordes) that I am euer like to receiue at your handes. Brusanus finding himselfe to bee thus preuented, answered thus: Petrona, thy former experience (I thinke) hath taught thee, that my crownes haue been euer at thy commaundement, my swoord as ready to incounter thine enimies, my body as willing to satisfie thy pleasures, nay wherein haue I failed to fullfill all duties proper to a louer, but Petrona the world is chaunged with Brusanus, hast thou not hard, my father is displeased with me, dost thou not know my frendes haue forsaken me, and dost thou not see my seruantes haue lefte me, Brusanus hath beene honoured as a prince, but now more dispised then a poore pesaunt, what speakest thou of a thousand crownes ( Petrona ) to him that is not furnished of so many farthinges: yet the thing that doth most greue me, is to part with thy sweete company, but there is no remydye. Brusanus may not stay, Hungaria cannot hold him. Alas my Lord (said Petrona ) and can you bestow nothing for a farewell, if you bee driuen to so narrowe a scantling, the paringes of your nayles shall suffyce to content your louer petrona, the which as a relique in your rememberaunce, I would charily keepe, perswading my selfe that if you had had a better present, I know it would haue falne to my share. Brusanus seing the kindnes of the louing worme, cutting of the paringes of his nayles he deliuered them into her hand, vttring these wordes: Loe petrona, to satisfy thy request, hold heere the present, which I know thou hast desyred for the loue thou bearest vnto me, and although for thy sake I could hartely wishe them to bee Iewelles of inestimable price, yet knowing such wishes are euer but wast, I assure thee if my ability would stretch as well to a whole million of gold, I would as willingly bestowe the one as I haue reddely giuen the other: And heerewithall pressinge towardes her, thinking once a gaine to haue taken a kindly kisse, she thrust him from her and said: Nay softe Brusanus you mistake your texte, I am sure euery parish priest could learne you this lesson, No penny no pater noster, and I haue often hard it said, No lenger piping no lenger daunsing, and nowe thou hast nothing lefte, what should I doe with thy company, goe vaunt thee now Brusanus, thy louer petrona would neuer leaue thee, so long as thou hadest but the paringes of thy nayles left to bestow of her, the best aduise I can nowe affoord thee is, I would wish thee presently to goe hang thy selfe, by meanes whereof both thy ill fortune and thyne ill life might both finish in an ill death: This said she speedely flung away from him, goeing into her chamber, where she shut fast the dore, leauing Brusanus standing all alone, who recounting with himselfe of these dispightfull taunts, had his fantasie so assailed with feare, griefe, dispaire, heate, coller, wrath, and desire of reuenge, that he raged against the gods, he railed on the destinies, he defied loue, hee cursed all woman kind: and hauing thus giuen allarume as well to all the powers of heauen as also to all the workes of the earth, after a little pause and that he had a while bitte on the bridell, he returned into these speaches. How Brusanus sorrowing his former misled life, resolueth to trauaile. And wilt thou now be discouraged Brunsaus, by remembring thine owne imperfections, seeing by labour and diligence thou maiest yet recouer what thou hast hitherto lost, hast thou seene so much and canst thou practise nothing, are thine eies cleare, and wilt thou still counterfeit blindnes, hast thou thy right sences and wilt thou seeme sencelesse, canst thou not make profite of thine owne folly, learne with the bee to gather sweetest honny from the bitterest hearbes, when both fortune, ocasion, and thine owne industry maye so well helpe forward the matter, let thy vice make thy vertue more to shine, so maist thou thinke thy pouerty a happy prosperity, yea most happy maist thou count thy mishap, that is the originall of thy true hap, while thou didest flourish, how wert thou fed with faire wordes, how many fained frendes, fine fauners and cunning flatterers did haunt thee, yea in thy wealth whole millions of frendes did compasse thee, but now in thy want, doest thou not see that both pleasure and company doth forsake thee, thou canst not find one that will affoord thee so much as a good looke. Sith then Brusanus, thou findest such falshoode in felloweship, and such faithlesse deeds in such painted speches, shake of these fauning curres with the flagge of defiance, and from henceforth trie ere thou trust: I but now to late to apply a plaister when the sore is past cure, to cry Alarume when the Citie is sackt, to seeke for couert, when the storme is past, and now thou wilt cry cauy, when thy coine is consumed, and beware of flatterers when thy wealth is wracked, to waxe more chary when thou hast nothing in thy charge, and when thou hast allready receiued the maate, thou seekest by cunninge to make voide the checke: But now thou triest it true that thy father foretould thee, that so long thou wouldest be carelesse, that at the last repentance would pull thee by the sleeue: but the flattering pleasures of this world can promise no other blisse, for worldly prosperity (I see) is a spur to wickednes, it carrieth men willingly to the pleasant court of vanity. Leaue of therefore Brusanus if not for shame yet to avoid sinne: shake of this incumbraunce, striue to be verteous, leaue to be amorous, forsake misdemeanure, and since thou hast seene much, practise a little: it is a common imperfection to offend, but an extraordinary perfection to amend, the first springeth by nature, the other from vertue, & how often hath thy father told thee that honor is only to be sought for by the meanes of vertue. It onely resteth then that I imbrace thee (o sweete repentance) by whose onely meanes, we are drawne to mercie, and without whose winges we cannot flye from vengance. Brusanus thus thanked the Godes, that had wrought his honour out of his shame, that had made his owne finding to goe amise, to be the best meane euer after to hold him in the right pathes, and although before hee had shewed himselfe a braue gallante in the court of Venus, yet nowe he vowed himselfe a professed souldiour to march vnder the ensigne of vertue, and calling to mind his former mislede life, did not onely detest and hate loue, but so mightely contemned the whole feminine sex, that his hatred did so much exceed, by howe much hee remembred his present misfortunes. This was a sodain chaunge, but sure a happy chaunce, but Brusanus holding on a determinate minde to seeke after honor, resolued him selfe to trauell, the which when his father had got intelligence of the newes, was halfe a salue to his sorrowe, thinking that it woulde either bee a meane to end his life or mende his lewdnes, he therefore tooke secret order to haue him conueniently furnished as well with mony as all manner of other necessaries. Brusanus iourneing through the country of Epirus, mett with Leonarchus king of that Region, disguised like a merchant, called himselfe Corynus, and what speaches passed betweene them. trauellers, who after their returne into their owne countrey are commonly so full fraught, with farre fette follies, that they are vtterly emptie of their home vertues, and can make no better returne then their heades ouerburthened with too many outlandishe vanities, he therefore armed him selfe with a determinate minde, to gather a platforme both of vertue  & vice, imitating the good in their commendable qualities, & abhorring the bad in their foolish demeanures applyeng both presydents of good and bad to one vertuous purpose, & wholy to endeuor him selfe in al honorable enterprises hauing thus fortified him selfe with this vertuous imagination, directed his first course towards Epirus, wher Leonarchus then reigned kinge, a prince that was renowned for his vertue, fortunate for his peaceable gouernment, reuerenced for his grauity, obayed for his authoritie, loued for his mediocrity, and honored for his liberalitie, administring iustice with such sinceritie, yet tempering the extreamitie of the lawe with such limmite, as he gained the good wil of strangers in hearing his vertue, and wonne the heartes of his subiectes in feeling his bountie, counting him vnworthy to beare the name of a soueraigne which knew not (according to deserte) both to cherishe and chastice his subiectes. This noble prince vpon a priuate conceipt to him selfe, disguised in the habite of a marchant, had secretly left his courte, and trauelling through many partes of his owne dominions (being not other-wise taken then for a marchant) called him selfe by the name of Corynus, the which name (because I perceiue hee was other wise loath to bee knowne) I will therefore vse for the time. Brusanus, who in the meane space had iurnied many daies towards Epirus was now come to the confines, and taking his directe course towards the famous citie of Doretta (where the court was still residente) he fortuned (in the way) to ouer-take this kinglye marchante Corynus: and after friendly salutations passed betweene them, Corynus taking a through vewe of this gallant yonge prince, was wonderfully delighted in his comely personage, in his amiable countenance, and in his modest regards: and perceiuing by his apparell that hee was a stranger, to breake of their vnnecessarie silence he saide. Although (curteous gentleman) it bee no parte of good manners to desire to knowe a strangers secrets, yet if it pleased you but to recompt vnto me what country man you are borne, whether you are trauelling, and what I might call your name, if (to requite your curtisie) ther be any thing wherein I may stead you, you shall command me for a much greater matter then I haue yet requested. Brusanus hauinge heard the mild motion of this graue marchaunte whose outward shew of countenance, did manifest an inward stay of minde aunswered thus? Sir, my country is Hungaria, my name Brusanus, by byrthe a gentleman, by fortune a traueller, and the cause standing of such nice poyntes, as peraduenture your grauity may hardly brooke: let this suffice, my yonge yeares (as you see) subiecte to sundry impressions, at the last haue taken holdfast in trauelling to vnknowne citties, led by this resolution, that in seeing manye thinges, I should learne some thing, and intised by the generall reporte of the rare vertues, the maiesticall gouernmente, and most renowned demeanure of Leonarchus, who holdeth her the princely diademe, I haue left myne owne country, and am trauelling to his court to se if the brauery be correspondent to the brute, and the demeanure of the countries, so commendable as is reported. Corynus, secretly reioysing to heare himselfe so praised, aunswered thus. Truly, (curtious gentleman) the commendations you haue giuen to Leonarchus are so many, that my selfe (being as much affected towards him as any subiecte may bee to his soueraigne) canne deuise to say no more, and for that by your former speeches, I perceiue your desire is to grow into the highe way of experience, being arriued heer to se the fassions of our court, whatsoeuer by eie your selfe shall perceiue, I by my experience can something lay open, hauing in my yoonger daies ventured amongst the rest to become a courtier, although not so formall as county Baldassare hath figured. The court here of Epirus, being so renowned (as you would make it) by the king that now holdeth the scepter, as it is replenished with men of diuerse calling, so it is frequented by men of as sundry dispositions. Some repaire thither hoping of preferment by their vertuous indeuors, who by their good deseruinges are to growe in fauour, or by their valor and force of armes, are to be confirmed with martiall honour. Other againe incited by vanitie (hauing the raine in their one neckes) resort thither to satisfie their youthfull humors with a little folish brauery, where their braines are so continually combred with deuising of new fashions, that many times of comly personages, they transforme them selues to disguised puppittes. By this you may perceiue that as the court is a schoole of vertue to such as can bridell their mindes with discretion, so it is a nursse of vice to suche as measure their wils with witlesse affection. How Brusanus and this counterfaite Marchant were incountered by a courtier called Gloriosus, and lodged at Vtica. Gentleman that was ridinge to the court, and a courtier hee was, called by the name of Signior Gloriosus, the loftines of his lookes was much to bee marueld at, but the manner of his attire was more to bee laughed at. On his head he woare a hatte without a band like a Mallcontent, his haire hanging downe to both his shoulders, as they vse to figure a hagge of hell, his beard cut peecke a deuaunt, turnde vppe a little, like the vice of a playe, his countenance strained as far as it would stretch, like a great Monarcho: his coller turnde downe round about his necke that his throat might be seene, as one that were going to hanging should make way for the hallter, his dublet holstered with bumbast, as if he had beene diseased with the dropsie: vppon that hee wore a loose Mandilyon, like a counterfeit souldiour, in his hand a fanne of fethers, like a demye harlot: Riding thus along by them, casting his eies to and fro, seming by his demenure, as if he had had, a whole common wealth in his head, without any word speaking, Corynus who before had knowne him in the court, and therefore best aquainted with his humor, said vnto him: Gentleman, if I bee not much mistaken you are riding towardes the court, whither (if it please you) wee will be glad to beare you company: Gloriosus bending his browe answered: thou base borne fellowe, what doest thou thinke I would make a companion of thee, a pedling marchant, more fit for a ware house then a princes court: Corynus smiling to himselfe to heare the folly of this vaine headed courtier mildly made answere: Truly sir, I would not presume so far to make my selfe your companion, but I haue knowne right worshipfull Gentle men thus riding by the way, that would haue bene wel pleased with good company: This softe replye wonderfully qualified the fyerse nature of Gloriosus: whose colericke complection was as testy as a goose that hath yong goslinges, yet easy to be pleased againe with a handfull of otes, so after a little more frendly communication had betweene them, they were come to the gallant Citie of Vtica, where they all agreed to rest for that night, and after they were come to the inne, Brusanus desirous to goe visit the monuments of the Citie, and to take a view of the brauery of the buildings, was accompanied by Corynus, Gloriosus keping his lodging as one disdaining to walk the streets with so simple company: but after they had walked themselues wery, and were returned againe to their chamber, Corynus demaunding of a seruant what other strangers were in the house, was answered there were two other, the one a souldiour, called by the name of Martianus, who was newly come from the court, the other called Castus, a countrey man that was trauelling towardes the court: Corynus willed the seruant to intreate them both to come vp, hoping to heare some newes, especially by Martianus, who was come from the court, the which both himselfe and the rest desired. What newes Martianus brought from the court, how the king was missing, and how the courtiers did generally bewaile his losse. Being both come vp into the chamber, after they had beene very frendly wellcomed, Corynus turning to Martianus said, as we vnderstand you are lately come from the court, and we being desirous to heare what noueltyes are newe coined, are to craue so much curtesy at your handes, to make vs partakers of your newes, and for myne owne part, I shall thinke my selfe greatly pleasured, that am accustomed by such particuler platformes, to gather an vniuersall cogniseance either of good or bad: Martianus curtiouslye aunswereed: Truelye Gentlemen the newes at the courte are straunge, yet not so straunge as true, yet not more true then generally lamented by as many as ouer heareth them: Twentye daies are nowe fully expired, sith our most vertuous and noble prince Leonarchus hath beene missed at the courte, no man knoweing what should become of him, neither can it be immagined whether he be dead or aliue, gone he is, search there hath beene, inquiry is daily made euery way, and by all meanes, but no tidinges can be learned more then I haue told you. The lamentable clamours are vniuersall, the graue counsailers sheades their teares for the losse of their prince, the father of their counselers, the very stay and principall piller of all their consultations, the gallant courtiers haue lefte off their costly colours, betaking themselues to mourning hewe, hanging their heades, wringing their handes, lamenting the lacke of him that was a prince to defend them, a father to care for them, a companyon in their pleasures, a frend to reliue their wants, what should I say, the dolefull memory is generally bewailed, some remembring the nobility of his birth, some his peaceable gouernment, some his liberality, some his iustice, mixed with such mercie, some the greatnes of his authority, tempered with such familiar curtesies, that they did more feele the fruites of his clemency, then the pompes of his greatnesse, and all accounting him the father of his people, and the life of the country. The onely comfort that is left them, is the hope they haue receiued of the gratious yong prince Dorestus, who immitating his fathers vertues, and in whome they allready shine so cleere, that it is easy to discerne him to be a blossome of the same braunch, a stemme of the same stocke, and a sonne of the same sire: Tenne daies are ouer passed since (as well by the consent of the counsaile, as by the requestes of the commons in generall) they would haue established him in his fathers seat: but Dorestus more surcharged with sorrow, then couetous of a kingdome, and more fit to furnishe a funerall, then to syt in a princes throne, would in no wise consent to their requestes, vntill hee might heare what was become of his father: But they neuer ceasing their sute, and hee ouer weried with their importunityes, to satisfie their requestes, haue adiorned the day of his crownation for fyueteene daies, if in the meane time they can learne no other tidinges, hee is then content to receiue the diademe, as his proper right and due inheritaunce: I will not further inlarge the seuerall coniectures that are gathered of his absence, some immagininge him to bee priuily murthered, some thinking him secretly vowed to some monestary or other religious house, some thinking so manye thinges, that some knowes not well what to thinke, and yet when they haue all thought, the good king cannot be hard of, neither will I trouble to tell you what seuerall examinations hath beene taken, howe many inquiries hath beene made, and what continuall posting there hath beene through the whole realme, let this suffice, he cannot be found, and it is thought necessary (and that by generall opinion) that there should be a soueraigne gouernour, to redresse wronges, to punish vice, to correct abuse, to maintaine iustice, and to chearish vertue: Dorestus (though against his owne will yet to satisfie their requestes) haue assigned the day of his crownation (as I told you) within fyueteene dayes, whereof there are yet fyue to come, if in the meane time there come no other newes, I haue then breefly told you all the newes. The sorrow Brusanus made to heare this newes, and howe Gloriosus vaunted vpon this report. heere the tale, wherein both Leonarchus the king, and Dorestus his sonne were so vertuously commended, made neither semblaunce of ioy nor griefe, but listening what other men would answere kept himselfe silent: But Brusanus, whose heauy countenaunce bewraid his sodaine passion said: And is it possible that so renowned a king, so vertuous a prince, and so louing a soueraigne, should be thus consumed in his owne realme, nay in his owne court, nay more then that, in his owne priuy chamber, and amongst his owne subiectes, and yet cannot be learned how, well Brusanus thy hap is the harder, thou hast left thy parentes, thy kindred and thy country to become a traueller, thy hope was to haue bettered thine owne experience, by the example of him, whose vertues were so famed through euery nation, but thou findest thy selfe preuented by vniust fortune, and canst thou not draw her freakes to a platforme of thyne owne profit, arme thy selfe against all her assaults, and beware how thou dost heereafter trust her; and esteeme no better of these worldly honours, then as slipperie ioyes, sliding pleasures, and transitory delightes, and thus fixing his heauy eies vppon the ground, he ceased further speach: Gloriosus, who was all this while deuising how to speake wisely, after that he had a little roused himselfe, bending his browes and putting on his terrible countenaunce, said: Well Leonarchus, if thy conspiring enymies, haue shortened thy date, by vntimely cutting of thy thred of life, vnhappy was thy chaunce that Signior Gloriosus was absent, whose prouident eie, to looke into matters of state, is ynough to preuent all trayterous practises, conuey they neuer so closly, whose very lookes are leueled with such auster aspect, that they are able to fray the proudest practiser, from al vnlawful attempts, and these armes, (that are the ministers of my displeasure should I but discontentedly stretch them forth, oh, who were able to abide it, neither strong Sampson amongst his philistians, nor valiaunt Hercules against his vgely monsters, were halfe so terrible as angrie Gloriosus against the troupes of traitors, then Leonarchus, nay, then infortunate Leonarchus, and in nothing so much infortunate, as thus to be sequestred from such a stay to thy state, from such a piller of thy preseruation, and from such a castell of thy comforte, as might haue preuented all perilles, what so euer thou art happined into, after the whole company had a little smiled to themselues, and had much adoe to forbeare open laughter, Corynus said: it may bee sir, you were vnknown to Leonarchus, otherwise he was shrewdly ouer seene, so much to neglect a gentleman of your quality: My frend (answered Gloriosus ) thou dost presse me to fare, I pray thee haue care of thy selfe, and seeke not thine owne dismembring, by to much vrginge my patience, with thy vnseasonable speeches, dost thou thinke Gloriosus could be vnknowne to Leonarchus, when his court hath beene beautified with my presence, and whose pallaces were adorned with my person: No, no, and therefore I tell thee (thou manne of little vnderstandinge) thy woordes are to much preiudicial to the prerogatiue of my reputation, but it pleaseth me to impute thine erroure, to the want of knowledge, so that in beareing with the one, I am contented to pardon the other, and therefore I admonish thee heereafter to take heed how thou dost place thy phrase, to a gentleman of the kings court: Well sir answered Corynus, sith I doe find courtiers to be so captious, you shall see heereafter that I will learne to speake more wiselier, when I haue occation to talke with them, in the meane time, me thinkes heere is a poore man that lookes heauily on the matter: then turning himselfe to Castus, he said, howe nowe my good frend, what newes with you in the country, it seemeth by thy cheare, that all should not be well. The wofull discourse of Castus: what craft in the country amongst Lawyers, and what adiorning amongst maiestrates. mishappe aunswered. Alas sir, a comfortles cause requireth a careful countenance, and a curelesse griefe, a desperate minde, and if my newes be haplesse that I haue brought from the country, so now they be helplesse by that I hear from the court, when we be depriued (as I perceiue) from our good king, the only anker-holde of al my hope, that should haue ministred right to my infinite wronges. And are your wronges such (aunswered Corynus ) that they are not other wise to be remedied, then by the king himselfe, if I be not deceiued, there be lawes in the countrie to determine your right, you haue likewise maiestrates to administer the lawe, in mine opinion your cause wer very strange if it should not be relieued by one or both. Uery true sir (aunswered Castus ) my cause is strange indeede, and yet if I were aswell stored with coyne wherwith to corrupt, as I am furnished with sorrowe whereof to complaine, I needed not haue trauelled to the courte for redresse, neither haue I omitted (so farre as my poore abillitye woulde stretche) both to atempt lawe, and to see aturnies, but mine aduersary is wealthy, and therefore worshipfulll, whose loftye countenance is enoughe to cary out his lewd conscience, and although the lawe in itselfe, intendeth nothing but right, yet as it is ordered by some that hath the handeling of it, it is made the very instrument of wronge, yea the most of them framing their plea therafter as they be feede not according to the truth, and for priuat aduantage, or how many delaies can they forge, from court to court, from day to day, from time to time, yea from yeare to year: then haue they such distinctions, such errours, such demurs, suche quillites, suche shiftes, and so many deceites that the plaintife shal passe a thousand troubles, before he may proceede to one tryall. Oh these golden dumbe shewes are soe mightie in working, that hee that hath them to giue, they will make iudges them selues to become both deafe and blinde. Thus riche men neede speake but a word, and all wil hear them, when poore men may shead their teares but no man pitie them: But after that I had thus tried my selfe in the lawe, I indeuoured by petition to present my cause before the pitilesse maiestrates, but alas ther began my greater miserie. For first euen amongst their base and seely porters I found a peuish pride, and such a scorneful demeanure, that I might not be suffered to stand nere, muchlesse to enter their gates without a bribe, but then againe amongst their clarkes: O what gaping for greater gyftes, and what loking after costly rewardes, the which my pouerty not able to searche vnto, what found I then but coy countenances, currish language,  & other like disdainful demeanure, thus leauing their comfortlesse houses, I was dryuen to giue attendance in the colde streates, where after longe and tedious waiting, the very horsekeepers would shoulder me from their maister, who if perhaps through my pitious exclamations, hee chaunced to cast his head aside, it was either to afright me with his terrible lookes, or vtterly to dismaye mee with his churlish checkes. Thus hauing tryed all, but finding none, to pitie or comforte my distresse, I determined with my selfe to trauell to the court, hoping there to find some gentleman, attendant about his maiesty, that might preferre my sute to the king him selfe, who is accustomed to heare sutors with more expedition, and to keepe them with lesse expences: but alas, I perceiue my purpose is preuented, and I left destitute of all hope for euer to be happy. The aunswere of Martianus, whether it be better for a suter, the courte or country. It is but a bare comfort (answered Martianus ) wher the best choice hath yet assurance of doubtful end, you haue ceast your playnt in the country, to become a sutor in the court, and herein you may be compared to him that goes out of gods blessing into the warme sunne: do you thinke to finde suche curtisie amongst courtiers: you say you go to complaine of a wronge, and peraduenture to him that will giue no man his right, you say you are poore and vnable to giue a fee, but you shall hardly finde him in the courte, that will do any thinge for gods sake: in the country if you found such churlishe regardes, in the courte you shall find as proude lookes: yea the very doorekeepers to these greate men in the courte, will looke for more cappes and curtesies then (I aunswere) you haue bin accustomed vnto, and yet still receiue your obaysance, without any regarde of your busines: but do you complaine of bribing in the country, and would you come empty handed to the courte: where ther is no grace without gold, nor no friend without a fee: and if your aduersarie be wealthy (as you haue saide) and that he be able to sende fiue hundred duccattes on his message, do you not thinke them able to worke wonders in the court as the golden dumbe showes (you speake of) could euer do in the country, yes be sure, they are not onely able to make men blind and deafe, but they wil open his lippes that was dumbe, to present al manner of leasinges, yea for a need before the king himselfe. I am sorie my experience should serue me so well to display the court of Epirus, but he that himselfe hath beene surely prickt, can bid others take heede how they run amongst thorns, and I that haue sped so ill with my courting, can wishe others to beware, how they come thither a sewing, if they be not able to maintaine bribing. It is now thirtie yeares sith I became a souldier, from which time I haue serued the king in alloccations against his enimies in the fielde, the rest of the time I haue continued in his garrisons: in this meane space, I haue spent what my friendes left me, which was something; I haue lost part of my bloud, which was more: and I haue consumed my prime of youth and florishing yeares, which was most: and comforting my selfe with some hope of happy rewarde (for my better helpe now in my declining years) with this resolution I came to the courte, what mony I was able to make, I put it in my pursse to bear my charges: I hauether continued these six monthes, with cappes and curtisies downe to the ground, and some time, may it please your honour, otherwhiles, I beseche your worship, but neither honorable, nor worshipful, that I could find to better my state but I haue sent my mony, & am come away as you see. And yet I muste confesse that for the king himsef, ther was neuer prince yt was more bountiful, nor liberall, nor that hath giuen oftiner or greater rewards. But alas poore king (if without arrogancy I may pitie a king) he hath beene nothing more deceiued then in bestowing his rewards: for being driuen to see with other mens eies, to heare with other mens eares, and to reward by other mens commendations, it is seene that promotion is determined in suche sort, as fancy rather confirmeth the election then discretion, in so much that desert may now go a begging, when al the world is guided by opinion, and many a one hath beene rewarded, & commended by some noble man for his great seruice, that hath but holpe him off with his hose when hee went to bed at night, or peraduenture a ruffesetter, a bottel carier, a newes bringer, a parricite, a flaterer or som other such like minister of his pleasure, and it may be, a bribe giuer, for a hundred aungelles of gold, in such a matter, are of greater vertue, then all the aungelles that be in heauen, yet (as I haue saide) such a one (vpon some noble mans commendations) shall receiue greater recompence, then the man of good deserte indeede, of any condition or qualitie what soeuer: so that in the courte, pleasinge of humours, is found to be most profitable, where a foole shal glorie of more fauour, then a wise man of acceptance. But I pray you sir (aunswered Corynus ) why did you not make your request to the king himselfe, who as it shold seem by your owne wordes, is forwarde enoughe, to recompence wel doing. Uery true (answered Martianus ) and to the king himselfe I presented my sute, who with most gratious promises, and comfortable speeches, willed mee to commit my cause to some noble man, that might commende it to his maiestie and get my dispatche: but alas, our daintie nobles are soe dangerous to bee spoke with all, that it is wel if in a monthes waiting, you may attaine to three words speaking: for some times if I met them in merry talke with my betters, my petitions came then out of season to interrupt their pleasures, an other time if I met anye of them solitarie by himselfe, my lord was then in some melancolly moode and out of time to be spoken with all: thus betweene mirth and melancolly, poore sutors maye longe inough watch their seasons, yet neuer finde them in season to do them any good: but could I once againe haue come to the presence of the kinge, I woulde haue made no doubt, of that recompence that now I neuer looke after. And why so (answered Corynus ) if Dorestus be the man that he is taken for, good deserte canne neuer goe vnrewarded, god forbid hee shoulde sit in his fathers seate, if he should neglect his fathers vertues. Corynus, Martianus, and Castus, are arrested of treason and brought to the court to the young prince Dorestus, there to be tried. himselfe to be well furnished with suffitient matter to picke a thanke (when he came to the courte) but specially of these last words spoken by Corynus, god forbid that Dorestus should sit in his fathers seate) went presently to the criminall iudge of the cittie, charginge him in the behalfe of the younge prince Dorestus, to apprehend, both Corynus, Martianus, and Castus, and to see them brought to the court as traitors, where he himselfe would be ready to auouch against them, treson to the king, slaunder to his courte, and infamie to his whole gouernment, this saide, without any longer stay, he tooke his iorney towardes the prince (with greate expedition) intending to aggrauate the matter as much as might be, the rather to win himselfe reputation, in performing soe notable a peece of seruice, (as he supposed this would fall out to be) the maiestrates vnderstanding Gloriosus to be a courtier, hearing his words to importe a matter of treson, and as it was thought the king being so long missing, was brought to some casualtie by the practise of treson, accompanied therefore with some conuenient number he came to the Inne where he arested the foresaid three of treason, and although the apprehension in this manner was some amasement to their mindes, yet it was most strange to Corynus to be thus taken for a traytor to the king, but after that he had a while deliberated what mighte be the matter, hee requested the Offycer to let him vnderstande, whether it were by direction, information, or what other instruction he had thus to apprehende them, the other aunsweared, sir you shall finde mine owne authority suffycient to arrest a traytor, for the rest what there is farther to charge you withall, you shall vnderstand at your comming to the younge Prince Dorestus, before whome I mind presently to bring you: and hauing a suffycient company to guard them, forwards they go, the prisoners euery one comforting himself, knowing his own coscience to be clere. Brusanus that had giuen good heede to euery accidente, and perceiuing by the former circumstances that Corynus, Martianus and Castus were meere strangers the one to the other, thought it therfore impossible that there should be any compact of treason betweene them, and hauinge a speciall likinge to Corynus, desirous to see what might fal out against him he followed him, who when he had ouertaken, he proffered any courtesy wherein a stranger might steede him, whether with his traueil or his purse, they were both at his commaundemente: Corynus againe in as greate a league of likinge towardes Brusanus, and desirous to do him some honor, before he should leaue the country, requested him to accept of a prisoners thankes, and that he woulde not leaue his company, till, it was determined what should become of him, to which request Brusanus very willingly agreed vnto: they traueil so long that they come to the courte, where Gloriosus was attending and had quickely certified the Prince of their arriuall, who commaunded that the prisoners should be safely kept vntill the next morninge, when himselfe would be ready to heare their cause. Dorestus sitteth in iudgement, Gloriosus accuseth Castus. The next day, hee beeing accompanied with the nobles that were in the court: came into the common place of Iustice, vsualy called by the name of The house of reformation. This house of reformation, was a very large roome, wher the kings of Epirus, in the auncient time were accustomed personally to sit, at the least three times euery weeke, to heare suters and to dispatch, all manner of causes and controuersies, that were betweene their subiectes, and to minister Iustice, to as many as were to demaund it: and in this house of reformation it waseuer accustomed, that if there wer many suters, the complaints of the poore were euer heard, before the requestes of the rich: The Prince being come to this place, after that hee had geuen reuerence to the throne of maiesty, wherein his father had bene accustomed to sit, then sitting himselfe downe in the next seat, the noblemen likewise euery one takinge his place: the prisoners were brought to the bar, where Gloriosus was likewise ready to informe, but before they did proceede to the hearing of the matter, the younge Prince deliuered these wordes: They make themselues guilty of great iniustice, who beeing appointed of God to persecute the wicked with the swoorde drawne, will yet keepe their handes cleane from bloude, whereas the wicked in the meane time commits all manner of sin, and that vncontrouled: and it is no lesse cruelty to punishe no offence, then not to forgiue any, the one beeing an abuse of clemency, the true ornament of a Soueraigne, and the other to turne authority into tyranny: neuerthelesse maiestrates in the execution of Iustice, ought to take great heede least by ouer great seuerity, they hurt more then they heale, for the seate of a Iudge that is too seuere seemeth to bee a gibbet alreadye erected, wee must then diligently note, that as it is the duety of all maiestrates, to chastice and to punish euery malefactor, so likewise they must beware, least vnder pretence of exercising Iustice, they fall into an other kinde of iniustice through ouer-much rigour, for too much seuerity, causeth men to be misled for cruelty, and belongeth rather to a beastly and sauuage nature, then to the nature of man: for clemency & compassion, neuer ought to be seperated from a good and iust sentence, which is to holde small faultes excused, or but lightly to punish them (prouided allway that iustice be not violated) for as the wise man saith, that it was ill to be subiect to a Prince vnder whome nothinge was tollerated, but worse where all thinges were left at randon. Let vs learne therefore for the conclusion of our discourse, so to vse iustice with mediocrity, that neither we learne to ouer much seuerity, nor yet may be ledd by too much lenity. Dorestus hauinge thus ended his exhortation, the whole company that heard it, were wonderfully delighted, some extollinge hys vertue, and other commending this his proceedinge: after a silence commaunded and that euery man was husht: Gloriosus was willed to say what he had to inferre against the prisoners, and accordinge to the custome of the place, Castus cause was first to be examined, hee was therefore willed to stande foorth, and Gloriosus commaunded to procede in that he had to charge him: who after he had first cleered his throat, then castinge vp his eyes to the roofe of the house, he discoursed thus: I shall not neede (gratious Prince) to traueil much by circumstances, or to vse many wordes, to make my proofe the better against this wretched worme of the worlde, my credite beeinge such here in the court, the testimony might seeme sufficient, that Gloriosus hauing spoke the word, it shoulde not bee gainesayde: to come to the purpose, as mine eares then glowed to heare, so my hart now panteth to thinke, what hatefull speeches were pronounced by this vnhappy man Castus, so exclaiming of the lawyers, so cryinge out against the maiestrate; so slaunderinge of them both, as though there were neither law nor iustice to bee hadd within the whole dominions of Epirus: the which beeing waid in a due consideration, is not a little staine to your worthy fathers gouernement. Stay there Gloriosus (saide the Prince Dorellus ) I must not suffer you to mince the matter so fitte to your purpose, for it is not the Princes fault, if Iustice bee not ministred, when hee hath appointed maiestrates for the same purpose, but it is his blame if he deferre punishment when hee vnderstandeth the contrary, the rest of your woordes importe no other matter then an exclamation made by this poore man against the maiestrates, and perhaps for wante of Iustice, but whatsoeuer bee the cause, it resteth in himselfe to auoide the crime, for as the soueraigne Prince, acknowledgeth after God none greater then himself, so the maiestrate holdeth his power after god of the souraigne prince, priuat men must therefore acknowledge both the prince and maiestrate, euery one in his place of iurysdiction with all honour and reuerence: Speake then Castus, what hast thou to alleadge in thine owne excuse, for these matters imposed against thee heere by Gloriosus. Castus answereh for himselfe The poore man being altogether surprised with an incounter of feare and griefe, was not able to speake one woorde, but wringing his handes, hanging downe his head, and casting his eies in such sort, as who should say, alasse, if my cause be not to be pittied what should it auaile me to aunsweare: but the good Prince obseruing his demeanure, and minding to cut off his timerous silence, spake to him as followeth: My good friend, let not this courtly presence, dismay thy countrey plainnesse, but comfort thy selfe with hope of this place: which distinguisheth no persons either by fortunes faune: or pouerties frowne, neither yet to measure the person by his wealth, but iustly to prase the equity of his cause, mercy and iustice are the meanes, wher with I minde to temper my proceedinges, but yet in such mediocrity as the one shall not be confounded in the other: persuade thy selfe therefore that thou shalt be heard with equitye, and therfore spare not, but comfort thy selfe, and speake boldly. When the prince with his incouragement had set the poore mans tongue at liberty, he framed his complaint in this order: It is truth (most gratious prince) that twenty yeares are fully ouer passed since my father deceased, in his life time called by the name of Codron, and after his death, leauing me his heire to a poore country cottage, yet seated in a most pleasant orchard, planted (by my said father) in the prime of his youth, yet alas in a most infortunate soile, though happy inough, both for the serenity of the aire, and fertility of the ground, but onely vnhappy in that it was seated to neere an ill neighbour, for but on the other side of the hedge, there dwelt a gentleman whose liuing is great, whose credite is much, whose conscience is least, whose name is Signior Orlando, whoe hauing manye times taken suruey of my poore plot, the frutes whereof yeelded the greatest reliefe wherewith to sustaine my selfe, my wife and children (but that which poore men take for their profites, is vsed of gentlemen but for their pleasures) and thinking how commodious it lay for his house, hee was many times in hand with me to haue bought the inheritaunce, the which I as often denayd him, being the onely succorse that I had to repose in, but after that, o how many quarrels were pickt vpon small occasion, how was I berated if a chicken had but flyen ouer the hedge, the legges of my cattell were broken, if they strayed but foorth of mine owne gates, yea my selfe was euerye daye threatned by his seruauntes, that in the ende gladd to curry fauour, I came vnto him desiring his freendship: offeringe him my orcharde for his pleasure to walke in at all times, and to make a way through his owne ground, for his better passage, and for some part of the fruit that he best liked off for his own eatinge, and my selfe at his commaundement to doo him any seruice that I coulde, but all this woulde not serue, there was nothinge would please him, but the whole possession of mine orchard, the which in the ende hee desired but for three yeares, and in the meane space to geue an annuall rent, and although in very troth, I was not contented, yet glad to winne his fauour I agreed, thinking to beare the brunt for so small a time, the which in deed, I might the better haue done, if he had paid me the rent he promist, but I had no sooner giuen him place, voiding my selfe into a little roome not far of, but mine orchard was inclosed with a mighty ditch, seueralde into his owne ground, but for the rent that was promised, although his three yeares are more then three times expired, the day is yet to come that euer I could receiue groat, to conclude, he not onely with holdeth my rent, but hee likewise holdeth me out of my house, and against all right, hath kept me out of my owne, these tenne yeares: I cannot denie but in this meane time I haue attempted lawe, but I must confesse it is to my great charge, for his great store of crownes so ouer weied my right amongst the lawiers, that in foure yeares suing, I could not bring my cause to one daies hearing, but should I say nowe after I had bine thus cosined amongst the lawiers, o no, I perceiue it is offenciue, let me then say thus, after I had bine consumed amongst them, and that I was not longer able to see them, I made my complaint to the maiestrates, but if it bee a fault to say I found them pitilesse, I humbly craue pardon (most gratious prince) for this is all that Signior Gloriosus is able to charge me with. Gloriosus accuseth Martianus, who answereth his accusation. The poore man hauing thus finished his speache, was willed to stand by, and Gloriosus was now to inferre against Martianus, who proceeded in this wise. Although I haue founde by the art of Logique, learned by the rules of Rethorique, and gathered by the preceptes of philosophy, what vnnecessarie members these souldiers are in a well gouerned state (in so much that many wise men deemeth them worthy of nothing then not to be) yet with all the learning I haue gathered out of my libraries, with al the examples I haue seene in my perigrinations, with all the experiments I haue founde in the courte, nor with all the art that is in my head, the verye stoore-house of wisdome, and from whence whole fountaines, nay huge flouds of eloquence doth continually abounde, yet (as I haue saide) al this will not serue me, to reiterate the wordes pronounced in disgrace of the whole courte of Epirus, by this man of little reputation, I meane this souldier. His sentences, althoughe not artificially couched, yet strained after afulsome manner, to the very full sea marke of reproche, his phrases very harshe, but more spitefull, his wordes vnaptly placed, yet according to the literall sence, all applied to a malitious purpose, I could heare distinguish vpon euery sillable, and (I giue god thankes for it) I could (according to art) make diuision of his whole speeches into seuerall partes, & so examine the maior and minor, of al his arguments, as I might refell his propositions, and vtterly deny his allegations: But this is inoughe for Signior Gloriosus to conclud, Martianus hath distained the courte with slaunder, and must clense it againe with the price of his bloud. The young gallantes of the courte, that stoode by and had ouer-hearde all, wonderfully commended Gloriosus, protesting, that he had spoken very wisely, thinking him a very meet ma to be a counceller, but ye yong prince Dorestus said as followeth. So farre as I can perceiue Gloriosus, your learning is more then the matter where-with you haue charged Martianus, the some of all your eloquence concerneth a slaunder to ye court, but how or in what manner there it stil resteth, but say Martianus, what occation hath led thee to speake ill of the place: Martianus aunswered thus. Most gratious prince, if in my words I shall not obserue that reuerence that I know is apertinente to this presence, I most humbly craue pardon, and the rather for that my bringing vp hath not beene so muche to directe my speeches to princes in their pallaces, as to souldiers in the fieldes: to annswere then to the matter where-with Gloriosus hath charged me, the beginning of whose tale is so spiced with such a deale of learning, that I know not what to say to it, wherby I perceiue many courtiers to be much more fruitefull then haares, for as it is saide, when they haue beene at bucke, within fortie daies after they lytter there leuerites, then againe they goe proude, are conceiued, and all at an instant: but these goe proude euery day in the weeke, waxe great with learning before they conceiue it, and are deliuered of the full burthen of their wit, at the least fortie weekes before it is begotten. Many wise men (saith Gloriosus ) soe condemneth souldiers, as they forbid him to haue place in a well gouerned state: and I neuer hearde yet, but an honest souldier, was a more profitable member to his country, then any vaine headed courtier: whose gentry (as it is written) comes from their parentes; whose wealth, is the haruest of their flattery; whose victories, are the fruits of their souldiers: for the first, them selues blot with their vices; the second, they consume with their vanitie, the last, is attributed to more then them selues, I can compare a courtier to nothing better then an ape, which no man would keepe but to procure laughter, and the vse of the courtier, is all for pleasure, nought for profite. It is further inferred againste me by this man of little wit, (this courtier I meane) how slaunderous I haue beene to the whole courte of Epirus; I can not make so learned a demonstration of the matter as Gloriosus hath done, but according to a souldiers capacitie, I will shewe you by example: suppose I should say (as I trust I shal neuer haue cause to thinke) yt Gloriosus the courtier wer a very wise man, now, you must vnderstande this (according to the interpretation of Gloriosus ) to bee spoken in ye comendation of the whole court, & wher my propositio includeth but a perticuler person he wold infer a general coclusion. May it please your Grace nowe to vnderstand, I haue serued your (most renowned Father) these thirtie years as a Souldier, and comforting my self with some hope of reward, to help me now in mine elder yeares. I came to the Court, where I became a suter, but those eies that looke into all proceedings, and are watchfull onely to their owne profites, and loath that any fat should bee licked from their owne fingers, will suffer no good turne to passe which they can hinder, neither can I denie (most gracious Prince) but in lamenting mine owne misfortune, that haue bene so long a suter, that I am now become a begger: I haue complained that so many drones grating on the princes purse, shold eat vp the hony from those that best deserue it. For the punishment of mine trespasse, I humbly appeale to your gracious clemency, for I perceiue, if Gloriosus were my Iudge, no lesse would content him, then the price of the bloud in my belly, for a peniworth of slander to his person. I will not tell you heere, into what a pelting chase Gloriosus was driuen into vpon these speaches: I pray you imagin, that he was wonderfully angry, and kept such a stur vpon the matter, that there was no rule with him, till in the end the prince himselfe willed him to holde his peace like a foole. Wel quoth Gloriosus, sith your Grace speakes so gently vnto mee, I am contented at your intreatie to bear with the matter, otherwise I protest by Iupiter himselfe, he goes not vpon two legs (if he beare the name of a souldier) but I would haue made him to haue repented this presumption nine hundred yeares hence. Gloriosus accuseth Corynus of treason against Dorestus, the circumstances wherof are briefly laid open by Brusanus. After the gentleman had bene in this sort qualified, he was willed to infourme what hee had against Corynus, and in this wise hee beganne to tell his tale. Your Grace hath alreadye heard by that is past, howe infamous the first hath beene vnto the Countrey Magistrate: The second hath not feared to slander the court: but this third, in plain tearmes, hath presumed to touch your owne person. The circumstances are but short, and thus followeth the wordes: God forbid that Dorestus should sit in his fathers seat: the sence is plaine, and I will once againe repeat the wordes: God forbid, that Dorestus should sit in his fathers seat. Let mee see now what glose can they set to this text? what ifs or ands can they patch to these speaches, to alter the sence from high Treason? The whole company that stood by beganne altogether to crie treason, treason, treason: but silence being commaunded, Corynus was willed to speake for himselfe: who in this sort aunswered. Prince Dorestus, Sophocles the Tragedian, being accused before the magistrates of dotage, repeated vnto them his Tragedy of Oedipus Coloneus, (which at that instant he had made) so that his accusers confounded in their owne ouerweening, departed with a shameful repulse. So I am likewise accused of treason, and I am willed to make mine answere: see heere worthy Prince, this wrinckled face, which many yeares hath withered, & should betoken staidnes: beholde these hoarie hairs, whose color time hath changed, & should cary some experience: and although by experience, I could answer in other circumstances, yet I hope this shal aswel find grace to cleer me of treason, as the Tragedy of Sophocles to acquite him of dotage. This answere seemed confused to the multitude, but the prince Dorestus who had marked the graue aspectes of this antient man Corynus, gathered a further meaning of his wordes then the rest could wel conceiue, and whether it were by som secret instincte of nature, or what other motion if was that moued him, he fell into a most affectionat liking of Corynus, but Brusanus that had stand by all this while, pressing forth said as followeth: Let not a strangers presumption breed offence, (worthy prince Dorestus ) that opposseth himselfe vncald for, to testifie a truth, and although the matter that I pretende might craue long discourse, aduised purpose, and seemely conueyaunce, yet the rare vertues which I see to accompany your calling, the singuler iustice that I see to carry your proceedinges, shall make me be the lesse tedious: My selfe (noble prince) being led with delight to behold strange Cities, to discouer vnknown places, & to better mine own experience, haue left my natiue country, and betaken my selfe to pretenced trauell, and bycause I will leaue nothing which the necessity of the cause inforceth me to open, though (peraduenture) (in a curtous conceit my wordes might smel of flattery) true it is that the renowne I haue hard of this country of Epirus, the wisdome of the Prince that gouerned it, the wise men that inhabite it, the true Iustice that ruleth it: though one of them were sufficient to moue admiration, yet the most of them haue directed my trauell into this country, and bendinge my iourney towardes this place, by the way I ouertooke this merchant Corynus: After salutations passed betweene vs, wee had not rid far but wee were likewise ouertaken by this Gloriosus, what speaches past between vs, bicause they are neither fitting to our purpose, nor necessary for the place, I will therefore omit them, but on we rid all together to the Citie of Vtica, where determining to rest our selues, in our lodging we met these other two Martianus and Castus: Martianus being new come from the court (as himselfe reported) was the first that gaue vs to vnderstand of the king your fathers missing, Castus on the other side was traueling towardes the court (and as it should seeme) to seeke for iustice, but now discouraged by these late newes, Martianus againe relating his cause (as euen nowe before this presence) concluded likewise his little hope, to attaine recompence for longe seruice, marke nowe (vertuous prince) for heere is the point of all this treason: Corynus that had ouer hard all, comforted the poore man in these speeches: It were pitie my frend (said Corynus ) that good desert should goe vnrewarded, and god forbid that Dorestus should sit in his fathers seat, and neglect his fathers vertues: I could farther enlearg touching the premisses, but what should I need, when I finde your owne vertue (worthy Prince) more sufficient to consider of euery necessary circumstance, then mine own little skill is able to deliuer it. Brusanus is discouered to be the Prince of Hungaria, a combination of freendship betweene Dorestus and him. In this meane time that Brusanus was thus discoursinge, a gentleman in the company that sometimes had beene in the courte of Hungaria, whisperinge in the Princes eare, assured him that the party which presented that speech, was Brusanus, the onely sonne of Myletto king of Hungaria: the which when Dorestus vnderstood, taking the better suruay of the man, and listening more attentiuely to his speeches, although hee were wonderfully delighted with his woordes, yet hee was a greate deale better pleased with his personage, and hauinge finished his tale, Dorestus requested Brusanus to tell his name, and what countreyman he was, Brusanus aunsweared, sir, I was borne in Hungaria, a gentleman by birth, and by name Brusanus: It is not vnlikely (quoth Dorestus ) that Brusanus, the Prince of Hungaria, should be any lesse then a gentleman, and if there be no other occasion then I can imagine, Brusanus can be no lesse then welcome to Dorestus. Brusanus seeing himselfe to be thus discouered, briefly made aunsweare: and Brusanus desireth no greater contentment, then to be an assured frend to Dorestus. Dorestus then arisinge from his seate, and incountring with Brusanus saide: and in token of perpetuall amitye with Brusanus, Dorestus heere giueth his hande, and biddeth Brusanus most hartely welcome: the one of them then imbracinge the other, with more then ordinary affection, the whole company wer delighted to see the courteous demeanure of these two gallant yong Princes: but aboue the rest Corynus especially reioyced at the sighte, for knowinge now that Brusanus was the Prince of Hungaria, commended him in his imagination to be the most rare and towardly young Prince that liued. Dorestus procedeth to iudgement, he maketh choyce of Corinus to direct him in his counsayles. After the two Princes had one the other thus entertained. Dorestus willing a seat to be prepared, caused Brusanus to sit downe next vnto himselfe: and being thus setteled: Dorestus mindinge to proceede in iustice, deliuered these woordes: The Office of a good Prince is to defende the common wealth, to helpe the innocent, to aide the simple, to correct the offender, to relieue the poore, to honour the vertuous, to punishe the vitious, to bridell the ambitious, and by iustice to geue euery one his owne: and common wealthes are not lost, for that Princes liue in pleasure, but because they haue no care of iustice, neither do people murmure, when the Prince doth recreate his person, but when he is slacke to redresse wrongs. O that princes did know what it were to take charge of a kingdome, hee should find that to be iust in himselfe, were honour to his person, but to minister iustice, is profite to the whole commonwealth: it is not therefore inough for him to be vertuous in his owne person, but he is also bound to root al vices from amongst his people: But what profite is it for a prince himselfe to bee honest, and those that should administer iustice vnder him to be dissolute, For a prince to bee true, and his officers false, for a prince to be gentle and his officers cruell: And hath it not ben often knowen, that where the prince himselfe hath bene carefull, those that he hath put most in trust, haue bene negligent: I will for a time dissemble some thinge of mine owne knowledge, when we shall neede no other president at this time, then the complainte of this poore man Castus, in redresse of whose cause I do heere decree, that Orlando shall speedily restore him again to his house and orchard, and for the annuall rente that was concluded on betweene them, he shall restore it him foure fold, and that for so many yeares as are behinde. I doe further ordaine, that the Lawyers which haue taken his money, and not ending his cause, shall repay it double: the magistrate likewise that denied him iustice, I doe heere discharge him from bearing office, and for the small regarde that hee hath had to the complaint of the poore, I doe ceaze him at fiue hundred pound fine, to bee distributed to the reliefe of the poore. For thee Martianus that hast serued so long a souldier, it is not requisite, that the vertue of valiancy should goe vnrewarded, for good souldiers must be cherished, and in respect of thy long seruice, and to comfort thee now in thy latter yeares, I doe heere bestow vpon thee three hundred crowns, that shall presently be paid vnto thee, and I doe further giue thee a pension of three hundred crownes by the yeare, to bee paid vnto thee during thy naturall life. Corynus, I doe heere acquite thee of treason, thy wordes rather proceeding of honest affection: but if thou hast committed a fault, it touched but my selfe, and good Princes ought not so much to reuenge their own iniuries, as to defend those that are iniuried: Hee should pardon wrongs that are done to his own person, but reuenge the least ill that is committed against the Common-wealth: and for mine owne part, since I came to the state of discretion, I haue euer had two things before mine eies, which is, not to reuenge with rigour vpon mine enemies, nor to bee vnthankfull to my friends: and as it becommeth a good Prince, to haue more regard to the benefit of his Countrey, then to the delights of his person: yet for that they are often times negligent in manie things, not so much for that they haue no desire to fore-see, as because there are none that dare warne them. I wil that from hence forward thou be attendant about me, my selfe allowing thee a sufficient stipend for thy maintenaunce: thy office shall be to giue me counsaile in all my affaires, and to aduertise me of such faults and imperfections as thou shalt see to appeare in me, and if thou shalt see me to neglect my fathers proceedings, I will that thou shalt reprooue me: and although there be many others, by whome I am counsailed by, yet amongest them all, I reserue my selfe to be familiar with thee, hoping by thy graue lookes, that thou wilt not aduise mee in any thing that shall not redound aswell to my honour as to my profite. The whole company did wonderfully commend this censure of the prince, some noting his iustice, some his curtesie, some his liberality, others his clemency: but Corynus in this manner addressed his speech. As your Graces authority to commaund, is full of vertue, wisedome, and grauity: so it belongs to me to obay with diligence, trueth, and fidelity, esteeming it much to my reputation to bee commaunded by your Grace, in whose proceedings there is so great a testimony of vertue: and because to princes and great Lords, wee must minister our reasons by weight, and giue our words by mesure: yet because your wisdome deemeth it so reasonable to be aduertised, I beseech you turne not that to presumption that I shall present by duty and office, and if my wordes shall derogate in any thing from your honour: let my profession suffer indignity, by which I hold the countenance of my reputation: and so I will wade no further in protestation, because great offers are oftener performed in words than deeds. Dorestus seeketh to deferre his establishmente in the kingdome, Corynus aduiseth him not to refuse it. These premises thus concluded, euerye man remained satisfied, Dorestus himselfe excepted, whose minde was still molested, with the memorie of his father, and whose spirites were dayly troubled with this that now insueth. You haue partly heard that when Leonarchus was missing from the court, and that after all meanes of inquiry had beene made after him and could not yet be heard of, it was desired by a generall requeste, that Dorestus (according to his right) shoulde presently be crowned king, and although at that very instant it was deferred by Dorestus, yet by their generall importunitie, he consented within fifteene daies to satisfie their desires, to the which request he the rather graunted for that hee hoped in the meane time to heare some newes of his father, thirteene of the fifteene daies are exspired, & Dorestus to giue a longer time, vseth these wordes. O what trust may be hoped for in this flattering worlde, whose custome is with a little gold to mixe a greate deale of drosse, vnder a resemblance of trueth, it leades into many deceites: and to ouer fewe and short delightes, it ioynes infinite griefes and displeasures, to whome it showes most fauoure, in him is most perril and destruction: and the alurements of the world are but baites to beguile such as bite at them, when princes them selues are so farre deceiued, for where they are thought to haue open liberty, they are kept in secrete prison: when it is thoughte they haue al things, alas they haue nothing: when they ar thought in greatest safetie, then are they sonest assaulted with perill: so that truly we may bouldly say, that he alone that is shut in the graue, is in safegarde from the vnconstancy of fortune: consider (I beseche you) my, cause of griefe, and if you shal find my complaintes to be more then ordinarie, you shall see the occasion to be no lesse then extreame: but haue your selues forgotten whome you haue lost, remember, remember Leonarchus your king what he was towardes you, how mercifully he gouerned you, how fatherly he loued you, how carefully he preserued you, and how cherely he cherished you, and woulde you now with such speede establishe an other in his place till it bee assuredly knowen what is become of himselfe: O god forbid that either you should be so vngratfull, or that Dorestus should be so vnnaturall, and if you should thus forget your Prince, it might be thought you were more in loue with his fortune then with himselfe, and a small showe of hearty good will whome you seemed so much to honour in his presence, that you shoulde so sodainely forget in his absence: But if euer you loued your Prince now publishe your gratfulnesse that it may bee seene to the worlde: and leaue off to make further request in a matter that so much concerneth your owne reproch & my dishonor. Corynus, who onely adressed himselfe to answere, said as followeth: Although it might be deemed, a signe of little wit and great folly, for a man to answere sudainely to euery proposition, yet for as much as it hath pleased your grace to admit me to speake, and remembring with what deuotion you requested me to doe it. I am bound in like affection, with all humility to obay you: It is not vnknowne vnto vs the cause you haue of griefe, but if you may lament the losse of a louing father, we haue no lesse reason to sorrowe for the want of a gratious soueraigne, yet seeing the chaunces of mortall creatures, do shewe that all men are subiect to the lawe of nature and fortune, and albeit (there is no doubt) but that your father might be a worthy prince, and there with al replenished with euery condition appertaining to the vertue, and condition of a king, yet since in his creation he brought with him a subiection to worldly casualtyes, I thinke your wisedome is too much, to make that greuous to you, which nature ordaineth common to all, when there is nothing happened to your father, otherwise then god hath determined, who no sooner had created his body, but he both directed the course of his life, and ordained the time of his death, for god hauing made all mortall things, hath authority to dispose them, euen with the same power wherewith hee hath created them, reseruing onely to himselfe imortality, so that we must confesse, that all thinges are guided and gourned by the prouidence of god, who knoweth and ordereth casuall thinges necessaryly, and although in your father there was fully filled, the patterne of a good prince, you can not in better sort expresse your zeale, then to suffer god to haue his will without grudge, let my wordes therefore but intimate thus much, that as you cannot recall againe those that be absent, so you must not bee carelesse of those that be present, and as no man is bound to those that are dead, yet euery man must giue succours to them that are aliue: you are left heere the right inheritour to the crowne of Epirus, and by no other meanes then god himselfe hath appointed, refuse not then Dorestus, that intercession of thy subiectes, which is so much desired for their comfortes and thine honour. Dorestus what he replied, Corynus the merchant is become Leonarchus the king, the ioy that was made for his recouery briefly made this answere, dost thou call it honour Corynus, to put my father from his crowne, he is vnworthy to haue honour, that by infamous meanes will seeke after it, and the child that will vniustly take his fathers honor, ought to loose his life, but if thou hadest so great regard to those vaine prehemineces or honorable dignities, lookd after by ambitious mindes, o how much shouldest thou haue respected mine honesty, which is the very first step (indeed) to win honour, and without the which wee can attaine to no better then vaine glory, which is but a false shadowe of true vertue, the liberty I gaue thee to speake, contained things indifferent, neither vnmete to be required, nor worthy to be denaid, perswading altogether to beare more respecte to my frendshipe, then remembraunce to my calling: the which sith thou hast neglected, I doe once againe admonish thee heereafter to be more circumspect, and as thou tenderest my good will, to be better aduised what thou speakest, Corynus immediately answered thus: Well Dorestus if Leonarchus hath left thee a sorrowfull sonne, thou hast made Leonarchus a most ioyfull father: then sitting himselfe downe in the seat of maiestie, he further said: it were but in vaine longer to conceale that, the knowledge whereof (I perceiue) would turne to so great comfort. See heere Dorestus, the instabilitie of fortune, I was euen now a prisoner, then a Counsailer, nowe a king, and all at an instaunt. Dorestus, who by this time had taken a better suruay of this counterfeit marchaunt, and hauing nowe gathered assured knowledge who it was, falling down on both his knees before him, he cried aloud, God saue Leonarchus, my most redoubted king and father: The test of the Nobility, with the whole assembly there present, altogether cried out, God saue the king, God saue the king: Doe you not thinke this sodaine alteration bred as great admiration: yes I can assure you, and it likewise broght with it no lesse contentation, for euery man reioyced in the recouery againe of their good king, but Brusanus, both wondred and triumphed in his owne imagination, to see the accident how strangly it fell out. Gloriosus amongest the rest, seeing the marchant (whome hee had aceused of treason) sitting vnder the cloath of estate, and remembring otherwise howe hee had handled him in speeches, was halfe out of loue with his owne wit: but after a conuenient pause, that silence was commaunded, the king in this wise beganne to discourse. Leonarchus discourseth what experience he hath gathered in his late traueiles, and first of the infections of his owne Court. As it is the nature of vice, to put on a vizard, & to disguise and couer it selfe with those shewes that belong only vnto vertue and being thus clothed with the helpe of corruptible pleasures, it yoaketh base minded men (whose care is onelie set vpon the desire of earthly thinges) which it presenteth before their eies as their felicity, seeking to defend it selfe by reason, which although they bee altogether vaine and friuolous, yet of great waight, in regard of the weake flesh of man, which easily suffereth it selfe to be a bondslaue to sinne: we are therefore to take good heed, that wee suffer not our selues to be surprised by so dangerous an enemie, nor to giue him any accesse or entrance into vs. To know then the causes of euils, is the readiest way to cure them, for a disease known is halfe cured, and many kingdomes are brought to ruine by diuerse causes, which if they were knowen to their princes and gouernours, they might easily be preuented by prouidence and reason. The prince that is carefull to see and enquire for the damages of his Realme, it may be said (if he prouide not for them) that he can doe no more, but to him that is negligent to learne them (if he doe not prouide) it may be said he will doe no more. This hath bene the cause that thus disguised as you see, I haue traueiled through mine owne dominions to see the demeanures of my subiects, that by gathering a platforme of common report, I might be the better able to reform a common mischiefe; for the surest Counsailers that belongeth to a prince, be his own eies and his eares, which must bee alwaies vigilaunt: and it is not decent, that Princes should be Lordes ouer many, and should communicate priuately but with few. By my traueile in the Countrey I haue bettered my experience, to learne the follies of mine owne Court, and omitting to speake of many alterations, I will but onely glaunce at the superfluitie of this our present age, wherein al kind of excesse, riot, weltering in pleasures, curiositie in apparell, perfumes, frisling of haire, not vsed so much amongst women, as practised daily amongst vaine men. Should I speake here what intemperance is vsed in diet what curious dishes deuised for appetite: nay, what filthy conceits to prouoke beastly desire, what seuerall sortes of eates to furnish forth a banket, what exces & superfluity, both in meats and drinks, it were to much for me to tel, and to shamefull for you to heare. In the first ages, the Hebrues vsed to eate but once a day, which was at diner, so the Gretians vsd but only to sup, for this cause wee read, that Plato being demaunded whether he had seene any strange thinge in Sicilia, answered hee had found a monster in diet, which did eate twice a day, happy then might those daies be accounted, that esteemed not of any thinge more then was needefull, but where as wee haue but hitherto looked into the vanity of their attire, and the curiosity in their diets, with their externall follies, let vs nowe but a little consider of the inward disposition of their minds, and we shal find that the whol sort of them are desirous of reputation, but by what meanes doe they speake it, by flattering of Princes, by soothing of great men, by pleaseing of humors, by carrieng of newes, and other like seruile demeanures, not fit for an honest minde to apply it selfe vnto, true honour (indeed) is by no other meanes to bee atchiued, then by vertuous indeuoures: As for those honours that depend vppon the bare oppinion of Princes as they take their begining without desert, so they haue their ending againe at an instant: But as I haue gathered by this souldier Martianus, (in a discourse that hee made, before wee came to this place) Princes that are constrained to relye on other mennes reportes, must vse greate diligence, to discerne flatterers, and disguisers of matters, and must likewise vse no lesse circumspection, in bestowing of offices, and giuing rewardes: Princes many times giues preferment to their frendes to recompence their frendship, other whiles to their seruantes to requite their seruices, and although it might bee said that many Princes doe erre in distributing their offices, yet they doe not erre, for that they would erre, yea, and many times it is seene in cases of promotion, high offices and dignities are rather bought with money, then deserued by vertue: where in time past, there was no man areared to honour, but hee that deserued it: In former adges, men of science were searched for in strang countries, but now, though they knocke at our gates, they are not suffered to enter, no our corruption and custome drawes vs to other delightes: This court in elder adge was counted a receptacle of wise men, but nowe the common harbour for parasites and flatterers, but as no vermine breedes where they find no warmth, no vultures stoope where they smell no pray, no flies swarme where they see no fleshe, no pilgrime creepes where there is no crosse, so there is no parasit will lurke where hee findes no gaine, and therefore doe flatterers praise vs, bycause they would price vs, but I wonder that these great men that haue authority in the courtes of Princes should bee so generally seduced by flatterers, and so vsually carried awaye, by these creeping parasites: But beinge instructed as I am, I doubte not but ere manye daies past, I will so scoure that rable from out of this courte, that they shal be glad to seeeke a newe haunte: Pretermitting many other follies entertained in the courte, I will conclude with this example vsed by Alexander Seuerus as a cauiat to courtiers. This good Emperour hauing a seruant, whome he much fauored, but he abusing, his maisters curtisie tooke great bribes of poore suters promising them to be- friende them in their requestes: but the Emperour binding him to a post, caused him to be chooked with smoke, making proclamation, that they that sell smoke, should dye with smoke. If all the smoke sellers in euery Princes courte were thus rewarded, and all the parrasites in like manner banished, I thinke the courtes of Princes would not be so fully replenished, nor euery greatman so mightily followed. The King proceedeth in his discourse, what vices he hath noted in the countrie. But do you thinke that where the court is thus infected with vices, that the country is not spiced with the same infirmities: O yes you may be sure, and mine owne eies hath beene witnesses of many misdemeanurs: I haue sene many men liue idlely and so vtterly vnprofitable, some others neither idle nor yet well occupied, and therefore not sufferable, and what vsury doth abound in the Citie, what extortion & couetous hourding both in towne & countrie, what pride and ambition in the layty, what simmony and heaping of benefices in the clargy, what plaintes at the barre, what delaies on the benche, what malice to those that be good, what boulstering of those that be ill, what lacke of loue in those that bee riche, and what oppression of the miserable poore. This I say I haue seene, and some thinges your selues haue hearde by complainte of this poore man, Castus, the maiestrat that we haue appointed to execute iustice, the lawyer that by profession shoulde bee a minister of right; the one of them is become negligent, the other carelesse, both corrupt and subiecte to lucre: they refuse nothing that is giuen them openly, the bribe is as much as they can do secretly, they greuously punish the offences of the poore, they closelye dissemble the faultes of the riche, and without a bribe it auaileth no man to aske iustice: a peniles sutor, makes a pitilesse iudge: Cicero complained of his time, that many notable decrees of lawes were corrupted and depraued by the curieus heades of lawyers: what woulde he do if he were nowe aliue and sawe the lawyers so vilie poluted, where a thousand cauiles and quidittes are continually coyned. Gainefull to wicked and faithles men that seekes nothing but deceite, and very preiudiciall to good men, who manye times had rather loose their right, then vndo them selues by following with such delaies, and so longe time by way of iustice. To the end therefore, that the disorders whereby all these vices haue beene brought into the commen wealthe, may be plucked vp by the rootes: let vs all set to our handes, that the entrance maye bee shut vp against the wicked who are the norishers of all this corruption: for mine owne parte, you shall see me soe prouide, that this sale of offices shall be abolished, that both iudgment and iustice, shall be better executed: and that the auntient and happy ordinaunces of our predecessors, shall be restored: Now touchinge the complaintes of my late accusation, I meane Martianus and Castus my fellowe prisoners: what hath beene awarded in their behalfe I doe here ratefie, with a beneuolence of a thousand crownes to be deuided betweene them out of mine owne treasure. For thee Gloriosus, that hast accused me of treson, in whome I haue found more maiestie then good manners, more grauity then wit, more prattell then proofe, yet for that there is nothing beseeming a Prince, to giue place to any wronges, then to those that are done to his owne person: and as those men are most vnworthy their scepters, who cruelly reuenge their owne iniuries, and pardon suche as are done to others: I doe here freely forgiue thee for all manner of trespasses that thou hast committed againste my selfe: but for the iniurie thou hast done to these other two, by the wrongfull charging them with a false accusation; I doe heere presentlye banishe thee the courte, charging thee heare-after not to come within three leagues, vntill thou hast reformed thy selfe, in all thy demeanures, manners and conditions. How Brusanus was entertained by the Kinge Leonarchus, and after some pleasante time spent in the courte, Brusanus and Dorestus betooke them-selues to trauaill. These thinges thus performed the people altogether fell into a generall commendation of their kinge, praising him to be so gentell in conuersation, soe patient in iniuries, so thankefull of benifites, so good to the good, so seuere to the ill, that the king acknowledging their faithfull loue, thanking them for their obedience, diligence and seruice, he arising from his seate, and taking Brusanus in his armes assured him to be as heartelye welcome to the King Leonarchus, as euer hee had bene before to the marchaunt Corynus: thus accompanied with Brusanus, Dorestus, and the rest of his Nobility, hee departed to the Court, where he caused a most sumptuous lodgeing to be made ready for Brusanus: hee then proclaimed a generall feast, and to be continued for twenty daies: in the mean time, the people had prepared theaters, scaffoulds, & standings, wheron there was sometimes presented Commedies, Histories, and other rare inuentions: other whiles againe the Tilt was frequented by many braue couragious knights, so strong and gallantly armed, as might haue bene iudged that they did rather prepare to incampe themselues for warre, then to shew knightly exercises but in sporte or pleasure. Brusanus and Dorestus, beeing nowe growen to a mutuall loue, and both of them desirous to approoue their owne vallour, came into the listes amongst the rest gallantly mounted, and most richly armed. Brusanus carriyng for his deuice in a field azure Cupid, with both his armes fast pinioned like a malefactor, his bowe and arrowes broken, his worde was Inuidia Amoris, Dorestus had for his deuise in a field argent, the flying Daphne, in the figure of a Lawrell, and the wise Apollo pursuing Cassandria: his woorde was Amor vincit omnia: the one of them so quite contrarie to the other, the which although it fell out by aduenture, yet sure it did presage the sequell of that which was to follow. I doe not meane to sette you downe the sundrye exployts perfourmed by these two gallant Princes: let this suffise, they continually caried away the prize, to their great commendacion, and to no lesse wonder to as many as did beholde them, to see so braue incounters against so many hardy knights that were so well approoued, and of so long experience. The perfourmance of these noble exploytes, did so imboulden them in their couragious desire, as loathing to spende their liues in ease or slouthfull idlenes, & more and more desirous to increase their vertues and experience, determined both together to leue the Court of Epirus, and to traueile through the world to seeke knightly aduentures: with this resolution they came vnto the king, crauing his allowance in their determinations: the which at the first, although it were very greeuous vnto him, yet to appeaze their hautie desires, and hoping to beguile his pensiue thoughts, with the memorie of their worthy acts, hee graunted to their requests. There is no more now to bee done, but for the princes to prepare themselues with necessaries fit for their iourney, and because they are now making of their prouision, I thinke it best for a little space to leaue them about their bussnesse, when they are ready to set forward, you shall aswell vnderstand of that, as of the rest of their fortunes what happens vnto them in their traueile. The end of the first Booke. Brusanus and Dorestus after long iournies, ariue at the court of Ileria: Astulpho King of that Region, hath a Sonne called Antipholus, and a daughter named Moderna, Moderna casteth a liking towards Brusanus, Dorestus falleth in loue with Moderna. These two princes wer long in prouiding themselues, and now being ready, they were as long in taking of their leaue, and bidding their friends fare-well: but hauing accomplished all things necessarilie, they take their iourny, and passing through Phrigia, Misina, Leodicia, aud Pannouia, they came to Illeria: And although I post them thus hastely on their way, you must imagine they tooke more leasure, and perfourmed so many commendable exploits in their traueile, that the report of their honourable actions, had a through recourse, euen amongest all Nations and kingdomes in that part of the worlde. There raigned now in Illeria, a mightie Prince called by the name of Astulpho, who through his prowesse in all martiall exploites, waxed so proud and tyrannous, vsing such mercilesse crueltie to his forraine enemies, and such moodlesse rigour to his natiue subiectes, that it was doubtfull whether hee were more feared of his foes for his cruelty, or hated of his friendes for his tyrannie: yet as the worst weed springeth vppe more brauelie then the holsomest hearbe, and as the crookedst tree, is commonly loaden with most fruite: so this rigorous king, was fostered vp with great fortune, his estate established with no lesse worldly honour, indued hee was with woonderfull wealth, and fortunate againe with the like prosperity, but most happiest of all, in a sonne and a daughter: the sonne called by the name of Antipholus, a most gallant young Prince, loued for his curtesie, reuerenced for his vertue, and honoured for both, and the heire apparant to the Crowne of Illeria. The daughter called by name Moderna: in demeanure decent, in countenance so sweet, in face so amiable, in body so comely, in all her parts so proportionable, that nature might not possibly affoord more beautie in any creature, nor art supply any defect in nature. Besides all these exquisite perfections, she was the inheritrix to the kingdome of Dalmatia, by the right of her mother called Persida, the onely daughter and heire to Vrbanus, the late king of Dalmatia, who before his death, gaue his said daughter Persida vnto Astulpho for a second wife, assuring for her dowry (after his decease) the kingdome of Dalmatia to Astulpho during his life, and so to the heires of his body begotten of his daughter Persida, of whome Astulpho had no other issue but onely Moderna, at whose birth Persida died in childebed, so leauing the inheritaunce of the kingdome to Moderna, who although she were but the halfe sister to Antipholus, yet nature in respect of the Symphatie of their mindes, seemed to haue planted but one and the selfe same heart, they so intirelie loued the one of them the other. These two Princes beeing thus come vnto the Illerian Courte, were verie well welcomed by the King Astulpho, but most kindlie entertained by the Prince Antipholus; and although the honourable exploites of these two gallant Princes was reported in the court of Illeria, longe after their personall ariuall, which won the hearers to loue them before euer they saw them, yet now such heroycall greatnes shewed in their eies, such extraordinary maiesty in all their actions, but especially the goodly presence of Brusanus (in whome such true valiaunce shined) bred a delight full admiration to all beholders, and now insinuating themselues into the socrety of the gallant courtiers, they proued to bee in sport so pleasaunt, in talke so witty, in manners so modest, in conceytes so cunning, in parle so pithy, and in all their conuersation so comely, that they were generally liked of all, and for a time there was no other talke in the court, but in the commendation of the two Princes: But Brusanus besides the beautie of his body, had such a naturall dexterity in all thinges, as in feates of armes who more hardy, in any excercise of the body, who more actiue, in communication or any discourse, who more pleasant, and in all manner of companies who better esteemed, so that there was no person, time, or place, wherevnto hee aptly applied not himselfe, insomuch that the familiaryty betweene himselfe and Antipholus, did more and more exceed, and it fortuned that Moderna casting a glaunce, vppon the beautie of Brusanus felt a certaine alteration in her affections, and as it were a sudaine assault within her selfe, but hauing small practise in the prankes of loue, shee could not coniecture the secret cause of these her sudaine passyons, thinking it to be but some toy lightly taken, and would be againe as sudainly left, and vppon this she still rested her selfe, conceiuing yet a good likeing towardes Brusanus, Dorestus on the other side hauing espied Moderna accompanied with other Ladies, walking in the fieldes to take the aire, contemplating himselfe in the perfection of her beautie, hee was taken prisoner before hee had leisure to arme himselfe, but see how occasion offered it selfe to a further mischiefe: Brusanus and Dorestus were inuited (amongst many other) to a banquet prepared by Moderna, there was likewise her brother the Prince Antipholus, with many other Lordes and Ladies of the court. The perplexity of Dorestus for the loue of Moderna, the like of Moderna for the loue of Brusanus. During the time of this banquet, Dorestus being placed right ouer against Moderna, and taking a better viewe of this perfect blossome of beauty, this matchlesse parragon for personage, perfited by nature, and polished by nurture he was so fettered in the snare of fancy, his fancy so intangled in the trap of affection, that his onely blesse, pleasure, ioy, and delight was in contemplating his eies on the heauenly face of this Goddesse, but alas her beauty bred his bane, her lookes his losse, her sight his sorrowe, her exquisit perfections, his extreame passions: Brusanus in this meane time now and then enterlarding the dishes with pleasant discourse, was throughlye surueyd by Moderna, whoe marking his manners, and musing at his modestye, notinge his excellent courtesye, and wondering at his exquisit beautie, was so inflamd with frendly affection towardes this yonge Prince, that where before she esteemed her likeing to be but the frutes of her gentle nature, she now gaue free scoape to those sweete thoughts, which by this had taken the ful possession of her harte: The banquete once ended, and euery one departed, Moderna shutting her selfe into her Chamber, discoursed thus: alasse poore Moderna, how art thou bewitched where is thy wonted vertue, hast thou prepared a banquet to intrap thy selfe with a more delicate dish, then any thou didst prouide? hast thou laid a bait, and thy selfe poysoned with the bane? hast thou bid him welcome, that hath caught thee captiue. Blush Moderna at thy Fortune, thy thoughts, thy choice, thy loue cannot be vttered without shame, nor thy affections without discredite. But ah Brusanus, ah sweete Brusanus, thy beauty Brusanus: but peace Moderna, blab not out that which thou maiest bee ashamed to reueale vnto thy selfe: but thou doost loue Moderna, yea, and whome? a straunger Prince, stragled out of his owne Countrey, beautifull enough, but yet perhaps not staied in minde, and therefore not fit for thee to fancie. Cease then Moderna, to looke at Brusanus, much lesse to loue him: be not ouer-taken with these dissembling men, whose eies are framed by art to allure. Die the Moderna, Moderna die: better were it for thee to perish with high desires, then to liue in base thoughts: thus throwing herselfe vpon her bed, drawing the Curtaines, shee turned too and fro, as if shee would haue hidden her selfe from her owne thoughts. Dorestus againe who was departed from the banquet, with a new field of fancies traueiling in his mind, went directly to his chamber, and making fast the dore, began in this sort to discourse. Ah Dorestus, art thou alone? O no, not alone, when thou art accompanied with so many vnacquainted passions: alasse, what hellish hagge doth possesse thee, or what frantique furie doth inchaunt thee, that so sodainly thy mind is perplexed with such seuerall passions? alate free, now fettered: alate swimming in rest, nowe sincking in care: ere while in security, nowe in captiuitie. Ah Moderna, thy courtlie Maiestie without coynesse, thy perfect beautie without blemishe, thy comely demeanure without curiositie, thy sweete and pleasaunt speeches seasoned with witte, thy decent mirth tempered with modestie: It is thou, it is thou, that hast thus charmed me, it is thy beauty that hath bewiched me. But I will loue, nay I must loue, and I will obay because I must obay; ye & beauty must be obayd, because it is beauty, and framed it was of the gods to feed the eie, but alas it tormenteth the hearte. O loue, O deuine loue, feared of men, because honoured of the gods, not to bee suppressed by wisdome, because not to be comprehended by reason, without lawe, and therefore aboue all lawe, But how now Dorestus, doest thou blaze that with praise which thou shouldest rather condemne with disgrace, or wilt thou seeme to blesse, where thou hast cause to cursse, and why shoulde I curse loue that am in loue, the gods disdained not to loue, Iupiter loued Io, and why shoulde not I then loue Moderna: Dorestus, loue her, and in the contemplations let this be reserued in thy praiers, that it wold please the gods to graunte Moderna to bee still faire, neuer adged and Dorestus to loue assuredly, and to continue constant: with this resolution, he bound himselfe within the limittes of his owne chamber, suffering no other thoughtes to haue familiaritie within his braines, but that which presented vnto him the picture of his beloued. Brusanus cometh to visit Dorestus in his lodging, Dorestus maketh him aquainted with his loue towardes Moderna. Dorestus, and meruailing to finde him soe obstinent from wonted exercises, that was accustomed to be so forwarde in all manner of commendadle indeuours, comming to his chamber, where he found him by himselfe he saide. I haue found in you (worthy Prince Dorestus ) a greate slacking of your wonted vertues,  & you subiecte your selfe to solitarinesse, the very enimie to nature it selfe, and the onely hinderance of all good exercises: neither careing for companye to solace your sadnes, nor accustoming your selfe to those delightes that whylome wonne you commendation, which maketh the Gentlemen of the courte to imagin they knowe not what. Dorestus, although he knewe his owne fault, yet desirous for a time to conceale his loue: made this aunswere. I know not (my good Brusanus ) what it pleaseth the Gentlemen of the courte to surmise by my solitarines, neither woulde I wishe them to impute it to any coy or curious statelines that is in me, for in so doing they shoulde do me wronge to coniecture of my disease before they haue cast my water. But this solitarines (saide Brusanus ) cannot free you from suspition, nor defend you from melancoly, being thus alone by your selfe: and respecting our vnder- taken attempt, is it not time that we leaue the Illerian courte, prosecuting our Iournye as wee firste pretended: Dorestus who all this while hadde hys mynde fired on an other deuotion, hearing Brusanus to speake of leauing the Illerian court, gaue a sudaine start at the very word, breathing out a pitious sighe, answered thus: O Brusanus, doth not the pleasure of the court render sufficient recompence for our time spent in it, me thinkes your very eies should receiue such contentment, that you shoulde not seeke nowe to depart, when your onely counsaile may worke my greater reliefe, then mine owne reason is able to render: Behold Brusanus, I doe challeng that curtesie at thy handes which erst thou didest promise with thy hart, in perfourmance whereof thou shalt ease some part of my sorrowe, and proue thy selfe faithfull to thy frend, these speeches he deliuered with a gesture gouerned by the force of his passions, thus ended his discourse listining what Brusanus would answere, who noting his words spoken with such vehemency, did rather increase newe doubtes, then giue him ground to settell any iudgment, but yet wonderfully dismaid, to see this alteration in him whom he so dearly loued, made this answrere. Where in may Brusanus steede you, that you may not commaund him, but the manner of your speeches are so straung vnto me, as I knowe not where in I may pleasure you nor what I should answere you: Ah Brusanus (said Dorestus ) if the violence of loue haue euer taken hold of you, I hope my case shall neuer want pitie in your consideration, you would haue me leaue this court, but alas I am so surely fettred that I can not away, you would haue me free, that am already so imprisoned as there is no other redresse to purchase liberty, but onely by her mercy that hath caught me captiue: Moderna, Brusanus Moderna, ah Moderna (without superstition be it spoken) is the adored goddesse of my amorous deuotions, the emperious mistris of my martired hart, whose beautie is my blisse, whose sweete countenaunce, is my soule comfort, to whome more then to my selfe, I onely desire to liue. Brusanus perswadeth Dorestus to shake off his fits of loue, Dorestus resolueth to submit himselfe a prisoner to loue and beautie. both what hee said, and with what minde hee spake it, was stricken into a sodaine amazement, but immediatly recouering his spirites, he said: Is this Dorestus the onely yong prince of the world, noted for his vertue, that so sodainlie should martch vnder the banner of Venus, the very first down step to all griefe and sorrowe. O Feminine loue, what power holdest thou in mens hearts, being (indeed) so far off from loue, that I rather think it a doating frenzie, rouing headlong vpon impossibilities, ingendred indeede betwixt lust and idlenes, his associates  & chiefest companions, are pain, trauel, anger, rage, furie, dout, grief, languish, threatning, dispair, vncertaine hope, his surest good, a certaine base weaknes, his fruits are laborsome aduentures, nay, rather lothsome misaduentures, which either wil bring forth il successe, or no successe: to conclude, loue is in nothing more constant, then in tormenting his professors. O remeber your selfe then Dorestus, if not for my sake that am sory to see your passions, yet for your owne sake, that euen now remains in ieoperdy: purge your head of this infection, weaue not the webbe of your own woe, spinne not the thread of your owne thraldome, it is better to beware by others mishappes, then by repentaunce of your owne follies: hazard not at that which cannot be had without harme, stretch not too farre, wade not too deepe, vse beauty but serue it not, tast wine but surfeit not, warme thee by the fire but burne thee not. Take heed therfore, and dwell not long in this temptation, when it is neither conuenient for your honour, your body, nor your profite. Dorestus that was strucken in a dumpe with these admonitions, answered againe. You handle me Brusanus, as a crabbed mother, that when her childe hath caught a fall, shee whippes the taile to make amendes, but if you finde your selfe an Apostata to loue, or that you haue displaied the flagge of defiance against fancie: can you not vse your liberty to your selfe, but you must vse it, as if you would vantingly martch ouer your frends miserie: O Brusanus, things are sone promised, but not so hastelie perfourmed it is easie to sound the victorie, but very hard to obtaine the conquest: all can say we would ouer-come, but few or none returne with triumph. Loue is a God and will be obaid, and lookes to command, not to be conquered, and beautie cannot be resisted: dare reason abide the brunt, wher beautie bids the battell, can wisedome winne the fielde, where loue commaunds as captaine? O no, no: loue is without lawe, and therefore aboue all lawe: honoured in heauen, feared in earth, and a very terrour to infernal ghosts. Lord how wise you be (answered Brusanus ) in framing propositions to deceiue but your selfe: if loue be lawlesse (as you infer) it is lewd: if without limites, lasciuious: if contained within no bounds, beastlie: if obserued with no order, odious: so that lawlesse loue without reason, is the very loadstone to ruth and ruine. Howe can you then imagine the effect to bee good, when the subiect is naught, or howe canne you so clearkely defend your desperate motion, proceeding from suche a fond and foolishe occasion: But you will saye it was the perfection of her comelye person, her exquisite feature and rare beauty that kynd led your desire. But remember Dorestus, beauty no soner florisheth, but it as quickly fadeth, it is not fully ripe, before it begin to rot: it is no soner out of the budde, but it withereth in the blossome. If then beauty be so fading, so fickle, so momentarie, so withering, so wauing, sone passed and soe sone parched, is this the Iewell that you make soe deare off, is this the Jemme that you would purchase with so great daunger, consider againe, al beautifull thinges are not precious, Mercury is milke white, but deadly poyson: the gloworme, is bright in the hedge, but blacke in the hande, the Panther hath a painted skin, but a deuouring paunche: the Serpent is pleasing to the eye, but pestilent to al our other partes: and he that taketh to much delight to gaze on beauty, shall sometimes bee gauled with to much griefe. Yet I say not nay, but that loue may haue a certaine childishe vehemency: but if louers were not charmed with some secret inchauntment, they would be able either to keepe their fancies for being inflamed, or else to coole desire being alreadie blinded: for the daies they spende in thoughtes the nightes in dreames, both in griefes, either beguylinge them of that they had, and promising, that they are neuer like to finde: their heades fraught with fantisies, fixed with ielosies, troubled with both: yea so many inconueniences waite vpon loue, as were infinit to recken them all, and to much intolerable (for a resonable man) to tast but one: being alwaies begun with griefe, continued with sorrowe, and ended with deathe: and albeit the pleasure passeth away in a trise, no soner done but forgotten, and the punishmente is permanent, yet so delightfull is the present sweete, that they neuer remember the following soure. The time is yet to com wherin many thorns are not founde amidst the roses of mariage. Marius the Romaine, asked Metellus why he would not take his daughter to wife, seeing she was beautifull in body, staide in countenance, eloquent in speach, noble by race, riche in doury, happy in good name and adorned with sundry vertues: to whome the other replide that he knew all this to be true, yet (quoth he) I had rather bee mine owne then hers. Another good fellowe on a time, aduised his friend not to marrye his son before hee were wise: (was thus aunswered) be not deceiued my friend (quoth the other) if my son once grow to be wise, he wil neuer marry: nowe Dorestus if you had a will that inticed you to loue, recouer now a wit to se the error in loue, better counsaill can you not haue, more holsom aduise I cannot giue, if you cary an obstinat eare, you hurt but your selfe, if you accept of my curtisie I profer it friendly, if you take it as I meane it, you will followe it willingly. Dorestus that stood all this while with a flea in his eare, at last made aunswere. I se Brusanus, that loue and beautye are little beholding to you but that eye that loatheth to behold beauty, is vnworthy to contemplate the heauens: what appetite more earnestly to be sought after then beauty, which conceiueth no blemish and concerneth the light of the body. But fortune I now most humbly thanke thee, for the recomforting mee with the delightfull remembrance of the beauty of my mistris, making me pertaker of that contemplation which is heauenly: the memorie whereof is a present restoritiue to all incumbrances that you haue hetherto feared me with, and a sufficient defensatiue, to any misfortune, that can heere-after befall me: but it is against reason Brusanus, so vncharitably to exclaime against those, without whome our life though neuer so luckie should seeme most loathsome, and so preiudicially to contemne those heuenly creatures, whose onely sight is a salue against all hellishe sorrowes: If thou didest knowe Brusanus, the ioy, the comforte, and recreation that is conuersante with beautye, thou wouldest doe pennance and marter thy selfe, for abusing so high an estate as Cupid is. Truely (quoth Brusanus ) thou art worthy Dorestus to be a chapman, that will bid so well for thy chaffer: But I would mine owne experience had neuer serued me to iudge so well of wemens manners, that somtimes adicted my selfe wholy to their seruice, and spent my life in the lappes of Ladies, wasting my goods to maintaine their brauery, and my wit to follow their folly. Oh howe curious haue I beene to please my Lady, but how carelesse to serue my Lord, O that I had bene more carefull in avoiding wemens company, and lesse cunning in disciphering their vanity: But if beauty be the marke that you shoote at Dorestus, take heede, for many vices of the mind, are couered vnder this vaile of beautie, & it hath brought commodity to very fewe, but they are not to bee numbered, that it hath brought to vtter distruction: O shunne Dorestus, shunne I say this sugered mischiefe, be not longer obstinat, let not your vertues decrease, shake of this collor of incumberance, be not subiected by loue, nor seduced by lust, no erroure shall then mislead you, no foolish fancy shall feed you, no woman shall besotte you, no vice shall withdrawe you, no glaring beautie shall intice you, and what knowledge but shall serue you: Dorestus that had his mind trauelled with two extreame passions, the one of loue towardes his mistris, the other of griefe to heare these wordes of Brusanus, after he had a while chafed to himselfe, he mildly made this answere: It is pitie Brusanus, that wit should be no better imploied, then in the contempt of beautie, the dispraise of loue, the dispite of women, and in the disparagement of their honours, but I cannot so lightly bee induced, to mislike of that sex of whome I was borne, of whome I receiued life, by whome I haue bin nursed and charely brought vppe, and wemen are framed of nature, with as great perfections of the mind, for the exercise of vertue, as men, but what soeuer fall out, I am fully resolued in my selfe, either to win the spurres or loose the horse, to haue the blossome or loose the frute, to inioy the beautie of Moderna, or to ieoperd my best ioynt, and therefore, what so euer the learninge willes, I will consent to nature, what so euer the lawes of philosophy perswades me, I will at this time giue the raines of liberty to my amorous passions, and what so euer be the chaunce, I will cast at all, God send you good fortune (said Brusanus ) but I feare me it will neuer be in loue: By this time the yoonge Prince Antipholus was come to the chamberdore, calling both Brusanus and Dorestus, to walke out, and to vse some exercise vntill it were supper time, to the which Brusanus willingly agreed, but Dorestus framing a slight excuse remained still in his chamber, & being thus alone, he recalled to his mind the seuerall speeches past betweene Brusanus and himselfe, and now hauing better leasure to consider of euery circumstaunce, resolued not so slightly to let passe the reasons of Brusanus, but like a champion in the defence of women, takeing pene, incke and paper, thus he writeth. Dorestus Prince of Epirus, to Brusanus, the professed enimy to loue and beauty. The phylosophers ( Brusanus ) amongst their preseptes of good counsailes, were accustomed very bitterly to reprehend the bouldenes of the tongue: this well considered, were sufficient to condemne your bitter inuectiues, seeking to bereue vs of that comfort, without the which the depopulation of the world would followe, you dispraise women, who at the first were created by the almighty himselfe to be a helper vnto man, doth it not then followe that as the creator is more worthy then ye thing created, tha the helper should in like manner be of greater moment then the matter holpen: The better to confirme our argument and to proue women the more perfet creature, let vs consider of the substaunce whereof she was created: It cannot be denaid, but mettal the oftner it is fined, the purer it is made, then is it not as certaine, that man being framed of the dust of the earth, & was yet made good, that woman being drawne from metall thus alreadie purified, should be a great deale the better: heere is nowe to be considered, the goodnes of the creator, that hauing framed a paterne of such perfection, would cuple her as a companion to vnthankefull man, whose proud nature, not able to brooke equality, hath euen from that time, vntill this very instant, sought to raigne ouer wemen, with an vsurped prerogatiue and to eclips their vertues, with slaunderous and false reportes: it might haue pleased god euen then to haue cupled man to a lion, to a tiger, to aserpent, or some other such, but he linked him to a woma, he gaue man a woman to be a comfort vnto him, to the intent therefore, and the rather that man should bee induced to their imbracementes, hath not nature adorned them with perfection of beautie, delicacy of bodye, excelency of wit, and such sweetnes in al their demeanures, that men of any iudgement, and able to discerne of suche inestimable riches, doe they not whet their wittes, their willes, their tongues and all their whole inuentions, howe to comprehend their fauour, and to insinuate themselues into their grace: yea they doe adde increase of courage to men of little hardines, making them to be more valiaunt and venturous in armes, to bee briefe they are the very pictures of comelines, the vesseles of sobriety the ornaments of beautie, and the very images of continency modesty & vertue, whose natural property (in any iniury done them) is either to excuse or to pardon: and heere making a sparing conclusion of their vnspeakable commendations, let me perswaude thee Brusanus, to leaue thy misdeeming of so pretious a treasure, for whom we are borne, & not for our selues, & by whome we are againe reuiued in our posterity, & not of our selues: Dorestus, hauing finished this discourse, sealing it vppe in the manner of a Letter, sent it the next day to Brusanus, who perusing the contents, and hauing with Euripides, proclaimed himselfe an open enemy to woman-kinde, hee determined to stand fast by his takling, and to send Dorestus such an answer, as he should not easily be able to auoyd: and beeing thus rather fraught with coller, then furnished with good matter: hee betooke himselfe to his penne, where wee will leaue him for a while, and speake of other matters. Dorestus bewraieth his loue to Moderna, she vtterly refuseth he vnfoldeth his pretence to the king her father, who granteth to giue him Moderna for his wife. desired successe, and wading betweene small hopes, and huge dispaires, yet remembring that nothing could be atchiued that was neuer attempted, hee determined to giue the on-set: and finding Moderna in a place conuenient, nesling himselfe so neere her as he might: to whome speaking in looks, for as yet his tongue was not come to a through boldnes, and yet by the many seruices he proffered her, she might well perceiue, that although he wanted power, yet hee wanted no will to please her: thus determining to present his sute, when hee came to the point, feare of offence, and dread of deniall, disappointed his purpose, that hee remained mute: but at the last, perceiuing delay bred daunger, houering betweene hope and feare, finding his mistres at so good conuenience, hee began in this maner to display to Moderna, the store- house of his deadlie desires. My extreame affection (most worthy Princesse Moderna ) will either breake out in words, or breake my hart with silence: but it hath at the last inforced mee to appeale vnto your curtesie, as the onely medicine that may cure my intollerable sicknes: nay, incurable I may well call it: for vnlesse the fruitfull shewes of your mercy, do mittigate the fire of my fancie: the drops of your princely fauor, quench ye flame of my affection: and the guerdon of your good will, giue a soueraigne plaister for my secret sore, I am like to continue in endles miserie. Sith then my care proceedeth from your beauty, let my sore bee cured by your bountie: sith the perfection of your person hath wrought my bale, let the effect of your curtesie procure my blisse, and reiect him not with rigour, that respecteth you with reuerence: loath him not with hate, that loueth you in heart: it is your beauty that hath depriued me of liberty, and it is your bountie that must redeeme me from captiuitie: and if my rashnes bee a fault in presuming thus to trouble you, let your beautie beare the blame, which is the spurre to mine enterprize. Moderna, that had vowed her selfe to another saint,  & hearing a fresh assault giuen to her heart which was already conquered: thought it not good for his stomacke, to giue him a surfeit of too much fauour, answered thus. Sir, as I can perceiue, your sicknes threatneth no danger of death, and if it bee but a loue matter, the fit wil soone be past: but alasse, your conueiance was nothing cleanly if you had not the out-side of loue to couer your in-side of lust: but bee it loue, or bee it lust, Dorestus take this for an answere, I haue vowed virginity, I mean to liue chast, cease then to craue that cannot be gotten, seek not for vnpossibilities, you say my beauty was the spurre to your enterprise, let my words then make you desire to leaue of your sute. I will not feed yeou with delaies, nor entertaine you with faire wordes, and foule deedes, but speake as I thinke, and so you shall finde it, and what soeuer you shall reply, my defence shall be to beleeue nothing: but yet least you should thinke mee too much vnthankefull, though I cannot inwardly mittigate your miserye, I will yet teach you an outwarde plaister, the which being applied, you shall find a great vertue, to asswage the heat of that loue, which you say is so pesterous and troublesome vnto you, and thus followeth the medicine. Take two ounces of the sound of a bell when it is roong for a mans soule that died for loue, as much of the neighing of a horse, that hath brought his Maister from Dunmo with a Flitche of Bacon, then take the parings of any mans nailes that is ful foure and twentie yeares olde, and neuer flattered woman: grinde these to fine pouder in a winde-mill that stands in the bottome of a Fish-poole, then take halfe a pinte of the water that is wiped from a mans eies at the buriall of his wife, put to a handfull of a Louers protestations made to his Lady without dissimulation: boyle all these together vpon a few coales, then straine it through the lining of any mans gowne that hath beene married full out a yeare, and neuer quarrelled with his wife, put to but one dram of good conscience, drawne from him that maried his wife more for loue of her vertue, then for the lucre of her dowrie: vse this plaister wise, laid warme to your left heel at night when you go to bed, and my life for yours, it shal both bring you into quiet sleepe, and rid you of this incumbraunce that doth so trouble your head with loue. Dorestus, to whom euery sillable shee pronounced was a thunder-bolt, againe answered. Alasse, let not certaine immaginatiue rules, whose truth standeth but on opinion, keep back your pitie and mercy. O Moderna, for thin own vertues sake, let not my miseries be quited with disdaine: I plainely lay my death before you: yea, the death of him that loues you, the death of him whose life you may saue: O tread not of a soule that submits it selfe at your feete: let not your noble heart put a doubt, till occasion be offered: mistrust not him whome you shall neuer find haulting: If there hath bene a trothlesse Iason, yet there was found a trusty Troylus: and as there hath bene a dissembling Damocles, was there not yet a loyall Lelius: sith then my safelye onelye consistes in your mercye, I humbly beseche you to take pitie vpon him, who is either to be made happy or haplesse, as it shall please you to awarde. Moderna, not longer able to tarrye the hearinge of more wordes, arose from her seate and gaue him this for a farewell: Dorestus, to make you happye withe myne owne mishappe, I neither canne nor will, to loue him whome I cannot like, were but to wrest against my selfe, to flatter him whome I meane not to fancy, is but a tricke of extreame folly: no Dorestus, it is not possible to perswade me to enter league with fancy, that am a foe to affection, or to followe Venus, that am vowed to Diana, I meane not to loue, least I liue by the losse, and she that is free and will be fettered is a foole, thus Dorestus you know my minde and so farewell: and away she goes leauing Dorestus, at his meditations: who seeing the manner of Moderna, was driuen to vse patience perforce, thinking her sharpe aunswere very hard to be disgested: but after he had a while paused on the matter, he burst out into these speeches: But by the sweet, ( Dorestus ) how shouldest thou know the sower: but by the blacke, how shouldest thou know the white, hee neuer acompteth of prosperitie, which hath not beene before pinched with aduersitie, which perchance Moderna, meanes to make me trie by experience: thinking to feede me with bitter broathes, minding heere-after to giue me a Cullice of better comforte: first to daunte me with the ranging stormes of deniall, that the calme of her consent may the more contente me: to make me taste the bitter pilles of annoy, here-after to diet me with confections of sweeter ioy: for the chilling colde of winter, makes the springe time seeme more pleasante: soe the frowning lookes of Moderna, will make her smiling countenance seeme more cheerefull: then cease not Dorestus to persue thy sute with endlesse paine, either to inioy her curtisie, or tast of her crewelty, to thy great happines, or extreame heauines: Dorestus being setled in his determination thought it conuenient for his better speede, to breake the matter to the king her father, and to craue his consent and furtherance in the cause: hoping that if he could win him, he should find Moderna the more tractable, and thinking it not for the best to make long delay, he determined in the morning, to put in practise his pretence, and going to bed thinking to take his rest for that night, he was no soner laide downe, but the picture of his beloued presented it selfe, to his imagination, then calling againe to his remembraunce, her crabbed aunsweres, and her flat deniall to loue: the hight of all ougly sorrowes, did soe horribly appeare before his amased minde, that he could take no rest: then began hee in this manner to complaine, O loue, doest thou not thinke the day torment sufficient, but thou dost enuy me in the nightes quiet: wilte thou giue my sorrowes no truce: and Moderna, is thy beautie vtterly voide of pitie, doest thou disdaine to helpe his ague, whose Cotidian fit, is conuerted to a frenzy, alas, loue wanting desire maketh the minde desperat, and fixed fancy bereaued of loue, turneth into furye, the loyoll loue I beare to Moderna, and the loathsome feare of her ingratitude, the depe desire which inforceth my hope, and the deadly dispaire which infringeth my happe, soe trauelleth my minde with contrarie cogitations, that death were thrice more welcome then thus to linger in dispairing hope: ceassing further speches, he lay al the rest of the night tumbling, and tossing without any manner of sleepe: in the morning very early, making him selfe ready, and finding the king walking in a pleasant garden (which vsually he was wonted to do) he vnfoulded to the king, the loue that he bare to his daughter Moderna, humbly beseching his furtherance in his sute, proffering so larg conditions, as pleased the king so well, that he not onely promised his owne good-will, but also assured him to win Moderna to consent. Dorestus triumpheth before the victorie, the King perswadeth his daughter to take Dorestus for hir husband, she cunningly dissembleth with the King her father. what greater prosperitie (quoth he) can happen vnto any earthly wight, then if he be crossed with care to finde a medicine to cure his calamitie, then if he be pinched with paine, to get a plaster for his passion: if hee be drenched in distresse, to finde a meanes to mittigate his miserie: which I see by proofe performed in my selfe, these comfortable speeches, hauing now salued my forepassed sorrowes, those honye sweete wordes haue now so healed my wounds; that where before I was plagued in perplexitie, I am now placed in felicity; wherbefore I was opressed with car, I am now refreshed with comforte, O friendly fortune, if from henceforth thou furiously frown vpon me, if thou daunt me with disaster mishap: this thy friendly curtesie shal be sufficient to counteruaill al future enormity In this maner Dorestus reioyced to himselfe, I wil not say triumphed before the victorie, the sequel will manifest yt to him that he is desirous to vnderstand. The king that was especially well pleased to make Dorestus his sonne in law, and willing to let slip no time, the very same day after dinner, sent for his daughter Moderna into his owne chamber, to whome he vsed these wordes. Moderna, as I haue beene carefull to bring thee vp a virgine, so I am desirous to make thee a wife: for as I know, there is nothing more commendable then virginitie, so I am not ignorant, that there is nothing more honorable then matrimonie: for if virginitie be pleasing to one marriage is profitable to many: and as I haue vsed these speeches to perswade thee to marriage, so I would haue him that should match with thee, to be such a one, in whose societie thou shouldest not count mariage a bondage, but a freedome: not a knot of restraint, but a bond of liberty: one whome thou shouldest like for his beauty, and loue for his vertue. To come then from the generall to a perticuler, it is Dorestus which I wish to be thy husband, and thou to be his wife nay, Dorestus is the man that I am determined shall be thy husband, a Prince worthy to bee beloued, and the gemme which is gallant in colour, and perfect in vertue, is the more pretious, the hearbe which hath a faire barke, and a sweet sap, is the rather to be esteemed: Thus thou knowest my minde Moderna, and the onely care that I nowe haue, is to see thee married before I die, and thou waxe old: Moderna was driuen into such a maze with this sodaine motion of her father, as she knew not what aunswere to shape, for shee ment nothing lesse the to yeeld to his request, hauing vowed in her conceit as before you haue heard. And to make deniall, shee thought would either incurre displeasure, or mooue superstition: but her father listening what she would say, she thought in this manner to haue stopt his mouth, and thus she answered. Most soueraigne Prince, and gratious father, as I know there is no greater bond then dutie, nor no straiter law then nature: for disobedience in youth, is often galled with dispight in age: the commaundement of the father, ought to bee a constraint to the child for parents wils are lawes, so they passe not al lawes, but this dooth especially make me to muse, that in my tender yeares, my infancy beeing not able to receiue your fatherlie counsaile, your grace then preferred virginitie as the onely ornament wherewith to adorne me, and now in my riper yeares would you disswade me from that, whereunto your selfe hath already setled my mind: pardon me sir, I beseech you, and giue me leaue to continue this state which I now holde as the onely thing that I account deere and precious vnto mee: for although (as you say) marriage bee honourable, yet it is a thing that commeth by course, whereas virginitie is no lesse admirable, and is a precious iewell giuen vs by grace: To loue, is the onely thing that I doe hate and I hope, the fatherly care you tooke in my youth to bring me vp in vertue, shall bee still continued, finding mee addicted to the same. Moderna answered the king, what-soeuer perswasion I vsed in thine infancye, I know they were such, as fitting for thy yeares: but thou art yet yong, and I am olde: and age hath taught me, that which thy youth cannot conceiue: thy youth warneth me to preuent the worst, and mine age to prouide the best: actions measured betime, are seldome bitten with repentance: I confesse virginitie to be good, but marriage is necessary: yeelde then to thy fathers perswasions which maye preuent thy perrils. I haue chosen thee a husband, faire by nature, royall by birth, famous by vertue, learned by education, Dorestus by name: he I say, the Prince of Epirus, it is hee, and no other that I haue determined shall bee thy husband, settle thy selfe therefore to like of thy fathers choyce, who knoweth best what is fit for thee thus leauing his daughter for the time, who departing into her own chamber, where this newe occurrant gaue her freshe occasion, thus to reuiue her former lamentations. O vertue, either I haue hithertoo had but a shadowe of thee, or thou thy selfe art but a shadow: but seeke Moderna, seeke to asswage this flame and to quench this fire, which as it commeth without cause, so it wil consume without reason, if thou wilt thus giue the rains of thy libertie to thy franticke affections, medicine will come to late when the disease will grow incurable: but can I deny, what the destinies haue decreed, is it in my power to peruert that which the Planets haue placed, or to resist that which the starres haue ordained: what need I vse so many words, I am not the first, neither shall I bee the last, that haue beene thus wroong with this fit of frenzie: thy father would be contented thou couldest loue, and thou therefore discontented because thou doost loue: I, but thy father would haue thee to loue Dorestus the Prince of Epirus: I, but thou art in loue with Brusanus, the Prince of Hungaria: Why, then thou louest a Prince as noble, as vertuous, as famous, as learned, as beautifull, and euery way as worthie as Dorestus is: Loue him still then Moderna, loue him still, what, wilt thou preferre thy fathers will before thine owne liking, or thy fathers liking before thine owne loue? No, no, doe not so: choose for thy selfe, whatsoeuer be thy chaunce, folow thine owne content, care not for the rest, thou canst but repent: but foole that thou art, where bee thy wits? art thou sure all this while, that Brusanus will like of thee? Thou louest him, but howe doest thou thinke hee will requite it, thou stoopest without a stalle, thou commest without call, yea, and to an emptie fist: O lawlesse loue, O witles will, O fancy full fraught with frenzie. But why dost thou moue doubtes Moderna? misdeeming either Brusanus or thy selfe: shall the reward of loue be loathing? doth good wil deserue hatred? or fancie defiaunce: or what is there in thee that Brusanus should mislike. Art thou not a Princesse, as he is a Prince? I but his perfection hath made thee vnperfect. But, art not thou the next heire to the kingdome of Dalmatia, it is that Moderna, it is that: thou hast nowe hit it, that makes Dorestus so much to loue, and wil bring Brusanus to stoope to thy lure, fear not then Moderna, for shee is acceptable to euerye man that brings a Crowne for her dowrie. Moderna setling her selfe in this resolution, so much the more armed her determinations as she saw her selfe assailed by her fathers constraint: yet still remembring shee must wade betweene constancy and curtesie: she therefore of pollicie vsed some better countenance to Dorestus, sometime baiting his hope with a dish of little certaintie: neither comforting him with too much kindnes, nor vtterlie dismaying him with too rough repulses: and nowe her onelie care consisted, howe shee might with modesty make her loue knowen to Brusanus, the which with all speed she intended to put in practise. In this meane while, Brusanus, who had bene long at his studie, was prepared with an answere to send vnto Dorestus: the tenour whereof insueth in this manner. Brusanus Prince of Hungaria to Dorestus, a maintainer of feminine flattery. I perceiue ( Dorestus ) that between vs the olde saying is like to bee verified, which is, that one fable draweth on another. And heere I cannot a little woonder to thinke, what humour should draw Dorestus to praise those for the onely paragons of the world, that in truth are the very out-castes of nature, who sith their first creation to this present, there was neuer anie man (of vpright iudgement) that durst be so foolish-hardy, as once to bestow of them a generall commendacion: those onelie excepted, whose foolish affections drowned in the seas of folly, are thereby made partiall, in the behalfe of their mistres: but where blind men must iudge of colours, there is ill painting, & where louers dare speake in the behalfe of wemen, there reason is enforst to play banckrout. But if Dorestus, to try what he could do in a bad matter, would therfore write in the praise of women, as Erasmus wrote a booke in the praise of folly: heer is now the olde prouerbe neglected. It were better to bee idle, then ill occupied: and although I meane but sleightlie to run ouer your sorie allegations, yet I hope you will not turne my modestie vnto wante of matter, but in seeking confirmation from the Philosophers for the commendations of wemen, would seeke the testimonie of the Iurye that had al ready pronounced him guiltye: or like a madde man that would power on a paile of water when he ment to make the fire burne: But shal I make repetition of their seueral opinions, and what they haue written touching wemen in generall. Marcus Aurelius, that noble Emperour, and worthy orator hath these sentences: There is not so fierce and perilous an enemy to man, as his owne wife: Wemen be of a tender condition, they will complaine of a small griefe, and for lesse cause will rise into greate pride, hardye is that woman that dare giue councell to a man, but he is a foole that will aske it, but he most foolishe that will follow it: It is naturall for a woman, to dispise those thinges that are proffered vnasked, soe it is death to be denied of that she demaundeth: There is no creature that more desireth honor and worse keepeth it, then doth a woman: wemen for a little good, looke for great hire, but for much euill, no chasticement. Thus far Marcus Aurelius, and this might suffice, if men were not wilfull, but I knowe that neither the dignitie of his person, being an Emperour, nor the reputation of his wisdome, being a Philosopher were sufficient to guarde him, but they would so taunt and raile at him, as he were not worthy to weare his mistres collours, that could not finde out some name of reproche in disgrace of the Emperour: I will therefore accompanie him, with such accomplices, as shall bee able to stand by him in all assaultes, and we will first begin with Senica, who hath these wordes: Inconstancye is a common infirmitie both to children and wemen, the one through slendernes of wit, the other as a natural sicknes: Giue thy wife no power ouer thee, for to day if thou suffer her to tread vpon thy foote, to morrowe she will sure tread vpon thy heade: Diogenes: they that had rather bee conuersante with wemen then with men, are like swine that had rather be rooting in durt and mire, then in faire and cleane water: Beware of the baites of wemen, which are laide out to catche men, for they are greate hinderaunces, to him that desires wisdome: Plutarche sweet sauours and oiles are more fit for wemen then for men, because they smell of folly: Hermes, beautye in wemens faces, and folly in their liues, be two euils, that fretteth life, and resteth goods: Protegines, in three pointes wemen and fools be of like condition, for they are ful fo vain affections, curious and peuish to please, & very wilful in foolishnes: Plato: a woman is a necessarie euill, wemens company, a mischseefe that cannot be shunned: Socrates: wemen are more pitifull then men, more enuious then a serpent, more malicious then a tirante, more deceitfull then the diuell: Aristotle: wemen in mischeefe are wiser then men: Chylon: hee that haunteth much wemens company, cannot be strong, nor he rich that delighteth in wine: Pithagoras: there are in wemens eies two kindes of teares the one of griefe, the other of deceite: Tertullian: a notable Doctor and piller of the churche with whome we will conclude, saith thus: woman was the first forsaken of Gods lawe, the discloser of the forbiden tree, and the gate of the diuell: Tell me now Dorestus, howe can you commend trechery for truth, vanitie for veritie, and ougly vice for seemelie vertue, or will you yet condemne mee for an euill speaker: But because woma was giuen to be a helper vnto man, must it therefore followe that the helper is more worthy then the thing holpen: then must it needes fall out that the grome that helpes Dorestus of with his hose when he goes to bed at night, is of better rekoning then Dorestus himselfe, & the slaue that but carries lime and stone to the building, is to be preferred before the maister workman: but I will graunte Dorestus, that wemen be helpers, for he that followes them a pace, they lightly helpe him to the diuell: Your comparison for the fining of mettals, I cannot mislike, for that it hath some affinitie with the truth: for in deede, the more mettales be fined the purer they proue, and gold before it be brought to his perfection, is first clensed from his earthlye substance, and being once drawne from his ore and drosse, it then remaineth a mettall, but yet vnpure, because it is mixed with brasse or copper, wherfore of necessity ther must be a forced refining, & then the gold is perfect and remaineth in price: the brasse or copper is likewise a mettall, though of a far baser condition, and therefore is referred for our meane and ordinarie necessitie: Soe when man was first framed from out the slime and dust of the earth, he was not yet perfecte gold, for why there remained brasse and copper, that is humoure and passion, wherefore it was conuenient there should be a second clensing, which being once performed, man was then in full perfection, and of the grosser substance there was framd a baser creature women being drawne from the partes where our affections lye hiden, and as she was thus indued with infinit passion, so it was necessarie to take from her all force, for had she had abillitie to haue performed her cruelty and rage, all the deuels in hell had not beene able to haue ruled her, and therfore (according to the olde prouerbe) God sendes a curste cow shorte hornes: But was it such a benifit for man to be cupled to a woman, rather then to a Lion, to a Tiger or a Serpent, no truely, woman is more furious then a lion, more cruell then a tiger, more venimus then a serpent, and more subtill then the diuell: and by her figured charmes brought man from that blessednesse in the which hee was first created, when the diuell himselfe was not able to do it: But to what sorte of men is it that wemen be so acceptable, forsoth to louers, let vs directly then seeke out whereto loue leades vs: The loue of men to wemen being a rage exceding all other passions, makes vs forsake the loue of God and to imagin our good to rest in them, as if we should do worship to Idoles, whose nature is vnder vain resemblances, to corrupt the deuotion of men, a thing so common in example, that (to a sencible iudgment) a slender rehearsall may suffice) and who so euer treadeth that desperat laborinth of loue, is in ordinarie destiny, of a wise man to take the habit of a foole, of a carefull man to become negligent: of a valiant man to become so weake as to stand in awe of a foolish womans word, of a prouident man to loose all pollicy: of a younge man to become withered, of a free man to become miserably bound, of a milde man to beare the burthen of an asse: of a religious man to become an Idolater: of a riche man honoured, a poore man scorned: of a patient man to be a reuenger of the filthy causes of his minio: to be briefe both to forget god & loose ye knowledge of himself: I neuer knew any one truly translated into the stat of a perfect louer, but after he had possessed his actual felicity in loue did not atend inward perplexities with outward disquietnes, confused counsels, careles executio, broken speech, vnsound iudgements, yea, such a generall negligence in all his actions and conuersation of life, that in a due consideration of the affects of loue, in his example it might easily bee discerned, there is more galle then honie, lesse pleasure then paine, more care then comfort, and more want of courage, then due commendation of a noble mind. I haue heard of many that were madde for loue, yet I neuer hearde of any that were wise in loue, I haue knowen the wise haue bene besotted by fancie, yet I neuer knew fancie that made a wise man: for it is no more possible, that loue should be without passion, then the Sunne without light, fire without heat, or water without moisture, whose pleasant motions are mixt with wonderfull disquiet, his little pleasure with piles of sorrow, his small brookes of transitorie ioy, with great riuers of extreame anguish: In loue, what seeeth the eie? lasciuiousnes: what heareth the eare? lasciuiousnes: what inureth the body? lasciuiousnes: the badge of loue idlenes, the best rest corrupt delights, the finall ende repentaunce. Loue is a bitter sweet, a poysoned bait, a golden hooke, a contumelious comfort, a diuelish intent. In loue wee misspend our time, consume our goods, wast our lands, yea, wee doe corrupt both body and soule. By loue, our hearts are blinded, our vnderstanding dulled, our memories mangled, our bodies distempered, and all desire of wisedome is set at a bay. Thus the pore louer findes his pleasure translated into a quality of bitternes, and his hope so turned into dispaire, that hee hath no other refuge then in death, and yet in him he hardly finds medicine. If he be but a little disgraced of his bodie, he becommeth wilde of countenance, vnquiet in minde: yea, his whole state so restlesse, as if hee were tormented with some hurtfull spirite, and in the absence of his mistresse, you shall neuer see him settled in anie company, or place of what value or worthines soeuer it be, but as vacabonds without a warraunt, or people fearing the fall of the firmament, they run heere and there, as though their safetie consisted onely in the eie of their mistresse: Peraduenture, there be som that wil mistake my meaning thinking this love that I would seem to disgrace, is but dishonest liking, or rather as it may be tearmed lawlesse lust, such as is practised with euery mercenarie woman: but take loue when it is lawfullie ment, wherin it is best to be admitted, and vse wemen in their purest kinde, whereunto they were first created, and you shall finde, that there is not so much care in the one, but there is as great combre in the other: and that the one bredeth not so much wracke, but the other bringeth as much woe: and where they both doe but promise vs a dramme of delight they will surelie pay vs with a pound of despight. For the institution of marriage, I confesse it to be good: nay further, I acknowledge it to be honourable, and it was first ordained to a most godly purpose, which was to keepe men from that filthy sinne of fornication: but what men, suche as were not able to containe their fleshly desires within the limites and bounds of chastity, for as it is said, chastity is the beauty of mans soule, and it is further affirmed, that the first degree of chastity is pure virginity, the second honest matrimony, so that marriage hath heere but a second place: now by this wee may conclude, that marriage was ordained but as a meane or medicine, wherewith to allay our fleshly lusts: and like as in all other our naturall infirmities, when they oppresse vs, we by and by seeke the Phisition, who to purge the humour, ministreth vnto vs but an Apothecaries drugge, the which by artificiall meanes may well bee made pleasant in the receipt, but in operation and woorking, it so distempereth euery part of our body, as we shall neuer finde rest nor quiet, so long as there is any parcell of it remaining within vs: so hee that is infected with the sicknes of loathsome lust, he may wel seeke Phisicke, that is, he may take a wife to allay the rage of his fleshly desires, but he shall find her but an Apothecaries drugge: for though she seeme pleasant in the first receit, yet in the winding vp, she prooueth a continuall torment, and his hastye attempt is euer rewarded with a gnawing repentance. Marriage is tearmed by the name of a yoake, by other-some it is called a bondage: and mee thinkes that these very names might perswade vs, that there is no great felicity to be sought for in his fruits. I can most fitly compare louers to hunters, that likes better of the sporte, then they doe of the game it selfe when they haue it: or like him that would needs goe a fishing, though hee caught but a frogge: and my louer in the time of his wooing, thinkes there is no greater blisse, but hauing once attained the height of his desire, his affections straight begins to decline. Thus you may perceiue, that in mariages there is not such sweet, but it is sauced with too much sowre, in loue such gouernment, which sauoureth not of follie, nor in affection suche fore-sight, which is not repented with great heart-breake. O foolish therefore, that will suffer themselues to bee conquered by a woman, whome God at the first created but as an instrument to mans necessity: But it is their beauty that bewitcheth vs, for with a pearce of their ein, there is harboured such power, that with the nature of the Basilike, they so inuenome euerye part of vs, that no art will serue to purge it. Truely, the folly of affection is woonderfull, yet are the errours of beauty more admirable, when of herselfe shee is but a painted sepulchre, and in her actions, the diminisher of all naturall and morall reason: we praise beautie, what more vading, we honour beautie, what more corrupt: wee sorrowe for beauty, what more foolishe. In greene grasse you shall finde biting serpents, in glorious sepulchers, rotten bones, in paineted pots, deadly poyson: in faire wemen, false hearts. Their immodest boldnes many times makes them aduenture of that which is both expresly forbidden them, and also is most loathsome and contrary vnto nature, as Myrrha, to fall in loue with her father. Phedra, with her sonne. Biblis, with her brother. Pasiphe, with a Bul. The matrons of Rome in the time of Papirus, preteding to haue two husbands, did manifestly bewray their inordinate lust, and is it not as likely that those dames, incroching further liberty, might haue sought for a third, and so for as many as they had list: but Dorestus, if wemen were so vertuous as you would make them, their vanity would be lesse in attire, and themselues not so popin-iae-like in their conuersation: their golden Calles would bee set a side, which are more curious then comely, mor precious then necessary, vnlesse with the olde superstition, wee should decke an artificiall Idoll, to draw the world to a vaine worshipping: their curling of haire so deuided and laid into lockes, that it seemeth to cary precepts and propositions of Art, their maskes and vailes for their faces, that leads men in imagination of greater beautie then indeede there is: yea, to what other purpose are their Courtisans fannes, their huge Uerdingales, with infinite other vanities, but onely to please men, and in pleasing of them, to be desired of them: but would you know the very misteries of these alluring curiosities: they serue (indeede) for instrumentes to plead for that by shew, which they would bee glad to speake for with thier tongue, but for sooth they must doe all thinges with modestie. They would be seene to haue many seruants to sue vnto them, for that in their owne fancy, is the cheefest testimonie of their beautye, and they haue cunning to imbrace euerye one with a perticuler affection, and that with such slight as the wisest shall be lead in hope of their good wils. They haue with the Iugler chaunge of entertainement for euery company, to perswade one with speach, to court an other with lookes, to be familiar with a third by signs, to allure a fourth by false trains of cloaked honesty, feeding them all with vncertaine hope, and him shee makes the Asse to beare the burthen, that beares her most affection. One shall be her seruant, and he must weare her colour, a second her partner, and weare her garter, a third her Louer, and possesse vnchast bed-pleasures, and though the two first, bee as lauashe of their expences as the rest: yet they must be content to holde the candle, while the third is offering to our Lady. They loue aboue all things to bee solicited with great importunity, accounting him for a meacocke, that will be repulsed with a first deniall, affirming that a woman must say nay and take it: and yet the more she seeth you plagued in passion for her, the lesse careful is she of your countenaunce, but the more you grow cold in your loue, the greater increaseth ye heat of her affections, like a disease, whose cure comes by contrarie medicin: such is ye violence of their spite, that with ye Salimander they seem to haue a felicity, in the torment of the pore fools that serues them, whose presence they feede with a flattering hope, and in his absence they make a scoffe at his honest affections: Thus you may perceiue they haue tongues to traine, eies to allure, teares to excuse, lookes to atract, smiles to flatter, imbracementes to prouoke, frownes to delay, beckes to recall, lippes to inchaunt, kisies to inflame, bodies to perfume, and al these to poyson: By their slightes they haue made Emperours idell as Anthony, strong men feeble as Sampson, valient men effeminate as Hercules, wisemen dissolute as Salomon, eloquent men lasciuious as Aurelius: Wilt thou yet bee maried, when thou must beare with all her inormities, her railing, her scoulding, her curssing, her banning, her enuy, her pride, her flattering, her frowning, her crueltie, her spite, her wilines, her wantonesse, her nicity, her slight, her subtilty, her quesines, her disquietnes, her taunts, her scoffes, her floutes, her periury: but thou wilt say for increase females are good, very true, but for decrease there are none soe ill, for who soe euer tasteth of their breathing will waxe bedlem, but hee that delighteth in their brauling, will surely proue a begger: Their commoditie as it is got with care, soe it is kept with to much disquiet: hast thou a wife and is she wise, then will she sure make thee a foole; if she be folish, she wil make thee ashamed; if she be faire, toles on guest to thy house more then thou hast neede off: if she be foule, she wil afflight thee: if barren, thy wo is increased: if fruitfull, she heapeth vpon thee either care to prouide for a towarde sonne, or sorrowe to preuente the practises of a wicked daughter: Thus may you se their companye doth corrupt vs, their vices without number, their vertues none at al, their wit is will, their truth trechery, their trust treason, their faith fraud, their curtisie cruelty, their simprying ciuilitie, is voide of al humanitie: You may se Dorestus, the subiect I haue taken in hand ministreth such matter as I knowe not how to make an end, yet heere I will conclude, hoping that hereafter you will bee better aduised, howe you commend chalke for cheese, copper for gold, or shrowes for saintes: Acknowledge your folly, be sorry for your errour, it is the greatest signe of grace, for a man to confesse his fault: Brusanus hauing thus ended his lines, sent them immediately to Dorestus, who taking a suruay of the crciomstances, fel downe of his knees, and holding vppe his hands to Venus, craued mercye, thinking he committed more then sacriledge in reading so horrible blasphemy to the diety of her sonne: Inioyning himselfe for pennaunce to make a present aunswere, which immediately he set himselfe vntoo. Moderna bewrayeth her loue to Brusanus, he scoffeth at her passions, and reiecteth her loue. In this meane while, Moderna, transported with desire to whome she had already bequeathed her selfe, wherefore after that she had with earnest and long indeuour sought to resist vndesistable loue, at the lengthe taking courage, bouldlye to persist, she entreth with her selfe into these arguments: What reason hast thou Moderna to contende with loue, that is both restlesse and vnreasonable, or what standst thou vpon these ouer curious pointes, thy fathers displeasure or thine owne modestie, when the first may be pacified, and the seconde nothing preiudiced: yea Moderna, thou maist reuerence as a daughter, and loue as a wife, and yet the latter not preiudicial to the first: But how should I do now to make my loue knowen to Brusanus, what shall I tell him, I loue him, and my selfe become a suter, for that euery meane woman is ordinarily required in, fie no, that were a bould part, why then thou shouldest be noted of lewdnesse, and generally condemned of to much lightnesse: and who shal condemne thee for thine honest likeing, thou dost not meane to practise lawlesse lust, and lawfull loue is neither offenciue before God nor men, feare not then Moderna, make thy loue knowen to Brusanus, the band of mariage once confirmed, is inoughe to couer all faultes: Speake then if thou mindest to speede, sue to him for loue, that perhappes woulde speake to thee, but that hee feares a repulse: Fortune (as it should seeme) verye fauourable to further her intente, for the verye same euining as she was walking into a pleasant garden to take the ayre: shee founde Brusanus sitting solitarie by himselfe, debating in his minde what successe were like to follow his friend Dorestus in his loue: to whome comming with a pleasant countenance, and yet no other then stood with modestie: she saluted in this manner: It seemeth (curteous Prince Brusanus ) you haue some certaine cerimonies to performe, you sit so sadly, what shoulde moue your melancholy demeanure, if ought be here that mislikes you, forbid it, if any thing that may delight you commaund, and it shall be had: Truely madame (aunswered Brusanus ) you are mistaken, for neither am I soe holy as to meditate so much, nor in so pleasant moode, to laugh at euery conceite, for other passion, if I seeme a saint, I hope I shall scape the diuell: I am the better pleased (aunswered Moderna ) if you be well contented, but how like you this country of Illeria: As I should do Lady (aunswered Brusanus ) it is pleasant in climat, populous in Citties, plentious in dainties, and well stored with manye braue personages: But our wemen are nothing so faire here as they are in Hungaria (aunswered Moderna ) nor our ladies so wel pleasing to your fancy, as peraduenture you haue mette withall in other places: It is the thinge I least care for (answered Brusanus ) and yet if the perfections of their mindes, be answerable to the habitude of their bodies, I feare me there is no other climate that can ouer-looke more beautifull, or afforde more wise, then I haue seene in Illeria: If your thoughtes be answerable to your wordes (aunswered Moderna ) the end must thus follow, that where you alowe so precisly, you must loue a little, or else in contemninge that you commend, we shall condemne you in that you pleade not guilty: That were to much extreamity (aunswered Brusanus ) for soe by the deeming of mine eye, I might be doomed to mine owne distruction: Moderna, that had thus preuily felt his repulse, although not beating so amorously as she did wish: yet hauing oportunitie to vtter what she would, not omitting therefore so good occasion, she saith: It is no hard matter ( Brusanus ) to bring inward liking to outward confession, and if you wil not thinke me to be more prodigal of my present, then your fancy will serue to take in good parte, knowe this that sith thy first ariuall here at my fathers courte, mine eies haue beene so daseled with the beames of thy beauty, and my minde so snared with the view of thy vertues, that thou only thou, art the man whome I like and loue: and to cut off speeches, which might seeme to sauour either of flattery or deceite, as thou art the first vnto whome I haue vowed my loue, so thou shalt be the last, onely requiring this for my good will that thou take me to thy wife: for other-wise to practise pleasure without vertue, I protest my minde is nothing lesse: heere withall the teares streaming downe her eies, gaue her a shorte pause to this that followeth: againe she saith: In troth thou maist thinke either my message is great, or my modestie little, either that I take smal care of my selfe, or repose great trust in thee, who soe vnfitting for my calling, without any regarde to my estate, do so prodigally offer my selfe, to the disposition of thy iudgment, to conceiue of me at thine owne pleasure, being prouoked there vnto by the purenes of my loue, and the fidellity of my good wil: honesty being the only guide of my conceites: if I haue then committed a fault, it is in louing thee to well: Heere againe the teares stopped her words for a time, but hauing dried her eies, she thus proceeded: If you finde ought immodestly escaping my tongue, impute the same to the integrety of my loue, and the necessitie of speedye dispatche: my father hauinge already promised me in marriage, to your friend & companion Dorestus, whom in my hart I could neuer fancy, & whom with all my soule I vtterly renounce, and haue wholie settled my selfe to be thine onely one: wherefore, neither feare nor scorne to inioy that which is thine, or at the least-wise, let her presentlie vnderstand thy pleasure, whose good or bad daies, whollie consists in thy good or bad answere: thus ending her speeches, she now againe beginnes to weep. Brusanus, that was almost out of his wits to hear this louing discourse, returned this answere for her better comfort. Madame, when dogges falles to snarling, serpents to hissing, and wemen to weeping: the one meanes to bite, the other to sting, and the third to deceiue: but doe you looke for an answere: truely madame, I haue no leasure to loue, I must about other busines, and thus away hee flinges, leauing Moderna in a pittiful plight (you may imagine) who finding her selfe so shaken off, departed presently into her chamber, and casting her selfe vppon her bed, shee closed her eies, as if each thing she saw had bene a picture of her mishap, where she began thus to exclaime. Alasse (quoth she) dispised Moderna: is this the reward of thy giuen away liberty? Why didst thou not holde thy thoughts in their simple course, and content thy selfe with the loue of thine owne vertue? O vnkinde Brusanus, could thy force and courage finde out no fitter conquest, then to triumph ouer her mishappes, who at the first sight did wish thee all happines? shall it bee said, that the mirrour of man-kind hath beene the wracke and ruine of a Ladie that loued him? what triumphe canst thou make of this conquest? what spoiles wilt thou carrie away of this my vndeserued ouerthrow? But O wicked mouth, how darest thou blaspheme the ornament of the earth, the vessell of vertue, the very obiect that all eies owe reuerence vnto? and how maiest thou blame him? or wherein hath hee offended thee? O no, no: there is no fault, but in thine owne imaginations, that would thinke that so high a perfection would staine it selfe with so great impossibilities. Alasse, hee hath then doone thee no wrong, it was thine own weaknes that wrought thine owne woe, thou maiest then beginne to hate thy selfe, but neuer leaue to loue him. But what a labyrinth am I entred into, I disdain my fortune, and yet I reuerence him that disdains me, I accuse his vngratfulnes, and haue his vertue in admiration. Oh heauens, I would his vnkindnes could race out the deapth of my affection, or my affection could make him to relent from his vnkindnes. Moderna thus taking to her selfe the waight of her own woes, left off further speaking, and beganne to turne her selfe to euery thing: as if change of obiects might helpe her inuention, and although she had a great while traueiled her thoghts, not settling any determination, in the ende shee resolued from that time forward, to restraine the libertie of her sences, not so much to looke on the Sun, that had dimde her eies with brightnes. Dorestus, that had bene all this while busie at his penne, and being now prepared of an answere to Brusanus, sent it immediatly vnto him in these words. Dorestus, Prince of Epirus, to Brusanus the common deprauer of Feminine vertue. VVhen the Foxe doth once begin to preach, good wemen then beware your Geese, and where vanitie dare oppose it selfe for verity, there vice may cry checke, but neuer giue the mate. How miserable is the condicion of those men, that wil make themselues guilty of their owne mothers disgrace: and how vnnaturall may that seede bee accounted, which will shew it selfe vnthankfull to the soile: and although grosse questions are to be answered with slender reasons, and adle heads should be scoffed at with idle answeres: yet to helpe simplicity, thus beset with subtilty, I must not neglect the defence of so many innocent Dames, for any respect of a deprauing friend. For your large exhortatorie, I let it passe as friuolous: but we must not doe wemen that wrong, to condemne them for a little foolish Philosophy: for as the Philosophers were men, so they had many faults: ther were some of them Parasites, som Epicures, some Iesters, some railers, some inserted with pride, some with couetousnes, but most lasciuious: and it is a custome of ill men, to defame wemen openlye, when they haue abused them secretly. Such a one was your great Emperour, and worthy Philosopher Marcus Aurelius, whome you so muche account of: but who more dissolute in the company of wemen, yet who more prodigall in defaming of wemen: in the disordered demeanure of his owne wife, Faustine did many times so disquiet him, that he was not able to moderate himselfe, no not withall his precepts of Philosophie. I doe not speake this to confirme Brusanus in his opinion, that wemen were thus able to martir the minds of these learned Philosophers, but I speak it aswell to confute those bitter inuectiues pronounced by the Philosophers, (peraduenture in a furie) as also to confound their actions, that notwithstanding their pretended knowledg, would suffer themselues to bee seduced, not onely by wemen that liue in suspect, but some of them most notoriously known, as namely Layis of Corinth, whome Aristippus so nicely courted, and to whome Demostines came to cheapen, but her ware was too hie prized. Periander, chiefe Philosopher in Greece at the instaunt of a strumpet, slewe his honest wife. Anacharsis was so bewitched on his Curtisan Ielaua, that he so instructed her in his knowledge of Philosophy, that on a time while he lay sicke, she supplied his place of reading in the schoole. Cleobulus, when hee was 60, yeares olde, and had read Philosophy 45, yeares, climing vp a window, to haue come to his beloued, fell downe from the ladder, and died of the bruse. Solon, that was accounted such a sage, was besotted of his owne bond-woman, whome he brought from the warres: Aristotle so much renowmed for his wit, at the fond request of his foolish mistresse, made himselfe a sillie Asse, creeping about a chamber with a bridle in his mouth: where dame folly his mistresse, sitting on his backe, (hauing appointed her companions in priuy corners to behold this pageant) made but a scorne of that learned Philosopher. Terrence was hanged out of a window in a Basket. Socrates was crowned with a pisse-pot by his own wife Zantippa. By this you may perceiue, that these men, notwithstanding their great philosophy, submitted themselues to the wils of wemens of litle modesty: & is it not like that such as will commit Idolatrye with wicked wemen without care, may not after blaspheme all wemen without cause, and that they will obserue as little grauity in their vnbridled furie, as they obserued reason in their disordered fantasie. But to make proofe and triall of mettals, there is no better meane then to bring them to the touch, then shall you find men to be furious, froward, ouer-thwart, rash, sullen, boysterous, harsh, sturdye, and giue them their best commendacions, you may compare them but to Iron, which sheweth by his rust, the vneuen temperature of the elements, and malitious influence of the Planets in his composition preffyuring the vngodly estate of man, wasted by the flame of concupiscence, and canker of loose life: where women by nature are mild, modest, sober, silent, gentle, louing, humble, meeke, lowly, and in euery perfection as pliant as the purest golde, whose propertie is neither yeelding to the moystnes of the water, nor consuming by the extreame furie of the fire, is the tipe of those, who dispising all thinges, are afflicted for vertue: & where the countenaunce of a man threatneth nothing but cruelty, the very lookes of a woman promiseth mercy and pittie: But I thinke there was neuer Lion so furious, neuer Tiger so cruell, neuer Uiper so infectious, neuer Aspicke so mortall, neither euer Wolfe so rauenous, but the males will rather oppose themselues to defend their Females, then any way to greeue them: and although these brute beasts are bereaued of reason, yet in the conuersation of their kinde, they shew themselues more worthie then man: and was it not Adams owne wretchednes, that wrought his owne fall in Paradice. Let Brusanus looke better of his text, and he shal find it to bee so, and that Adam could neuer after haue risen againe, but by the seed of a woman. And now I can but pittie Brusanus, who hath taken such pains, framed such arguments, alleadged such examples, gathered such conclusions, and hath induced so many reasons, and all in the disgrace of loue, vnder the shadow whereof he hath figured the very substance of lust. They are euill acquainted with the nature of honest loue, who will dispose him onely vnder a contentment so fraile, being in himselfe so deuine and wonderfull. The Philosophers, who in a deepe in-sight, thinking to attaine to the vnderstanding of nature, imagined loue to bee a most excellent forme or plot exceeding generallye the consideration of man: the accidentes which often doe happen through the elements of fire and water, are many times perrillous, and yet to hinder or take away their vse, were to driue nature from her course, euen so it is in loue, whose profession you wishe vs to leaue for certaine light inconueniences accompanieng him by circumstance, without any consideration of the soueraigne benefites which secretly lie shrowded and hiden in him: and therefore as loue is a poyson vnto fooles, so it is sweete to them that knowe how to vse him, for to loue without reason, is a token of lust and to liue without loue an argumente of follye: And therefore Brusanus you labour with greate wronge to exempt vs from that diuine amitie whiche the almightie him selfe hath not onelye commended, but also streightly commanded vnto vs: If our Creator hath said it is not good for man to liue alone, how dare we say we know better what is meet for vs then he that made vs, if he hath said, thou shalt leaue father and mother and cleaue to thy wife, dare we say she is but an Apothicaries drugge, and marriage to be esteemed as a yooke or a bondage, but a sweete yooke to be coupled to vertue, and a happie bondage to be linked to beautie, but what greater honour then that we do owe to our parentes, expresly commaunded: Honour thy father and mother, and yet this holy institution of wedlocke is more worthely dignified, Thou shalt leaue father and mother and cleaue to thy wife, when a man therefore betakes himselfe to wife hee giues no occation to be slaundered, but iust occation to be honoured. But Brusanus, me thinke you skip a little beyond your skil thus to quarrell with beautie, is the sunne to be misliked because it is bright, the diamond to be refused because it is cleare, the pearle to be condemned because it is orient, or wemen to be dispised because they be beautiful, when it is the onely doury it hath pleased God to bestowe amongest them, the more to shew the maiestie of his handy worke: But you inferre it causeth men to doat, and to whom do you impute the fault, would you haue wemen to eclipse that perfection which them selues cannot hide, without preiudice to their creator: but hee that standeth to neere the fire, let him blame but himselfe, if he bee scorcht with the flame: Marcus Aurelius, wrighting to the lady Lidia, proueth by his Philosophy, that it is a token of greate simplicity, not to descry the perfection of beautie, and an argument of greater folly, not to desire it: Now you begin to quarrell with wemens apparrell, but you are in this matter either not well informed or else to forward in iudgment, seeing this curiositie (as you terme it) is alowed to wemen, with more authoritie then you thinke, for wemen being onely created for the plesure of man, why might it not be thought, that God him selfe sturres that opinion in her, to giue contentment to the eies of him, for whose sake she was created: Licurgus in his common wealth, precislye ordained that maidens should goe bare faced, to the end they might be seene and desired, and by the same meanes, the married wiues laboureth to please (not the populer sort as Brusanus imagineth) but her husband to whom she is married, as it is written of the daughter of Augustus, who on a day being attired aboue her wonted custome of modestie, where at her father taking no greate delight yet for the present, gouerning his iudgmente by silence, but another time finding her in habit more conuenient to his liking, Oh (saith he) howe farre more seemelye is this attire for the daughter of Augustus, then that which she wore this other day to the disguising of nature, to whome she aunswered and that with reuerence: then sir I vsed my time to please the desire of my husband, and now I stand to satisfie my duty towards my father: The like example was vsed by the good lady Hester, when she protested before God that the sumptious attires which sometimes she vsed, carried no other purpose, then to feed the liking of that great king Assuerus, who had chosen her for his owne, and as the frocke makes the frier neuer the more deuout, and so in the attire of a woman lieth no true argument of incontenency, and much lesse ought her garments to breed anye opinion of her leude life and although the suspitious, be apt to speake ill, yet wemens consciences being cleare, what other rekoning haue they to make of wicked speches, but that they ar rather of custome then of credite: Besides this, such is the malice to wemens behauiour, that if any one shoulde attire her selfe contrary to the vse of others, she should be noted either disdainfull of the fashion, or at least an hipocrite in conuersation: Wemen are further charged that they loue to haue many seruantes, and how cunning they be in their chaung of entertainment vnto such as be sutors vnto themselues. In high attempts and marciall exercises, our gallantes now doe practise nothing but to courte Ladies and to triall with Gentlewemen, whose dissimuling dealing deserues a counterchaunge of like qualitie, no maruell though wemen grow to be fond, when it is to please the fantesie of men that be folish, or who can blame wemen though they iuggle a litle with those men, that practise nothing else but to play fast and loose with them: and although Brusanus hath thus generally exclaimed against all wemen, yet had he but loked into euery ordinary calender he might find out as many vigillies of holy wemen, as feasts of deuout men, and in his racking of the scriptures it seemed his right eye was out and he could see but on the left side, for if he can finde mee a Dalida, I canne shew him a Debora, if he can turne me to be a Iesabell, I can seeke out him a Iudith, and although some men through wemen hath falne into the rebuke of the world, hath ther not beene as infortunate wemen that hath beene ruinated by the treason of men, as Medea by Iason; Philis by Demophoon: Dido by Eneas: Ariadua by Thesius: with manye others, if it were needefull heere to rehearse them: The rest of your words, which serueth to no other purpose but to depraue, there needeth no other aunswere but that they were spoken of spight: and the woman of good life, feareth no slaunderous tongues, and a cleare conscience, neither needes excuse, nor feareth accusation: See now, what is become of this terrible tempest, where soe manye malicious boults haue beene thundred forthe against wemen, alas it is ouer-paste withoute anye daunger, for the beste substaunce were but puffes of winde, suche as mighte make a noyse, but doe no hurte at all: But what a labyrinth should I nowe enter into, if I should take vppon me to write in the commendation of women, that haue aspired in the deepe capacity of artes and sciences, and therein so profoundly, that men should not onely haue cause to praise, but also to wonder at them. Histories are plentifully replenished, where mention is made of Nycostrata, called also Carmenta, for the eloquence shee had in versifieng, of Lasterna and Axiothea, two woorthy dames most highly renowned amongst the schollers of Plato, of Arethea, that wrot fourty seuerall bookes who read openly in the schoolles, and had a hundred and fifty Philosophers that were his schollers, of Aspasia that instructed Pericles of lelia Sabina so renowned in Rome for hir letters of Amatasunta, and others like learned in the latin. But wherein haue women bin inferiour to men in vertuous life, who more framed then Aemelya, Claudia, Tusia, Nycaulia: For gouernment who more prouident then Zenobia, for wisedome Saba that oposed Salomon: for actiuity in war, Penthasile: for poesy, Sapho: for policy, Zoe: for poetry, Thalia: for rethoricke, Helerna: for oratory, Cornelia: for eloquence, Hortensia: amongst the elementall gods is there not (for matter of warre) aswell the goddesse Bellona, as the god Mars: and for science and wisedome, is there not a Pallas aswell as Apollo: for poesy, or versifieng are not the nine Muses as famous as Phebus: By this you may see there was yet neuer man so profound in any knowledge, but there hath bin a woman to second him, further more, these vertues of Iustice, Temperaunce, Fortitude, Patience, Pittie, Mercie, Charity, Humility, and many other like, ar all of the feminie gender: yea the very Church of god is compared to a woman, and figured forth in femall shape. But yet a little better to make triall of wemens perfections, we will examine their first creation, wherein is to be noted the substaunce whereof they were formed, which was of the purified mettall of man, the place where they were created, which was paradice, the time of their creation, which was the last, and therefore the perfittest handiworke of the creator, the cause why they were created, which was to be comfortable assistantes to men: through the sinne of a man, death and damnation were incydent to all humaine posterity, by the seede of a woman, life & saluation was purchaced to all true beleuers, after Christes natiuity, during the time of his abode heere on earth, who conspired against him, who sought to persecute him, who tempted him, who condemned his doctrine, who would haue stoned him, who said he had the deuill within him, who would haue intraped him, who practised his death, none but men, Herod, Annas, Chayfas, Scribes, Pharisies, vnbeleuing Iewes, yea Iudas one of his owne apostels, contrary wise, who loued him most intirely, who imbraced his doctrine, who confessed him to be a prophet, who entertained him in their houses, who ministred vnto him euen of their owne substaunce, onely women, Mary, Martha, the woman of Samaria, Ionua, Susanna, and many others. It was a woman that poured a boxe of pretious oyntment on his head, they were men that murmurred against it, and were offended that so great cost was bestowed vppon him, it was Pilat (a man) that condemned Christ, and deliuered him to the Iewes to be crucified, it was his wife (a woman that would haue saued Christ, willing her husband to haue nothing to doe with that iust man: they were men that carried him to be crucified, compelling him to beare his owne crosse: they were women that followed to the place where he was crucified, bitterly weeping and lamenting his death: what would you more, they were wemen that still visited his sepulcre after his burial, it was to a woma to whome he first apeared after his resurrection: but I dare say no more, for as the horsse knowes not his owne strengeth: so if wemen did consider of their owne worthynes, they would be infected with that pride, which yet they haue not, and men with that malice which yet they neede not: now Brusanus, by this you may conceiue, what leaden conceites hath ouergrowne your reasonable argumets: I could wish you to be sory for your erroures, blush not to aske forgiuenes, wemen be full of mercy, their propertie is to pardon, if this will not suffice, I must leaue you to the instruction of Musonius, who in his booke of sciences writeth thus: It is an impudent part to present any thing to publique iudgment, that wanteth knowledge, and the part of an enuious man, to dispraise without occasion: Dorestus hauing thus ended his lines, sent them to Brusanus with more hast then good speed (as after it fell out for himselfe) for Brusanus aduisedly perusing the circumstaunces, and finding his owne misdeaming of wemen so manifestly confuted, was striken into a sudaine remorse of conscience, and began to confesse in his hart the impiety he had vsed, in slandering their sex: protesting from that time forward to loue and honour them so much and more, as before he had dispised them. Brusanus renownceth his former herisies, he feeleth the effectes of loue, and writteth to Moderna. Heere calling to his minde his vngratfull demeanure towardes Moderna, whose beautie presenting it selfe a fresh to his memory, loue being readye at an inch with fuell to kindell the fire, wrought such a sudaine alteration in his mind, and such contrary passions so perplexed his doubtful thoughts, that after a long controuersie in himselfe, hee was driuen perforce to yeeld to fancie, and pulling in his former flagge of defiance, intreated for truce, and began to enter parle with Cupid on this manner: Why howe nowe Brusanus, what a doubtfull combat dost thou find in thy selfe, is thy lawlesse liberty turnd to a slauish captiuity, is thy freedome fettered, are thy sences besotted, wert thou of late at defiance with Venus, and wilt thou now shake handes with vanity, didest thou ere while renownce beautie as a foe, and wilt thou now imbrace her as a frend: hast thou so carefully counsailed others to beware the baite, and wilt thou now so crabbidly poison thy selfe with the bane: but foole that thou arte, whye dost thou thus rechlesly rage against reason, why dost thou thus fondly exclaime against thine owne wellfare, why dost thou condemne thy selfe of that crime, where of thou art not guilty, thou hast vowed to beware of fickle fancy, but this thy liking is firme affection, thou hast bin bitten with the sore of lawlesse lust, but neuer tasted the sweet of loyall loue, bicause thou hast indeuoured to desist from vanity, wilt thou therefore exempt thy selfe from vertue, wilt thou neglecte a peerelesse Princesse, whose birth may be a countenance to thy calling, in the attayning of whome thou shalt gaine honour, nay more, thou shalt inherit a kingdome, I marry Brusanus, there goes the game away, followe that chace, it is no small matter to inioy a scepter. I but yet remember thy selfe, and thou shalt find that thy desire must needes be waited on with daunger: Moderna is promised by the king her father to Dorestus, he againe is thy vowed frend, and wilt thou requit the trust he reposeth in thee with such disloyalty: But dost thou stand vppon doubts nowe Brusanus, O fie for shame, art thou false harted: what fearest thou the displeasure of a king, if thou by the meanes mayest compasse a kingdome, and did not Dorestus tell thee himselfe that loue was without lawe, what respect is then to be had of frendship: feare not then Brusanus, the rest of thy time hath bin but a dreame vnto thee, it is nowe onely thou beginnest to liue, now onely now, thou hast entered into the way of blissefullnes, let not then the opinion of I know not what promise, bind thee from paying thy duty to nature: With this resolution Brusanus determined to watch oportunities to come to the speech of Moderna, and by chaunce finding her walking in a gardin, comming to her before shee was aware of him, as hee begun to open his lippes to salute her, Moderna of a sudaine started away from him, withdrawing her selfe into her chamber, the which shee did rather fearing to bee farther tempted with so sweete an aspecte, then for anye hatred shee bare him whome shee loued against her will: Brusanus, marking her demeanure, was somewhat amased, yet not minding so to giue ouer, he went to his chamber, where he wrote these insueing lines vnto her. Madame, although the passion which is commonly incident to all wemen (I meane misbeliefe) hath ouer taken you of late, yet thinke not that either my affections are so light as to esteeme your disdaine for iniury, or let that loue finishe with a braule, which is in me begun and shall be continued for euer, vnkindnes may preuaile for a season, but not corrupt, and your repulse may (perhaps) perswade me to forbeare, yet not to forsake: as nature hath made wemen faire thereby to intangle men: no reason but some times they shoulde bee frowarde to commaund men: but it was a sweete pollicy, by a vitter repulse to renew affection, other doubtes, misdeemings, or opinions haue I none, but onely this, that my mistres was froward to make triall, not to forsake, & that my selfe am by nature to brooke an iniury to be pertaker of so happy a benifit: well Moderna, all misdeeming set a part, grant me your grace and fauour: and I shall haue greater cause to reioyce then you to susspecte, and wil alwaye remaine your faithfull seruant to commannd, who craueth nothing more then to do you seruice. Yours if he be Brusanus. This letter being sealed vppe, he quickly found the meanes to haue it deliuered to the handes of Moderna, who noting the contents of these plausible lines, by the same messenger returnes him this aunswere. I stood in doubt ( Brusanus ) whether I shoulde aunswere with silence or sophistry, because where the demaund is but a iest, the fittest aunswere were a scoffe, for dwelling still in your olde error, who will beleeue your newe protestations: but to make you to acknowledge your faultes, and to mortefie that madde humour of yours, that made you so much to forget your selfe, and to bring you againe into your right sences: I wil not let to pray for you, nay more then that, I would be glad to here a whole trentall of masses (besides other charitable actions) to redeeme you, because I did loue you: but seeing your purgatory is not pardonable without sattisfaction from your owne merrites, I can but wish you to haue grace to acknowledge it: and by penitent wisdome to win againe, what your wilfulnes hath lost: for the many seruices you proffer me, if to morrowe after dinner you will come to me that I may speake wich you, if I find your owne words correspondent to your writings, it may be I will imploy you, till then farewell. Yours if she could Moderna. Brusanus and Moderna practiseth secret flight. you) his appointed time to visit his lady, who being as ready to awaite his comming, they conuay themselues to an inward chamber, wherefor the time, either of them remaines confused, with a sodaine astonishment of exceeding ioy: Brusanus (in the end) breaking of their vnnecessarye silence, vsed these words: Though timerity, (madame) hath caused me to refuse your proffered bounty and the deeming of mine owne vnworthinesse to neclecte your fauorable curtisie, yet seeing the fault proceeded rather from a mistrust of mine owne happines, then for any mislike or other contempt of your greate worthines, I humbly craue pardon for this my fore-passed simplicity, promissing heere-after protested faith and loyalty: Moderna taking Brusanus by the hand smilingly made this aunswere: It is an easie matter Brusanus, to purchase credite, where the party is al-ready perswaded, and to infer beleefe, where euery word is acounted an oracle: but to cut off other friuilous protestations, let this suffice, thou hast the victorye, vse it with vertue: but fearing that my father shoulde suspecte our liking, and by that meanes preuente our purpose: hauinge as thou knowest promised me to Dorestus: I am therefore content to followe thee where-soeuer thou wilt be my conducter, and by making an easie escape from hence, we may liue for a time as contentedly else where, and being lawfully wedded (for that is the bondes of my loue) it will be no harde matter, to winne againe my fathers liking, and in shorte space to make ouer returne to the kingdome of Dalmatia, where thou shalt receiue the Scepter, in the right of me thy married wife: this Brusanus is the onely way by which your contentment may drawe on my happines: Brusanus, who had al-ready taken forth this lesson, perfectly to yeeld a willing obedience to al his desires, made this aunswere: Madame all places are to me both good or bad, as it shall please you to blesse or cursse, behoulde then (noble lady) what other seruice it shall please you to command, I am ready in your affaires to apply my selfe with al duty and obedience: After they had a while concluded of their safety, and set downe the course betweene them howe they might proceede in their enterprises, Brusanus departed to prouide himselfe for this secret flight: Dorestus al this while, who had receaued but colde comfort from Moderna, that had still driuen him of with delaies, by fortune finding her in a conuenient place, he saide vnto her: Madame, shall my merrit be repaied with no meed, shall my good wil be requited with no gaine, and my long sute with no comfort, O Moderna let mee yet call thee before the iudgment of thine owne vertue, and now at the last, pittie my estate, and do not recompence my desire, with despight, nor my lingring loue with loathing hate: Why Dorestus (quoth she) doest thou call it hate not to condescend to the request of euery one that woeth, or doest thou thinke it cruelty not to yeelde to the assault of euery flattering louer, but if this may contente thee, as I cannot be so curteous to requite thee as thou desirest, so I wil not be so cruel to despite thee for thy good will, let this suffice for the season, here-after thou shalt know more, I haue now other busines in hand: thus she departed awaye leauing Dorestus in a browne studdye what hee mighte make off her wordes. Brusanus and Moderna are secretly fled from the court of Illeria, the King rageth, Dorestus fretteth, they both intende warre against Miletto, King of Hungaria, and father to Brusanus. The very same night Brusanus and she beeing prouided of all thinges, necessarily conuaied themselues away from the court imediatly after supper, and taking the aduantage of the night, directed his iorny towards the cofines of Grecia, leauing his owne country, which way he thought there would be great speede made after him, the which (indeede) fell out according to his expectation: for in the morning that they were both missing from the courte, and that the manner of their flight was gathered by coniecture, the king sent out al the postes he had presently in readines, to belay those quarters towards Hungaria: by this meanes Brusanus and Moderna escaped the handes of the king of Illeria, but yet after that, they fell both subiecte to the crewell menaces of mercilesse fortune, as in the sequell shall be showne, but the king when he perceiued no meane to recouer them, he burst out into these speeches against his daughter: O how many incombrances are incident to parents, that are vexed with the practises of amorous daughters, for when we haue fostred, cheerished and brought them vppe to yeares of discretion, euen then do they run themselues to their owne distruction, when we hope of greatest comfort, they do cumber vs most with care, and while we are prouiding dowries to bestow them in mariage of such as we like, they prouide themselues of parramours, and will not be restrained to fancie but whome they list, but let vs prouide them of a husband, such as we knowe to be fit for them, and they will liue virgins with a vengence, and seerue to blush at so honest a motion, but let a verlet but meet them in a corner alone, he shall be entertained without regard of sham or honesty but vnhappy Moderna, sith ye traytor that hath thus inueygled thee, hath not spared to dishonour thy father, I do heere vowe by all the powers of heauen, I will make Hungaria to smoke for this his facte, his parents shal curse the time of his natiuity, and lament yt euer they brought so wretched a impe into the world: The king freted not so fast in his melancholy, but Dorestus chased no lesse in his choller, blaspheming bitterly both against Brusanus and Moderna, but especially against Brusanus and vnderstanding the intent of the king was to make warres with Hungaria, he proffered to strengthen his armie, with tenne thousand Epirotes, and to march himselfe in person with the king, to be reuenged of the iniury proffered him by Brusanus, the king most louingly accepting of this assistaunce, fell in all hast to making ready both men and munitions fit for the warres, Dorestus hath taken his leaue and is departed likewise into his country to make preparation according to his promise, In this meane time the king had gotten certaine vnderstanding that Brusanus with Moderna had bent their course towardes Calypha, and minding notwithstanding, himselfe and Dorestus to hold on their determination, against Milleto king of Hungaria, he appointed to send his sonne Antipholus, into all those partes about the borders of Crete, to followe Brusanus to take reueng, to the which iourney Antipholus most willingly agred vnto, and leauing them heere for a time to make all thinges ready, we wil shortly followe Brusanus, but not to hastily, till hee bee cleare out of daunger, from the borders of Illeria. Thus endeth the second part of the aduentures of Brusanus. Brusanus by straung misfortune woundeth Moderna, his pitious exclamation for his vnlucky facte. freed from the furie of the king, were euen now subiected to the wounderfull munaces of bitter fortune, and thinking (in their owne conceites) they had escaped all daunger, were but then entered, the very path of succeeding peril, but Moderna who al this whil had bin transported with desire  & troubled with fear, had neuer leasure to looke with perfect consideration into her owne enterprise, but according to the lawes of loue, like a louer had bequeathed the care of her selfe vppon him to whome she had giuen her selfe: but now that her hope was something quieted, and the most part of her feare already passed, she began to looke backe into her owne thoughts, and better to consider with her selfe of her vndertaken flight, and to remember how she had left her natiue country, and had setteled so strang a determination, but yet being nothing dismaid, hauing in her presence the parte whome she so deerely loued, and therefore casting no doubtes, on they rid, Brusanus cheering her with many comfortable and louing discourses, by this time they were entered into a mighty forrest, or rather a huge wildernes, in the kingdome of Calypha, and not far from the famous Citie of Sara, where they had not traueiled long, but they were incountered by a barbarous companye, that were laid close amongst the bushes to watch for some bootye that should come that way, who hauing espied Brusanus, sudainely beset him round about, and hee as quickly leaping from his horsse, and taking downe his Lady, set her against the body of a great tree, then turning himselfe with a violent rage against that rascall rout (who by this time began altogether to assault him) hee gaue them such a welcome, and bestowed so many bloudy tokens amongst them, that they began to giue backe, but Brusanus, throughly inflamed with furie so laid about him, that the best hope they had to saue themselues was to trust to their heeles, and thus at an instant they began all to fly, Brusanus following so fast, and dealyng such dole amongst them, that they were fain to scater themselues euery man a contrary way: Moderna that was nowe alone by her selfe and beeing striken with a great feare, forsooke her place and folowed after Brusanus, but hauing lost the sight of him, she thrust her selfe into a mightie thicke bush that was by the side of the way: Brusanus giuing ouer the chace retired himselfe to goe comfort his Lady, and comming by the bush where Moderna lay hid, shee reioycing to see her frend safly returned, was creping out of the thicket to haue shewd her selfe to her best beloued: Brusanus hearing the russiling in the bush, and hauing a speare in his hand which he had recouered from one of the villaines, & thinking it to be some of the company that had there hiden themselues, very rashly aiming the speare where he saw the bushes to sture, vnfortunatly hit Moderna cleane through the body a little belowe her ribes: with the blowe shee gaue a pitious scritch, but not able to speake any word she sancke down dead to the ground: Brusanus, hearing the cry, yet not knowing what he had done, came to the place, and looking into the bush saw his handy worke, and being taught not to stand long vpon deliberations he forth with drew out the speare, then taking her vp dead in his armes he brought her into the plane, where after he had vsed all bootlesse meanes to recouer her life, his perplexed memory had straight filled him with the timely shape of all his forepassed miseries, and the rememberaunce of his former fortunes, with the agony of his present mishap, comming altogether into his minde, and marching as it were in one whole frunte, so gauled him with griefe, that with the extreamity of his anguishe, his sences forsooke him and hee fell to the grounde where hee remayned for a tyme, without mouing hand or foote, in the ende yeelding forth a grone as if his harte stringes had burst, and stretching his ioynts vppon the greene grasse, he came againe to himselfe, breathinge forth these wordes: O fortune, why hast thou not made an end of my life with the end of my ioy: O bottomlesse pit of endlesse sorrowe, how canst thou ridde thy selfe being fettered with the euerlasting consideration of thy miserable fortunes: thou hast beene a paricide to thy father, in seeking to destroy him by thy disobedience: a poyson to the country, infecting it with the example of thy vngratious life: a traitor to thy friend, robbing him of such a treasure, whereof he was a thousand times more worthy then thy selfe: and now thou hast beene a murtherer, a butcher to her that was the exampler of all vertue, and the very onelye ornament that garnished the whole worlde: O sorrowe, nowe thou hast the full sacke of my curssed corpes, and comfort thou art now extinguished because I cannot hope, and what can I hope for when death hath diuorsed me from the exampler of al vertue: wilt thou seeke then to prolong thy wretched life, no: cut off thy cursed daies, and who can be so fit an executioner as thine owne handes being accessarie to soe bloudie a facte, so that in killing thy selfe, they shall suffer their owne punishment: Then turning himselfe towardes the breathlesse body of Moderna bedewing it with his teares he saide: O diuine soule, whose vertues can possesse no lesse, then the highest part of heauen, beholde his teares, whose hart dothe melt in griefe, but if any mercye be resting in the skies, or any loue be left to consider of a friend: if the heauenly powers, may behold our earthly sorrowes: accept his life for sacrifice, that hath no other recompence, and would bestowe a thousand liues to view thy heauenly face: Then taking the speere where-with he had wounded Moderna, and setting it directly against his harte, minding to throwe himselfe vppon it: he saide: Death, now do thy worst, and spare not to assaile the most vnfortunate wretch that liueth, suffer him not to apeare amongest men, nor to receiue common-sepulture: then making a little pause hee saide further; but alas deathe is the end of all miseries: what reason haue I then to cut off a wretched life, by a speedy death: if I maintaine my life it is to abide farre greater torments then are in death: liue then Brusanus, liue, but liue still to languish in thine owne euiles: then throwing the speare from him he saide: And whether shal I recommend the protection of this my wretched corpes, to the earth, why it shuneth to be increased by the reliques of my shamed carcase: to the heauens, Oh vnspeakable tormente of conscience, which dare not looke towardes them, whether then wilt thou lead this captiuitye of thine: thou art not worthy to liue amongest men, that art a foe to nature: and it is to late to speake any comfort in the angry gods: helpe then you infernall furies, helpe him (I say) that dedicates himselfe to your deuotions: whose hellishe rage is fit for your seruice: whose guilty conscience may neuer admit of comfort: Thou sunne, disdaine heere-after to shine on so curssed a creature: Citties deny to harbour him: men, abhorre him: wemen dispise him worthely, that depraued you wrongfully, Diana, graunte him no shrowd in the forrest: Ceres, let him starue for breade: you dropping heauenes, vouchsafe him no moysture: thou earth drye vppe all thy welsprings where he shall come, yea let mine eies, be depriued of their light: let my tongue, shewe no vse but bemone mine owne wretchednes, let my hart, be the seat of infernal sorrow: let my soule with endlesse anguishe of his conscience, become his owne tormenter. Brusanus leaueth Moderna for dead, he bereaueth himselfe of humaine societie, Eriphila findeth Moderna, reuiueth her and healeth her, Moderna chaungeth her name to Calinda, a generall Iuste proclaimed for the young princesse Valeria, Antipholus brother to Moderna prepareth himselfe to that Iuste. In this and such like manner, did Brusanus tender his complaintes, whose dolorous passions might haue bene pleaded in full aquaintance of al fore- passed trespaces, had enuy it selfe followed the action, and rigor occupied the place of iustice: In this desperate moode, and (as it were) more then halfe bereued of his sences, he left Moderna for deade, betaking himselfe for euer to liue in this solitarie desarte, dispising humaine societie: acompanied onely with the beastes and birdes of the forrest: delighting himselfe in nought, but in soure discourses: his muse affording nothing, but lamentable laies: and leauing him here to speake of other matters: You must vnderstand that more then three yeares before passed, Belizarius king of Calipha was deceased leauing to inherit his kingdome, his onely daughter Valeria, being then not aboue thirteene yeares of age, in whom nature had striued to bestow her brauest perfections, and vertue no lesse vouchsafed to furnish forthwith presidents: This yong Princesse, the king at ye time of his death, comitted to the gouernment of the queene his wife and mother to Valeria, called by the name of Eriphila, a lady a greate deale more vertuous then fortunate: for not long after the death of the king, she married againe with Brianto duke of Doletta, a man of great ambition, practised in all mischiefe and most shamelesse in his demeanures: It fortuned at this very instante that this young Princes, acompanied with the queene her mother, with Brianto the duke & many other nobles, had beene a huntting in this forrest: their sportes beeing ended, as they were trauellinge home-wardes towardes the Cittie Sara: they found Moderna lyeng by the side of the way, dead as they supposed, and some of them alighting from their horsses finding her to be wounded, and perceiuing it to be newly donne, one laieng his hande on her brest to feele if shee had beene colde, hee might perceiue her harte softly to beate, being then assured that there was life remaining in her, craued the helpe of the Ladies to reuiue her, who hauing in their companies men well experimented both in Phisicke and Chirurgery, they recouered life in her againe, though not able to make them vnderstand the manner of her misfortune, the queene Eriphila caused her to be brought into her owne cotche, and comming to the courte where she had a most precious balme, dressing her with her owne handes, within fewe daies she was perfectly hole of her hurt, though not altogether eased at the harte, not knowing what was become of her dearest friende Brusanus: neither durst shee enquire after him, and the rather to keepe her selfe vnknowen, she chaunged her name, from Moderna to Calinda, the which name for the time, my selfe will likewise vse: Calinda thus remaining in the courte, attendant of the queene Eriphila, rested her selfe in this hope, that in time, she might either heare of Brusanus, or Brusanus should heare of her: The younge Princesse Valeria being now betweene 16. and 17. yeares of age, was wooed by many great Kinges and Princes, but al of them stil cunningly delaied of by this duke Brianto, who beeing married to the queene, mother to Valeria, and therefore chosen protector and gouerner of the kingdome of Calipha, till the Princesse should be married, pretended so much as in him lay, both to keepe her from marriage, and to put her by the kingdome, which beeing foresene by others of the nobillity, they so wrought in the matter, that a day was apointed of a generall Iuste, wherein that Prince that coulde most valiently demeane himselfe, shoulde haue for his prise, the yong Princesse Valeria, & she for her doury the kingdome of Calipha. By this time Antipholus the Prince of Illeria, who had vndertaken the persute of Brusanus and his sister Moderna, was come into the borders of Calipha, who vnderstandinge what preparation was made by so many gallant Princes, he determined with himselfe to try his valor amongst them, the which he intended, rather for his owne exercise, then for any desire he had to the prise, hauing as yet neuer seene the Princesse: hee therefore speedely repairing to the Citie of Sara, prouided himselfe of all thinges best beseeming his honour. How Antipholus demeaned himselfe in the Iuste, he winneth the Princesse, who most willinglye surrendereth herselfe, he leaueth her for a season, following his pursuite of Brusanus to Constantinople. It woulde aske nie heere a very long time, if I shoulde discourse at large of euery particuler: as first to signifie the seuerall Princes, accompanied withe such troupes of armed Knightes, that it seemed the mightie host of Alexander, when he tooke in hande the conquest of the world: then the riches and brauery of their fortunes, with their straung and quaint deuices: the numbers bothe of lords and ladies that came from diuerse farre and straung countries, but to looke on, and beholde the manner of these enterprises: the beautie and brauerye of the ladies and gentlewemen, amongst whome Valeria shewed no lesse maiestie, then the moone in perfecte clearnes, amongst the dimmest starres, and it were ouer-long, and nothing to my purpose, to set down euerie mans particuler actions, to discribe how many speares were crushed, howe many hardye knightes were borne to the grownd, both man and horsse, and how many wonderfull exploites of chiualrie was that day performed: sufficeth this, that Antipholus entering the listes amongst the rest, and casting vp his eies to the scaffold where the Princesse Valeria sat accompanied with many other ladies, he was greatly abashed to see her beautie, which he iudged to be more heauenly or aungelicall, then humaine or earthly: this sodaine aspecte, had as sodainlie kindeled such a flame in his brest, that I can deeme no lesse, but it both fortified his strength and courage, for Antipholus so demeined himselfe against al comers, that as manye as did beholde him, both wondered at his valor, and praised his vertue, and thus he continued from the first to the very last, the heraulds with the hole company of lookers on, adiudged him the most worthy of all the rest, yet was there no man that knewe what he might be, but they all concluded that if his birth & calling, were answerable to his valiaunce & prowesse, that there could not be wished a more honorable match for the Princesse: Valeria her selfe beating into her head the remembrance of his noble actes, and hearing the opinion of the standers by: was desirous bothe to see and knowe him, that had now so great an interest in her: Antipholus againe, makeing hast to challenge his dewe, came before the Princesse, where vnlacing and putting of his helmet, he kneled downe humbly kissing her handes, proffering his further seruice in any thinge wherein it pleased hir to imploy him: and hauing nowe made himselfe knowen to the hole presence, hee further added thus much to Valeria: and although (excelent Princesse) I must confesse mine owne merrit to be nothing, in comparison of so great a benifit, which I hope to attaine vntoo, rather by the vertue of a gratious consent, then other-wise by any thing of mine owne desert: yet being incouraged by your owne conditions openlie proclaimed at the begining of the Iustes: and being intituled by the generall award of the Iudges and heraulds apointed for the purpose: I am now accordingly to chalenge that prise, of greater estimation (in mine owne conceipt) then if the signory of the whole world had happened vnto me: This Princesse Valeria vnderstanding him now to be so greate a Prince, and although loue had already made entrie in the most secret part of her hart, by the view of his knight-hoode, soe nowe the same breach being made wider by the second assault of his beautiful lookes: loue entred with banner openly displaied, & finding no resistance, tooke possession wholy of her hart, swearing al her affections, to be his true prisoners, she being nowe wholy surprised with an incounter of loue and bashfullnes, mildly made him answere in these few wordes: Worthy Prince Antipholus, as I am not to resist the ordinaunce of my frendes that be most carefull for me, so I must not gaine say those conditions where vnto I haue voluntarily tied my selfe, by publique proclamation, neither do I thinke it fit for mine honour, to make shew of squemishnes to a Prince of such excelent vertue, when the whole multitude are (as it were) eie witnesses, of so great magnanimity and prowesse, you may therefore (noble Prince) accounte of Valeria as your proper right, and Valeria heere voweth to Antipholus, faith, loue and loyallty: The Queene Eriphila accompanied with the nobility of Calypha, came with cheerefull countenaunce to entertaine Antipholus, thanking the heauenlye powers altogether, that haue vouchsafed soe greate good fortune to their yoong Princesse, Thus were they all filled with exceding ioy, Bryanto onely excepted, who seeing his deuises would no longer serue, to shift Valeria from mariage, was nowe debating with him selfe what course he might take to bring her to her end, the which he thought to be the ready way for the accomplishment of the rest of his purpose: and loo, oportunity seemed ready to further his intent: for Antipholus (as you haue hard before) had vndertaken this trauell to finde out Brusanus and his sister Moderna, and hauing yet got no intelligence of them, hee would needes prosecute his iourney to Constantynople, where if he could heare no other newes, he would then make his returne, when with a more quiet conscience, and a better settled mind, he might performe their mariage rightes, to both their contentacions: in the meane time he committed his dearest Lady to the custody of her mother, protesting, that in what coast or cuntry so euer he should happen into, that his hart should remaine dedicated to her deuine beautie and vertue, and so commending her health to the Gods, he thus tooke his leaue. Bryanto falleth in loue with Calynda, shee bewrayeth it to Eriphila, how he is deluded by them both, and of other his vngratious and villianous intents. holsome attemptes, in the end he honestly resolued with all speede to practise the death, both of the Queene his wife, and of the Princesse her daughter, by the death of the Princesse he hoped to compasse the crowne, and by the death of the Queene, he should set himselfe at liberty to take an newe wife. For Calynda remaining in the court (as you haue hard) attendant on the Queene: although shee had so cunningly counterfieted her state, that shee was not known what she was, yet she could not hide the perfection of her beautie, but she had so intangled Bryanto the Duke, that he had many times assayed to practise her to his beastly appetite, to the which bicause shee refused to consent (led by the rage of his inordinate lust) he determined to rid away his wife, to that end to marry her. For the performance of these premisses, he tooke this course: he appointed a day to ride into the forrest a hunting, pretending great sport, and done only to shewe the yoong Princesse some pleasure, finding her so dumpish for the departure of Antipholus? for this purpose he had well fed a cupple of ruffians of his owne training vp, the one he appointed to ride before the yoong Princesse Valeria, the other should likewise be attendant till oportunity serued: it was agreed that these two in the midest of their sportes, and when they were most busied in following the chace, should sudainely slip into some by way with the Princesse, and helping them selues by the benifite of the couertes, when they had her alone from the rest of the company, without anye remorse, they should despatch her of her life, then bestowing the body in some secret place that it might neuer more be found, they should both of them fly into some other country, where besides ye reward which the duke for this purpose had already bestowed vpon the, he promised stil from time to time secretly to relieue them with greater sums. This determination thus set downe, in this meantime Calynda had made the Queene Eriphila priuie to the whole demeanure of the amarous Duke her husband: fearing that hee should haue attempted her by some extraordinary meane of force: The Queene nothing doubting of the tale, would needes intreat Calynda the next night to appoint the Duke to her lodging, where she her selfe would both supplie her place, and abite all other aduentures what so euer should befall, and with much adoe she won her to graunt to it: Calynda the next day accordingly, finding opportunity, she told the Duke, that yet in the end, she was moued with compassion of his long sute, and that if it pleased him the same night to repayre to her chamber at a conuenient time, he should finde it no great matter to open the dore, desiring his grace yet to vse great circumspection, although not for her cause, yet for his honour: Bryanto, hearing this heauenly harmony, thought himselfe already to be a sure possessor of his desires, and kissing her handes, vowing many protested seruices, he left her for the present, to whome the rest of the day seemed tedious, but night being once approched, according to his instructions, accompanied onely with a Gentleman of his chamber, called by the name of Lucius, whome the Duke made still acquainted with all his vngratious actions, and many tymes vsed his help as a broker in the like enterprises, and groping thus together through many darke roomes, they happened in the end to the chamber of Calynda, where pushing easely at the dore, and finding it open according to promise, the Duke entered, leauing Lucius to attend his comming out, assoone as he was gotten into the chamber hee went to the bed, where leaping in on that side, which (indeed) was left of purpose for him, and hauing his spirites altogether blinded with this sweet immaginatio of imbracing his desired Calynda, in whos place (as before it was couenanted) he found Eriphila, the queen his wife: who with a determinate patience had taken vppon her for that night to abide all accidentes intended to Calynda: But the Duke passing forth the night more happy in contemplating this action, remembering himselfe that the same morning was the appointed time of his goyng a hunting, and minding not to let slip a matter, which he immagined would fall out to so good an issue, intending therfore to take his leaue, and thinking now that he had her so fully at commaundement, that he might trust her with all his secretes, at the time of his departing he told her that in requital of her courtesie, he meant not onely to make her his maried wife, but verye shortly to crowne her Queene of Calypha, in the acomplishment whereof, he must vse her as a witnesse against his wife, whome he meant very speedily to accuse of adultry, when her witnesse, with one other (of whome he was already prouided) would be a sufficient testimonie (according to their lawes) to condemne her to be burnt, assuring her further if this should faile, rather then he would be longer cumberd, with her whome he did so inwardly detest, himselfe would giue her poison, or otherwise with his own hands, he would make some riddaunce of her: The poore Lady hearing the doome of her owne distruction, in this manner intended by her husband, you may immagin, was in a pitious plight, but fearing to bewray her selfe, with a faint voice, she gaue consent to accomplish his desires: The Duke thus taking his leaue, departed not with so great ioy, but hee lefte her perplexed with a great deale of more griefe Valeria in the forrest is distessed by two villianes, was rescued by Brusanus, he conueieth her to a place of safetie. In the morning, who was so early vp & ready as the princesse Valeria, she was calling to horsse before a great many were out of their beds, full little knewe shee what was practised towards her, the Queene her mother excused her self from riding that day, faining to be il at ease, for she vnderanstding what the duke pretended towards her, thought it not good to let slip any oportunitie that might befall her to preuent his practise: but minding the same day, while they were gone a hunting, to flye into Boetia to the king (who was her brother) for the safetie of her life: but let vs followe the hunters that by this time were in the forrest: you knowe what game the duke hunted after, vnhappy man, after an innocent ladies life: but the hunts men rowsed a greater stagge, the hounds were vncupled, the duke himselfe was one of the first in the chace, the rest followed, they all tended their sport, my two forespoken companions watched their time, and hitting on a way that lay through a mightie couert of trees, he that had the Princesse behinde him, turned into that way, the other was hard at his heeles, the poore ladye seeing one followed so fast, misdoubted nothing, on they rid, til at the last they were cleane out of hearing of the hounds, and had likewise lost all the rest of their company, when one of the verlets speaking to her saide: Madame, which of vs twaine would your selfe now make choise on to take the first fruites of your good will, your friend Antipholus is gone to Constantinople to seeke aduentures, and I se no reason but you might likewise aduenture of a friend, that you your selfe may wel like off, when hee hath soe little care so lightly to leaue you: The Princesse amased to heare this saucye demaund, aunswered: Presumteous villaine, how darest thou attempt to make suche an offer vnto me, doest thou thinke I will disgest so notable an iniury, no assure thy selfe I will be reuenged to the vttermost of thy villany: Alas madame (quoth the other) and are you so ready to seeke reuenge for demanding of a question, when he hathe but honestlye sought to perswade that by curtesie, the which if it pleased him or me, we may bothe constraine by cruelty, but content your selfe, and aunswere more directlie, consent you must, and yeelde you shall, heere are no flockes of friends to defend you, and if you knewe your owne case, you would be glad both to curry fauour, and to speake faire. The poore lady looking better aboute her, and perceiuing her selfe to be singled out from the rest of her company, and finding by their presumtious speeches that she was betraied, replied thus: Alas, the onely limites of your request, is my destruction, and your detestable demaund, more odious vnto me then death: but if my case be so hard as you do perswade, I beseeche you both to determine of my deathe to the sauing of mine honour: Well madame (aunswered the other of the villains) some thinge to satisfie your desire (hauing the lawe in our owne hands) we wil first serue our owne appetites, then after we will not sticke to ridde you of your life, to the ende you shal not longer liue to languish in greefe: This said they turned out of the way into a mighty thicket of bushes, as couertly shrowded with highe and mighty trees, and the Princesse dreading badde measure, began in pitious manner to cry out for helpe, but alas in a place so vnfrequented, that there was no mortall creature to resounde an Eccho to her exclamations, the which the villains knowing well, tooke her downe from her horsse: and forceably casting her against the ground, began violently to assault her chastity, she stil defending her selfe so much as her feeble force woulde permit her, and euen at that instant, when she was depriued of al other resistance, Brusanus, who lyeng in that desert in such desperate passion (as before you haue hard) fortuned to come by, and hearing the pitifull shrickes of a woman, made to the place from whence he hard the voice, and perceiuing the destressed Princesse, he opposed himselfe in her defence, & at the very first incounter, he slewe the one of those wretches, the other not able to make longer resistance, fell downe of his knees offering himselfe to the mercy of Brusanus, who first disfurnishing him of his weapon, willed him to recompt vnto him what gentlewoman that same might be, and what his fellowe and he ment in such villanous manner to attempt her, hee aunswered thus: Noble gentleman (for your valiant demeanure vndoubtedlye perswadeth me of your title) for the lady, I will leaue it to her owne confession to manifest what she is, for my fellowe who by your valiance lyeth heare slaine, his name is Eurestus, my selfe called Vago, both of vs trained vppe from our infancy, in the courte of Brianto duke of Doletta, protector and gouerner heare in this kingdome of Calipa: and both of vs feed by him to haue murthered this lady: and for our better oportunity (it was like wise by himselfe deuised) that in the time of hunting here in this forrest we shoulde take occasion to performe our enterprise, the which (after we had both satisfied our vngratious apetites) had you not come thus to the rescues, we had vndoubtedly accomplished: Thus sir I haue briefly shewed, we should haue beene the ministers (though not the authors) of an innocent ladies death, but that it hath pleased God (by your good helpe) thus miraculouslye to preserue her, no doubte to a better purpose: Vago hauing thus ended his tale, Brusanus, not yet knowing whome he had rescued, curtiously demaunded of her what she was: the Princesse dryeng her dropping eies, and prostrating her selfe humbly at his feete, she saide: Touching your demaunde, knowe sir, I am by byrthe a Princesse (though as you see vnfortunate) and more vnfortunate (by the speeches of this traytor) then before I was aware off, in that he seeketh to practise my death, in whome I reposed the greatest safety of my life: But woe, yea endlesse woe befal that vngratefull trattor Brusanus, by whose villany I am brought to this misery, and whose only trechery is the cause of my mishap but alas sir, what thankes may I nowe render to recompence your curtesis, or how shall I be able to reward this your hie desert: Brusanus hearing himselfe thus euill spoken off maruailed at the matter, but in the end he saide: Is it possible (madame) that this Brusanus you speake off, would so preiudice the quiet of a Princesse, to giue you cause thus to exclaime against him: Valeria here discoursing at large with Brusanus, made himselfe vnderstand, that she was the daughter and heire to Belizarius, the late king of Calipha: howe he had left her the inheritrixe to the kingdome. Howe manye Princes sought to win her loue: how at a generall Iuste appointed to the same purpose, Antipholus Prince of Illeria, by his owne valor and worthines wanne her from all the rest. Here she began to relate the whole circumstances of the amorous incounters that happened betweene Antipholus and her selfe: and from hence shee drewe the cause of her quarrell to Brusanus, for (quoth she) this mutuall loue being thus confirmed betweene vs, when I desired it shoulde longest haue continued, and hoped to haue settelled my selfe in a state of greater blessednesse, euen then Antipholus (to performe a certaine vowe before solemnized to his father) would needs vndertake to trauail in the pursuite of this wretched Brusanus, who not longe before had traytorously conuaied his sister away from out his and her fathers courte: by this meanes am I spoyled of my greatest solace, bereaued of that rest, wherein consisteth my onely delight: and by this meanes, yea by this onely meanes, I am left (as you see) subiecte to the inconstancy of cruell fortune: Here she began againe very bitterly to rage against Brusanus, who euen then ouer-taken with the guiltines of his owne conscience, which is euer-more a seuere accuser, and to the impenitent person: a most terrible Iudge: the very name of Antipholus was a scourg to his conscience, adding newe griefe to olde sorrowe, and wishing with himselfe not longer to liue a despised run-agate, knowing that Antipholus sought him but for reuenge, and the worst of his malice he knewe coulde be but deathe, and that was the best thing that might betide him: after he had a while debated of these thinges to himselfe, he saide: Madame, soe farre as I can gather by your wordes, the onely thing wherein you accept your selfe to be vnfortunate, is in the wante of your beloued friend Antipholus, whose greatest cause of trauel (as you say) is to seeke out that wretched Brusanus, a creature (no doubt (accursed from his cradle: and if this be the onelye fruite to your felicities, sende after Antipholus, at whose returne (to worke your comforte and his quiet) I will deliuer Brusanus into his handes, and in such a manner, as Antipholus shall haue aduantage inough to be reuenged of any Iniuries, what-soeuer: in the meane time, what course it shall please you to directe me for your owneselfe, you shall find me ready to imploy my whole indeuours to do you seruice: After the Princesse had geuen him infinit thankes, they fell to consulting how she might remaine in some secret place for a season, in the end her selfe called to mind a gentleman, dwelling not farre of by the side of the forrest, that had been a faithfull seruant to her father, to his house she desired to be conuaid, but the day being farre spent, they were driuen for that night to lodge in the forrest, with such entertainment as Brusanus had prouided in a caue not very farre off: the next day verye earlie in the morning Vago was their guide to their desired place, whome Brusanus reserued of purpose to testifie against the Duke: Being thus come to this gentlemans house, whose name was called Fuluius, they were both secretly and curiouslye entertained, where we will leaue them for that night, hauing other matters in the meane time where-with to aquaint you. Eriphila pretending flight into Boetia, was intercepted, brought backe to the Duke, he committeth her to prison, her death is practised by a counterfeit deuise, she is brought to the place of execution You haue hard before how the Queene Eriphila, to preuent all perills intended by her husband, resolued to flye into Boetia, and minding to let slip no opportunity, the Duke was no sooner gon towardes the forrest, but she (a great deale more priuily then prouidently) fled from the court. It was long before the Duke returned from the forrest, & the reason was, the yoong Princesse Valeria being sudainely lost, they spent much time in seeking her, and yet returned without any newes, but the Duke being come home, and hauing got intelligence of his wiues sudaine departure, wondred greatly what might be the cause of her flight, and although he could not coniecture the certainty, thought it not good to suffer her so to passe, but assuring himself which way to send after her, caused such hasty pursuite to be made, that shee could by no meanes possibly escape, but being brought backe againe to the Duke, he commaunded her presently to close prison: and hauing framed the platforme of her confusion already in his head, in this manner he meant to performe it. There was a knight resident about the court called by the name of Arcadyus: a man famed through all Grece for his prowesse and strength, and one that by his force and chiuallry had performed so many notable exploites, that by the generall opinion of all, hee was thought to be so singullar, as there might not bee found an other to second him: and truely had his vertue bin aunswereable to his valour, he might well haue bin thought peerelesse, of al the knights that liued in those partes: but the want of honesty was a great staine to his honour: this Arcadyus had a daughter of most exquisit beauty and about sixteene or seauenteene yeares of adge, called by the name of Lucina, whose looks had so alured our licentious duke (who was quickly scorched with the blase of euery beauty) and hauing now forgotten his promised vowe to his supposed Calynda, he burnt with such inward desire to this Gentlwoman Lucina, that being assuredly confirmed in the large conscience of her father, he immediatly sent for him, and beeing men of like disposition, it was quickly concluded betweene them, that Arcadyus should accuse Eriphila the Queene, as accessary to the murthering of her owne daughter the yoong Princesse Valeria, and that the matter might carrie the more credit, a cause was put downe, what might so much inrage the Queene against her daughter, and thus it was deuised: about ten yeares forepassed in the warres holden betweene Astulpho king of Illeria, father to Antipholus, and Canace, king of Boetia, brother to Eriphila: Valdus (being then generall of the Boetian army vnder his brother Canace ) incountering in the plaine field with Astulpho, was himselfe slaine, his armie put to flight, and the whole forces of the Boetians so infeebled and discouraged: that Canace (to purchase a peace) was driuen to surrender to the king of Illeria, the famous Citie of Auarra, besides other great sommes of money, in satisfaction of certain demaunds challenged by Astulpho: Eriphila being yet gauled with these griefes: but especially desirous to reueng the death of her brother Valdus vppon Antipholus, practised first with her daughter to poison him, who refusing her, for the intire loue she bare to Antipholus, to whome she rather desired to be linked in mariage, then to wish him any misfortune, the least that might befall, whereat Eriphila beeing wonderfully discontented, and fearing her daughter should bewrae her intent, she posted ouer the matter to Arcadyus himselfe, and hauing first acquainted him with all former circumstaunces, shee laboured him (so much as in her lay) both by curtious intreaties, and liberall promises, that hee would vndertake priuily to murther the Prince Antipholus: but he loathing so detestable an enterprise, both vtterly refused it, and with all dutie and faithfullnes, willed the queene to desist the farther attempt of such odible practises, so much vnbeseeming a lady of her estate: but her choler so much the more kindeled, and the rather for that she was preuented from farther attempts, by reason Antipholus so sudainely departed on his pretended iourney: she therefore turned the furie of her reueng (contrary to nature) against her owne daughter: and thinking to preuent Antipholus, of his greatest felicitie, which he especially accounted to be in the loue of Valeria, and minding to reueng her conceiued displeasure against her daughter, for denieng to poison Antipholus, and for the accomplishment of altogether, hauing found a cupple of companions fitte for her purpose, the stratageme (of her owne deuising) was accordingly performed while they were hunting in the forrest, where the innocent princesse (by the appointment of her vnnaturall mother) was creuelly murthered, and the actors fled into Boetia, where the queene her selfe intended to haue met them, seeking her saftie by hasty flight, fearing that her deuilysh deuises shoulde haue broken out: This accusation thus cleanely coined betweene them, the duke intended the very next day to make riddaunce of his wife, and the rather for the desire he had to his new bride, which was a persell of the couenantes agreed on betweene the duke and Arcadyus, that Lucina shoulde bee a dutches at the least, but they rested in hope to crowne her a queene: The next day very early in the morning, the duke crauing the assistaunce of diuerse noble men (such as hee knewe to bee neerest adicted to his owne disposition) consulting with them of many causes touching the state, then making semblaunce of great sorrow, for the losse of the princesse Valeria, and the rather when they knewe not what account they might render to the world, what shoulde become of her, yet seeming to carry a hope of her recouery, beeing fully perswaded in his mind, that she was but straied out of the waye, hauing loste themselues in the forrest, and did therefore thinke it very conuenient to send out great search into euery quarter, to see if they could find her either aliue or dead. While these causes were in discoursing, Arcadyus presenting himselfe before them, crauing their patience in hearing a matter of such remorse, as to reueale was grieuous vnto him, bycause it touched such persons as he had euer highly reuerenced, and to conceall it, he durst not, for that it would proue a scourg to his own conscience: he was willed breefely to deliuer his doubt, & if he were by any meanes wronged, they were ther ready to render him right: Arcadyus here (as before it was deuised betwen the duke and him) accused Eriphila with the murthering of her owne daughter, the manner whereof, bicause it is before specified, I may therefore heere omit, but the circumstaunces were not betweene them so cunningly counterfeited, but the matter by Arcadyus was as artificially auowed, and although the discourse were smoothed to the purpose, yet there was nothing so much confirmed his tale to be true, as the queenes own flight, in that she sought so priuily to steal away, & no man could immagine any cause wherefore: But the duke hauing giuen attentiue eare to the whole speeches of Arcadyus, seemed to the beholders to be wonderfully troubled in his mind, & breathing forth a pitious sighe, as if his very soule had bin pasionate with anguish and griefe he said. Arcadyus, dost thou knowe what thou hast said, and whome thou hast accused, assure thy selfe, if thou art not able sufficiently to proue as much as thou hast heere presented, that besides the asperity and rigour of the lawes in these causes prouided ther is neither torture, nor any torment that may be deuised, but they shal fal al to thy share: I craue no fauour (aunswered Arcadyus ) and I am heere ready (according to the lawes) to maintain my right by way of combat, against any man that dare auowe the contrary: I take thy word (aunswered the duke) and for that it shall not be said I will smoother vppe a matter so hatefull to all eares, for any loue or fauour to the peruerting of iustice, I doe heere award (though with a sorrowfull spirite) that to morrowe by tenne of the clocke in the morning Eriphila (whome till this houre I haue so tenderly loued) shall without all remorse be burned, as a most vnnaturall woman that would conspire the death of her owne child, and if by that houre (in her defence) she be not prouided of a champion, who by triall of battaile shall aquite her of all accusations wherewith thou hast heere charged her. The ordinaunce of the duke being thus set downe, Arcadyus (who altogether presumed of his owne strengeth) although he thought no man so hardy to incounter him, yet he prouided himselfe against the time: the duke on the other side, thinking his paine now altogether past, was deuising of his mariag day, immagining himselfe alredy to be a widower, and indeed, by generall opinion, they all accounted the queene to be but as a dead woman, in these cogitations the time runnes on, and the nexte morning, without the walles of the Citie on a very fair green, was the place appointed for ye execution, the clock stroke 9, & there was no ma hard off that durst appose himselfe in ye queenes defence, she was led forth to ye place wher she should suffer: who with pitious sighes & sobbs, bewraied the inward sorrowe of her harte, which mooued great compassion to all beholders: Arcadius was ready in the place (brauely mounted, and strongly armed) to mainetaine his accusation, the Ladie assuring her selfe that her deathe was there determined, was not soe much terrified withe the torture, as the slaunder, but knowing no better meane then with patience to suffer, humbly falling on her knees and holding vp her hands, she besought the heauens to receiue her guiltlesse soule, and although her body shoulde be consumed by the fury of the fire, that the flames might yet descry the Innocency of her cause: the lookers on letting fall aboundance of teares, to see this pitifull spectacle, although they knewe not what Iudgment to settle touching her accusation, yet they all lamented her misfortune concerning her condemnation: It was now a good halfe houre after nine of the clocke, when Arcadius speaking to the executioners said: What is the matter (my friends) that you make so long delay, spending the time in vaine, what do you thinke theer is anye man so foole hardye that dare enter the listes with me in this quarrell: if you know any such or if that be your stay, let him come forth, and you shall see I wil soone make him repent his presumption, when it shall be to late for him to confesse his foolishe enterprise. Brusanus rescueth Eriphila by combat, Arcadius confesseth their conspiricy, cleareth Eriphila and dieth. After Eriphila had made her hartye praiers vnto God shee was brought to the stake, when the last act to finishe vppe the tragedy was to put fire to the fewell, but God who neuer forsaketh Innocents in their necessitie, vouchsafed speedye helpe, for this lady now standing (as it were) equally betwixte life and death (though neither fearing the one nor hoping the other) is yet comforted contrarie to all expectation: for a seruant belonging to Fuluius hauing beene in the Citie, and learned al the newes: returned directly to his maister, relating vnto him how it stoode with the queene, who the next day was to be executed, for conspiring the death of the young Princesse her daughter: when Fuluius had certified these newes to Brusanus and Valeria, after they had a while paused on the matter, and had aduisedlye considered of the trechery of the Duke. Brusanus would needes vndertake the combat in the behalfe of the queene, and being furnished by Fuluius bothe of horsse, armoure, and all other necessaries fit for such an enterprise, at this verye instant when the executioners were readye to put fire to the fewell, Brusanus presentinge himselfe before the principall officers said: Is it possible (worthy gentlemen) that a poore innocent lady should thus be condemned to dye before she hath beene personally brought to araignement, not being suffered to aunswere for her selfe, but vppon the bare assertion of a knight, if neuer before detected, yet in this case, necessarily to be susspected: or do you not thinke that the Duke her husbande, who vppon small causes became her Iayler, will not vppon lesse occasion become her murtherer: but hee maketh Iustice the cloake of tirany, and shall that bleare your eies not to soe his subtilty: The whole company wondered at the bould speeches of this straung knight, but as there was not any man there that coulde immagine what he shoulde be, soe not one amongst them all would giue him any one worde to aunswere: Arcadius standing by, saide as followeth: Why who art thou, or what art thou called, that wanting courage to performe as a knight, art thus come hither to perswade with words like a cowarde, doost thou thinke thy Philosophy inough to incunter the pointe of my sworde: thou hast beene to ill aduised in medling with this mater, that can warrant thee no better then thine owne destruction: Brusanus aduisedly noting these presumptuous speeches aunswered: Touching thy demaund, who I am, or what I am called, I list not in that point to make thee any aunswere, yet thus much to satisfie thy desire, assure thy selfe I am a knight (no cowarde) and am come hither to abate thy pride and to chastice thy presumption, that contrary to the order of knight-hoode, thou hast dared to charge an Innocente Princesse with so false & vntrue an accusation: and that thou mightest the rather perceiue, I am not come hither to perswad more by wordes, then I minde fully to performe in deedes, I am here ready in the behalfe of the queene, by way of combat to make triall against thee that thou hast most falsely and shamefully slaundered her. Why then (quoth Arcadius ) to the end that I may with the more speede minister correction to thy folly, let vs delaye no longer time with wordes, but prepare thy selfe to the battaill, for it seemeth vnto me, euery minit to be a monthe, vntill I haue taken a full reuenge of this thy witlesse enterprise: Without any more words had between them, they seperate themselues to take their course, then spurring their steedes with a mightie Carere, they incounter the one of them against the others speares soe directlye leuelled, and therewithall, so strongly charged, that they were both shiuered into smal peces, the beholders wondered at the force of the strang knight, but Arcadius himselfe was much more amased, who neuer before that time hade felt the like encounter, and being now in a pelting chase, with his drawne sword, he turned to Brusanus, who in like manner was as ready to receiue him, the battail then began so fiersly betweene them, that in very short space they made euident profe of their courage and manhoode, the valiant knightes malissing eache at others welfare, finding their armoures so good that no sworde woulde enter, were both of them made so angry, that they laied so muche the faster about them: the fight continued a long time soe indifferent, that the beholders were not able to Iudge which partye had the better: in the end Arcadius began to rate with himselfe, thinking that his wonted force had lefte him, because in his whole life time vntill that present day, he had neuer mette with any man that was able to indure halfe soe long againste him: Brusanus againe, knowing his quarrell to be Iust, and therefore not offenciue to God, thought himselfe dishonoured that a periured knight should stand so long before him: both of them thus blowing the coales of their anger, which wer already set on a fire, the fray began againe betweene them more eager then euer it had beene before: so that the whole multitude were filled with great admiration, to see such extraordinarye prowesse betweene the two knightes, but Brusanus comforting himselfe with the equitie of his cause, discharged soe mightie a blowe at the head of Arcadius, that not-with-standing his helmet was forged of so fine steele that no sworde might pearce it, yet the weight of the stroke was such, that it brought Arcadius into such amasement that he tumbled from his horsse, and fell downe dead to the ground, where at the beholders altogether gaue a great shoute thinking him assuredlye to be slaine: you may immagine this was a comfortable sight to the queene, of whose safetie there was soe little hope, that they lefte her still standing bound fast to the stake: but Brusanus alighting from his horsse, paced easily towardes Arcadius, and seeing him lying in such an extasie, thought it would haue beene to greate a disparagment to his honour, to haue stricken a knight lyeng in his case: walking therfore some fewe turnes, Arcadius in the meane time recouering againe his sences, sodainely start vp, and grasping his sword in both his hands, smote Brusanus behinde him, such a blowe vppon the head, that his legges began to yeelde vnder his body, and much adoe he had to recouer himselfe from falling: here began againe a more fierse and terrible incounter on foote, then all that had passed before on horsbacke: but Brusanus determining to make a shorte dispatche, heaped suche blowes vppon Arcadius, that hee vnreuited his right poulderne, soe that his whole shoulder lay all disarmed, and Brusanus marking the aduantage strake him so mighty a blowe, that he gaue him there a mortall wounde, where-with Arcadius let fall his sword to the grounde, not longer able to make resistance: Brusanus likewise stayeng his hand, said vnto him: Sir knight, the noble courage that I haue founde to be in thee, maketh me to pittie thy case, haue nowe compassion of thy selfe, and hasarde not the perdition bothe of thy bodye and soule, by dyeng in a wronge cause, restore the ladye againe to that reputation, wherein thou hast so iniuriouslye slaundered her, and liue: What (qd. Arcadius ) doest thou thinke, though fortune hathe fauoured thee in attaining the battaill that my courrage doth faile me, in persisting to the vttermost what I haue vndertaken, no, I both defie thee and that compassion, where-with (as thou saiest) thou art mooued towardes me, followe thy aduantage which oportunity hath offered thee, fortune may assist thee to glory in my death, but in the conquest of my minde, thou shalt neuer haue cause to triumph: Brusanus finding him in this desperate resolution, said vnto him: Unhappy man, although thou haue no greater regarde to thine owne saluation, yet God defende that I should be the instrument of thy euerlasting perdition, neither is it my custome to oppresse him that is vnresistable, and althoughe thou deniest to confesse thy shamefull impositions where-with thou hast slaundered the Queene, yet assure thy selfe I haue other sufficient meanes to make the matter so euident, as all the worlde shall witnesse of thy trechery, and that to thy greater shame: for the rest I leaue it betweene God and thine owne conscience, beseching the heauens thou maiest yet liue to repente, for anye other harme, I wish thee none at all: Arcadius, noting the vertue of this stranger knight, after he had a little deliberated with himselfe, was stroke into a sodaine remorse of his owne conscience, and hauing lost the greatest parte of his bloud by the largnes of his wound, feeling himselfe now to begin to faint, he called for the principall maiestrates and officers there present, before whom he confessed the whole conspiracy betweene the Duke and himselfe, fully aquiting the Queene of all former suppositions, and he had not scarce finished his speeches, but his breath vanished into the ayre and left his body sencelesse. Eriphila is restored: the yoong Princesse Valeria presented to the maiestrates, Brianto murdereth himselfe, Antipholus, is returned. Vppon this confession they presently inlarged the queene, ioyfuly restoring her to her former honour, and waiting vppon her withall duetifull attendaunce, the multitude gaue harty thankes vnto god that had thus safely deliuered their good queene, who had euer demeaned her selfe most gratiously to all subiectes: heere they began with generall exclamation to accuse the duke in sundry pointes of tirany: Brusanus, finding so fit oportunity, gentelly requested the whole company a litle while to stay, for that he had a matter of great importance wherewith to aquaint them, by this time they might see a smal company came riding towardes them, as they drewe neere they might perceiue a gentleman who rode all before the rest, with a gentlewoman behind him, the man they knewe to bee Fuluius, of the woman they could haue no weting, for that her face was couered with a scarfe: then might they see an other who was bound as a prisoner, and surely garded with armed men, whome they knewe to be Vagoe, being altogether thus come to the whole prese, Brusanus humbly kissing his hande, tooke downe the gentlewoman, and leading her by the hand before the maiestrates he said: Behold I deleuer heere amongst you, your yoong princesse, of whose safetie I would wish you should haue a greater regard then hetherto you haue had, for the rest of her aduenture, and what fortune hath befalne her, I leaue to her owne reporte: discouering then her face by taking away the vayll, the whole assembly knewe her assuredly to be their princesse Valeria: heere began againe a greater admiration then any what so euer had hetherto happened: but Valeria breefely related vnto them, the manner how she was conueied from the rest of her company as they were hunting in the forrest, the villany that was offered vnto her by Vago and his fellow Frestus, and how she was miraculously deliuered by this straunger knight Aristo (for Brusanus not otherwise willing to be knowne, so named himselfe) Vago confirmed these premisses to be true, confessing further how the duke had hired both him and his fellowe to murther the princesse, and how that daies pleasure of hunting was appointed to no other purpose, but for their oportunity to performe that enterprise, these matters being thus manifested, the maiestrates presently appointed a gard as well in the defence of the princesse, as also of the queene her mother, and certaine noblemen were chosen to holde the gouernment in the behalfe of the princesse, vntill the returne of Antipholus from Constantinople: The duke by espialls hauing got inteligence of all these premisses, and finding himselfe to be frunted in all his enterprises, and that his whole conspiracies were thus broken out, being priuate in his chamber onely accompanied with Lucius, the man that was most trusted with all his vngratious practises, burst out into these speeches and said. O caitife most accursed, hath thy fortune concluded with this consequence, is this the frutes of thy long premeditated practise, hast thou laid a plot for thy aduauncement to honour, and is it broken out to thy eternall shame and infamy, o what else what better couldst thou looke for, hath not thy practises bin abhominable, thy enterprises detestable, thy indeuours hatefull, and the whole course of thy life filthy and odible, o that the bowells of the earth would now open and deuour my treasons, my conspiracies, and other my shamelesse deameanures, together with this detestable body, that the world might be purged of this filthy infection, and the remembraunce of both might dye to all posterity, but what standest thou vppon these pointes, thou art nowe to sit vppon thy selfe as iudge, and against thy selfe to pronounce iudgement, dispaire then wretch in thine owne wickednes, and let a desperate death finish that cursed life that was so prone to mischiefe, and so ready to persist in all deuilesh wickednes: without any further speeches he sudainelye strake him self through the body with his owne dagger, where with Lucius crieng for helpe, many came rushing into the chamber, where the Duke lay weltering in his owne bloud, so that in very short space his life vanished, and lefte his bodye breathlesse, the rumour of the dukes death was sudainly spred through the citie, and officers were immediately sent to examine the circumstaunces, who to finde out the better certainty aprehended Lucius, whome after they had many wayes apposed, he voluntaryly confessed, that the onely cause why the duke had so practised the death of the queene his wife, was for the loue he bare to Calynda, who being many times louingly solicited by the duke, in the end an nightes meeting was agreed on between them, when they both confirmed their amorous desires, and likewise concluded the death of the queen, Calynda hoping to succeede for a second bride to the duke: vppon this confession they attached Calynda, committing her to close prison, assuring her no better fauour, then the aspirity of the lawes would alot her: Brusanus being still resident in the citie, refused sundry rich presents, liberall offers, and honourable curtesies, presented vnto him as well by the yoong princesse as by the queene her mother, & languishing now in greefe, with the memory of his former fortunes, he knewe no better meane to make satisfaction to Moderna, then to suffer himselfe to be sacrifised by the hands of her brother Antipholus, whome he knewe had pursued him but to that end to be reuenged, resting therefore in this resolution, not otherwise knowne then by the name of Aristo: it was not long but Antipholus returned, who was receiued into the citie with great honour and triumph, but what ioy was made by the princesse Valeria, I bare not vndertake to discipher, and you may well thinke it was much. Brusanus and Antipholus are brought to meete in a gardin, the manner of their incounter, Valeria: pacifieth Antipholus, he protesteth frendeship to Brusanus. Some fewe daies ouer-passed thus in pleasure, in which meane space Antipholus was made acquainted with euery stratagem practised both against the princesse and her mother, although the narrow escape (especially of his most dearest beloued) gaue him great cause to reioyce, yet failing of that reuenge he intended to Brusanus, his mirth was something mitigated, with this gaule of discontentment: which being espied by Valeria, whose eies were still watchfull ouer her beloued, by an easie intercesion, he confessed vnto her the cause of his greefe: Valeria calling to mind the promise Aristo had before made vnto her in the forrest, comforted Antipholus, assuring him within very short space, so to deliuer Brusanus into his handes, as at his owne discretion he might minister such punishment as to himself might seeme sufficient, & although Antipholus, wist not what meanes Valeria, had to effecte such a matter, so much by himselfe desired, yet he rested something satisfied, hoping she would bring it to passe according as she had promised: Valeria minding to loose no time, sent immediatly to Aristo to challeng his promise in the premisses: Aristo then setteled in opinion as before you haue heard: returned this answere, that notwithstanding hee must confesse Brusanus to be a most infortunate creature, yet hee likewise knewe him to be a prince, and therefore consideration was to be had, and that for diuers respectes not to betray him openly: but if he might be brought priuily to speake with Antipholus, in some secret place betweene themselues, he would not then refuse so to satisfie Antipholus in his desires, as it should well apeare that Aristo had well discharged the office of a frende, although not to Brusanus, yet to Valeria: the greatest matter that was nowe to be cared for, was how to bring Antipholus and Aristo into some place secretly to conferre, which was not long in performing, for the very next morning Valeria caused Aristo to be priuily conueyed through her owne pallace into a most delicate orchard, very larg and spacyous, and shadowed thicke with trees: heere his conducter lefte him all alone, and accordingly as Valeria had commaunded him presently in like manner to fetch Antipholus: Aristo nowe being alone by himselfe and there with all vtterly disfurnished of weapon, the which he purposedly had lefte behinde him, and thinking now to finde an ende of all his misfortunes, hee entered into these speeches. O Moderna, behold thy sorrowfull Brusanus, who disdaining heere his loathsome life, hastes on his fatall houre to vewe thy heauenly face: and if anye auncient loue be lefte to consider of thy vnfortunate friend, accept of his oblation who offereth for his misse no lesse then the price of his bloud: behold I say his grieffes, whose dayly teares are witnesses of his woes: and although til this time I haue prolonged my loathed life, yet in my thoughtes, I euerye day haue dyed: but sith the destinies haue now agreed to free me from fortunes further despight, and that my happy houre is thus concluded by the fates, graunte me nowe that my deceased ghost may haue accesse vnto thy heauenly presence, and that my sorrowing soule maye for euer attende thee in the Elisian fieldes: By this time Antipholus was come into the garden, and walking by himselfe alone to finde out he wiste not whome, he espied Brusanus, and being as quickly inraged with fury, as he did as sodainly know him, he hastely drew out his sword, & running towrads him, he said: Traytor & villaine that thou art, coulde thy loue towardes my sister make thee disloyall towards her father, iniurous to me her brother, and both false & faithlesse to thy deare friend Dorestus, or couldest thou immagine thy villany would escape vnpunished, or diddest thou thinke the whole circuit of the earth could haue harboured thee in safetie: but tell me speedely what hast thou done with my sister, or where hast thou left her, Brusanus answered thus: Where thou tearmest me to be a traytor or a villaine, thou knowest thou doest me wronge, touching my misdemeanure towardes thy father, thy selfe, or my friend, I will not seeke to excuse, for that I sholude not disswade for the punishment wherwith thou threatenest me now in such displeasure: Alas, it is the thing that I then least feared, or nowe stande in doubte off, but where thou inquyrest what is become of thy sister, that question is it that stingeth my verye conscience, but knowe thou, she is dead, and yet to excuse her deathe by loue, were to excuse loue of murther, but if the losse of my owne life might haue renewed Moderna, mine owne hands should haue hastened my death, your weapon shoulde neuer hasarde it: if therfore my bloud may wash away the dishonour, spare it not, prosecute what thou hast soe long time sought for, neuer take pitie of him that takes none at all for himselfe, for there was neuer life for better cause yet bestowed: Truely (quoth Antipholus ) thou doest well to hate thy selfe for thou canst not hate a more cursed creature, but wretch thy Lady shall not longe be cumbred with so vile a soule: here withall he lift vppe his arme thinking to haue sheathed his sword in the body of Brusanus, who offered his naked brest to be pearced by his threatening weapon, but Valeria that was come into the orchyard, and came thither of purpose but to aquaint Antipholus with the partie to whome both her selfe and her mother had beene so much beholding, and being at this instant hard at the heeles of Antipholus, hearing his last pronounced wordes, and seeing the weapon manaced, against him that had so valiantly defended her, she hastely caught holde on his arme, then falling downe before him on her knees she saide: O Antipholus, by the honour of the noble name thou bearest, by that inviolate magnanimity that is in thee, by that constante promisse thou hast kept towardes mee, staye thy hande (I beseech thee from practising so horrible impietie, but if thy choller be suche as thou wilt not desist, execute then thy crueltie vppon mine own person, who hath vnwitingly betraied this harmelesse Gentleman, let me (I say) by whome the first error spronge, make this action tragicall by my proper fall, for God defende that Valetia should euer liue that day, to see his bloud spilte, who hath preserued me from so many periles: Antipholus taking her vp by the hand saide, do you know Valeria for whome you pleade, this is Brusanus, the onelye man I hate, against whome I haue protested to be a mortall foe: and this (said Valiria ) is Aristo, that very man who saued me from rauishment; preserued mee from being murthered, deliuered my mother from shamefull death, all this he performed by his valor and prowes: but if this be Brusanus as you say, coulde you glory in the fall of so noble a Prince, O my Lord Antipholus consider from what occasion this deadly quarrell hath his limmites, he hath stolne away your sister from your fathers courte, was it thinke you in contempt of your father, in dispight of your selfe, or for the loue of your sister, or coulde it be done without her owne consent, if loue then were the meane to inforce this enterprise, howe Iniurious woulde you proue to the diety of Cupide, hat would make loue the originall of suche a deadlye hate: but who is so fearefull that loue will not make to bould, who so doubtfull, that beauty will not make desperat, or what enterprise is ther so hard, that a man wil not hasard to obtaine his faire mistres: I hope the effectes of loue hath some working in your selfe, and would you neglecte to attempt whatsoeuer were behouefull to the attainment of your beloued: I say no more, but if euer Valeria may moue pitie in your consideration, forget this conceaued griefe, and esteeme of the matter no other then it is: the obiect is loue, and what carpet knight so cowardly, that would not aduenture for his Lady, or what dame so dainty with dread, that woulde not hasarde her selfe, with the onely parragon of the world: Here she made a pause expecting what Antipholus would aunswere but he that was both charmed with her words, and inchaunted with her lookes, coulde render no other replye, but breathing forthe a pitious sighe streined from the very bottome of his hart, he threwe the sworde out of his hand, as a manifest witnes of his relenting minde, which beeing perceiued by Brusanus, he saide as followeth. O cruell fortune, that will graunt me no fortune, to be infortunate, but I beseech thee Antipholus, shewe mee pittie, by being pitilesse, & for so much as the Gods seeme deafe, and not to heare, the destinies dull and not to helpe me, lift vp once againe thy weapon to dispatch me of life, that other-wise will neuer be eased of griefe, yeelde therefore the vnhappiest man that liueth, the rest he seeketh for and liue thou Valeria to inioy thy constant friend Antipholus. Antipholus wel noting the inward perplexitie of Brusanus, and being nowe mooued with wonderfull remorse, to se his passionate demeanure, euen at this instante his choller was conuerted to compassion, his deadlie hate, to intiere loue, and the rather to show his hartie affection, Imbracing Brusanus in his armes he said. O Brusanus, it is better to liue with a small gaule of griefe, then to dye exempted cleane from grace, better to prolong on a life led in miserie, then to hasten on death without hope of mercy, for in life we haue time left vs to speake of the incombrances of fancie, but after deathe no possible meanes to redresse endlesse calamity, and although I knowe your owne wisdome better able to direct you, then my skill wil aford me to instructe you, yet in token of an euerlasting amity to be had betweene vs, I will yeelde you mine aduise, the which although it fit not your bodie, I doubte not but it shall profite your mynde: If then this distemprature that thus ouer-ruleth you, bee ingendered by euill humore, an apothicary drugge may helpe to amend all, but if (as I am most perswaded) your owne affections minister the matter of your malady, reason must be the corosiue to eate out the corruption that hath infected you: but is it the losse of my sister (who as you tell me is dead) that hath drawne you into this desperat fit: O Brusanus, her death I must confesse, is so displeasaunt vnto me that it is grieuous to my very soule, but what should we sorrowe for that we art not able to remedy, for who can withstand what the destinies haue decred, when we are all borne subiecte both to nature, fortune, time and occasion, sith then in our creation we haue brought with vs this subiection to worldly casualties, should we make that grieuous to our selues which the heauenly powers haue ordained common to all: no, we must not grudge against the prouidence of god, who ordereth casuall thinges, necessaryly: there is nothing then otherwise happened to my sister, then hath bin appointed by the powers of heauen, and may it not be thought that by the iust determination of the gods shee was summoned to yeelde nature her due, beeing thought vnworthy to liue and inioy a prince of so excellent perfection and vertue: cast of then ( Brusanus ) these vnacquainted sorrowes, which as they are the slaues of imperfections, so they be the disparagement of & honourable mind: the greatest conquerours be they that can conquer themselues, and honour is soonest ministred to him which can maister his owne affections: and behold Antipholus offereth heere to Brusanus loue, honour, frendship, and perpetuall amitie: Antipholus ending heere his discourse, was thus answered by Brusanus: I know not my Lord Antipholus, howe to render condigne thankes for this vnlooked for curtesie, and although your learned perswasions be such as I am not able to contradict, yet it is not possible by reason to redresse that which no good counsaile is able to cure, for some inueterat euilles in our externall partes, may well be remoued with medicine, but a sorrowe beeing grafted in the hart, wil hardly abide the grappel of perswasion, and my sickenes I must confesse is a hart sore, the salue of which sith it is remoued from my hope by froward fortune, I deeme it more fitter for me (pasionate as I am) to dy, then thus ouerburdened with continuall sorrowe, my life should proue a liuing death, neither can I denie but the losse of my Moderna, is the originall of my fit, (which you account desperat) but indeed ingendred by he vehemency of loue, yea chast loue, a loue not setteled on the vsuall pleasure of the flesh, but on the grounded vnity of the hart, whereby her soule was so firmely alied to mine, as no showers of misfortune or breach of time can alter the quallity, the quantity whereof as it could not be conceiued on earth, so it taketh his effect in heauen, the fates haue berefte me of this rest, and suffered my flower to be parched by misfortune, and death hath seperated her soule from her body, and sent her to that place of pleasure, where she shall receiue a crowne of immortall glorie, but the seperation of her from me, the gods haue made to this purpose, to make me learne the mutability of this wretched life, and to consider of the eternity and wonderfull essence of the heauens, where they haue placed my frende to this ende, that I with more desire behold the skie, that being rauished with the maiestie therof, I might likewise become heauenly: and forget to be earthly,: cease then I beseech you to striue against the streame, my sorrowes are so settled, as no perswasions wil remoue them, and in requitall of your exceeding curtesie Brusanus, voweth heere to Antipholus loue, reuerence and honour, and so long as it shall please the gods to continue this wretched life, I will not forget to pray to the heauens to send you that contentment, which I know you haue wished to me, Antipholus and Valeria both seeing his resolution, would not for the present appose him with further speeches, yet hoping in the end to alter his determination, they inticed him into the house, where a most sumptious lodging was purposly prepared for him and manye pleasaunt conceites by sundry meanes practised to haue moued him to mirth, but nothing could be deuised that might beguill his pensiue thoughtes, and within verye short space he grewe to be sicke and kept his bed, you may well thinke he wanted no attendaunce both from Valeria and the queene her mother, but Antipholus could not helpe him, wee will therefore a little while leaue him to the mercy of his fit. Antipholus pronounceth sentence of death against Calynda, she is discouered to be his sister Moderna, she is brought to comfort Brusanus in his sicknes iustice duely executed against those that had bin practisers with the duke, both against the princesse and her mother, and to this end, did sit himselfe in person with the criminall iudges, (accompanied with other noble men) at an open sessions, where Lucius and Vago were both condemned to the gallowes: Calynda in like manner was there to bee tried, and was charged with conspiracy against the queene Eriphila, who seeing her brother sitting vppon the bench, to whome she was very loath to be known, and being in her owne conceit void of all hope for euer to heare of Brusanus, did therefore thinke it better for her to dye, then longer to liue so much surcharged with sorrow: shee therefore confessed the inditement, and pronounced her selfe guilty to as many articles as were opposed against her: vpon her own confession Antipholus gaue sentence that the nexte day shee should bee burned in the same place, and with that fewell which had bin before prepared for the queene: The sessions being broken vppe, Antipholus finding his Lady and her mother together in company, he discoured vnto them how hee had disposed Lucius and Vago: relating further how frankly Calynda confessed her conspiracies, and what was likewise determined against her: but the queene whose mind had bin hetherto carried away with her owne misfortunes, that the remembraunce of Calynda was vtterly out of her thought, and calling nowe to minde that by her onely meane, she had gathered so much light, as contained no lesse then the safety of her owne life: she began heere to consider with her selfe that Calynda could not possibly be culpable in any il meaning towardes her: she therefore requested Antipholus that she, might bee sent for, and that her selfe might speake with her assuring him further that what so euer Calynda hade confessed against her selfe: did rather proceed from some inward conceit that afflicted her owne mind, then of any ill pretence she could haue towardes her, she hauing had such former experience of her fidelity and loue: Antipholus answered, that besides her owne confession, Lucius had avowched the whole matter against her, him selfe giuing a whole nightes attendaunce on the duke, while hee was with Calynda in her owne chamber, where after he had taken the frutes of his lewd desires, euen then he made her priuie to the rest of his practises, when she gaue her consent to assist him in his enterprises, hoping after ward he would haue married her, accordingly as he then made promise vnto her: the queene Eriphila requested of Antipholus, that Lucius might yet bee further examined, what time it might be that this meeting was appointed, and the very night of this confederacy: which being accordingly performed, he according to the truth confessed it to be, that very same night before when ye duke on the morning had appointed his hunting in the forrest; the queene finding his rekoning to fal out iust with her own computation, to disburden Antipholus from further misedoubting, she discoursed vnto him, her owne practise with Calynda, and how with much adoe and great perswasion, she had won her to appoint the duke that nightes entertainment in her owne chamber, who had manye times before solicited her with louing protestation: neither could she denie, nor thinke it any shame to confesse, but that at that instant she supplied the place of Calynda, and in a happy time (as she thought it) that was so much behouefull for her owne good, for the duke immagining (indeed) that he had imbraced his desired Calynda, vnfoulded vnto her the summe of all his pretended treasons where the rather to prouide for her better safetie, she seemed to consent to her owne distruction, and therefore to conclude, she thought her selfe especially beholding to Calynda, by whose meanes she came to knowledge of the mischiefe that was intended against her by the duke her husband, which otherwise might haue lighted vppon her by poisoning, murthering, or some other like violent death, that might haue bin priuily practised: heere Antipholus (little weaning how neere Calynda was to himselfe) examined further what shee was, where shee was borne, or of what perentage shee was descended: Eriphila made answere, that she was a straunger, and not otherwise knowne vnto her then by her owne report, whome shee first found in the desert grieuously wounded, and lyeng as a dead carcase vppon the ground, and how by her meanes shee was both reuiued, and likewise cured, since which time she had remained attendant vppon her, still gouerning her selfe both wisely and vertuously in all her demeanures, onely she perceiued her to bee continually perplexed with some colorous passion that troubled her mind, but what the occasion might be she could not learne, neither could she imagin but this was the cause that she had so vntruely accused her selfe, as beeing weary of her own life: Antipholus, who not aboue two daies before, had receiued from Brusanus, the verye manner of his sisters misfortune, conceiues by al coniectures that this should be Moderna, and beeing tickled with this hope, hee sent immediately to haue her brought before him, intending at her comming to take a better suruey of her, then before hee had done when she was araigned, the messenger founde Calynda at her priuate meditation, setteling her selfe the nexte day to dye, confirmed in opinion, that nothing could better betide her then death, that should yeeld a truce to all her conceiued sorrowes, was loath therefore to make any moe iourneyes til the next day that she hoped to end al her trauailles, but there was no other remedy, which beeing by her perceiued, shee went along with her conductors, who brought her where Antipholus was abiding her comming, accompanied with his lady and her mother, and although Calinda had done so much as in her lay to disguise her selfe, and had soe shadowed her face that it might not well be discerned, yet Antipholus at her first comming tooke so narrowe a viewe, that he immediately knew her, and being replenished with vnspeakable Ioy (which for a little he dissembled) he saide to the Queene: Madame, is this ye same Calinda, that you haue tould me off, who hath beene so much beholding vnto you, as the sauing of her owne life, dothe consist: My lord Antipholus (aunswered the Queene) this is that very same Calinda, whose life (by straung aduentures) I saued in the forrest where she was left for dead, and whose fortune hath sence requited me with the very like curtisie, so that she hath well discharged that debt: here the Queene directing her speeches to Calinda, gaue her very gratious and comfortable words, demaunding of her what might be the occassion that she had so slaundered her selfe, to worke her owne confusion, but Calinda whose greatest care was to keepe her selfe vnkowen to her brother, stoode still without making answere: Antipholus, who was not longer able to hide his owne affections, letting fall aboundance of teares, and imbracing Calinda in his armes, he said vnto her: O Moderna doest thou disdaine to acknowledge me for thy brother, that haue euer loued thee as tenderly as the balles of mine owne eies, and haue accompted the no lesse deare vnto me, then the very hart that is within my body: and couldest thou soe dissemble thy name, disguise thy parson, and belye thy selfe, that I should giue censure of her death, that woulde haue proued a more terrible sting to mine owne couscience, then all the torments, that hell it selfe is able to aford: Moderna finding herselfe to be discryed,  & hearinge the louing wordes of her brother, whome she rather thought woulde haue punished, then pitied her, aunswered thus: My most deare and louing brother, I cannot deny but that your loue hath beene no lesse tender vnto me then here you haue reported, neither coulde you better showe it, nor your selfe vse a more kinde or brotherly part, then to pronounce sentence of death against her, whose life is both loathsome, and hatefull to her selfe: hauing lost the very anker-holde of all my happines, the onely castell of my comfort, my friend and louer Brusanus: whome I assure my selfe to haue shortened his owne life onely for my cause, whose presence sence I coulde not inioy here on earth, my very soule mourneth til it bee disseuered from this earthly substance, that I might accompany my Brusanus in the heauens: neither shall he wante my praiers, nor I omit to make daylye sacrifice with my teares, till the destinies haue dated out that blessed houre, whereof I now finde my selfe preuented by iniust fortune: Valeria and Eriphila standing by, and gathering by former circumstances, that Calinda was now become Moderna, and sister to Antipholus: noting likewise the wonderfull vehemencye of her affections, towardes Brusanus, and knowing againe in him the very like towardes her, were bothe mooued with exceeding compassion, and filled with incredible Ioy: and after they had both of them saluted her with as greate signes of good will, as it was possible for them, by out-warde showes to expresse: Antipholus that was alike Ioyfull as wel that he had gotten a medicine for the malady yt vexed Brusanus, as a salue for his sisters sore, thought it not good therefore to neglecte longer time till he had ministred reliefe to both their deseases: but taking his sister by the hand, and being accompanied with Valeria and Eriphila, he brought her vppe into the chamber, where Brusanus was lyeng in his bed, rather attending the houre which the fatall sisters shoulde apointe, then aspecting so good happe as succeedingly followed, and sitting himselfe downe vppon his beds side, he saide. The comfortable meting betweene Brusanus and Moderna, their marriage day is apointed, the nuptiales likewise of Antipholus and Valeria performed together on a day. Is it possible ( Brusauns ) that a Prince of such vertue, shoulde so surrender himselfe to his owne misconceiued opinnions, as not to be able to brooke anye reason: you saye you loued my sister, if it be so, let your liking now be showen in louing her still that languisheth for you, comfort her with gladnes, in seeing you recouer your wonted helthe, that may kill her with sorrowe, in beholding you to be thus distempered with griefe: beholde ( Brusanus ) who presenteth her selfe to your compassion, my sister Moderna supposed to be deade but yet reserued by the heauens, either to be made happy in your safe recouery, or other-wise thus passionating your selfe, to remaine for euer infortunate. Brusanus amased with this heauenly sounde, hearing Moderna named to be aliue, immagined himselfe to be in a dreame, and lifting vppe his eies, he loked ful in the face of Moderna, that was placed by her brother fast by his beds side; and knowing it vndoubtedly to be the true picture of his Lady, lay still gasing vpon her as a man that had beene in some traunce: Moderna againe hearing the name of Brusanus, and casting her eies vppon him where he lay in his bed, knowing him immediatly to be her desired friend, the sight whereof did so rauish her with ioy, that she was likewise stricken mute, not able to giue a word: the one of them thus greedely fixing their eies vppon the other, seemed bothe as a cupple of dumbe Images: but Antipholus desirous to shake them out of these drousie immaginations, began in this manner to cheare vp Brusanus: Why how now Brusanus, what are you inuocating to the Gods, or blessing your selfe from diuels, fearing I haue presented you with some transformed spirite, doubt nothing man, but take her by the hand, and tell me then if she be not made of flesh and bone: Antipholus there taking his sister by the arme he deliuered her to Brusanus, who no soner laid hand of her but his spirites began to reuiue: and rowling himselfe vppon his pillowe, he burst out into these wordes. O happy day, yea ten times blessed be the houre, when I liue to se this comfortable sight: Moderna imbracing him fast in her armes, mutually mixing their ioyful tears with louing kisses. Of which pleasant passions, wer also glad copartners, both Antipholus himselfe, and in like manner the younge Princesse, with her mother: but after the vehemency of their affections, had a little giuen scope to the rest of their sences, and that their tongues were set at libertie: O how manye sweete hony words were shuffeled out betweene them (but especially by Moderna ) soe dangerous to be spoken off, as I dare not set them here downe, fearing I shoulde infecte wemen with too much kindnes, that are of themselues, so naturally inclined to pittie: I will therefore passe them ouer with silence, let this suffyce: Brusanus within three daies was perfectly recouered, so much to the contentation of Antipholus, that all thinges were in common betweene them, the like was betweene Valeria and Moderna: and after they had a while pleasantly discoursed of euery accident how it fell out and happened amongst them: they concluded their nuptiales, which they appointed to be celebrated both in one day, for the solemnising whereof great preperation was ordayned, as well for Antipholus and Valeria, as for Brusanus and Moderna, where I thinke it best for a season to leaue them in this contented happines, being other-wise called to prosecute a further occasion, and thou carefull Clio, that hast hitherto guided my muse, to figure forth dolorous discourses, and to blason out such sorrowfull aduentures, assist me yet to display matters of like mishappe, and of more accidentall calamitie: and helpe me thou Bellona to ringe the Larum bell, that must now directe my penne to wright of warres, and to blase the bloudy broyles of Mars, who was now perdominaunte in the midell heauens, whose influence prefigured these insuinge troubles. Astulpho acompanied with Dorestus, leading a great armie, betweene them, are aryued vppon the confines of Hungaria, Myletto sendeth for assystance to Caristo, Prince of Piamount. It hath beene before mentioned, that vppon the flight of Brusanus and Moderna, from the Illerian courte, it was determined by Astulpho, immediatlye to commence warres against Myletto King of Hungaria, in reuenge of his sonnes abuse, and that his owne sonne Antipholus shoulde followe the quest of Brusanus into Grecia, whose successe you haue nowe harde, Astulpho accordingly leuied a huge and puissaunt army, and being acompanied with Dorestus with 10000. Epirotes in his assistaunce, they marched in braue and warre-like manner, towardes the confines of Hungaria. The Hungarians, that had long inioyed the benifit of sweet and quiet peace, were very much amased to heare this sodaine Allarum of warre, but as no man can perfectly know ye blessednes of peace, that hath had no triall of the burthen of warre, soe a long peace bringeth with it many discommodities, making men insolent commonly through to great prosperitie, as also nice, lauish, & effeminate, through abundance of wealthe and solenes, and without all doubte, they that are to muche affected to peace and quietnes, do weaken themselues by little and little before they be aware: & their example doth likewise molifie the courage of youth, whereby they lye open to the iniuries of those that wil seeke to inuade them: For this cause saith Philopamenus, in the time of peace, we must practise our selues to be more skilful in war, & must likewise enter into warre, but to ye end to establish peace, but ye Hungarians neglecting this principle, bound theselues prentises, so much to this peaceable desire, that they had both forgotten their martiall disciplines & vtterly shaken of their militarynes, but common necessity inforced them to armes, the enimie as they hard was marching, and they had no respite now to forethinke them what should haue bin done, but speedily to determine what must bee done, they presently therefore fel to mustering throughout their whole prouinces, and in euery corner of the kingdome of Hungaria, great multitudes of men were prouided and armed, captaines, and leaders were appointed, such as had neuer seene ensigne displaied in the fielde, vnlesse perhaps at the fetching home of a maypole: some that were lately come from the court and had carried pantoffelles, some as newly come from schole, and had read Vigesius: some old souldiers that had bin trained in a noble mans chamber, some that was able to marciall whole millions with their penne, yet knewe not how to charg their pike: some that would haue ouerthrowne an armie with their tongues, yet knewe not how to set an hundred in good order of ray: some rash, some hairebraind, some wilful, some foolish hardy, most vnskilfull, all appointed by fauour, none by desert: by this time word was brought to Miletto, that a Herald of armes was com from the king of Illeria with some message, and the king desirous to heare his newes, willed him forthwith to be brought in, the Herald without any salutation at all, told the king that he was a messenger of very ill newes, for in respect of the villany offered by his sonne Brusanus to the king his maister, by stealing away his daughter, he was therefore in the name of Astulpho to bid him open defiannce, willing him forthwith to aunswere whether he would abide the hasard of warre, or other wise to surrender to such conditions of peace, as the king his maister should afterward by an ambassader prescribe vnto him, the king willed the Herald to be well entertained for that night, the next morning he would returne him with aunswere to his maister, the king of Hungaria, now vnderstandeing the quarrell to proceed by the lewd demeanure of his sonne, thinking him still to continue his lacsiuious manner of life (began vtterly to dispaire of his amendment) conferred with his nobility of his intent which was, to disinherit his vicious sonne Brusanus from the succession of the kingdome, and to leaue it the inheritaunce of his vertuous daughter Leonida, and for that Caristo the prince of Piemount had lately requested his daughter in mariage, he could not better bethinke him, then with all expedition to send a messenger vnto him, to pray his assistaunce with twentie thousand souldiers against his enimie the king of Illeria nowe in armes against him, and the warres being once ended, then to bestowe his daughter vppon him in mariage, and her dowry to assure him (after his owne dissease) the kingdome of Hungaria, which offer hee knewe would well content the prince: the whole assembly marueilously well allowed of the kinges determination, knowing the prince to be a most magnificent gentleman, indued with wonderfull courage and vertue, to the end therefore that no delay might be vsed, they gaue their speedy consentes, beseeching the king in all possible hast, to send awaye a messenger to that purpose, which was accordingly performed. Miletto minding so much as he might to dally with the king of Illeria, to the end to win time, hoping shortely to be assisted by Caristo, the nexte day calling the Herald sent from Astulpho he willed him to tell his maister for aunswere, that although he feared not his forces being able euery way to with stand it, yet the care hee had of his subiectes safetie, & the loue yt he had to preserue the liues of his, commons had such remorse in him, tha he rather desired to continue them stil in peace (if it might be had with any resonable conditions) then to put his hope in the hasarde of fortune, when he desired nothing lesse then to maintaine the quarrell of his sonne, vnlesse it had falne out in an honester cause: the Herald hearing this aunsweare, craued a safe conducte for an Ambasadore, that should be sent from the king his maister, which was immediately deliuered vnto him vnder the kings signet Dorestus is sent to parle with Miletto, he falleth in loue with Leonida, Caristo is ariued with twenty thousand Piemountes, Dorestus is sent backe with a cold comfort. This messenger returning to Astulpho with this answere, Dorestus was the man that was appointed for this imbassage, the conditions that were deliuered him from Astulpho to agree vppon, were short and sweete: the first was that Miletto the king of Hungaria should acknowledge himselfe a vassaill to Astulpho, and to hold his kingdome during his owne life from him, paying a yearely tribute of sixe hundred thousand duccates: the second was, that after his owne discease, it should be established by the whole estate, that the kingdome of Hungaria should remaine to the kings of Illeria, and to their successours for euer: the third and last was, that he should deliuer into the handes of Astulpho, sixe of his principall noblemen, which should remaine as pledges, for the performance of the promisses: prouided alwaies, that if Miletto could within one yeare deliuer his sonne Brusanus, either aliue or dead to Astulpho, that then the yearely tribute of six hundred thousand duccates should cease, but the rest to be performed as in manner afore said: these were the demaundes of Astulpho, giuen in commission to Dorestus, and vppon these conditions either to conclude peace, or present warre: Dorestus beeing thus dispatched from Astulpho, and being accompanied with a traine of braue gentlemen, departed on his iourney towards the citie of Larissa, where Miletto held his court, and beeing there arriued, the king was certified of his comming, who beeing in his chamber of presence, caused the Ambassador presently to be sent for, and so much the rather knowing him to bee Dorestus, the yoong prince of Epirus, so much famed for his many perfections, who courtiously doing obeisance to ye king, breefely deliuered his ambassage: Miletto hearing these proud demaundes, deuised so much as hee coulde to delaye the time (hoping very speedily to be assisted by Caristo ) aunswered that he could not on a sudaine dispatch so weighty a matter, but he must first take the aduise both of his counsaile, and the rest of his nobility, which done, within fewe daies he would returne him aunswere, in the meane time, he appointed that Dorestus with his traine, should be sumptuously sealled: while they were thus entertained in the court, accompanied with the gallantes, and lusty courtiers, that peerelesse parragon Leonida, daughter to the king, attended only a troupe of braue ladies and gentlewemen, passed through the chamber of presence, and was espied by Dorestus, who sudainely fixing his eies on this sweete aspect, was so rapt into a trance with the contemplation of her beauty, that his hart was so snared in the beames of her pleasaunt glaunces, that there was no remedy, he must yeelde to this first assault of fancy, but heere it were straung to bee told howe many contrary incounters, tossed in his minde, sometimes thinking to preferre his sute, yet that he thought was follye, beeing the daughter of his professed foe, neither would time suffer him to prosecute his purpose, nor present occasion permite him to make triall of his loue, and yet to linger still in that estate, hee thought was to much miserye, then he called to his mind how: Moderna had dispised him, and heere he began with disdainefull immaginations to condemne al weme of instability, of inconstancy, of lightnes, of incertainty, and to accuse them as creatures that were vowed to all manner of vanity: our gentleman thus tossed with the tempestes of these contrary cogitations (as the vessel that is borne with the tide against the wind feeleth double force, and is compelled to yeelde to wind and waue) so Dorestus, the more hee sought to quench his loue by disdaine, the greater increased the flame of his desire, that faineting vnder the force of his inward tormentes, he withdrewe himselfe into his chamber, where shutting fast the dore, he began in this wise to discourse with himselfe: Ah Dorestus, thou camest hether a captaine, and wilt thou nowe returne a captiue, thy intent was to conquer, not to be vanquished, to fight with a launce, not to bee foild with loue, but how dost thou thinke to subdue Hungaria, that canst not vanquish thine owne affections, art thou able to quaill a kingdome, that canst not quaill thy foolish apetites, no, it will be hard for thee to triumph ouer others, that art not able to maister thy selfe, yeelde not then to this fresh alarume of loue, be not dasled with the beames of vading beauty, nor inamored with desire of euery dilicate damsell, for in time such blisse will turne to bale, and such delightfull ioy, to more dispitfull annoy, loue Dorestus will proue an enimie to thine honour, a foe to thy person, a canker to thy minde, a corosiue to thy conscience, a weakner to thye wit, a mollester of thye mind, a besotter of thy sences, and finally a deadly poison to all thy body: why hast thou not had some triall, hath not Moderna taught thee what frutes are to be found in loue, I hope thou hast not yet forgot what thou foundest by experience, but peace Dorestus dost thou speak of loue, or art thou in a dreame, why whome dost thou loue, is it Leonida: what the daughter of thy possessed foe, one that wisheth thy mishap, & partly prayeth to the gods for thy msfortune, no sure, I thinke thou art not so fond, she is not thy frend whome thou mayest hope to get: but thine enimy whome thou art not sure to gaine, nor neuer thinke she will requit thy merit with meed, or repay thy loue with liking, o no, she hateth thee Dorestus as a vowed enimy to her fathyr, & thy comming hether is to parle of peace, take then a truce with thine owne affections, and ende those warres which fancie hath begun, in thy selfe: but alas beauty hath runge the larum, and loue is the chieftaine and leader of the band, whoe hath alreadye subdued my sences, and taken prisoners, all my affections: and although wit would gladly fight it out, yet will, who shoulde take in hand the charge, hath surrendered himselfe, and is already yeelded, and reason not able to abide the assault, is likewise driuen to fly the field: Alas Dorestus, what victory canst thou hope for, more then to plead for pittie, and to seeke mercy at her handes, that may yet haue compassion and saue thy life: Dorestus without any further speeches determined resolutly to trie his fortune, and watching his best oportunity to bewray his liking to Leonida, hee found out her haunt where shee priuately walked euery day in the after none in a pleasant gardin fast adioyning to her owne lodging, whether hee secretly conueied himselfe, and being shrouded amongst the pleasaunte laurelles, Leonida accordinge to her custome pacing vp the allie softely by her selfe, was incountered by Dorestus, & humbly saluted her: Leonida something amased with this sudaine approch knowing him to bee a stranger, demaunded howe he came thither, Dorestus answered, by chaunce he happened into the place hauing lost his way, so doe many (quoth Leonida ) that seeke vnknowne waies, and likewise followe their owne wayes, but what hath brought you hither, or who hath bin your guide, my desire (aunswered Dorestus ) to see and withall to be satisfied, no worse guide vnder the sunne (said Leonida ) haue you not seene desire pictured both blind and flyeng, aswell to shewe his erroure as his hast, besides vnbridled to shewe his rashnes, and howe hardly he can be staied: Dorestus finding himselfe thus pritiely niped, was in a quandare howe hee might prosecute his vndertaken attempt, yet in the end he gaue the onset in this manner: the choice is hard lady Leonida, where partie is compelled, either by silence to dye with griefe, or by vnfoulding his mind to liue with shame, yet so sweete is the desire of life, and so soure the passions of loue, that I am inforced to preferre an vnseemely sute, before an vntimely death, loath I am to speake, and in dispaire I am to speed, in the one shewing my selfe a coward, in the other weieng myne owne case, for considering what loue is I faint: and thinking howe I am counted a foe, I feare: and so it is, that intending to be a victor, I am become a vassall: comming to conquere, I am vanquished, seeking to haue brought others into thrall: I haue lost mine owne liberty, I came to your fathers court a captaine, but am like to returne a captiue, my charge was to parle of peace, but my chance is to discourse of passion, your beauty madame (ah) your heauenly beauty, hath brought me into this bondage, your exquisit perfection hath snared my freedome: your curtesie onely may free me from care, or your crueltie crosse me with endlesse calamitie. Leonida, that had all this while listened to his tale, was so inflamed with a melancholy kind of heate, as shee was not of a long time able to vtter a word, yet at the last, as it were in a furie she deliuered this aunswere: Why Dorestus (quoth she) art thou become frantique, or deemest thou me to be out of my wits, if thy speeches be in iest, they are to broad weieng the case, if in earnest, they are to bad, considering the partie, to dally with Venus, that art vowed to Mars, argueth thee to be either a coward or a counterfeit, to make shewe of loue, that arriued heere in hate, sheweth thee to be infected with frensie or folly, but it is a blind goose that loues to heare the fox preach, and shee a louing foole that stoupes to her enimies lure, and therefore if I should loue, what must it be Dorestus, my fathers foe, the bloudy wretch that seekes his life, the cursed enimie to my cuntry, no no, he cannot fauour the stemme, that would cut downe the old stocke, he little respecteth the twig, that tendereth not the roote: he lightly loueth the child that deadly hateth the father: I may not therefore so far forget mine honour, mine honesty, my parentes, and my cuntrie, as to loue, nay not deadly to hate him, which is a foe to the least of these: cease then to seeke for loue where thou shalt finde nothing but hate, and assure thy selfe if thou didst loue as faithfully as thou dost flatter falsely, yet would I neuer belieue thee, requite thee, or any wayes pittie thee. Alas madame (aunswered Dorestus ) way my case with equity, if you hate me as I am a foe to Miletto, yet fauour me as I am a frend to Leonida: if you loath me as an enimy to your cuntry, yet pitty me as I am a captiue to your beautie: Tarpeia fauoured Titus though a foe in Rome, Scilla respected Minos. yet he beseaged Nisus: Tereus the prince of Thrace beeing sent by his father to defye Pandyon, the king of Athens, was inamoured of his daughter Progne, whereby in steede of fatall enmitie, there insued frendly amity: O what greater signe of affection, then where in liewe of hate, there insueth loue, it is to bee immagined, either a thing confirmed by the fates, or appointed by the gods, then where I haue done amise, I will not faile to make amendes, if I haue committed a fault, I am ready to render recompence: and as I haue bin your fathers foe, nowe will I be his faithfull frend, if I haue sought his disquiet, I will procure his rest, yea I will goe against the haire in all thinges, so I may please Leonida in any thing: Leonida breefely replied: Dorestus, your sudaine liking bewrayes the lightnes of your loue: and this your fond affection importes the ficklenes of your fancy, may hee bee counted a priuie frend, that shewes himselfe an open foe, for your examples, they be necessary caueates for ladies to be warned by: for if Progne loued her fathers foe, how wretchedly did Tereus requit her loyalty, for the other two: their gaines were perpetuall shame and endlesse discredit, for the one was slaine by the Sabines, the other likewise reiected by Minos: and therefore sir to conclude, you cannot more displease me, then in seeking to please me, and as for my father be his frend, or his foe, it is in your own choice: but for me, if I knowe no other cause to hate thee, this shall suffice, I wil neuer loue thee, & without any more speeches, away she flung in a great chafe, leauing Dorestus, alone by himself, who leauing likewise the place came into his chamber, where a little to ease his stomacke, he brake into these speeches: Of all euill which either god or nature hath laid vppon man, there is none so great but either reason may redresse, pleasure asswage, mirth mittigate, hearbes heale. or by some meanes or other may bee cured, loue onely excepted, whose force is so full of rancour, that phisicke can in no respect preuaile to helpe the patient, diseruing not the name of a disease, but rather the title of an vncureable mischiefe: yet importing such a shew of contentation, that it so inflameth our desires to purchase it, that we care not at what vnreasonable rate we buy it: if it be then so stronge, why is it not more stedfast, if it be so forceible, why is it not fixed, perhaps so it is in al sauing in me, I am ye odd perso on whome Cupide wil showe his cunninge, I am he that must chope and chaunge and liue by the losse: first forsaken by Moderna, now dispised by Leonida: howe art thou then perplexed Dorestus, thou louest without hope, and therefore liuest in ill hap, thou hournest in desire, but thou art couled with disdaine, and her father is thy foe, but if hee were thy friend, dothe not Leonida dispise thee, hath not she denyed thy sute, disdayned thy person, lightly respecting thy loue & as smally regarding thy seruice: onelye promissing this, while she liues to be thy protested foe: And what then fond foole, wilt thou shrinke for an april shower, knowest thou not that a deniall at the first is a graunt: and a gentle annswere, a flattering flowt, the more they seeme at the first to loath: the more we find at the last they loue, hope then the best Dorestus, for loue and fortune careth not for cowardes. By this time tidinges were brought to the courte, that Caristo Prince of Pyemounte was within three daies iourny, with a stronge armye of 20000. Pyemounts, and that the Prince himselfe would not faile the very next day to be at the courte, as well to salute the King and the Queene, as to see his dearely beloued mistres Leonida, for whose sake hee had vndertaken that seruice: Great ioy was made through the courte, at these happye tidinges, and no lesse preperation was made for the receiuing of the Prince: This was a colde comfort for Dorestus, who no soner vnderstood of the newes, but he could easely pronosticate of his owne successe, but when hee had certainly learned that Leonida was disposed by her father to Caristo, and how vppon that occasion the Prince had vndertaken armes: O how were his cares then increased, his spirites were troubled with millions of immaginations, sorrowe had ceased on all his partes, and setteled himselfe in the very bottome of his hart, dollor, griefe, care, anguish, dispaire, languor, with all their accomplices, had dispersed themselues through all his powers, and taken the full possession of him, as their owne proper right: But Myletto, who had lingered this time, but of purpose to heare from Caristo, and his drift being now dated out to his own desire, the next day he sent for Dorestus, to whome he deliuered these words: Prince Dorestus, I haue throughly considered of the proude demaunds sente vnto me from Astulpho, and wondering at his presumption, what should moue him to sende me any such greeting, as though I were not able to maintaine mine own right, that am an absolute King as himselfe and euery waie his equall, and as for my crowne and kingdome of Hungaria, as I haue hitherto kepte them in dispight of any enimie, so I doubt not but to continue them during mine own life, and after my decease, to leaue the succession to such heires as shalbe as likely to incounter him and his successors in Illeria, as for him or any of them by any meanes to oppresse Hungaria, for answere therefore take this, that by the assistaunce of God, within tenne daies, I wil meete him in the plaine fielde, and will giue him battaill, where I doubt not but to chase him from out my borders, to his great shame and infamy: This is the aunswere ( Derestus ) that I haue determined on, and now at your pleasure you may departe in safetie, hauing (according to the lawes of armes) a safe condite for your protection. The king without anye further wordes lefte Dorestus, who finding himselfe to be thus continually crossed, was at his wits end what course he might take, but calling to his minde howe that was no place for him to abide longer in, accompanied therefore with his traine he departed, but soe ouer-growne with griefe, that he passed no houre, minit, nor moment, without wofull wailinges, sorrowfull sobs, and sighes bitterly breathed out, in soe much that the Gentlemen his companions surmised his perplexitie to proceede of feare, hearing of the puisaunte armye conducted by Caristo: they began therefore both to comforte and to incourage him, and although their perswasions serued to litle purpose for the curing of his care, yet seeinge that his sorrowe would not salue his sore, but rather increase his sicknes, and that mourning would rather augment his miserie, then mitigate his maladie, he bare out the matter with as good countinance as his passion woulde permit, and comming to the campe, he declared his message to Astulpho, accordingly as Myletto had before deliuered. Myletto ioyning his armye with Caristo, doth march towardes Astulpho, they incounter in fight, howe Dorestus behaueth himselfe, Caristo is slaine by Dorestus, Myletto is put to a retreat, and driuen to saue himselfe by flight. Hungaria, burning, spoyling, killing, and ransaking all that euer came in his way: These lamentable occurrentes comming hourely to the eares of Myletto, of the spoyling of his subiectes, it caused him to make the more hast, and concluded with Caristo, promising (by the sacred oath of a King) both to giue him his daughter in marriage, and the kingdome of Hungaria, for his inheritaunce, and thus ioyning their forces togither, they marched towardes Astulpho, who was still wasting of the countrie, both by fire and sworde; and beeing come within a small distaunce where Astulpho lay incamped, they likewise intrenched themselues for that night. Worde was immediately brought to Astulpho, of their ariuall, and how the next day they determined to giue him bettaill, these newes were ioyfull to the Captaines and lusty gallantes, for euery man hoping to win fame, were generally merry through the whole campe: Dorestus onely excepted, who being tormented with vnspeakeable griefe, began to droupe, making no showe but of sorrowe, in soe much that he was generallye suspected to be a fearefull cowarde, and that dread of daunger was it that draue him into those dumpes, but as they rashly coniectured cause of his sorrowe, so they mist the nature of his sicknes. The next day very early in the morning euery man fell to his armes through bothe the armies, and Astulpho who knewe very well howe to demeane himselfe in such causes ranged out his squadrons, and martialled them into one strong and maine battaill: Caristo in like manner, nothing inferior neither in skill nor courage, drewe out his owne forces of his Piamounts, into a squadron by themselues, whereof himselfe tooke the conducte, and minded to giue the first charge, the Hungarians were likewise ordered in a second battaill, in the verye strength and bodye whereof Myletto had his place, & was appointed stil to second, succoure, and relieue Caristo in all occasions of extremitie. Dorestus knewe not all this while where on to resolue, for if he refused to fight (beside the dishonour that the world would alowe him, of which he made the least accompt) yet he knewe if Myletto preuailed, that he had then bequethed his daughter Leonida to Caristo: againe to enter the fielde, he should showe himselfe a foe so open and aparant, as ther were no meanes left whereby to frame excuse: While Dorestus continued in these meditations, the battails fell to marching, and Caristo (as he had determined) charged the Illerians with such courage and fury, that euen in this first incounter they began to recoile, but many were slaine on both parties, neither was ther wanting skil and hardines, & their fight continued thus a prety season betweene them, but in the end Caristo preuailed, and the Illerians were put to a plaine retreat, and began some of them to fly: Dorestus seeing it hie time to best pyre him nowe or neuer, was dryuen out of his dumpes for his own safetie, issued forth with his Epirots, and charging Caristo on the flocke of his battaill, ouer-threwe at the verye first a great number of Piemountes, the fight here againe began to hold on a fresh, but Dorestus hauing receiued a maime vncurable, not by any stroke lent him of an enemie, but by the onely conceite of his minde, for hee espied in the helmet of Caristo, a gloue, which he immagined, was giuen him by Leonida, and so in trueth it was, wherefore pressing through the thronge, making waye with his sworde, he came to Caristo, drawing him for the loue of his Lady, to with-drawe himselfe, and to breake a launce, Caristo (whose courage was inferior to none) without any further speeches put the spurres to his horsse, and galloping out of the thronge into the vttermost winge of the battaill, as he turned himselfe, he mighte see Dorestus, who had likewise followed him, and had taken a parte of the fielde readye to incounter him, without anye more a doe, they runne one against the other with such fury that they made the earth to tremble, their speares flew al to sheuers in the ayre, it was not long before they had drawne their swordes, then buckling togither with forcible blowes, as either of them shewed inough of courage, soe neither of them were to seeke of cunning, in briefe, after manye breathinges, Caristo disaduantaging himselfe by his own fierce and desperat fight receiued such a wound, that he fell starke dead to the earth: Dorestus that sawe him lyeng-breathlesse began to let fall aboundance of teares deliuering these wordes: O vnhappy and vnfortunate Prince, God knoweth how sorrowfull and greuous thy death is vnto me, and how faine I would haue giuen remedie in some other manner to that I most desired, neither would I haue ben so cruell an enimy vnto thee, but the loue that I bare to Leonida, hath rather inforced it then mine owne nature, and woulde to God I might haue beene relieued by some other means, & not to haue bought my life with thy losse: but as loue is tyranous, soe maruell not though he want pittie towardes thee, which coulde not other-wise purchase it to himselfe. With this he alighted, and taking the gloue from out the helmet of Caristo, hee mounted againe on horsbacke, and bending towardes the battaill, he might see a wonderfull slaughter of the Piemounts, but the Captaines and leaders of the Hungarians armie, being men vtterlye ignorant of martiall exercise, such as for want of skill neither knewe how to take oportunitie, nor when it was time to charge, letting slip all former occasions which might haue aduaunced their conquest, stoode still in amaze till the Piemounts being vtterly broken by the Epirots, retired amongst them in whole troupes for their owne safe garde, and the Captaines vnskilfull how to open their ranckes to let them in, by meanes whereof they disordered quite the whole battaill of the Hungarians, and the Epirots following the chase, began to beare downe the Hungarians, in such forte that they were not able to stand before them, the which being espied by Dorestus, he presently caused the retreat to be sounded, and thus at an instant drewe backe his whole troupes. This demeanure of Dorestus was noted by many, and as generally maruelled at by all, but (indeed) they mistooke him in some-thing, for in trueth they vnderstood him in nothing: But Astulpho, who by this time had raunged his broken company againe into a new order of aray, and knew very well howe to take aduantages, set afreshe vppon the Hungarians, who beeing before disordered and not able to maintaine fight, fell to a retreat of flat running away, and the King himselfe had much a doe to escape, but the nighte growing on and waring very darke, the benifite whereof saued a great number of their liues. Astulpho marcheth after Myletto, beseygeth him in the Cittie of Larissa, and by periurie surpriseth the Cittie, and taketh prisoners, Myletto the King, Paulina the Queen, with Leonida their daughter. night within the trenches of his campe not suffering his men after so great a victory to rest secure, but kept a stronger watch then before he had accustomed, fearing that his enimies immagining him to rest careles in confidence of his late fortune, might take courage to set vppon him, but alas poore men they had no such immagination, their greateste hope of safetie was in trustinge to their heeles: Myletto being left now with a small number of his dispersed people, hee retired himselfe to his chiefe Cittie Larissa, where he found his Queene, his daughter, with the principales of the Cittie, lamentinge the generall misfortune: and being assured that it woulde not be longe before Astulpho would beseege that Cittie, it was therefore furnished with sufficient garrisons of men, presentlye setting ingyners and labourers, to fortifie the most weake and decayed places: ceassing neither day nor night, to put al things in readines, as the little respite of time woulde afforde them. Astulpho, who minded nothing lesse then to lose that aduantage, wherwith fortune had already fauoured him: hauing gotten intelligence by espiall, that ther were no forces of the enimy nere hand to anoy him, and hauing further learned that Myletto was retired to Larissa, he marched thither with as much speede as conueniently he might, wasting and spoyling the country as he passed, acknowledging the honor of his last victory to belong to Dorestus, who little reioysing in his conquest, marched along with him, perplexed againe with a newe tormente, not knowing howe to salue the sore yt which he had already chafed: for he thought with himselfe, that if he should make peace with Myletto, letting him vnderstand the loue he bare to his daughter, that he woulde not except of it, either for the greate domage that he had already done him, or for the band where-with he was bound to Caristo the Prince of Piemount, thinking it woulde be a thing neither resonable, nor yet agreeing to his honour, in liew of the Princes paines which he had taken to com from his countrie, accompanied with so puissaunt an army in his defence, and in regarde of the death which he ther receiued in his seruice, to become a friend to his foe, and to giue his daughter (before espoused to the Prince) vnto the most deadly foe that the Prince had. These things (I say) did so trouble Dorestus, that though he euery daye coyned a newe deuise, yet knew not at night where on to resolue. By this time they were come before the Cittie, where ye Citizens issuing forth with small copanies exployted many seruices to their greate commendations, but their forces were to feeble, they were stil ouer-matched with numbers, and were therefore driuen to retire into the Cittie: Astulpho setteled himselfe before the walles, and in short time so gyrdeled in the Cittie with a trench, that they could neither sally forth of the towne, nor receiue any newe supplies, that should come in their reliefe. It were here tedious to let you vnderstand, the seuerall strategems practised by Astulpho, and still preuented, and the Cittie defended in dispight of all his enterprises: But Astulpho finding his deuises to sorte out to soe little purpose, brought a stronge batterie against the walles, which deliuered such continuall and terrible vollies: that a maine breach was made assaultable, and a great parte of the wale besides so shaken, that it was readie to fall: Astulpho caused the breach immediatly to be fearcely assaulted, & it was by the Cittiezens as brauelye defended, the assaylantes after great losse were put to a retreat, and the defendantes with no lesse sorrow lamented their misfortune, for a great number of their brauest men had lost their liues, in the defence of the breach. Astulpho seeing his forces daylie to deminishe, and all his enterprises to be continually preuented, fretted within him selfe with griefe, and waxed almost woode for anger: Myletto againe, seeing the Cittie so shaken, and their walles so weakened, that they wer not able to defend a secod assault, was as much surprised with fear, & taking the aduise of his counsail, they cocluded to send to Astulpho, to se if he might be brought to any resonable condicions of peace, which was accordingly performed: Astulpho, who cared not by what meanes he obtained so he might win, and minding to keepe promise in nothing, if he could take aduantage in any thing, thought that if vnder collor of Parle he could draw the King from out the Cittie, he would surelye intrap him and holde him prisoner, and the better therefore to accomplish this his deuise, he returned aunswere to Myletto, that he was contented to take a truce for tenne daies, within which time if such codicions as he should prescribe might be agreed vnto, the peace then to hold for euer betweene them, or otherwise at his perrill to abide the hasarde of warre. Myletto verye ioyfull to heare of this tenne daies truce, hoping in the meane time by some meanes to relieue himselfe, or at the least to reedifie his shaken walles, that were euery houre readie to fall, he confirmed the peace during the foresaid time as well vnder his handwriting, as vnder his oath solemnely giuen, requiring the like of Astulpho, who accordingly protested, both vnder his hand & oath, to keepe true peace for tenne daies: The truce thus agreed vppon, Astulpho premeditating what course he might followe for the accomplishment of his intended purpose. Myletto on the other side minding to take oportunitie, the verye next dayt brought labourers to that parte of the wall that had beene before so shaken with shot, and threwe it flat to the ground, minding with as greate expedicion, againe to build it vp, and with curtins and trenches drawne before it, to make the place more stronger then before times it had beene. Astulpho, seeing so great aduauntage offered, the verye same night assaulted the city, in the breach that by them selues was made, and they resting (as it were) in security, of their truce before taken, were easiely surprised, a great slaughter made of the citizens, some part of the towne they fired, the rest vtterly spoiled, and the king himselfe with the queene his wife, and his daughter Leonida taken prisoners, and brought to the pauilion of Astulpho, where they were detained with a stronge guard. Dorestus visiteth Leonida, she chargeth him of periurie, he intreateth Astulpho to vse lenity, but he protesteth greater cruelty. practise, hearing of these newes, was vtterly dismaid, to thinke that a king should vse such periured diceit for the accomplishment of his enterprises, desiring yet to contemplate himselfe in beholding his ladie, the next morning very early he went to the kinges pauilion, where he found the prisoners that hee looked for both to his ioy and griefe, yet dissembling his owne motions, he said to Leonida, madame, I knowe it is hard, where mistrust is harboured, to inforce beliefe, or to procure credit where truth is cald in question, but lady if I had won such a conquest, and that you were my captiue, yet would I honour you as my soueraigne, and obey you as a louing subiect. Leonida not willing to abide any further speeches, cut him of in this manner. Art thou not ashamed Dorestus to vse anye such talke, what speakest thou of a conquest, captiues I confesse we be, but not to a worthy conquerour, but to a wretched captiue, not vanquished by prowesse, but by periury, not by fight, but by falshoode, holde thy peace therefore, if not at my request yet for thine owne credit, thy triumph in this victory can be but endlesse shame, and perpetuall infamie. Dorestus, although hee knewe himselfe to bee cleare of that crime, yet considering the ladies cause, thought it not good to trouble her with anye replie, but leauing them for that season, as he passed forth he might behold such extraordinary crueltie vsed to the citizens and poore subiectes of Hungaria, that it wrought in him a greate remorse. This spectacle, with the remembraunce of his Ladies captiuity, heaped newe griefe to old sorrowe, wherefore to perswade Astulpho to the more clemency, he cam vnto him, to whome hee said in this manner, though it bee glorious (most mightie king) to ouer- come by battaile, yet it is more glorious to ouercome by pitty, & he deserueth greater praise which winneth the harts of his enimies in his tentes by good example, then in the field by sheading of bloud, pardon hath euer ben better then reueng, the one beeing proper to the spirite of man, the other to cruell beastes. Neither can any victory bee called true and perfect, but that which carrieth with it some clemency, for to ouercome is a humaine thing, but to pardon is deuine, heere of it is said, that we esteeme the greatnes of the immortall gods, not so much for the punishment, as for the mercy that they vse, and although mens lawes avouch it to be more iust to reueng an iniury receiued, then to offer it to an other, yet nature teacheth vs, that both the one and the other do proceede of like imbecilyte: vnder your gratious correction then, it seemeth vnto me to great seuerity to afflict the adged father for the offence of the light headed son, or at the least so to limitte your reuenge, that it be not rather called a tirany then a punishment. Why Dorestus (aunswered Astulpho ) art thou yet to learne, that the offence of the children should bee punished in the parentes, hast thou not hard of the lawe established by our auncitors, called Falcidia, by which it was inacted, that the child should be admonished for the first offence, for the second chastised, for the third hanged, and the father likewise banished as partaker of his fault, for want of good education and instruction of his sonne. The Heluetians had an auntient lawe, that if a youngman had receiued sentence of death, the execution thereof should be done by his father (if hee were liuing) who was the cause of his euill education, that the father might in some sort be punished, for the negligence hee shewed in the bringing vp of his child. Fathers therefore must qualifie their children, by bringing them well vppe in their infancy, and letting them haue due correction in their youth, which two things being neglected by parentes, the faultes of their children are most iustly imputed vnto them: and Hely the priest was not punished for anye faulte which himselfe had committed, but bicause hee winked at the sinnes of his children: wouldst thou then prescribe limittes, of reuenge to him that hath fostered vppe an impe that hath practised so much my preiudice: no no Dorestus, I will so crucifie himselfe, his wife, and his daughter, that they shall al curse the houre that such a brat was borne into the world to worke my displeasure, neither shall their cursing anye whit helpe them, till I see their flesh rotted from their bones, in prison where I purpose to keepe them during life: Dorestus whose hart began to pant with paine, to heare this cruell conclusion pronounced by Astulpho, against his lady, immediately aunswered thus: If Machiauell and his fellowes fauourers of tirany, had well weied what wee read in infinit places of scripture, that god will ouer-throwe dissemblers with all their lies and subtilties, hardly could we seeke to ouercome by dissimulations, deceites, trecheryes, and suche like prankes, then if falshoode procure blame and dishonour to all men, it doth much more to kings and princes, for where the prince knoweth himselfe to bee the minister of gods iustice, with what confidence dare he suffer iniquity to enter into his seate, which he vnderstandeth to be the throne of the liuing god, with what conscience will he pronounce falshoode, out of his mouth, which he knoweth is appointed to be the truth of god: with what bouldnes dare he subscribe to disceite with his hand, which hee knoweth is ordained to wright the decrees of god, but where we are both iudge & party, in steed of iustice we seeke after force, violence, rigore, deceite, subtilty, yea periury rather then faile, and what not so we may serue our owne turne. Astulpho not longer able to indure his speeches he interrupted him thus. Dorestus, if you bee minded to preach, get you into a palpit: and if you meane that I haue vsed so many deceites and subtilties as you speake of, you doo me wrong, for in the capitulation betweene Miletto and me, we concluded a truce for tenne daies, but I subuerted him in the night, where of there was no mention made, but what and if there had: haue you not learned this principle in warre, that in conquering of an empire, there is required as great policy as prowesse, and where the lions skinne will not serue, the foxes case must bee put on, and for the obtaining of a kingdome as wel mischiefe as mercy is to be practised, and better it were to commit an inconuenience in breaking of an oth, then to suffer iniury by keeping of promise: content thy selfe therefore Dorestus, and let this suffice to perswade thee, as I haue intrapped mine enimie by practise, so I assure thee I will hold him by force but yet (aunswered Dorestus ) if you meane to hold the inocent father Miletto, what shall become of the harmelesse daughter Leonida: Bicause (quoth Astulpho, ) I will bee sure to keepe her harmelesse still, she shall remaine my prisoner so long as she liueth, for then I knowe shee shall doe mee no harme: Dorestus seeing the nature of the tirante, thought it not best to vse any further speeches, but presently with-drewe himselfe into his tent, to deliberate with more leasure what he were best to do, to free his best beloued from her threatened captiuity: intreatye hee sawe would serue to little purpose, wherefore hee determined by sodaine assault to rescue the prisoners by force, and so to deliuer them from the handes of Astulpho: but heere he considered his owne weaknes to performe such an enterprise, and thought that if he should faile in his attempt, it woulde redounde to the greater perill of those parties whose safety hee especiallye desired, wherefore he resolutly determined, that if by ioyning himselfe in assistaunce with the cuntry, he could not accomplish the performaunce of his desires, then presently to retire into Epirus, and there to leuie such sufficient numbers, wherewith he would set free the princes altogether from thraldome, or to make himselfe a partaker of their misfortunes. Dorestus resolueth to succour the prisoners, Astulpho marcheth backe into his owne kingdome, Dorestus vnderstanding of the king his fathers death, he hasteth to Epirus, he leuieth a mightie armie to followe Astulpho into his owne kingdome. howe to take oportunity, he founde in his account that all desert wayes were denaid him, and this onely meane left for him to worke by, which was, either by dinte of sword perforce to effecte his purpose, or otherwise neuer to hope for that he most desired. Heere vpon Dorestus both sodainely and secretely, with drew himselfe with his whole retinue of Epirotes, vnto a place not far distante, which nature had made stronge by meane of a greate riuer that ran about it, where fortifieng the rest by art, he purposed to remaine, to see what assistance the cuntry would afford him, for the rescuing of their king, and the freeing of themselues from seruitude. Astulpho somewhat amased with this matter, sent to Dorestus to knowe his intent, whoe returned him againe this short aunswere, that his purpose was not to assocyate himselfe with a periured and deceitfull prince, who by a fraudulent meane and dishonourable conquest had sacked the citie and taken the spoile of the whole to himselfe, it rested therefore if he would set free all his prisoners, or at the least, deliuer vnto his costody, the young lady Leonida, that then hee would come to other articles of agreement: otherwise to account him an open enimie, for so he had protested to showe himselfe vnto him. Astulpho finding out by this request of Dorestus, the very drift of all his deuise, assuring himselfe it was the loue of this lady, that had so altered Dorestus in his former demeanures: therefore to preuent all perills what so euer might fall out, and knowing that he had sufficient pledges for the accomplishment of the rest of his purposes, the very next night gathering his company together, hee marched awaye with all expeditoin towardes his owne cuntry of Illeria, carrieng the king, the queene, with their daughter, away with him as his prisoners, the which when Dorestus vnderstood of, he thought it small boote for his purpose to make any longer stay there, but intended as conuenience might giue him leaue to supplie himselfe with sufficiente forces, to march after him to Illeria, and to this purpose he craued aide from the Hungarians, who promised by a day to supplie him with sundry regementes, the which with all possible speed they fell to making ready: Dorestus concluding with them, both of the place, and the time of both their armies to meete, marched himselfe with his whole troupes towardes Epirus, as well to relieue his ouer wearied companyes, with conuenient necessaries, as to strengthen himselfe with greater forces for his better helpe. By the way as he was marching, there incountered him a messenger with newes of his fathers death. Heere Dorestus began againe to renue his wonted lamentations, in such sort, that many daies ouer-passed before he would receiue comfort, yet in the ende certifieng himselfe, considering that to render retribution is a duty of nature, and a debt to be paid, either in youth, in age, or at such like season, as is not at the discretion of man, but at the will and good pleasure of god, with whome wee haue no power to contende: and againe calling to his remembraunce his vndertaken attempt, and to what taske he had tied himselfe, found it high time to bestirre him, and to shake of those drowsie dumps, which rather seeme the testimonies of a dispayring mind, then the showes of an noble courage. It would aske heere to long discourse, to set downe with what signes of ioy Dorestus was welcomed home to Epirus, and howe glad his subiectes were of his safe returne: but Dorestus at his comming before he would receiue the sword and scepter, tooke first order for the intombing of his father, whose funeralls was solemnised with such pompe, as was both fitte for a famous king, and also requisit for a christian prince: this done, he was crowned king of Epirus, to the great comfort of all his subiectes, of whome he was generally beloued. Nowe he aduaunced his captaines, and conductors, that had bin his partakers in this former iourney, some to places of credit, others to titles of honour and dignity, and caused a full paie to be made to all his souldiers, gratifieng euery man in whome was anye desert with liberall rewardes, and this great largnesse of the king, was such a generall incouragement, that now hauing occasion to leuy new forces, to strengthen and supplie his small company with greater numbers, such multitudes voluntarily offered themselues out of euery quarter, that without pressing by commission, hee was quickly prepared of a most huge and puissaunte army, and after he had taken order for the due administring of iustice amongst his subiectes while hee was absent, hee marched to the place which was before appointed for himselfe and the Hungarian forces to meete, who keeping promise accordingly, ioyning their armies together, they marched towardes the confines of Illeria, where they had inteligence that the king was resident with his prisoners, in the citie Ioula, which was the cheefe citie of the kingdome of Illeria, no lesse beautifull then stronge: thither warde Dorestus marched with all conuenient speede, minding to besiege him before he should be throughly furnished to make resistaunce: and thus wee will leaue him marching forward on his way. Brusanus vnderstanding of his parentes captiuity, is vehemently grieued, Antipholus is likewise perplexed to see his frends heauynes, they make a iourney both them selues and their new married brides, into Illeria, to perswade with Astulpho for the libertye of the prisoners. haue done the ladies to much wrong, I meane Valeria and Moderna, for wemen when they be once determined of marriage, they loue not to haue the wedding day deferred, and as you haue hard before, their nuptialls were concluded, and so soone as thinges could bee prepared, married they were, Antipholus to Valeria, and Brusanus to Moderna, all performed in one day, but should I heere discribe, first the feasting, the banqueting, the new dishes that were deuised, to please dainty apitites, the strang fashons that were inuented, both for men and wemen to make them gaye: the musicke, the daunsing, the masking, the plaies and other showes that were procured for pleasure, I am sure it would but grieue you: that you were not there, either to haue tasted of their dainties, to haue brought away some of their new fashons, or to haue bin partaker of their sportes, I will therefore omit to speake any further of them: but see (I say) inconstant fortune, that can neuer be otherwise then like vnto her selfe, who dreaming giueth pleasure, by little dreame, but waking giueth griefe without all measure, so in the verye prime of their pastimes, and as it were, in the midest of their delightes, newes was brought, that Astulpho had taken prisoners, Myletto king of Hungaria, Paulina, the queene his wife, with Leonida their daughter, Brusanus hearing of this misfortune happened to his father, his mother, and his sister, was stunge with a vehement griefe, that hee beganne immediately to droupe, being so much ouer loden with sorrowe, as he was not able to indure it. Antipholus, againe seeing Brusanus (whome he loued as his owne life) to be so much perplexed with care, could not himselfe rest in quiet, till hee had framed the plat of his friends contentment, comforted therefore with this hope, he doubted not, but vpon his humble intreatie, both to pacifie his fathers displeasure towards Brusanus, and to purchase the deliuerie of the captiued Princes: and hauing made Brusanus priuie to his pretence, there was no remedy but he would beare him companye in this iourny: minding indeede if ther were no other meane to mitigate the malice of Astulpho, to surrender himselfe to his rage and fury, rather then his innocent parents shoulde suffer endlesse miserie through his misdemeanure: the new married brides Valeria & Moderna, hearing of this vndertaken voyage, woulde in no wise be left behind in this iourny, and it was thought by Antipholus, that the feminine perswations of these two Ladies, woulde not a little preuaile to moue his father to mercy: ther rested nothing nowe to be determined off, but with-all possible speed to prepare themselues forward, and their greater hast, it was thought conuenient, not to accompany themselues with anye other troupes, more then their necessarie seruants: Antipholus, knowing that all things were ready, and hauing appointed his deputie, assisting him with sundry commissioners, for the gouernment of the kingdome of Calypha vntill his returne, set forwardes (as before I haue saide) with a small companye for their better speed: and whom we wil here againe leaue in their trauail. Dorestus beseegeth the Citie of Pula, Astulpho intendeth to execute Leonida, Antipholus, Brusanus, Moderna, Valeria, are taken prisoners, and brought to Dorestus, which causeth Astulpho to stay the death of Leonida. incounter of his enimies, was com to the Citie of Pula, which he gyrded in with a strong siege: howbeit, the impregnable situation of the walles without, and the aboundance of men, victuals, and artilerie within, might haue discouraged the beseegers to assaill, as the same incouraged, they beseyged to resist, and therefore the barbarous King Astulpho (as it were in dispightful ostentation) to shew how little he forced, or feared his enimies, caused Myletto, with his wife and daughter loden with Irons, to appeare before the walles, and hanging out a banner as though he purposed a Parle, that calling for Dorestus, who being come within his hearing, he said: Dorestus, because Leonida (I knowe) is the party, for whose inlargment your enemies most especially do now ocupie Illeria, if therefore her deliuerie may suffice, be not then hopelesse, for Leonida thou shalt haue, but I wil first take off her head: Here withall the executioner whome he had apointed for that butcherie, begines to settle himselfe aboute his busines, turninge downe the collor of her garment, making her necke bare, the better to do his office, a woful spectacle to Dorestus, who was ready to sincke with sorrowe, and no lesse greeuous to the wretched King her father, who hearinge and seeing what was determined, in this manner breathed out the very sorrowes of his soule: And are not my already sustayned wrongs, a punishment sufficient to apease thy cruelty, but thou wilt also increase my misery, by the blody butcherie of my innocent child, alas doe not so, thy selfe being father, shouldest haue some feeling of a parentes affection: O consider Astulpho of thy owne following destinie, and looke into thy selfe by this my calamitie: I was once thou knowest in thy present dignitie, but thou seest what the heauens hath now decreed against me: and little doest thou knowe what may betide thee, but what my aduersitie maketh mee to remember, that thy prosperity causeth thee to forget, but couldest thou consider of my present miserie, and imploy the possibillitie to thy selfe  & thine, I might then find comfort, not doubting thy clemency, with assured hope of my daughters safetie. If therefore the example of my fall, the vncertaintie of thine owne fortune, the supplication of a King, the submission of a foe, the intercession of a father, the teares of an olde man, the regarde of iustice, or the innocencie of my poore Leonida, if al this may preuail, to moue thee to compassion, beholde Astulpho, with my tonge I protest it, with my hart I vow it, by the heauens I sweare it and mine acte shall performe it, that her ransome shall be the resignation of my whole intrest of the kingdome of Hungaria, to thee and thine: If all this will not moue thee, I coniure thee yet in the name of those Gods that will not faile to punish thy tyranie, by the shame of the worlde, that will not leaue to speake of thine infamie, by the innocent bloud, that will cry vengance against thee, & by thine owne guiltie conscience, that at last shal accuse thee: When thus much was spoken and all in vaine: Leonida more perplexed in beholding her fathers griefe, then terrified with the death wher-with her selfe was thretened, with a cheerefull voice, said as followeth: Deare father, one of the greatest benifites that can betide vs in this life, is to be thankful to Gods prouidence and neuer to be discouraged by any misfortune, no not to stand soe much in awe of death, that for feare thereof we shoulde commit anye thing vnbeseeming a noble harte, hauing then patientlye resolued my selfe, where-vnto serueth your bootles lamentations, where-by my deathe is rather dubled then deferred: for aduersities albeit they haue custome to vexe, yet haue they no power to chaunge the constancye and courage of a valiante and resolute mynde: O seeke not then (sweete father, by your discouraginge sorrowes, seeke not I saye, to hinder my sweete hope, which hope is death: and death is the salue to all my miseries, and yeeldeth assured truce to the rest of my troubles, and knowing in the end, that all things take end, it is not the ill death that we haue to account of, but it is the ill dying that is most to be respected. Enuy not then your daughters good hap, by sorrowing her death, but comfort your selfe with this assured hope, shee dyeth an innocent: if I were condempned for some notorious ill, perhaps my death shoulde disquiete you the lesse, but being as I am innocent from crime me thinks it should quiet you the more: Wherefore good father seeing that one and the self same passage is prepared aswell for the coward as the couragious, for the yong as for the old, being decreed that all must dye, if not at one time yet at another, beeinge farre more miserable to deserue it, then to suffer it, with the reuerence of a daughter, therefore I require it, and with out the partiall affection of a father, I beseeche you to graunt it: that you do not more discomfort mee by your impatient demeanure, then your dishonourable enemy shall be able to enforce, no not with all his butcherly practises: this is the last that I may hope to craue, and this is the least that in reason you may geue. More might she not be suffered to speake, but the executioner was willed to dispatch his businesse, and as hee was lifting vp the sword to haue taken off the heade of Leonida, Astulpho might perceiue a company both of men and wome that were led as prisoners and brought to Dorestus, and aduisedly taking view of the parties, amongst the rest he assuredly knew Antipholus his sonne, and Moderna his daughter: this sight did so amase him that euery parte of his body quaked for feare, whereuppon he commaunded the executioner to hold his hand: For you shall vnderstand, that Antipholus with that company (as you haue hearde before) trauailing towardes his father, and was come within a verye little of the city of Pula, without any newes at all of Dorestus, who the very night before had beset the Cittie, and that very morning sending forth certaine companies of horsmen to scoure the country, they lighted on Antipholus & his companie, who being but fewe in number, and al vnarmed and therefore not able to make defence, were thus taken prisoners, and in this manner were brought to Dorestus, who seeing Antipholus whome he so dearely loued, that he disired not so much as to drawe one haire of his heade in anye displeasure, yet knowing him to be a sufficent pledge for his purpose, for policies sake he drewe his sword, and comming towardes Antipholus, seemed as though he woulde haue sheathed it through his body, which being espied by Astulpho, who was ready to sincke to earth for sorrowe, he cryed out sayeng: O Dorestus, I beseech thee stay thy hande, and commit not so great crueltie, and sith that fortune hath fauoured thee, with this vnloked for aduantage, tryumph thou, yt Astulpho hath submitted, but imbrew not thy hands in the bloud of the innocent: Dorestus who reioyced not a little to heare these speeches, aunswered him: Yea marye Astulpho, this is another manner of song, I am glade you haue taken ouer a newe lesson, do you begin to preach, against crueltie: well I hope I shall finde you confirmeable to the rest: but for this present I will goe to my tent, whether if you will send me Leonida, as a pledge, it maye be I will retourne you such conditions, as may proue to your liking: without anye further speeches Dorestus departed, leading as prisoners in his companie, Antipholus, Brusanus and the rest. Astulpho sendeth Leonida to Dorestus with conditions of peace, Antipholus is sent to his father to intreat for Brusanus, Astulpho being ouer-come with a sodaine Ioy, seing the safetie of his sonne, falleth downe in a traunce and soe dyeth, Antipholus setteth free Myletto and Paulina, Leonida surrendereth her loue to Dorestus, their nuptialles celebrated, they combyne in friendship and end with contentment. imbraced Antipholus, blessing the houre of his happy aryuall, hoping by his meanes, bothe to attaine to his desired purpose, and likewise to conclude, assured peace and concord: then turning to Brusanus, the loue of whose sister Leonida, had vtterlye dissolued, all former conceyued displeasures, and imbrasing him in his armes, he said: O Brusanus, I can but reioyce to thinke that the enimie to all woman kinde, is yet at the length become a sworne soldyor in the bande of Cupide, and contented to marche vnder the banner of Venus, I hope by this time you haue renounced al your former heresies: Brusanus answered, yea Dorestus, and blessed be that ghostlye father, by whose instructions I was first moued to consider of mine owne mistaking, and haue euer sithens (as a true penitent) both acknowledged my ignorance, and done penaunce for my error, although not able to make full satisfaction for my misse: Dorestus then humbly kissing the hand of Moderna, said: and truelye madame your merrit was much in this matter, hauing saued a soule, that by his owne confession was in the verye high waye to perdition: Then I hope sir (aunswered Moderna ) sith he hath cryed Peccaui, his faults be then remissiue both to God and the world: Dorestus, who knew very well wher-vnto her speeches had relation, would returne her no answere, but resting his eies vpon Valeria, whome although he knewe not, yet he stoode amazed, to see suche perfection of beautye, demaunded of the standers by what Lady it might be, Antipholus who could best satisfie him, tolde him that she was a Princesse, the daughter and heire of Belizarius King of Calypha, lately deceased, and his wife, but newly married: Dorestus, then kissing her hand, began to comfort her, assuring her that she was lighted into ye hands of such a frendly enimy, as was ready to do vnto her both honour  & seruice: As Dorestus intended to haue proceeded in further speeches, word was brought him that Astulpho had sent Leonida, who was comming fast by, & was already entered within their Corps de gwarde. Dorestus, to testefie how ioyfull these tidinges were vnto him, gaue the newes bringer a chaine that he ware aboute his owne necke, esteemed to be of great price: and desiring Antipholus with the rest to accompany him, he met Leonida whome he entertained with great showes of humillity, and was neuerthelesse possessed, with as much ioy and gladnes, and hauing in his minde, prepared a longe oration for her, his eies were soe filled with her sight, that (as if they woulde haue robbed their fellowes of their seruices) bothe his hart faynted, and his tongue fayled: Antipholus then kissing the hand of Leonida, entertayned her for the present but with a vsuall salutation: but Leonida casting her eies vppon Brusanus was not a little comforted, in the presence of her brother, and he accordingly welcomed his sister, with as great showes of brotherly loue, as outwardly coulde be expressed: Valeria and Moderna, had nowe their turnes to entertaine Leonida, which both saluted her with no lesse signes of harty affection: Leonida being thus welcomed to the company, Dorestus caused 4000. crownes to be deliuered to her conductors, which were foure Gentlemen sente with her from Astulpho. After these Gentlemen altogether, had giuen humble thankes to Dorestus for his greate bounty, the one of them deliuered this message from Astulpho, signifieng to Dorestus, that the King his maister, to satisfie his request, had sent him his so much desired Leonida, in requitall whereof, if he woulde returne him her brother Brusanus, he should then finde him confirmeable to his further demaunds, whatsoeuer might be thought conuenient and necessarie, for the establishment of peace, loue and amitie between them; And although Dorestus minded nothing lesse then to satisfie Astulpho in that request: yet Antipholus, who tendered the safetie of Brusanus, as much as his owne life, and knowing the displeasure of his father, to concerne no lesse then the deathe of his friend: hee besought Dorestus with great intercession, that he woulde not commit an acte of such impietie, for to deliuer a Prince wittinglye to the slaughter, were no lesse then himselfe to commit wilful murther: Dorestus reioysing in his mind, at this vnfained friedship, demauded of Antipholus if he could deuise the meane to pacifie his fathers fury towardes Brusanus: To this Antipholus aunswered, that hee had left the kingdome of Calipha, and had vndertaken this sodaine iourney, but onely to that very end, neither dowbted he, but if himselfe might come to the speeche of his father, that hee would both mitigate his fathers displeasure towardes Brusanus, and otherwise to winne him to be the better confirmeable for the deliuerye of Myletto and Paulina: Dorestus who knewe very well that Antipholus would (in very deed) doe his best to performe as much as hee had said, and knowing Valeria to bee a sufficient pledge, was content that Antipholus should make present proofe of his owne practise, the which Antipholus most willingly vndertooke, and making no doubt at all of his good successe, he departed towardes his father, who was likewise attending an aunswere from Dorestus, and more then halfe in dispaire of his sonnes safety, fretting and fuming at himselfe, that had so rashly sent away Leonida, before he vnderstoode what was happened to his son: in the midest of these his melancholy fittes, Antipholus presented himselfe before his father, and humbly casting himselfe vppon his knees: Astulpho beholding the safe arriuall of his sonne, was not so much before perplexed with exstreame griefe, but hee was as sodainely conuerted to a fitte of no lesse excessiue gladnes, & rising from his seate purposing to imbrace his son, being ouercom with a surfet of to much ioy, he presently sanck dead to the earth, neither could hee euer after be recouered, by any artificiall meane what so euer could be imployde: I will not stande heere to figure forth the dolorous complaintes of Antipholus, whose sorrowes were as exceeding as his fathers death was sodaine, but calling to his remembraunce that against death there was neither prescription, nor authority, who yeeldes no compassion to the teares of men, takes no care for their sighes, scornes at their complaintes, and plaieth with their afflictions, Antipholus therefore pacifieng himselfe for the season, beganne to bethinke him of his other affaires, and hauing nowe the lawe in his owne hand, hee caused Myletto with Paulina to bee brought both before him: who after hee had most louingly imbraced hee comforted them with chearefull and louing speeches, hee likewise caused them to bee royally robed, in rich and sumptious apparell be-fitting their estate, and bicause Dorestus shoulde dread no bad measure, hee sent a messenger vnto him, with the certainty of his fathers death, then making the gats of the city on euery side to be set wide open in signe of peace and amity, accompanieng himselfe with the king and queene of Hungaria, with some fewe noble men to attend their persons, hee went to Dorestus, to whome hee said: behold Dorestus in respecte of former frendship, lately begunne betweene vs, and to that ende it may be for euer vnfainedly continued, I doe heere freely deliuer vnto thee, Miletto king of Hungaria, with Paulina the queene his wife, the parties which thou hast so much desired to set at liberty, neither would I deliuer them into thy handes but that I assure my selfe of thy princely meaning towardes them, and sith it hath pleased the heauens thus to call away my father, I know not now what should hinder, but that this frendship betweene vs should bee so surelye knit, that no future fortune shall euer bee able to dissolue: It would aske heere another volume, to set downe at large, the comfort, the contentment, the quiet, and the ioy that was nowe made amongst these princes, Dorestus triumphed in hope to haue his desired Leonida, Miletto reioyced as fast in the vertuous reconcylyation of his sonne, Brusanus was no lesse ioyfull for the safe deliuery of his father, Antipholus was as much delighted to see Brusanus pleased, but after they had a while spent the time in this manner, Dorestus tooke order for the dissoluing of his army, and causing a generall pay to be made, he sent them away with their captaines and leaders: Miletto likewise giuing the Hungarians thankes that had opposed themselues in his rescues, sent them also away, assuring them vppon his returne, both to remember their kindnes, and to recompence their duetifull indeuours: These matters thus ouer passed, Dorestus was at leasure to consider of his owne estate, which he thought to be more infortunate then the rest, who hauing set all at liberty, and onely himselfe to remaine a captiue: but it was determined amongst them that they would all remaine for a season with Antipholus: who had likewise prepared to entertain them with as great honour as the time woulde afford him, yet tempering his mirth with such meane as was necessary for the instant, considering the late decease of his father that was yet vnburied, beeing not throughly prouided for his funeralls: Dorestus in this meane space, taking aduauntage of time, so solicited Leonida a fresh, that she calling to her minde the high seruice hee had performed in her behalfe, in requitall wheerof, she surrendered herselfe to satisfie his demandes, to the great contentment of her father and mother, but especially of her dearest brother Brusanus: The mariage
