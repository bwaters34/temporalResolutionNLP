 proportion they have as frequently, if not more, evidenced it on Monarchies  & Commonwealths, as on their subjects) have so clearly acquainted me with this Truth, by those signall miseries they have involved that unfortunate Family in, from whence I have the honour to be descended, that if my words would not acknowledge their power, my condition must: for though, by the Lawes of a legitimate succession, I should now wear a Crown as flourishing as most in Asia , yet I am limited to the governing of a few Priests; which change I could never have digested, had not my fate inflicted one me another loss, of so peculiar and transcendent a quality, that the loss of Empire is absolutely drown'd in the fatall remembrance of it. Great Gods! (continued Callimmachus ) had you only cast me from the Throne of my predecessours,  & from all the joyes and fruitions of an early Monarchy, I had submitted to that fate, with as perfect a resignation as you could have expected from an Offendor, whose crimes could not but be infinite, since his punishments are so; but alas! why to this high misfortune would you add that higher, of seating me in a Noble Throne, only to precipitate me from it? But why do I repine at the last unhappiness, when you thought me worthy of the first; and how could I fancy you would inthrone me in the fair Statira's heart, which was the highest blessing, when you would not inthrone me in my Fathers Right, which was but a common Justice? Here Callimachus breast was so contracted with grief by a reflection on what he was engaged to relate, that it necessitated him to a small silence; which his generous Auditors would have made use of, to procure his pardon for their not having paid him those submissions due to his Reall quality, which their ignorance was guilty of,  & consequently could only appologize for; but Callimachus would not so much as listen to their intentions when once he guessed at them, which absolutely to retrench he made the greater haste to suppress his disorders,  & having effected it, he thus cotinued. I shall not scruple (Generous Princes) to acknowledge I am descended from Prusias King of Bithynia , sirnamed the Hunter ; that Prusias , who to all his other crimes, added those of betraying the great Hannibal , and of sending Minas to Rome , expresly to murther his son the Prince Nicomedes , whom he had married very young unto the daughter of Attalus then King of Pergamus ; which nuptial was no sooner celebrated, then he repented it, for finding how much the young Nicomedes was justly admired by all the Bithynians , and that his sons vertues did but render his crimes the more visible, and detestable; he resolved to destroy him by poyson, whilest he yet resided with him;  & to this he was the more inclin'd, by having the same belief of Nicomedes , that he had of himself, which was, that where the power of winning a Crown was not wanting, the will of doing it was the like, and therefore he feared the affection Attalus paid his son-in- law, would invite him to imploy his power for him, to which Prusias knew he must submit; not that Bithynia could not bring as many to resist, as he could to invade, but that he knew his Tyranny had lost him his subjects hearts, and consequently he could expect no safety from their Arms. But Nicomedes was too generous to make good his Fathers fears; yet having miraculously discovered his intention of poysoning him, and avoided it also (for he that should have given him the fatall Cup, mistook it, and by drinking it himself, converted his sin into the punishment of it) he thought to put himself into a condition of ending both his fathers and his own fears, and knew nothing could better effect the designe, then by absenting himself from Bithynia , which he did after his Princess had presented him with a son, which he also called Nicomedes , whom with his mother he sent to Attalus ; whither he would not retire, lest the place of his retreat might raise those jealousies, which he intended thereby to suppress. He therefore went to Rome , not only as it was the fittest place to form and fashion him, but as believing it a Sanctuary which Prusias durst not violate; for it was from the Romans he had received his Kingdome, which he had forfeited to them, by that assistance he had given Perseus King of Macedon , whose sister he had married. But nothing being able to suppress the Tyrants cruelty, when the dictates of Nature could not he sent Minas to Rome to destroy that life there, which the Gods had so miraculously preserved in Bithynia: But Minas when he was to act his treachery, and had on purpose inveagled Nicomedes alone to walk on the banks of Tiber , was so overcome with the Majesty of his person, and the charms of his vertue, that instead of executing his crime upon his Prince, he revealed it to him; and afterwards made him so clearly sensible of the great hazard he should constantly be in of losing his life, if Prusias had power enough left to destroy it, that he at length perswaded Nicomedes to go to Attalus , and implore an army, able to bring Prusias to reason; Minas assuring him that as soon as he entred Bithynia , he would bring him forces so considerable, that Prusias should not be able to resist. In brief, all this was performed, and after a long and intricate War, Prusias scorning all accommodation, was reduced to be King of nothing but the City of Nicomedia , in which Minas had so good intelligence, and so many friends, that they admitted Nicomedes and his army by night, who before his entrance prohibited all violence or incivility to his Father upon pain of death. But Prusias at the alarm fled in disguise towards the Temple of Jupiter for Sanctuary; and being by the way met by some of Nicomedes souldiers, though he told the who he was, was yet kill'd. This news brought to Nicomedes , he ran to the dead body, embrac'd and wept over it, punished exemplarily all the souldiers which had had a hand in his death; then gave him a Regall funerall, and afterwards languished away his own life. To him succeeded his Son Nicomedes sirnamed Philopater , who no sooner came to the age of relishing a Scepter, but his was' forced from him by Socrates , sirnamed Chrestus his only brother, and thereby necessitated to seek protection in Cappadocia , under Ariobarzanes the King of that Country, whose daughter he married, and when she had presented him with a Son also called Nicomedes , she engage'd her Father in the War against Chrestus , who being a greater Souldier then either Philopater or Ariobarzanes , not only, after a ten yeares War, drove them out of Bithynia which they had invaded, but also out of Cappadocia ; and forced both the Kings with the young Nicomedes , to fly to Rome , where some years they continued, imploring a Roman army for their restauration, which they at length obteined. The Generals were Mannius Aquilius , and Lucius Cassius , whose armies being small, they were ordered to demand an additionall force from Mithridates Eupater , who having privately agreed with Socrates to have Cappadocia , if he would not assist the Romans in recovering Bithynia , deny'd Cassius and Mannius his assistance, who yet by that influence the banished Kings had over their subiects, defeated and kill'd Socrates in a furious Battell, and re-seated Ariobarzanes and Nicomedes in those Thrones, of which they had been so long and so unjustly deprived. But the poor Philopater had no sooner received his Son from Rome , whose youth was as promising as either his Parents or the Bithynians could desire, but that his Queen died, and that loss had so strong an operation upon him, that he soon accompanied her, and left Bithynia to Nicomedes my Father. I have given you this little account of my family, (the crimes whereof though but inherent to one, yet the misfortunes were to all) to let you see that such as are eminent in Title are often so in afflictions; that the Gods by ruining the highest earthly felicities, teach us therby, that they are not too solicitously to be prosecuted by those that want them, nor to be reli'd on by those which possesse them, but that they ought to be considered as things which will leave us, or must be left by us, that we should be no more moved with the fruition than with the deprivation of them, and that these just considerations might instruct us to fix upon that place where fortune has no Empire, and to which vertue onely has the title. The Kingdome of Bithynia knew few superiors in extent, in fertility, in the beauty and greatnesse of Cities, or in the multiplicity of war-like inhabitants, when Nicomedes my unfortunate father came to governe it; and though he were a person replenish'd with all the realities and ornaments which makes one worthy to ascend a throne, and to be setled in it, yet those powers who from occult causes raise some to a crowne that deserve it not, and teare the scepter from some who deserve to hold it, esteemed the unhappy Nicomedes a fit subject on which to manifest the last of these truths, and it was in this manner that they acted their decree: when he came to ascend the throne, by his fathers death, it was in so early an age, that he had a higher desire to observe how other Kings did rule their subjects, than he then had to rule his owne; or else he believed by having a personall inspection into the advantages and defects of the regiment of others, he might the more perfectly know how to carry on his own: but from whatever principle it proceeded, and whatever danger he incurr'd, yet he was unmoveably fixt to visit, in a disguise, the Courts of such Princes in Asia whom fame had most celebrated; and therefore having intrusted his affaires at home to the Prince Astyages his uncle,  & then apparent Successor (a person as eminent for the honest as the politick part of Government, but so strict a Justiciar, that he put his onely Son to death for having violated a Law whose infringement was to be accompanied with that penalty) he began his travels in an equipage fit to cloud the greatnesse of his reall quality, and yet sufficient to manifest he was of no inconsiderable one. In briefe, after he had fruitfully visited all places fit for his curiosity, or benefit: he at length came to Mithridates Court, then the most considerable of all others in every respect; for though as then the Prince Pharnaces , the Prince Ataphernes , the Princesse Statira , and the Princesse Roxana , were not come into the world, yet there was such a confluence of other illustrious persons and beauties, which composed it, that Nicomedes was often heard say, That, to be one of that Court was as good as to be the chiefe of any other. But that which rais'd this opinion in my Father was, that the Pontick King (who all the world knew was as violent as inconstant in his loves) had then newly assumd a passion for the Princesse Fontamyris , who was onely heire to Cephines a tributary Prince unto him, yet very considerable, for his power and wisdom. This Amour joyn'd with Mithridates youth, made his Court the most delicious place, not only of Asia , but of the whole world. My Father too being in an age very susceptible of all the charmes of such a place, it was not strange he had so high an opinion of it, since all sort of gallantries shined there in their greatest luster. The next night after Nicomedes came to Pergamus then the residence of Mithridates , he was informed that the ensuing one the King presented Fontamyris with a magnifick ball; the great discourse of such a meeting, and the greater of that beauty who was the cause of it, gave my Father the curiosity to be a looker on; but he no sooner saw the faire Fontamyris , than he became one indeed, and what his curiosity had extended over the whole Assembly, a more pressing cause confined to one of it: And though Nicomedes the more unobservedly to gaze on his new Conquerour, had retir'd himself into the throng, yet his good Meene, and the advantage of his stature was such, that amongst many who considered him upon those scores, as well as for his being a stranger, the faire Fontamyris did it so intently, that not only Nicomedes observed and was concern'd in it, but Mithridates did the like too; and they had both much more cause for both; when the faire Fontamyris , by the rules of the Ball was to elect one to dance with, she chose my Father out of the throng, who as much confounded as joyful at it, having with a deep humility acknowledged the honour she did him (in the Pontick tongue also, which he spake as naturally as his owne) he afterwards acquitted himselfe with so much grace and unconstrainednesse in the dance, and observed the Cadence with so much justnesse and regularity, that the Courtiers, who found how much his having done so disgusted Mithridates , could not finde in their envie and malice the least rise to manifest either; for the more curiously and nicely they examined what he had performed, the more cause they found to esteeme and admire it. And that Fontamyris might have as much occasion to be satisfied with his civility, as he had to be with hers, whilest he was leading her to her place; he againe made her so many hansome retributions for the honour she had done him, that if she had reason to be pleased with what he did in the dance, she had at least as much to be so with what he had done after it. Nicomedes being obliged by the rules of the Ball to take out another Lady, he took one who sate next to Fontamyris , with whom he danc'd, and then having saluted Mithridates and all the company with much humility, but Fontamyris with much more, he retir'd into the throng, where he continued as long as the Ball, and in distempers, which till then he had never beene acquainted with: But (said Callimachus ) not having undertaken Nicomedes story, but mine, I will as brief in his as I can, with obedience to what you have commanded me concerning mine owne: and therefore I shall in short acquaint you, that my Father was so farre engaged in his passion to Fontamyris , and so successefully made his Court, that at length it was not only her opinion, but confession, that the difference betweene the Kingdomes of Mithridates and Nicomedes was not neare so great, as that between their persous; for my Father had informed Fontamyris , and Cephines , of his real quality, though he and they had conceal'd it from the Pontick King, who never knew thereof till Nicomedes had secretly carried away the Princesse into Bithynia , which he did both by hers, and her Fathers consent, who yet durst not publickly owne it, lest Mithridates resentments might have vented themselves against him, who only was in his power. Soon after in Nicomedia the Nuptials were resolemnized openly, and with all the magnificence a young King and a successeful Lover could invent: But alas! those joyes were but of short duration, and like glorious mornings which are the soonest over-cast, and turned to tears; for the lightening of this Nuptial Torch, was the flame which set all Asia on fire, was the original of that fatall warre which afterwards the world too well knew by the name of Mithridatick , and was the occasion, or pretence, of drawing the Roman Eagles out of Europe into the East, where they have since extended their wings to the Euphrates , over which 'tis believed they had long since flowne, had not the domestick differences of her proud Citizens done more for Asia , then the blood and swords of all her Inhabitants. This great people jealous of their glory, or thirsting after a pretence to encrease it and their Empire, so highly resented Mithridates not assisting Mannius Aquilius , and Lucius Cassius , in the recovery of Bithynia and Cappadocia , that they commanded those two Generals to invade Pontus , and to make the losse of that great Kingdome, the Penance of the Kings disobedience: But knowing the Roman Army was too small for so great a designe; by a solemne Embassy they invited Nicomedes to joyn his Armes to theirs, and to suppresse the Enemy both to his Family and Person. Nicomedes who owed his Crown to the Romans, who knew Mithridates Resentment would proportion his Losse, that if he omitted this opportunity of depressing him, he would probably never meet with such another; and perhaps in a heat of youth, ambitious to mingle Laurels with his Myrtles, invited by Gratitude, Policy and Glory, added a Bithynian Army to the Roman, over both which the Senate made him General, which they the more confidently did, because his Education was Roman; and this Action made them believe his Inclination was the like. Nicomedes, Mannius , and Cassius , found Eupater on the Frontiers of Pontus with a vast Army, which he had raised to invade his Rivals Kingdome; but now to his grief and wonder, he found must be employed to defend his owne. The Retaile of this warre would be endlesse, I shall therfore omit all the battels, sieges and encounters of it, to tell you the event of that signal day, on the successe of which, both Parties had set up their Rests; The Consequence being great, the Forces which composed both Armies were the like; under Mithridates Ensignes there were two hundred thousand foot, and one hundred thousand horse, rais'd in Pontus, Lidia , the two Scythia's, Mesopotamia, Armenia the lesse, and even the Bactrians, and the farther Eastern people came to his help against the Romans, their common enemy; to all which Craterus , a great Captaine, had brought him one hundred and thirty Chariots armed and fortified with sharp Sithes, an invention which till then the Romans and Bithynians had never beene acquainted with, and which did more against Nicomedes Army, then all Mithridates's besides. These great forces were led by Commanders, whose Gallantry rendered them as formidable as their numbers; besides Craterus , there was Dorilaus who led a Phalange of foot, so considerable both for the number and order, that the Romans both feared and admired it. Neoptolemus led thirty thousand horse, and his brother Archilaus led as many compos'd of various Eastern Nations. Canzaber a famous Bactrian Prince, led thirty thousand foot of that wild Countrey, and of the Zogdians; and amongst many others the young Prince Archathias , eldest son to Mithridates by a Pontick Lady, whose death had given him the liberty of making his addresses to Fontamyris , was at the head of ten thousand Armenian horse, and became his Command so well, that his good meene and courage abundantly suppli'd the want of his experience. To this immense land- army, Mithridates had as considerable a Naval one, under the command of Betuitus , which Anchor'd at the mouth of the river Amadus , neer whose banks this fatall difference was decided, and from which the ensuing battel took its name. Nicomedes army though inferiour in number, yet was not so in the confidence of victory; for the Senate, knowing how much depended on this great field, had to their Legions under Cassius and Mannius sent Appius a noted Captaine, who had re-inforced his Romans with so considerable a number of Cappadocians, that his Army only consisted of fourty thousand horse and foot. Mannius by those helps he had out of Pamphilia was no lesse, nor Cassius's neither, who had newly received large accessional forces out of Galatia and Phrygia . To all these Nicomedes had brought fifty thousand foot, and six thousand, all natural Bithynians: and that the Empire of the Sea as well as of the Land might be at once decided, he sent Order to Minutius Ruffus and Caius Popilius , to leave the Guard of the Pontick Sea, which thitherto had beene their employment by expresse Order from Rome , to engage Betuitus's Fleet, when the Land-forces began the battel. The Armies being drawn up by that time the Sun had reach'd the South, Nicomedes encouraged the Romans by the glory which that day they might win, and by the profit the victory would present them, which was no lesse then the civilized parts of Asia . Then addressing himself to his owne subjects, he only told them: 'Tis this day, O Bithinyans, that you will decide from whom you derived your originals; For if you seek your safety in any thing but your valours, your Enemies will not only say, but even your King will believe, and you will prove, that you are indeed descended from those cowards which the unfortunate Rhesus led to the relief of Troy , and which Diomed , the first night conquer'd and dispersed: But if by your courages you successefully court Fortune and Victory (for 'tis onely by valour those are won) the world will know you draw your extraction from the Lineage of the Gods, and that Bithis the son of Jupiter , and Thracis , was the noble source from whence you are descended. Nicomedes said no more, neither indeed needed he; for the Bithynians were so jealous of their pedegree, and so offended at their enemies, saying they were descended from those Grecian Fugitives, that they esteemed death a much lesse misfortune then to be denied their true Original, or to have that false one imposed on them; upon both which scores only, they had often in ancient times begun and continued bloody wars. The Military Musick was beginning to invite the hearers to drowne it in their shouts, when a Post came to Nicomedes from Fontamyris , to acquaint him, that the Gods had given him the unfortunate Callimachus , (which name Arsamnor my Governour gave me at Athens , it signifying in the Bithynian language as much as unhappy at the Birth, my owne being Nicomedes , which yet I never wore, being but too much known by the misfortunes of it) But with this desired newes my Father begun the battel, having first communicated it to the Bithynians, whose joy made the Enemy mourne; for carried on with so high an addition to their valours, they acted things which both the Romans and Mithridates admired. Neither did Nicomedes performances exact a lesse debt; for having now a successor, he was the more prodigal of himself, whereby all that durst resist him, soone found the bloody punishment of that confidence. But alas! what certainty is there of humane things? When the poor Nicomedes in the height of his glory, and at the head of a conquering army, from a single unknown hand, received a Dart, which piercing through his body, deprived him of speech and sense. The Bithynians by a general groane solemnized his fall, and the Mithridatians imagining what alone in so faire a way to victory could produce so strange an effect, by a shout of joy acquainted the sad Bithynians they knew what made them so. But the passion of grief at the Bithynians losse being greater then their fury for it, and at the same instant Craterus charging into their greatest body, with his armed Chariots, brought so general a disorder to Nicomedes subjects, that they scarce could carry off his wounded body; and the Romanes with their Auxiliaries seeing the Bithynians fly from that victory, they had so generously courted,  & almost obtained, despaired of recovering the day; which they had much more cause for, when Craterus and Arcathias , charged Cassius in front and flank, as Neoptolemus and Archilaus did Mannius , and as Canzaber and Dorilaus did Appius , where they found so poor an opposition, that I may therefore truly say, they got not the glory, though they got the field. Some affectionate servants of my Fathers, believing when his side lost his assistance, they would also the battel, carried him away in a Litter past the fury of the execution, and then by easie journeys brought him to Nicomedia; so happy he was in his misfortune, as to finde by experiment, that the fate of Asia and the lives of some hundred thousands had depended on his sword and courage; for whilest those did act, victory followed his side, and abandoned it when they did not. Nor was Mithridates obliged only to one Element for victory; for his Fleet had triumphed on the Sea, as his Army had on the Land. Betuitus presented him with the heads of Minutius Ruffus , and Caius Popilius the two Roman Admirals, who elected to share in their Navies Fate rather then outlive it. And that Mithridates might have no cloud to obscure his glory, though the number of his Army exceeded his Enemies, yet the number of those which fought, did not; for eighty thousand horse and foot which composed his last battalion, obliged the rest of his Army only, by their not contributing to their successe. Ten thousand Bithynian Officers  & souldiers who that fatal day had lost their liberty, were the next brought before Mithridates , who sent them all as a present to Fontamyris , and, as he said, as so many witnesses of the error of her choice. Nicomedes as soone as he was recovered, rallied of all his armies some fourty thousand foot and four thousand horse, with which he attempted Mithridates Army, which was divided and secure by their former victorie: But this battel, fought on the banks of Gargarus , was an exact repetition of the former; My Father had the victory till by wounds he was disabled from prosecuting and keeping it. This second defeat depriv'd him of all hope of bringing his fate to a third triall, especially it being accompanied with the losse of the Roman forces; for Quintus Appius a Roman Pr aetor , was betrayed by his owne souldiers to Mithridates ; and Mannius was taken, and brought to Pergamus , where after many derisions he was put to death, by melted gold being poured down his throat, thereby to reproach the Roman avarice. Mithridates now seemed rather to make a progresse, then a warre. The Cities of Magnesia, Ephesus and Mytilene , received him in triumph. By his Lieutenants he conquered Licia, Pamphylia , and Paphlagonia , and at length cross'd over the Mountaine Scoroba , which seperates Bithynia from Pontus . It was then the unfortunate Nicomedes found he could no longer resist his Conqueror, and therefore having sent for the chiefest Nobility of his Kingdome, and the chiefest Inhabitants of his Cities, he generously commanded them to submit to that fate he could not oppose, and not to exasperate Mithridates by a fruitlesse fidelity to him. This rare and noble care, strangely affected those which were to enjoy the effects of it, who in teares and other signal expressions evinced, they were not desirous nor therefore unworthy of it; so that the unhappy Nicomedes was necessitated to make use of his authority, to absolve his subjects from their obedience to it, and thereby robb'd his Enemy of a full triumph by deposing himself. This great businesse being performed with as much sadnesse as solemnity, he retired unto Fontamyris's Cabinet, where they both sent for Arsamnor , a Gentleman that had beene Governour to my Father, and had discharg'd that trust with so much fidelity, merit and successe, that they both resolved he was a fit person to be intrusted with me. As soone as he was come, Nicomedes told him; You see, Arsamnor , the Gods for the present have cast downe the house of Bithynia , but perhaps they may restore that Scepter to the young Nicomedes , which they have thought his Father unworthy to hold; had we still continued in the Throne, you should have had as great demonstrations of our bounty, as now we give you of our trust, which is the care of our only sonne; let him never know his name, or his real quality, unlesse he appear worthy of both, and unlesse the Gods raise him to a probability of recovering that right which we have lost. I will not tell you Arsamnor's joy at this high trust, nor the Queenes grief, when at once she was forc'd from the Kingdom and her sonne: You shall only know, that the next day after, the King and Fontamyris , having loaden Arsamnor with Jewels, made him take a solemne oath never without their consent to acquaint me who I was, and privately provided him with a swift Gally in a Creek opposite to the shoar of Greece (in which Countrey Nicomedes enjoyned my Governour to give me my education) they both left Nicomedia , and not long after Bithynia , with much lesse trouble then it occasioned in their subjects. The place which my Father chose for his retreat, was the City of Celena , the Metropolis of the greater Phrygia , whose King was a person deserved that title, and so much his friend, as he was confident he would appear so, even when fortune was not. Nicomedes would not take me with him, either from an apprehension that he might infect me with his infelicity, which he believed was contagious, or else if Mithridates by force or treachery should ever get him into his power; yet his ignorance where I was, might preserve me for more happy times, and make me one day recover that Crowne, he had so fatally lost. I was therefore by Arsamnors care and fidelity carried with safety to that Gally which was provided for us under the Promontory of Posidum , from whence the winde favouring us, blowing from the North, with Sailes and Oares, we soone crost the Sea called Propontus , and past through the Hellespont memorised by the famous death of Hero and Leander , whose Cities Sestos and Abydos crown'd the shoares of the guilty waters. Then crossing the Æ gean , and Icarian Sea, we cast anchor under the Promontory of Panormus , where Arsamnor dismissed his Gally, and leaving me in a little Village near Athens , went thither to seek a Sanctuary, which he easily obtained by the favour of Ariston , the eminentest man in a that City; for the Athenians were jealous of the growing glory of Mithridates , lest the losse of their City might have composed a part of it. Arsamnor then form'd himself an equipage fit for a Nobleman of Cappadocia , which he said he was; as also that he was forced out of his owne Countrey by the prevalencie of Mithridates Armes, and for his fidelity to his own Prince, assuming also the name of Telamon which had been his Grandfathers. The charms of his conversation, his affability, and other ornaments and vertues, soone gained him so considerable an interest, not only in Ariston , but in all the other Athenians, that he spent his time there in as much safety as if it had beene in Nicomedia , and with as much satisfaction as the remembrance of his Kings affairs would admit. But whilest I thus past my infancie at Athens, Mithridates had Conquered all Bithynia , and Cappadocia , and was neare forming as great an Empire in Asia , as the Romans had in Europe , which great people, though extremely perplexed by the sad discords of Italy , and of their owne Citie, yet being as careful of their glory as of their being, desiring the last, but for the first, they elected Cornelius Scylla , General of the Asian warre, under whose conduct they promised themselves a revenge, as great, as their desire of it; his earliest actions rendering that belief a rational one. But Scylla , who feared Marius and Cinna gave him this power in Asia , the better to establish their owne in Rome , delayed going to the warre so long, that the Grecian Cities, who at first more apprehended the Roman power then Mithridates's , and therefore gave Scylla some promises of joyning their Armies to his, now looking upon Mithridates Army as the nearest, and consequently as the greatest danger, joyned with the Asian , as thinking it their best interest, when doubtlesse honesty only was; and the two first Cities which were guilty of this change, were Athens , and Thebes , to whom the Pontick King granted many priviledges; and to enable them to be his friends, or to secure their not being his enemies, he sent them a vast army out of Asia under the command of the Prince Archathias , whose Lieutenant General was Archilaus , that same Archilaus who did him such memorable service on the banks of Amneus, Mithridates in person continued in the Citie of Nicomedia to celebrate his Nuptials; for finding Fontamyris preferr'd banishment with Nicomedes , before Empire with Mithridates , Hate invaded the place of Love, and to let the late object of his, know, resentment had performed what it may be she thought nothing but time could, solemnly married in the Metropolis of Fontamyris Kingdome the fair Calamis , whose beauty gave her what her birth could not. The Pontick King thinking himself sufficiently revenged on Fontamyris by expelling her out of Bithynia , and by making another Queene of it, in it, exchanged his love of beauty, into love of Empire, and so assiduously followed the warre, that in few dayes all the Asian Princes had drawne their swords in his quarrel, or had given him Hostages not to employ them against him, so that nothing was more generally believed, then that Greece would be the Scene of the warre, and that Mithridates would save Scylla the trouble of invading Asia , by meeting him half way. Telamon finding how deeply Athens was engaged in the Pontick quarrel, would have chose some other Retreat, fearing he was too considerable to be unknowue, if Arcathias , or Archilaus came into the City, and fearing also if he were taken, it might be my ruine; but Ariston hindered it, who assured him no Asian General, or Garrison should ever enter Athens , unlesse the Romans came to besiege it, which if they did, he would not faile to send into some place of safety him and his son; for I was not only thought to be his son by all the Athenians, but I also thought my self so, so strictly Telamon kept Nicomedes command. This promise made my Governour continue me in Athens , where we learned that Rome awakened with the Revolt of Greece , with the great army Arcathias had brought thither, and with the greater, Mithridates was to bring, had hastily ordered Scylla to his command, who had in this meane time, so well settled his affaires in the City, as he doubted not but to end the Asian warre before they could receive any considerable alteration. But that great people were then reduced to so low a necessity, that to furnish Scylla they were constrained to give him those sacred golden vessels which Numa Pompilius had consecrated to the Roman Deities, thereby evincing glory was their greatest God. Mithridates now understanding that Scylla only wanted a fair winde to crosse the Adriatick Gulph, and that the Coast of Italy , which that Sea did confine, was now covered with souldiers, jealous lest so many Italians as were settled in Asia might embrace the quarrel of their Countrey, or desiring the wealth of that people to defray the charges of the war, or detesting that Nation, or else to render the Asiaticks uncapable of pardon, sent Orders to all his Governours in Asia on a prefixed day to kill all the Italians under their power, without any regard to sex, age, or condition, to cast their carcases into the fields, there to leave them unburied, and to reserve one half of their goods to his use, the other half to distribute amongst themselves. Oh Gods! (continued Callimachus ) what sinnes could the unfortunate Nicomedes and Fantamyris be guilty of, that you could cast them from the throne of Bithynia to place such a monster in it? and why would you give so much wickednesse so much power to act it, or permit so many millions to be governed by one, who was so unable to governe himself? But yet it was fit that subjects which could obey such an Order, should be govern'd by such a King: Yes (generous Princes) the Asiaticks observed their Prince's command, and on the fatall day shed a Sea of Italian blood, the slaves and the free, the young and the old, the male and the female, the poor and the rich, found no Sanctuary in their conditions, no, nor even in the Temples, nor in the very embracing the Gods of them: The Temple of Artemisius in Ephesus , the Temple of Æ sculapius in Pergamus , and the Temple of the Goddesse Vesta in Caria were hardly able to containe the bodies of those who were murdered in them: And as if their fury had ingross'd or drown'd all other considerations, they had not discretion enough so to act their wickednesse, as to leave themselves the shadow of an excuse for it; since they kill'd these poore creatures with so much relish, that it appeared to be as much their delight, as it was their cruelty. But this could not so much lessen the Roman interest in Asia , as it did encrease their title to it; for the Gods could not protect the Asian quarrel, without protecting the Asian crimes. Those of Delos (subject to the Athenians) either apprehending to be engaged in a quarrel which the effusion of so much innocent blood assured them would be unsuccesseful, or hoping to cast off the Athenian yoak, declared for Scylla before he came into Greece , against whom Ariston went; but being too weak, had the assistance of Archilaus , and therby soon reduced Delos to her former obedience, in which expedition Archilaus so flattered Ariston , and so elevated his ambition, that it was concluded betweene them, Mithridates should make Ariston Prince of Athens , and that Ariston should do fealty for it to Mithridates . Yet this was not done with so much secrecy, but that Telamon had some suspicion of it, which afterwards he was the more confirm'd in, by the actings of Ariston , which transcended what a free State could suffer; But though the Athenians were sensible of it, yet they wanted the power to redresse it, for besides the interest Ariston had in Athens , he was so openly countenanced by Archilaus , that the discovery of his designe was a greater trouble to the people, then the ignorance could have beene. Telamon at length so well acted his part, that Ariston permitted him to retire to Miletus the Metropolis of Caria , and sent some Athenians to convey us thither: this place he elected, as being by the situation of it, likely to avoid that warre which now threatened Greece , and like to oppose any warre which should threaten it, by the great obligations it had to Art and Nature. It was there that Telamon as soone as I was capable of learning, began to instruct me in Philosophy, that on the score of Reason I might contemne that power, and glory, which misfortune was but too likely to deny me. In this calme retreat we learnt those bloody revolutions which happened in Greece; how at last Scylla landed there only with five Legions, and certaine Cohorts and Turmes, in which small army there was yet so exact a discipline, that it made all believe, those which had acted the highest conquest, the conquest of themselves, would hardly be denied any other. This belief not only brought Thebes under the Roman power, without Scylla's employing it to procure that end, but also deterr'd Arcathias and Archilaus from determining the warre by a general battel. But Scylla , after having fruitlessely essayed to provoke them out of so protractive and cold a resolution, elected at once to besiege Athens and the Port of Pir aeus , believing if the Asians would not attempt relieving of those places, he should soone win them, or if they did, he should soone win a victory. He farther concluded, that if they were so ill Protectors of such friends, it would deter the Grecians from continuing, or at least from assuming that name. This resolution being knowne to Arcathias , and Archilaus , they determined that the first of them should keep the field with halfe their army to obstruct Scylla's supplies, and the last should fling himself into Pir aeus to obstruct his conquests; and that the Grecians might see they had not invited them into dangers which they declined participating in; Ariston , who in person continued in Athens , having a considerable garrison, performed things with it, which were so; and never any Pyramid gave the builder of it more fame, then the walls of Pir aeus gave Piriclion an Athenian Captaine, who had rais'd them during the Peloponesian war, and which in this Roman war rendered all Scylla's assaults invalid, and the battering Ram unworthy that name; yet Scylla was not at all dejected hereat, but elevated himself with the glory of besieging at once the greatest army in Greece , and the greatest City of it, for by this time the Gods had taken away the young Prince Arcathias by a sudden death as he was raising an army to relieve his friends, or not to have survived the unhappinesse of having beene unable to do it; so that those forces wanting a Captaine fit to employ them, were by Archilaus orders come into Athens , and Pir aeus by Sea, which they did safely by the help of the Mithridatick Gallies, Scylla having none to dispute the Empire of that element with, I must confesse (continued Callimachus ) the first actions of war which ever gave me envy, and a desire of imitation, were those of this siege; for never was there more Art and courage manifested in so small a compasse, as within the Athenian walls, and the Roman Camp. But famine put a period to the besiegers paines, and the besiegeds glory; But yet even famine it self for a time lengthened the siege, the death of some continuing the life of others; for the living fed upon the dead But in conclusion, there was no hands to justifie the walls of Athens ; and then Ariston retired into the Castle, glorying that the Athenians had left Athens , rather then that the Romans had taken it; but the same misery which had reigned in the towne, soone did the like in the Castle; where Ariston endured death with as much resolution, as he had opposed it; proud with the knowledge that Athens and his dominion over it found their period in one day, and that the noblest City of the world accompanied his fall. Scylla being thus Master of Athens rewarded his souldiers patience and courage with all things sacred and prophane; and by the great severity he practised upon those Athenians which had escaped the war and the famine, made them know it had beene an act of more honour, and more ease, to have expired with their Countrey, then so to have out-liv'd it. Archilaus burning with desires of revenge, or else to evidence by some high performances after Arcathias death that his having bin General had hindered many great actions, drew all the Mithridatick forces into one body, determining therewith to place a period, or bring an accession to Scylla's glory. The Roman General received this Intelligence with Prophetick Raptures, and in his high Joy before the battel, manifested his confidence of winning it. The Countrey neare Cherovia was the Scene of this Dispute, from which City the battel took its name. Murena, Galba and Hortensius for a time drew all the Romans admiration, till Scylla , jealous that those under him should act above him, performed such prodigies of valour, that the Romans esteemed it more unjust not to give all their wonder unto their General, then to have deny'd before a part, unto three such men. Archilaus in this defeat lost upon the place one hundred and ten thousand men, and the hopes of ever having so many together againe in Greece , which by an expresse he advertised Mithridates of, who to keep the war out of Asia , forthwith sent Dorilaus and the Prince Diogenes with eighty thousand foot into Greece to re-inforce Archilaus , and to enable him to make one other experiment of Fortune in the field. At the same time also he assembled all the Princes and Tetrarchs of Asia which he suspected, or was not confident of; and having them in his power, put them, their wives and children to death, his past cruelty rendering this an act of wisdome; for he had so offended all mankinde, that he could not kill any but such as were his enemies. Many Noble Cities he used as ill by Zenobius a Lieutenant of his, whose natural cruelty equall'd his Kings; this was the last place he acted his Massacres in, and then went to Ephesus , expecting like reception, and designing the like tyranny. But the Ephesians finding that resistance, could not be worse then submission, resolved on the first, though Philopomenes was Governour thereof, and made so by Mithridates . This example had so good successe, that the Cities of Thrales, Hippapes and Mesopolites followed it, which made Mithridates think, that though cruelty was pleasant to him, yet it was not wise [ I have not acquainted you with so many Tyrannies of his, because he was my enemy, but to let you see that 'twas not only to punish the unhappy Nicomedes that this Mithridates was rais'd, but to punish all the civiliz'd world ] To these great revolts he received the certaine advertisement, that Archilaus and Dorilaus had been defeated in a furious battel by Scylla , who derived his victory from his personal courage; for when his army fled, he ran to the first Eagle, and taking it up, flew with it into the midst of the Asiaticks, crying out to his souldiers; If any aske, O Romans, where you have abandon'd your General, tell them you left him fighting in Orchomenia : which expressions and action raised their shame above their fear, and made them return to the battel, in which they did things that defaced the sin of their aflight, and presented Scylla with the Victory, which though that day far advanc'd, yet it was not till next day perfected; for then assaulting and entring Archilaus Camp, few scap'd out of it but himself. But to qualify the joyes of such signal Victories, Scylla received advertisement from Rome , that Cornelius Cinna , and Caius Marius having usurp'd the power of the City and over the Senate, had declar'd him an enemy to the people of Rome , had ras'd all his houses, and had proscrib'd all his friends and partizans. Scylla at this so fatal intelligence, loses not his courage, but resolves by it to form himself as great an Empire in Greece , and Asia , as his enemies design'd in Europe , and then in a fair Field to decide who should have both. But Cinna and Marius , who knew he had so high an ascendent over his army, that, what they could do, he could perswade them to do it for him, and believing no other designe could proportion Scylla's courage, and judgement, elected Flaccus one of the Consuls, and sent him with two of the best Legions to supply Scylla's Office, or to force it from him. But Flaccus being no Souldier, they sent for his Pr aetor Fimbria , who had by many exploits in armes rendred himself justly famous. This new Roman army being come to Brundusium , part of it with the Fleet which carried them, was taken by Mithridates Fleet; part of them perished in a storm, part that were landed in Thessaly , went to Scylla , not being able to endure Flaccus his insolencies;  & the rest had done the like had not Timbria by reasons, and clemency hindred it, which yet more incens'd Flaccus than if they had all abandon'd him; for by their so staying, he found one that served under him, had more power over his army, than he; which engendred such animosities between them, that Flaccus not only commanded Fimbria back to Rome , but elected one Termus in his place, which so enraged him that he took away the Fasces and Rods (which were the Pr aetorian ensignes) as they were carryed before Termus , who fled to Flaccus for reparation. The Consul hereupon comands his Souldiers to seize upon Fimbria , who experimented their love was a better commission then the Senate without it could give; for all the army abandon'd Flaccus , who was forced to fly to Chalcis , whither Fimbria followed, and at length found him hid in a Well, from whence being taken out, though he imploy'd Fimbria's pitty even in tears, yet he causd his head forthwith to be cut off and flung into the Sea, though Flaccus was both Consul and General, and Fimbria but a private Citizen. But to repair so signal an affront to the Roman Empire, he vigorously prosecuted Mithridates friends, which were the greatest enemies of it, which he said, was the end why the army was sent out of Italy , and which had thitherto been interrupted by the executed Consul's impertinency. Amongst his many exploits, one I cannot but mention, which was his cruelty and treachery to the Illians; for finding their strength might give his Romans as long a trouble, as it once did the Grecians, he left off force, and flatter'd them so successfully under the name of Fathers of Rome , that they admitted him into their City with his army, which he soon became Master of, and destroyed all that was living in it, thereby making one cruelty silence many, who would have otherwise reproached him with it, nay, the Images of the Gods, and the Temples in which they were adored, participated of his fury, which some thought they deserved for not better defending their votaries. Only the Palladium , which was sent the Trojans by Jupiter , was preserved by miracle, a vault of the Temple giving it at once both a Tombe  & safety; so that Troy was more unhappy in her children, than in her enemies, Fimbria being worse unto her than Agamemnon ; or else her first death having given life to the greatest Empire in the World, Fimbria would in gratitude thereunto make her still continue in that condition. But Mithridates after the last signal defeate given Archilaus , finding though Scylla and Fimbria were enemies to each other, yet they were both so to him; and believing the first of them wanted but an honourable pretence of leaving the Asian war, to dispute the Empire of Rome with Marius and Cinna , and to appease the manes of so many of his friends as had been murther'd by them, as also fully convinced such a series of defeats had disenabled him from much longer continuing a War; sent orders to Archilaus to endeavour a peace with Scylla , which after many a meeting, at length at one between Scylla and Mithridates was concluded, but on such advantagious conditions for the Romans , that even the articles of the agreement were the manifestations of his conquest. Scylla having so prosperously put a period to his Mithridatick War, to leave all clear behinde him, went against Fimbria , and summoned him to deliver him up his armias being Proconsul of Asia ; to which Fimbria returning an high answer, Scylla immediately besieged him, and [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17026001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE47D60&area=prose&forward=textsFT) reded him to so low a state, that Fimbria hired a Slave to murther Scylla , which being discovered, all Fimbria's army were so scandaliz'd at it, that many abandon'd him and went to Scylla , agaiust whom Fimbria had done too much to expect his mercy, and therefore contemning it when 'twas offer'd, upon the conditions of his departing into Italy , and resigning up his army, he stole to Pergamus , where in the Temple of Æ sculapius he ran his sword thorough his own body, but finding the wound was not friendly enough to afford him a sudden death, he commanded an infranchis'd servant of his, to dispatch him, which he did, and then with the same Sword followed him. Thus Fimbria died, whom the Gods permitted to be as cruel to himself as he had been to others, thereby manifesting to be so, was as much his nature, as it was his crime. Immediately after his death all his army yeelded themselves to Scylla , who received them with so much humanity, that they found Fimbria in killing himself had obliged them, as much as Scylla ; who having appointed Curio to resettle Nicomedes in Bithynia , and Ariobarzanes in Cappadocia (which was one of the articles of the Peace) and having the best he could calmed the differences in Asia , and rais'd five years advance of tribute in all the Cities of it under his dominion, which so impoverish'd them, that they were necessitated to pawn their Amphiteaters, their Town-houses, and all their other publick places to enable them to pay it, by the assistance of Methridates Galleys (which also on the peace were resigned to him) he transported his army first into Greece , and thence into Italy , which he fill'd with such confusions, and with so many horrid murthers and proscriptions that to such as lov'd their Countrey, death was no ill expedient to avoid, beholding the miseries of it. The Heavens by many prodigies seem'd to fore- tell those many others which men should act A Woman in Rome was delivered of a Serpent in stead of a Child. The Earth by a furious shaking flung down many Statues Temples  & of the Gods; And the Capitol, that proud Fabrick, built by so many Kings, was consumed by lightning. These and many others of the same nature were the actings and sufferings of that part of the World, in which I spent my infancy, and earliest youth, which were the only times of all my life that I was free from the sense of misery, which too I derived from Nature, not from Fortune, who had provided infelicities for me against my coming into the World, sufficient to make me for ever detest it. But having hitherto entertain'd you with accidents at large, I shall now confine my relations to narrower limits; being by this conjuncture of time arrived to an age capable of relishing happinesse and misfortune, to which latter only my stars had design'd me. In Miletus , the place of my then residence, there were several young Gentlemen of my age, and believ'd quality (for I past still in the opinion of the World, as well as in my own, for the Son of Telamon ) with whom I learnt all those exercises, as well of the mind as the body, which Greece and the lesser Asia plac'd any value upon, in which I had the happiness to surpass my companions, whose stupidity only I fear gave me that precedency. But sometimes to divert our selves, we used to hunt the wilde Boar; which was a Game, that Countrey was but too fruitful in; for often those furious beasts, when press'd by hunger, or by those which pursued them, would accompanie their own deaths, with some of their Hunters, which made Telamon very unwilling, to afford me often so dangerous a divertisement; neither would he ever permit it me, but accompanied by most of those young Gentlemen, over whom my larger proficiency, and the rate at which I lived (which was eminent) gave me some superiority; He himself too keeping alwayes by my side. One day, a hunting match being agreed on, we found a Boar of so immense a size, and so largely arm'd with Tuskes, that the boldest of our Hunts-men would have willingly resign'd the hopes of the quarry, to have avoyded the danger of the chase, had not the fear of shame been more prevalent then the fear of the Boar, who having cast off all his followers, but me (for Telamon's Horse had strained himself so unhappily, that he could no longer gallop) the inraged beast took along a high-way which came out of a neighbour-wood, at the next extremity, whereof I perceived some Gentlemen,  & Ladies, by the magnificence of whose equipage I easily judged, were of no mean quality. The Boar not deterr'd at the sight of so much copany, boldly runnes into the midst of them, and thereby so terrified all the Horses, that they fled back into the Wood, where one of them cast his rider, which the Boar no sooner perceived, than he ran furiously to her; Her great danger, and her greater beauty invited my assistance, which without balancing I ran to pay her; but finding my Horse might offend her, whom I intended to protect, I leapt off of him, and with a Javelin in my hand I placed my self between that beauty and the danger, which threatned her, and darted my Javelin so happily at the Boare, that piercing him through and through, it put some stop to his course, and gave me leasure to draw my Sword, with which, during his amazement, I ran him in at the mouth, and sheath'd the blade of it in his body; which though it gave him his death's wound, yet before he died, with one of his tuskes he struck me into my left side so deep, and so very near my heart, that his not having done me more harm, could not be so strange as the grief which invaded the beauty I had delivered was, that he had done me so much. I had that consolation and misfortune together, to observe she was more concern'd in my danger, than she had been at her own, thereby evincing I had freed her from one trouble, but to cast her into a greater. Never beauty had so many surprising charmes as that of the fair Monyma , which yet receiv'd some little accession by the condition and dress she was in; For her shape, and stature, which was capable of no addition, was perfectly discovered to the obliged, and ravish'd sight, by the clothes she then wore, which were such as the Goddess Diana is represented with in her celebrated Temple of Ephesus , when in dreames she manifested her self on Latmus , to the sleepy Endymion: that little paleness which her danger and disorder disobliged her with, was yet so well repair'd by the reflection of some falls of carnation feathers which shadowed her face, that she seem'd to be no loser thereby. In a word, she was such as made me more apprehend a wound from her, than that I had already received. In the amazement of that silent Fear, the fair Monyma came to me, and perceiving my clothes all bloody, she told me: I fear, Sir, your highest civility has involv'd you in a resembling danger, but believe me, your having so freed me from trouble, has made me a great sharer in yours. Madam, (I replyed, sensibly moved with so much obligingness) you might much sooner ascribe the small service I have paid you, to my duty than my civility; for 't was but just I should free you from that hazard I only had occasion'd; and if any thing troubles me in this performance, 'tis only from its looking so much like my debt, that it leaves you no rise to attribute any part of it to my inclinations, which (Madam) are such for your service, as they would joyfully manifest themselves by courting danger, though it were as high, as that goodnesse which makes you so sympathize in mine. I had hardly strength enough to speak these words, neither was I able to make an end of them without leaning upon my sword, which being too weak a support, I fell at Monyma's feet, who by a great shreek acquainted me her trouble at it was the like. As soon as her grief permitted her reason to act, she perceived a spring of blood issuing out of my side, and believing that ebullition occasioned my fainting, she tore off some of her linnen, and by holding it to the orifice of the wound, endeavoured to stop the bleeding. But though her care was strangely kinde, yet it had been fruitless, if her reiterated cryes had not drawn a Gentleman to her assistance, who having learnt the cause of her concernment for me, afforded me so much of his, that by it, and the help of a Chirurgion, which happily waited on him, my wound was drest, and my senses restored. The stranger, whose care and civility had so largely contributed thereunto, immediately came and made me such signal and handsome acknowledgements, for what I had done for the lovely Monyma , that I concluded by the greatness of his gratitude, his concernes for her were not little; and though his riper yeares might well have exempted me from certain emotions, I never till then was acquainted with,  & knew not whilest they disorder'd me what they were, or from whence they proceeded, yet after they ceas'd (which they did not till Monyma her self told me, he was her Father:) I found they proceeded from a small jealousie, to the cause of which I was so meer a stranger that I knew not, even enduring the effect of love, that I was at all engaged in that noble passion. But as soon as ever I understood Philopomenes relation to the beauty I admired, I made him such humble retributions, that he protested my civility had as much confin'd him to be my friend, as the service I had done his daughter: and to manifest his care of me, was greater than mine of my self, he forced me from an entertainment, which I esteemed more pleasing, than that recovery the Chirurgion assur'd him it was an enemy unto; and putting me into his Chariot (for though he and the fair Monyma rid when I met them, yet it was only the better to enjoy the freshness of the morning) he accompanied me to my house in Miletus , notwithstanding all my reiterated prayers to hinder it. By the way I met the afflicted Telamon , who by the immense sorrow he assumed at my danger, had then made me conclude him my Father, had I formerly doubted it. I will exempt you from the relation of those visits I received from Philopomenes during my indisposition, or from those many inquiries made after my health by his fair daughter, on whom, when I was restored to mine, I waited so constantly, that Telamon began to fear I did it upon some more pressing invitation that bare civility. That which made me the more openly make my addresses to Monyma was, the then believed equality of our conditions; for she was the daughter of an Ephesian Lord, who had so detested Mithridates cruelty, that though by his commission he was made Governour of Ephesus , yet he had invited and perswaded the City to declare against him; which injury he apprehended Mithridates would revenge, being enabled thereunto by the fresh agreement concluded with the Romans, who for the most part were returned with Scylla to rob Italy of that peace, they had left Asia in; And that his Countrey might not be involved in his misfortunes, or occasioned by him, he had left Ephesus and retired to Miletus , whose strength he thought would prove a better Sanctuary. But if Telamon had cause to suspect I had a passion for Monyma , this which I am now telling, gave him a certainty of it. The City of Miletus was in ancient times besieged by a barbarous Prince, who having by their obstinacy endured much loss, resolved to repair it by the ruine of the place; but being informed that amongst the besieged, there was a Virgin of such excellent beauty, that Nature never had obliged the World with the like, this Barbarian desired  & obteined a sight from her from off the walls, which so inflamed him, that he esteemed to conquer her, was a happier Victory than to conquer Miletus ; so that when the Citizens despaired of safety, he sent them word, if they would deliver up to his pleasure the fair Cyaxara , he would forthwith raise his siege, and never more present himself before their Wals. This Nymph having as much resolution as beauty, devoted her self as a sacrifice to save her Countrey, and only tyed the Tyrant to suspend the acting of his lust, till she was out of the Territories of Miletus , that her people might not behold, but only enjoy the advantage of her shame. This contract being made, the fair Cyaxara was delivered up to her Ravisher, and abandoned her friends with more constancy, and resolution, than they were Masters of, when she did so. The next night after he had got out of the agreed on limits, he determined to enjoy the reward of the War; but instead thereof, the vertuous Cyaxara had prepar'd for him the Reward of his sin; for when he was come into her bed, in the height of his Wine, and Lust, with a Poniard she had conceal'd, she pierc'd his heart, at which unexpected stroke, he uttered so loud a cry, that many of his chief Officers, who were in the next rome, ran to his assistance; but it was too late: for his black soul had forsaken his guilty body. And Cyaxara hearing a throng of people coming into her chamber, with the same weapon, all reeking with the Tyrant's blood, with which she had preserved her self from the lust of one of her Enemies, she preserved her self from the revenge and fury of the rest The death of this Monster occasion'd so many divisions in his army, that thereby Miletus was preserved from the fury of it; whose inhabitants in comemoration of the fair Cyaxaras gallantry, ordained a yearly Festival should be for ever celebrated for their deliverance, and for those eternal joyes her virtue had invited the Gods to crown her with; and that this day might be observed with more solemnity, the Magistrates of the City gave the fairest Diamond they could buy to the best Tilter, who was to present it to the greatest Beauty in the assembly, and who during that year was to be called Cyaxara . This signal day being come, and believing my self able enough to mannage a Horse, and handle a Lance, I begg'd Telamon to permit me to be one of the Tilters, which he assented unto, and it being the first time of my appearing in arms, he so beautified mine with Jewels of inestimable value, that they drew the eyes of all the people on me at my entrance into the lists as much as my success did when I went out, to present the reward of it to the fair Monyma , who was seated upon a Scaffold with others of her sex, who were of highest quality at that meeting. As soon as I came to the foot of that Scaffold, I allighted from my Horse, and having begged and obteined the Ladies permission to ascend it, I presented Monyma with that Diamond I had won, and told her; This, Madam, which my fortune has given me, my justice humbly payes unto you; I should be as blind as that power from whom only I derive my Victory, did I any other way employ the acquisitions of it; for 'tis so much your right that to have declin'd presenting it to you had been to have broke the Lawes of this solemn meeting. This little complement put Monyma into a small disorder, which having something conquer'd, she repli'd, thhat Callimachus , which your merit has given you, your civility has presented me; but indeed you had but this way of imploying your success, to make me think you deserved it not; All these Ladies (turning to those that were near her) will have cause to desire the perpetual extinction of this festival, when it furnishes an occasion of acting so high an injustice; for 'tis as much so to decline making your present to any of of them, as to conferre't upon me. I shall never, Madam, (I reply'd) have a belief opposite to the fair Monyma's , when her modesty does not form hers; but then I must beg her pardon, if to avoid the greater offence, I commit the less: neither do I think these Ladies can esteem me unjust, the most they can believe is, that I am unfortunate in having a successe which confined me to disoblige so many to do right to one, since none could have hid my power, that could justly otherwise have imploy'd it. Whilest I was thus discoursing, a Gentleman called Diocles , who that day I had dismounted in the Tilting, came to the foot of the Scaffold where his Mistris was, to whom he apprehended I would have given the prize (for 'tis none of the least miracles in Love, that every one believes the author of his, is the hansomest) where finding himself deceived, his jealousie turned to anger, and he was no more troubled at his first belief, than he now was, at what had displaced it. The beauty he serv'd was called Irene , who yeelded to none but Monyma , she was blest with as many graces of the minde, as of the body, and therefore had no inclination to receive the addresses of Diocles , who had nothing considerable but his extraction, his riches, and his courage, the last of which had been so often, and succesfully tryed, that duelling seem'd to be one of his recreations. The great affront he had that day received in his person, and the higher he thought he received in his Mistris, made him with a loud voice tell me; Callimachus , could I have fancied you would have given the prize of this dayes Tilting to any, but the fair Irene , I had by my Sword hindred you from acting that crime, and her from enduring it; but since I finde you guilty thereof, I cannot but punish what I should have prevented; which I would have done in a privater way, could I have supprest my resentments so long; And yet it is but just that the injury being before so many thousand witnesses, the reparation should be the like. I had no sooner heard these words, than saluting Monyma and the rest of the Ladies, I descended from the Scaffold,  & having flung off my Armour as Diocles had done his, I told him; That which I confesse, my fortune has given me over all the rest, my courage has given me over thee, which I am come by a repeated experiment to convince thee of, and to let thee feel I have been much more just in paying the prize to Monyma , than thou hast been in presuming to own thy self a servant to the fair Irene . At the end of these words we drew out our Swords, and observing that not onely all the Ladies, but the Magistrates of the City were coming to part us, we ran at each other with as much fury, as if our Mistresses had not onely bin the beholders, but were to have been the reward of the combat. My thrust was more fortunate than his, for it pierced him through the body, but his onely pierced my left arm; so that in the close having flung him down, and disarmed him, I bid him ask his life; He told me, since it had been so unsuccesful 't was not worth the pains. My resentment being a little over, I told him; Though thou wouldest perswade me by representing thy life is not worth the asking, that it is hardly worth the taking; yet I believe it much more considerable, and therefore for Monyma , and Irene's sake, I give it thee; by this time these two beauties with many others, as also Telamon , and the Magistrates were come, who forthwith caused both our wounds to be dressed; and because mine was in my arm, the Chirurgions sent for a scarf to support it in, which staying for too long, the fair Irene took off a rich one she had on, and bid them make use of that; this sight wounded Diocles more than my Sword had done; which taking notice of, I told Irene that he wanted it more then I, and though it were strangely obliging to me, yet it might prove more so to him, whose condition made intercessions for him, by his being uncapable of making any for himself. Irene immediately, either pittying Diocles , or to be reveng'd on me, permitted me to present it to him; which he refused, saying, He never willingly received a favour from an Enemy, nor would not his Mistrisse's derived from such a mediation, and conveyed by such a hand. This rudenesse made me repent my civility, and I believe revenge it, by wearing what he had declined. I will exempt you (continu'd Callomachus ) from the relation of Monyma's little Triumph, from Telamon's discontent at my quarrel, from his trouble at my wound, and his care of my recovery; which was much earlier than that of Diocles , who languisht above a year before he was able to pay a visit to Irene , and to beg her pardon that he had so ill defended her right. During all which time, I was so assiduous in my addresses to Monyma , that I had pregnant cause to believe they had not been fruitlesse. The fair Irene also had contracted so strict a friendship with her, that she became her confident, and at length my advocate, from whose intercession I received more than I could have expected from any one; so that now my greatest fears were from Telamon , who alwayes manifested so inveterate an aversion to my Love, and one day so expresly prohibited my continuing it, that not being able to divest my self of it, I was necessitated to carry it with so much secrecy, that Irene , and at last Monyma herself began to think, that was my designe, which indeed was my punishment. I had not the confidence to acquaint her, with what made me so rarely visit her; but when ever I got the opportunity of paying her that duty, I was so passionate in my expressions and looks, that I hoped my actions would acquaint her with what I durst not, which I esteemed the least unhansome way of disclosing my misfortune, and of evidencing my constancy. But whether she did not, or would not, understand this way of proceeding, she not onely began to use me at a rate, which mighr manifest a lesse concernment for me than she had once honoured me with, but also conjur'd Irene to decline interceding for a person, who declined interceding for himself. This that obliging friend inform'd me of, which occasioned a violent dispute between my duty to Telamon ,  & that I owed the fair Monyma ; in which though they could not vanquish each other, yet they vanquisht me, and cast me into so deep a melancholy, that the last admir'd it, and the first did pitty it. Irene [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17026001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE47D60&area=prose&forward=textsFT) concluding there was something of mysterious in this, resolv'd to break those confinements Monyma had imposed on her, and to know of me what occasiond my [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17026001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE47D60&area=prose&forward=textsFT) sadnesse, and then to imparte it unto her. In this resolve she so artificially ordered things, that once in the Temple (which was the onely place I visited) she conjur'd me to acquaint her with the occasion of my change, and grief, which she onely asked that she might contribute to the cure of it. So generous a proceeding from a person which I knew was so, made me resolve, to be rather known unfortunate, than to be believed guilty; I therfore fully informed her [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17026001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE47D60&area=prose&forward=textsFT) with strict prohibitions Telamon had made me of ever visiting Monyma again, which had occasion'd my seeming coldnesse, but had really so punisht it, that it had produced those visible effects, she so obligingly deplored, and endeavoured to remove. I had not in so publike a place leasure to say more, or she, than that the next day in the same place, and hour I should meet her again. This command the succeeding morning I observ'd, and had not been long in the Temple, but Irene came into it, and whilest others were imploy'd in their devotions, she told me as I kneeled by her, that Monyma was neither worthy of my Love, nor her friendship, for she was so unwise, and so unkinde, as not to believe the too great truth I had told her, and she had told Monyma , who thought 'twas but a designe, to cloud my change, and passion for her self, and therefore that I must no more make use of her solicitations, since they were so far from acting that cure, that they made the disease. This information added wonder to my grief, both which so intirely possest me, that I had hardly strength enough to acknowledge that friendship, whose effects had so wounded me; which yet having performed in the best way I could, I immediately retired to entertain my thoughts which but too much contributed with fortune, to torment me; For now I had not onely two Enemies to contest with, Telamon's aversion, and Monyma's jealousy, but the latter was so unhappily placed, that what occasion'd the ill, rendred it incurable, since she had a suspicion of her, by whom onely I had hopes to cure it. This accessional misfortune conspiring with my Melancholy , cast me into a languishing feaver, which so mov'd Telamon , that one evening he came to my beds-side, and told me; Callimachus , I cannot be more confident that I am the occasion of your sadnesse, and indisposition, then I am, that you would excuse it, if I durst acquaint you with the reasons; which being confined by tyes too great to be broken; but by those which onely can absolve me from them; I am resolv'd to make a journey expressely to obtein their leave; provided before I go you will solemnely protest unto me, that during my absence, which shal be but two moons at most, you wil make no engagement of marriage to Monyma , and if by some accident, I can not foresee I should miscarry in the journey, you will then before you make her any promise thereof, observe what is conteined in this paper, and not open it till that time is effluxt; There you will find things you little expect, and such as I know will invite you to believe I am as just, as you now think me cruel, and that I had more wronged you, in yeelding to your desires, than I do in opposing them. I shall not (continued Callimachus ) tell you my amazement at these words, my endeavours to disswade him from a voyage, which, I despaited not my obedience, and the sense I had of his goodnesse, might in some short time exempt him from, nor those holy vowes I made him, when I could not divert him from his intended journey, that I would not make any such engagement to Monyma , during those two months, nor after, till first I had observed his commands in the sealed paper. Three dayes after, when Telamon found my health was in some measure restored, after he had once again made me reiterate my former vowes, he brought me a Cabbinet in which he told me there were Jewels enough to continue for some years the Equipage I liv'd in; then having imbraced me, and kist my cheek, he told me, Perhaps Callimachus , you are much more than my son;  & then hastily went aboard his Galley (for his Voyage was to be performed by Sea) that I might not see some tears which were stealing from him. The end of the first Book. PARTHENISSA. THE SECOND BOOK. was able to pay the fair Monyma a visit, (which was not prohibited me.) When I came into her chamber, I found, to my amazement, none with her but Diocles , who was kneeling by her. I believe my sight surprized them as much as the company I found Monyma in, and Diocles posture did me; after we had express'd so much by a silent contemplating one another; he rose up, and told me, I hope Callimachus , you are glad to find the fair Monyma has made me your Rival, and that on my knees I beg pardon for not having been earlier convinc'd of a truth, which I did uever so much doubt, as now I joyfully acknowledge. This precipitate declaring himself my Rival, made me in spight of that respect I owed Monyma thus answer him: If your becoming my Rival does no more please the fair Monyma , than it does trouble me, you will be as unsuccesful in your submission, as you were in your resistance; And I cannot but believe had you a year sooner acknowledged so clear a truth, you had saved more thereby than now you will get. This reply so incens'd Diocles , that with an inflamed look he told me; since any wounds were received for not acknowledging Monyma's beauty was the highest, I shall repine at nothing therein, but that Callimachus hand did give them, who owed his successe to his quarrel, not his courage; That I owed my successe (I answer'd) in that disploit, to what you say, I shall as freely confesse, as that in any other my courage will give me the like over Diocles , which if this moment I did not convince you of, 'tis onely that all my passions yeeld to those I have for the fair Monyma ; which if yours did, we had not so long cast off that respect we owe her; and which your rudenesse shall not make me be any longer guilty of. Whereupon having whispered a word or two unto each other (which was an assignement where we should meet an hour after.) Diocles immediately saluted Monyma , and went out of the roome; she all this while was so astonish't, first at my coming to visit her, then at her being found at the Wars, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17026001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE47D60&area=prose&forward=textsFT) and lastly at our quarrel, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17026001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE47D60&area=prose&forward=textsFT) that she had not the power to command Diocles not to go away, though twice she opened her mouth to do it. I was not a little satisfied to have so favourable an opportunity of acquainting her, what had so long hindred my waiting on her, and what had now given me the happinses of doing it; I will not by retail, tell you all the particulars of this day, nor of some subsequent actions; it being eough for you to know that I so well convinc'd Monyma of my passion, and how unalterable I should be in it, that she at last freely permitted me to make her my addresses again; and then she inform'd me that a little before I came to her, Philopomenes had brought Diocles into her chamber, and had commanded her to accept of him as her servant,  & as one whom he had fixt upon for her husband: that Diocles had told her, he now perceived a fault he as much gloried to confess, as formerly to be guilty of: and that my visit had obligingly interrupted his saying more, and consequently her enduring more. This free proceeding rejoiced me as much as my restauration to her favour, & made me believe what I had told my new Rival by way of resentment, he would find a Prophecie; twas then also she acquainted me, how that her ignorance of what had invited me so often to visit Irene , and so seldom her, had given her a little jealousie, which had but too much punish'd it self, by making her feel how sensible my supposed change was to her, which she ingenuously confest, was more so upon the account of her having lost me, than that Irene had got me. These ravishing assurances left me no fears, but those which proceeded from an apprehension of what Philopomenes authority might act against me, and that they were spoke to gain a power over me, which might suppresse that designe I had against Diocles , over whom thereby I might believe my advantage was sufficient, without seeking any greater from my Sword. Whilest I was thus evincing my gratitude, and entertaining my apprehensions, Monyma went out of the room, as she told me, to call one of her Women, lest Philopomenes by finding us alone, might not onely suspect the cause of Diocles's going away, but prohibit her receiving any visits from me, to prevent his receiving the like disgust in the future. Her return with what she went for, was so sudden, that it then silenc't one of my doubts; and because I had received as much satisfaction, as I could have promis'd my self from that day's waiting on her, that I had a witnesse which denied me the liberty of those discourses which I took most pleasure in, and that the hour of meeting Diocles drew neer, I kist the fair Monyma's hands, and went not long after to the place we had agreed on, where instead of finding Diocles , I found a guard of Soldiers, who convey'd me to my own house, and by their placing themselves at my Gate, made me know it was my prison: soon after a friend of mine came to advertise me, that Diocles had preceded me in the like usage. At first I repin'd against Monyma , who I knew was onely acquainted with our difference (and who, I learnt afterwards, went out of the chamber purposely to send notice thereof to the Officers of Justice) apprehending she denied me the repetition of a Victory, my Sword had once conferr'd on me; But then my thoughts changing, I began to believe (as Lovers still are apt to flatter themselves) that her being more a friend to my safety, than my honor, had occasioned this proceeding, and in that faith I found in my trouble, my satisfaction. But (said Callimachus ) to continue this part of my Story in that brevity which I have hitherto practised, I shall tell you, that after the Magistrates had declar'd we should not be freed, till we had mutually sworn never to fight against each other, and that all our friends had long, and unsuccesfully endeavord to extort that promise from us, wearied with our confinement, more with our not waiting upon Monyma , but most of all to obey her command, we past that assurance before her, and continued as much friends, as persons which had so little cause for it, could be. The next day after this reconciliatio, Monyma sent to me to meet her at Irene's (with whom she was perfectly reconcil'd, having discovered her mistake) where she told me, she had received a positive command from Philopomanes , never to admit any of my visits, and therefore henceforth, those I payd her must be where I then was, and that too both privately, and seldome, least the privilege of going to see her friend might be also denyed her, she further told me, she was confident this had long since been resolv'd though but that morning onely injoin'd: for her Father knew too well, how much an alliance with so considerable a Person, and so vastly rich, as Diocles was, would be to his advantage, and settlement in Miletus , not to prosecute it with his utmost endeavours, and that had he given her that command before the reconciliation, it would for ever have hinder'd it, for knowing I should have been eternally depriv'd of her company, I would probably have declin'd that agreement, which must have involv'd my Rival in the like infelicity; she then too acquainted me with that which her disorders at my former visit had made her omit, which was, that before Diocles made any expressions of his passions to her, he had conjur'd her to acquaint him, whether she had any inclinations for, or engagements to me; that if she had, he might not be so rude as to give any interruption to a person, whose satisfaction should alwaies form his: to which, she assur'd him she had not; which then was a reall truth: my not waiting on her having made her believe, I had supprest my inclinations for her, which had invited her to silence any she honourd me with. This information made me much lessen that aversion I had for Diocles , who I till then thought had designedly endeavoured to be my Rival: but on the other side I was struck with so deep a sadnesse, foreseeing those obstructions, my passion would contend with, that neither some fresh favours of Monyma's , nor Irene's promising me all her assistance, could any way devest me of my melancholy; which made the first of them tell me, she thought my affection was not neer so high as I represented it, since she too visibly found my fear was greater then my love; and that the apprehensions of things to come, were more prevalent to make me sad than her friendship was to hinder me from it. I was much asham'd to have this reprehension, but much more to have deserved it, which to do so no longer, I forced my self to divert those two persons, I see justly esteemed, which yet I did so constrainedly, that I gave them more cause of pitty, than satisfaction. I had sometime the happinesse of thus waiting on Monyma at the fair Irene's , and of receiving reiterated assurances from her, that neither Diocles's addresse, nor Philopomanes commands, could any thing prevail to the prejudice of my passion; And as she was determin'd not to give her self to any without his consent, so she would not be given to any without her own. 'Twas by such entertainements as these that at length my grief was conquer'd, and almost the two moones of Telamon's absence, during all which I had not heard any thing of, or from him, which gave me occasion both of trouble and wonder. But alas, not long after this tolerable condition I was told by Monyma , that her vigilant Father having discovered these hours of entertainement, we enjoyd at the fair Irene's , he had so expresly prohibited her ever to speak to me again, that now there was no way left of communicating our minds, but by letters, which too must be manag'd with much circumspection, and art, least that Expedient of acquainting each other with our thoughts might be also denied us. But now I must make a little digression, to inform you of what brought as great, as unexpected a change, not onely in my then passion, but in all the subsequent actions of my life. When Sylla had pacified Asia , and made conditions with, or rather impos'd them on Mithridates ; two of which were, that Ariobarzanes should be restored to Cappadocia , and Nicomedes to Bithynia , he shipt his army for Italy in the resigned up Fleet of the Ponticke King,  & left Murena and Cotta , with two legions onely (either to shew how absolute his conquest had been, or that he could spare no more from his intended one) to settle those Princes in their Thrones, and to order those other affaires, which his precipitate departure had denied him time to effect. These two Roman Commanders summon'd Mithridates to withdraw his Garrisons, and Army, out of those two Kingdomes, which at first he seem'd to send comands to have done, but the Governours made so many delayes, and frivolous excuses, that the Romans began to believe, his intentions and his promises were different. And the truth was, Mithridates did but protract the time, till he could hear what Sylla did in Italy , resolving (as the event manifested) if Rome was engag'd throughly in her domestick differences, he would not part with two dominions, which had cost him so much treasure and blood, and which were to be restored to persons, he had too sensibly wrong'd, to trust them with a power to right themselves, it being also much easier to keep them out of their Kingdomes, (if Sylla and Marius were plung'd into a civil War) than having restor'd them, to keep his own. The apprehension Murena had of this (for Cotta then returned for Italy ) made him send Mithridates word, that if by a set day, all excuses set apart, Nicomedes and Ariobarzanes had not right done them by fair means, they should have it done by the Sword, and he should be declared an Enemy for ever to the people of Rome . This brisk message made the Pontick King finde, that the day Murena had set down for the restitution of Bithynia , and Cappadocia , if he did not perform it by then, was the space he had allowed him to prepare for War; which he cheerfully did, because the same time he received certain intelligence that Marius and Sylla were so throughly engag'd in blood, that even Rome was become a Humane Shambles, and that they neither had the time, nor the power to minde any differences but their own But because he had experimented how advantagious it was to the Land-war, to be Master of the Sea, and that he had resigned to Sylla all his Fleet, as an evincement he was once conquer'd, and as a greater, that he should not put him to the trouble and charge of doing so again; He us'd all means imaginable to recover a second fleet; And though by the endeavours of Betuitus his Admiral he had engag'd many Pirats under his pay, yet he found so loose a discipline amongst them, and consequently so uncertain a help, that their pay was more considerable then their service; and therefore he discharged them, resolving to compose his Naval forces of such onely as should give him hopes to repair the smalness of their number, by the exactnesse of their Order and Obedience. This was the reason why he sent Betuitus to visit the Maritime Towns of Caria , there to entertain such Ships of War, as the free people of that Province would permit him to employ. And because Betuitus had unsuccesfully [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17026001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE47D60&area=prose&forward=textsFT) endoured to win the consents of those of Miletus , who were much more powerful at Sea, than any Town in Asia , he at length (having corrupted some of the chief men by large Presents ) was advised by those to invite his King to come personally thither, as the onely, and then the certain way to effect his desires. The Pontick Admiral found this advise so probable, that he perswaded his King to that journey, who came with a very smal retinue within twenty furlongs of the City, and from thence sent a couple of Gentlemen to acquaint the Magistrates thereof, that they might not be alarum'd thereat, and to desire admittance and audience in a businesse, which was of such importance, that he would be himself the deliverer of it. The people of Miletus though exceeding jealous of their safeties and freedom, being truly inform'd of the small train which accompanied Mithridates , esteemed it lesse hazardous to grant his desire, than to deny it; since the affront might provoke him to a War, which could not but be much more dangerous then his visit. They therefore sent some of the eminentest amongst them to complement him, to desire him that night to rest himself where he then was, which was a house of pleasure belonging to the fair Irene's Father, that the next day they might be better prepar'd to give him a reception, which should have more relisht of their respect, and of what was due to so great a King, had not the shortnesse of the time hinder'd it. There was none unsatisfied at the sending of this message but Philopomanes , who apprehended Mithridates took this as a pretence, and meant indeed to be revenged on him for his having delivered up of Ephesus to his Enemies. But these fears were soon supprest by the Senates assuring him, they would all dye before their City should be no Sanctuary to such as fled into it, as one. The same evening it was resolved, that two of the greatest unmarried beauties of Miletus , should the next day, be drest like Amazons, and hold a silk Chorde crosse the Gate, the Pontick King was to enter at, which they should not loose till he had solemnely sworn, he would attempt nothing against the liberty of the City; which when he had done, then they should admit him, and the Magistrates should be ready to wait on him. This they esteemed the civilest way of exacting such an engagement, which they could not think was more necessary, than they were concerned, how without cause of disgust they might desire and receive it. The performance of this ceremony was placed upon Monyma and Irene , who the next morning in the clothes of Amazons , and drest to perfection, went to Diana's Gate, attended by the Magistrates, and all the principal persons of the City; to which place Mithridates soon came onely followed by his own train, and many of the young Nobility of Miletus , which went to wait on him into the City. When he came to the Porte, those two beauties drew their Barricado cross it, and Monyma with an action and tone altogether charming, told him, Sir, the people of Miletus have for many ages been so justly jealous of that perfect freedom they injoy, that they never admitted any Prince within their Walls, till he had solemnely sworn, not to act any thing to the destruction or lessening of it. This Sir, which their care has made them practise to all others, custome onely invites them to make use of towards you; of which they all hope you will be cleerly convinced, by seeing what till then denies you admittance into their gates, and what sex and number they have elected to defend them with. Irene having spoken some words to the like effect; Mithridates after a little silence fixing his eyes on Monyma , and addressing his words to her, reply'd; A desire from a person of so much beauty, and so obligingly made, cannot be but obeyed; and therefore I swear by all the gardian Angels, I will not at my now entring Miletus , attempt, or designe any thing against the freedom of her inhabitants; And I swear by you Madam, speaking to Monyma , that what I binde my self from now, I will abjure for ever, for your sake. Monyma and Irene , to whom Mithridates also made some little complement, at this assurance let fall the chorde, which made Mithridates immediately alight, who having saluted them both, told the first of them, with a visible emotion; That (Madam) which you have desired from me out of custome, I must beg of you upon a stronger motive; for doubtlesse your City cannot have so much cause to apprehend losing their liberty by me, as I have to loose mine by you; And therefore as I have sworn to you to leave it in as perfect a freedom as I found it in, permit me to implore you the promise that I shall receive no worse usage from you. And if, after having seen so much beauty, I could have had any room left for wonder, I should have entertained no small proportion, to finde that a people jealous of their liberty, should yet permit a person to reside amongst them, who is so certain a Conqueror of it. Monyma was so highly disorder'd by this unexpected entertainement, that she was not a little oblig'd to the Magistrates, who by coming to salute the Pontick King, reteined her from making any reply. But after Mithridates had performed the uneasy ceremonies due to such people; he went again to Monyma and Irene , and leading of them both, he desired some to shew him the way to their houses, that he might wait upon them thither; which he performed, though they, and the Magistrates often and earnestly begd of him to decline it. This was not thought strange by those who knew him, since he was so great an admirer of beauty, that he had twice already, onely upon that account, married Ladies of lesse quality than either Monyma , or Irene ; of the first of which before he left her, he desired the permission of frequently waiting on her whilest he resided in Miletus ; And having learnt whose daughter she was, he went to Philopomanes , embraced him, and told him, for her sake he pardon'd all that was past, and promist him as large a share in his esteem, and trust, as ever. The morning of this ceremonious day, I had received a letter from Monyma , (all other wayes being rigorously forbidden her) wherein she acquainted me, she was assured I had had some new dispute with Diocles , which many apprehended would be decided by the sword, and therefore she conjur'd me, to secure her that day from those fears that belief had raised in her, and that if she had an interest in me, I should evince it, by not exposing to any hazard a life, which was as dear to her as her own. This information had some little ground, for Diocles and I had exchanged the night before at a Ladies house, some words which doubtlesse had occasiond a duell, had not our preingagement hinder'd in both any thought of that nature. But finding her concernes of a quality, that it was both a duety, and kindnesse to silence them as soon as I could, I forthwith writ her a letter to ascertain her of my obedience, and went with it that evening to Irene's , where I was confident to meet her, or at least to get the letter convey'd unto her. I had not been there long, when Monyma came in accompanied by Philopomanes , and Diocles the first being very vigilant over her, having had some noise of our renewed quarrel. I am now (continued Callimachus ,) changing his voice, Come to the relation of an accident, that befell me, and which I beleeve never had, nor never will have a parallel. The time of Telamons promised return, was that evening to expire, and therefore I then carried about me the Letter, which he left with me, that was to tell me such strange and unexpected things, in case he came not back by the time limited; this Letter by chance was about the same bignesse with that I was to deliver Monyma , and put into the same pocket; so that by a sad misfortune, whilest Diocles and Philopomanes were discoursing together at one end of the chamber, and Monyma and Irene were doing the like by the fireside, thinking I had found a favourable opportunity to deliver my Letter, I took out the wrong one, and walking carelesly to them, I stole the letter into Monyma's hand, who being intently speaking to Irene , and not minding me, finding something unexpectedly touch her hand, she skreekt out, and let it fall, which noyse made both Philopomanes and Diocles turn about, who perceived the cause of it, as well by the letter which lay on the ground, as by the disorder Monyma and I were in; but she soon coming to her self again, took up the Letter hastily, and scornfully, and sealed as it was, cast it into the fire, which immediately consumed it. This proceeding made my satisfaction, rather than my trouble, knowing she had no better an expedient left to remedy what had happend than thus to use me. And the better to contribute to this delusion, I went away abruptly and in a seeming high discontent. At which her Father and her servant were so pleased, that they both acquainted her with their being so, by passionate and sensible expressions; And the obliging Irene following and overtaking of me, made me know the true cause of Monyma's proceeding; and offer'd, if I had any thing to acquaint her with, she would perform the duty of that unhappy Letter; which I did, and having acknowledged the unmerited friendship she honoured me with, I went to my own house; joyful that even misfortune it self had more contributed to the disguising of our Loves, than our inventions could; and troubled at nothing, but at Telamons absence, which perhaps I might learn the occasion of, in reading the paper he had left me, which I then might lawfully do; the time he had limited being then effluxt. But, O Gods! what was my astonishment, when having opened it, I found it was the Letter I had writ to Monyma , and consequently 'twas Telamon's paper which she had burnt! I cannot tell you what a throng of several thoughts came into my fancy, and how many misfortunes this one made me apprehend; sometimes I feard Monyma would believe I had discover'd something in that Letter so much to my disadvatage, that my fatal mistake was but to conceal it from her; Sometimes I trembled to think, that by my oath to Telamon , being obliged to perform a journy mentioned in the burnt Letter, before I made any engagement to Monyma , by that Sad loss I was confin'd from an hymeneal union, should she condescend to one; and not temporarily, but eternally should Telamon be lost; which I was more than apprehensive he was, his last assurance to me being, that if he liv'd he would be with me by the time limited. Sometimes (so ingenious I was to torment my self) I fear'd he affection'd me so exceedingly, and disgusted so much my alliance with Monyma , for whom he knew that I had an unextinguishable passion, that not having any means able to suppresse it, he had made himself away, or banished himself, thereby to confine me (in observance of those solemn Oaths I had taken) from that union. These and many resembling considerations I suggested to my self, against my self; besides the vast trouble I was in for the losse of Telamon , as well as for the ignorance of my own condition, which his last words obscurely made me imagine, was more elevated than till then I had believed it; all which concurring, or els my body of its own constitution then inclin'd to sicknesse, cast me into so dangerous a one, that for six dayes I gave my Servants and Physitians as little hope, as I had desire of life; but the seventh day, the malignity of my feaver was mitigated,  & in as many dayes more, I was in so promising a way of recovery, that understanding one of Monyma's Pages desired to give me a Letter from his Lady with his own hand; I gave him admittance and he presented me with the Letter, whose superscription was this: To the generous CALLIMACHUS . And knowing the hand to be Monyma's , having kist it with transports, I found it conteined these words. That same duty which first necessitated me to decline your visits, and then your conversation, now makes me give my self away to the Pontick King. When it was so powerful, as to make me do that for Diocles , 'tis not strange it could make me do this for Mithridates , who transcends him as much in merit, as in quality: believe me Callimachus , I am troubled to wear a Crown, since 'tis not from you that I receive it, for whom I had such inclinations, that had the Gods render'd it no sin to follow the dictates of them, I should have preferd a private condition with you, to the greatest Empire of the World without you; And since you can no longer legitimately continue that affection you once honour'd me with, Nor I, that which your merit and my inclinations made me once pay you; permit me at lest still to continue in your memorie, and esteem, as whilest I live, you shall be the most precious thing (as far as honour will permit) in the thoughts of the unfortunate Monyma . As soon as I had done reading this fatal Letter, I look't distractedly upon all my Servants which were present, and upon him that had deliver'd it, who, I knew, was one that Monyma repos'd a peculiar confidence in, thereby endeavouring to ask that from the company by my looks, which my words could not. At first I believed the reliques of my feaver had distracted me, which when I found it had not, I wisht it had; then thinking I had read by a false light, I made them open the curtains of the bed and windows, and reperus'd those killing words, which finding the same I had found at first, I sunk down into my bed, and fix't my eyes upon the youth which had brought me the cause of these disorders, and seem'd by a silent mournful contemplating him, to reproach his having assumed so cruel an imployment: but when I observed him weeping so bitterly, that it made me give him some of that pitty his message render'd him unworthy of, I fancied there was something of mysterious in it; and in that flattering imagination I commanded all my domesticks out of my chamber, and then conjur'd the disconsolate youth to inform me, why he would assume an imployment, which could not but occasion that grief in which he so sympathized; and what could invite his Mistris to so precipitate an inconstancy; if what was in the paper he had brought was a real truth, and not to palliate some necessitated proceedings of hers, which I hop't he was sent to acquaint me with. Alas Sir, (the Page reply'd) what you have read, is but too sad a truth, and my tears are not shed upon that account which you seem to ascribe them to, but to Monyma's electing of me for so unthankful a message, and to the grief which invaded her at the writing of that Letter, and you at the reception of it: yes Sir (he continued) had you but seen how cruel a conflict she was in between her duty and affection, and in what agonies she wrote unto you, when the first had got the Victory over the last, you might perhaps imitate me, and pitty, what you detest: Thereupon he told me at large how Mithridates during my Indisposition, had made so sollicitous an address to her, that many thought his desire of a permission to employ such vessels of War, of Miletus , as would serve him for affection or pay, was rather the pretence then the cause of his Voyage; how after he had found that the infinite beauty he admir'd was guarded by a proportionate virtue, he had chang'd his purpose, and endeavour'd to appropriate, what he had endeavor'd to destroy; which he might legitimately do, the Princesse Calamis being dead six months before, having some fifteen years past presented him with the Prince Pharnaces , the Prince Atafernes , the Princesse Roxana , and the Princesse Statira , and the Princesse Cleopatra : how as soon as so unexpected an overture was made to Philopomanes , he had embraced it with a greedinesse, which shewed both his wonder, and his joy; and had so incessantly press'd his daughter to embrace so high a Fortune, that this day vanquish't by his intercessions, or rather persecutions, she has promis'd to morrow to give herself to the Pontick King, who seems to be much more satisfied at it, than any other concerned in it;  & that she had esteemed it fitter for her own Letter to inform [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17026001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE47D60&area=prose&forward=textsFT) him of it, than that any thing else should, over which she rained such showres of teares, that had I seen them, I must have concluded, that could not be her designe, which was so much her torment. I leave you to judge (continued Callimachus ) whether this accession to my former miseries had left Fortune any thing more than life to inflict upon me. But least this Page should be sent to observe my actions, as well as to acquaint me with his Mistresse's, I resolved to bear my losse in his sight, with a constancy, which should (when she knew it) invite her to believe, I was unworthy of such an usage, and that though she had given her self the Victory, yet I would denie her the triumph of it. Therefore with as much composednesse as those various agitations I was under, would permit me, I forced my self to tell him; Go and acquaint your Lady in my Name, she should not have assured me, That as she would never give her self away without Philopomanes consent, so she would be never given away by him, without her own; or having given me that engagement, she should not have sent me this letter, for they are inconsistent; tell her also the same duty which has hitherto made me obey all her commands, I know will make me to obey this last. I dismist him with these words, and endeavoured to finde in my reason, and resentment, the power of performing what I then spake. But alas, some expressions in that paper which had brought her desires of declining my passion, too much contributed to the impossibility of performing it, and continued me in disputes too painful to be related. The next morning, though my indisposition were not a little increast by the precedent dayes agitation, yet I commanded one of my servants, to bring me an account of that ceremony, which was made so much to my cost, Towards the evening he returned, and told me that Monyma had been lead to the Temple of Hymen , with all the solemnity which so short a preparation could admit of, where Mithridates waited for her, in raptures as visible as great. But as the Priest was going to perform his Office, Diocles with a naked Sword ran furiously at the Pontick King, telling him, that none could possesse Monyma , whilest he had a life and sword to hinder it. This short declaration of his gave some Pontick Lords, who inviron'd their King, time to draw their Swords; and though they could not hinder him from receiving a slight wound in the arm, which he got putting by Diocles's thrust, yet they hinder'd him from receiving any more, and took away his life who had given him that; Immediately a great many of the youth of Miletus , forced into the Temple; against whom the Magistrates commanded all the assistants to make opposition, and sent hastily for some of their Militia to suppresse, and punish this disorder. The Pontick Nobility also, who had attended their King with some of his ordinary Guards, put themselves into too resolute a posture about him and his Queen, That the friends of Diocles understanding of his death, seeing the one, and hearing of the other, and onely coming to contribute to their friends interest, in case he had succesfully perform'd his designe, began by little and little to retire, so that before any help came, there was no need of it; but least Mithridates might again be expos'd to the revenge of Diocles friends, as he had been but too much to his, those companies which came to his relief, were by the Magistrates appointed to be his Guard whilest he continued in their City. And though Philopomanes , with all the chief men of Miletus , and Monyma her self earnestly conjur'd him to suspend his Nuptials till his hurt was well, yet he was deaf unto them, protesting, he was much more concern'd in the cure of that wound, the fair Monyma had given him, than in that Diocles had, and that delay would be more dangerous to the first, than the last. This being often reiterated, as his opinion, and at length as his resolution, the Priest performed his office, and Monyma gave the Pontick King her hand, and faith; who led her from thence to the Temple of Diana , much adored at Miletus , their City standing neer mount Latmus , the residence of her Endymion , where the remaining ceremonies being perfected, she was conveyed back under a Triumphal Arch, supported by some of his Nobility, and followed by the acclamations of all the people. I did nothing (continued Callimachus ) but sigh during this relation, which being finished I askt the maker of it, whether he had observed any thing in the new Queens countenance which relish't of obedience rather than inclination, in all that performance; To which he reply'd, that either her heart and face were in perfect mis-intelligence, or never any of her sex went with more joy, to a Nuptial, than she did to this; This he told me, as he confest to me afterwards, both as it was the truth, and as beleeving my condition, would rather have been impaired, than advantag'd by a contrary assurance, since I was not to expect my cure from her kindnesse, but my resentment. I commanded him again to endeavour to bring me an account of the conclusion of the day, as he had done of the beginning; which not long after he did by telling me, he had seen Monyma in Mithridates armes. All that night I took as little rest, as the Pontick King did, for I could not but consider, that in the same time I was deploring my losse, another was enjoying it. Ah how sensibly I felt my resentments were inferior to my love; since I found my trouble in that which otherwise had presented me my cure. Whilest I lay thus strugling with my miseries, I learnt that five dayes after the Nuptials, Mithridates having obteined licence from the Senate of Miletus , to engage what Ships of War he could in their Cities or territories (at the same time granting the like favour to the Romans, and Nicomedes , and Ariobarzanes , to preserve that equality they had till then so wisely for themselves observed, believing the advantage they had given the Pontick King in first making his levies, would be repay'd by giving them voluntarily a privilege they had never sollicited for) he took a solemn leave of them, and taking his Queen with him, was accompanied by them to the utmost limits of their Country, where after many professions and embraces he had taken his final leave, hasting into Pontus to prepare for that War he was determin'd to make with Nicomedes and his Confederates. The next day after this departure, the fair Irene sent to visit me, professing she would have made one her self to have comforted me in my losse, had the Lawes of civility permitted it, and had she not apprehended I had been so highly injur'd by one of her Sex, that it might too justly raise in me an aversion to all of it. I returned this obligingness with all the respect and acknowledgement I was capable of, assuring her I could never be an Enemy to a sex, which had a person of so much merit of it, as she was, who had given me more inclinations for it, then Monyma could do the contrary. It was above six moones (generous hearers) that I lay languishing in my misfortunes, and disputing for the Victory over them; which at length having obteined, I resolved to search all the Inland Seas, for Telamon (who, I had some hope) might onely have been taken by Pirates ; At least I esteem'd it my duty, as much as 'twas my inclination, to leave nothing unattempted, which might satisfie me, I had performed that debt, I owed him; Hoping further, that the varieties of this Voyage might settle the cure I had with so many difficulties acted in prosecution of this resolve, I caused a large Galley to be bought, and having man'd her to the utmost both for the Sword and the Ore, (the immense quantity of Jewels left me by Telamon , inabling me to defray the most prodigal expences, which made me conjecture his quality was more eminent by much, than he had made the World and me believe) I prepar'd to leave for ever Miletus , the place in which I had enjoy'd, and suffer'd so many satisfactions, and misfortunes; But this resolve was a few dayes suspended from execution, by a confinement which I was extremely pleas'd with, The Nuptial, of the fair Irene , who was to be married to a Carian Lord, that in all mens opinions, and, which was more, in her own, perfectly deserved her; I omitted no gallantry in this occasion, which might evince my joy for it, and that high friendship, I so justly pay'd her. I was also a little concern'd to let her see, that as I could endure all the crosses of love, where mine was not unfruitfully received, so I could divest my self of my passion, when I found it was unworthily plac't. Having spent some dayes in this employment, and left the fair Irene , in that condition she desir'd and merited, I took of her, and her Lord a final leave, and setting to sea I followed that course, which Fortune onely had appointed for me, believing she could not be as inconstant as she is represented, if she made me as unhappy in one Element, as she had made me on the other. I will not tell you how many Coasts and Maritime-towns I visited, inquiring after Telamon , Nor the particulars of a signal Naval-fight between Nicomedes , and Betuitus , between the Hellespont , and the Thracian Bosphorus, in which I joyn'd with the former, having too much cause to be an Enemy to Mithridates , nor those civilities the King of Bithynia confer'd upon me, nor those high employments he offer'd me to tye me to his service. Those though otherwise cosiderable in themselv's, I designedly omit, that your attentions may be entertained with adventures lesse unworthy of them. One day as I was sayling between the Promontory of Assum , and the Iland of Lesbos , I perceived three Galleyes which were engaged in a furious fight; and though I made up to them with as much hast as my sailes and oars could afford me, yet before I joyn'd them, the dispute was ended by the Victory the two had obteined over the one. The succesful were so intent upon the joy of their being so, or upon the dividing the spoyl, that though I was come neer enough to perceive them transporting in their boats, from one vessel to another, many Ladyes richly cloth'd, yet they never put themselves into a posture of defence, or so much as seem'd to be concern'd at my approach, so that without any acts of hostility I came neer enough to see a Lady fall upon her knees, and with elevated hands to beg my assistance, which she seem'd to implore with so good grace, and so much to need it, that I resolv'd to afford her what ever lay in my power. But to make my quarrel just, or to render any needlesse, I desir'd the Commander of those Galleis, to restore those fair captives to their freedom, or to acquaint me whether it was justly they had lost it. But in stead of a civil reply, I was rudely commanded to be gon, lest I should be involv'd in that captivity, I so impertinently inquired into. This harsh answer took from me all hopes of acting my design; but by force, and therefore to loose no time, and to take them in that disorder which their advantage in number seem'd to render necessarie, I forthwith grappl'd with that Galley which the prisoners had been conveyed into, and leaping upon the deck I soon made them finde, that an answer not so rude had been more safe, than that force which made them presume to give it. But whilest I was disputing the Victory in one of the Enemies Galleyes, my own was boarded by the other, where though they found some considerable resistance for a time, yet in the end they were reduced to need, and call for mine; which the less disadvantagiously to afford them, I left my Lieutenant to justifie that progresse we had made, and with some Soldiers with me I return'd into my own Galley, which I found had almost lost that Name, yet our unexpected relief so animated our friends, and therefore so terrified our enemies, that from assaulting they began to retreat, and after a little time to leap confusedly into their own Galley: we knew how necessary it was to husband this confusion, so that following them we soon made our selves Masters of their Vessel, killing all that resisted, and extending mercy to those that flung down their armes and implor'd it; This small successe gave me hopes of a greater, which the sooner and hopefullier to sollicite, I left some of my men to guard the prisoners, and with the rest I flew to my Lieutenant, who was in a condition to need my assistance before I could afford it him; For a Gentleman cover'd with a rich armour, and having his Helmet shaded with a great plume of Carnation feathers, had during my absence animated his own party, and acted such prodigious things, that he had almost reduced us to a condition of onely hoping to dye hansomely; This Enemy after much dispute I singled out, and began a combate with him, which made me know the honor of the successe would at least equal the danger of acquiring it: thrice we were forced to take breath to enable us to deprive each other of that little which was left us, and the fourth time he lifted up the sight of his Helmet, and discover'd a face so ful of deformities, that it took up my amazement, till his words put a period to it, which to the best of my remembrance were to this effect. Valiant man! thou hast shewed so much courage in a cause wherein thou hast had so little invitation to manifest it, that it gives me a high desire to make thee my friend, at least to have thee no longer my Enemy; which to perswade thee to, I shall freely give thee all my this dayes acquisitions, except one beauty, for whom I have so unextinguishable a passion, that it has forced me against the respect and duty I owe, and shall but in this occasion, eternally pay her, to endeavour by force, that which by my prayers and services, I too long and too unsuccesfully attempted. I cannot think it strange, I reply'd, that believing I fought for Pilladge , thou should'st make me so low an offer: But I would have thee know, since thy rudeness and the assistance which some prisoners thou hast, have implor'd of me, has onely made me draw my Sword; nothing less than an acknowledgement of thy offence, and a restoring those captives to liberty, can invite me to sheath it. One then, or both must dy, the other furiously answer'd, which is a fate I can with less trouble embrace, than those conditions thou proposest to avoyd it. These words being finish'd, he pull'd down again the sight of his Helmet, and renued the Combate, with a rage, which I could not attribute to a less motive, than that which animated his: twice with two reverses he made me stagger,  & made me owe my life to the faithfulness of my armour; but at length I gave him so large a wound in his left side, that despairing as much of Victory as of life he hastily abandon'd the Combate, and ran to the stern Cabin, to which place I flew after, and just as he enter'd it, I past my Sword up to the hilts through his body, which he being he less concern'd in, than in not imploring a pardon from that beauty he serv'd, he fell on his knees by her, and presenting her a handful of his blood, he begg'd her that that oblation with the losse of his life, might expiate a Crime, which he was much more troubled to have committed, than to have it thus punish'd: Then breathing a deep grone and kissing her feet, he expir'd in that performance. Though you may believe all this did not a little surprize her to whom he spoke, and at whose feet he dy'd; yet I can assure you, her beauties did infinitely more surprize me. Ah Gods! with what Majesty and Empire did they disclose themselves, and how, at first sight, she divested me of a high anger, and invaded me with a higher admiration, which having oblig'd me to contemplate her a while in silence, I at last broke it to tell her: I implore your pardon, Madam, if to obey your commands, and to serve you, I have been guilty of a rudeness which has rendred me unworthy of either: but had I known your Enemy and mine, had fled unto you as his Sanctuary, he should have found you an inviolate one, since to have been in that way suspended from my revenge, had been a higher duty than to have acted it. That admirable beauty to whom these words were addrest, by an amaz'd looking upon all those Women which waited on her, seem'd to evidence her surprize and astonishment at them, and then told me; what you have acted and hazarded for me, should have prepar'd you sooner to have receiv'd my retributions, than to have made me any excuses; But those I owe you are such, that what contracts the debt, renders me uncapable to satisfie it. Madam, I reply'd, you will (I hope) permit me to believe, your not owning my fault to infinite, is but onely to acquaint me your mercy is, which has in that one performance so over rewarded the duty of the service I have pay'd you, that I must beg of you to honour me with more of your commands, to expiate my having so rudely obey'd these: what you undertook, and what you have performed she answered, are both so generous, that it leaves me no apprehension that you will imploy your Victory to any other end than to restore us to that liberty, whose loss invited you to sollicite it: and therefore you have left me nothing more to desire of you, but to convoy us to our intended Harbour, that we may not repeat as great a misfortune as that which your courage has freed us from. That, Madam, (I reply'd) which now shall be my obedience, should have been my desire, if I had not esteem'd the honour you have already done me too great to importune you for any more: but before I obey you, allow me to free the place and Galley you are in, from the blood and disorder in it, and to restore your Friends and Servants to that freedom they had so undeservedly lost. Then dragging out the dead body that was in the Cabin, and causing the blood to be wash'd away, I went to see what face things wore, since my abandoning the Combate; but I must freely acknowledge, I went away in such disorders and emotions that I found I had endanger'd my own liberty, by a sight of that beauty, to whom I had restor'd hers. Do not wonder, I beseech you, that I could so soon be apt to receive the impressions of a passion, in which I had so recently been unfortunate; since those Charmes which now began to subdue me, were such, that I had as little the power, as the will to resist them: Never had the Gods been so prodigal of their gifts to one person, as to her; Her stature and shape were such, that it was as impossible to have found in either a defect, as to have wish'd to either an addition. Her complexion was so fresh, so lively, and so admirably mix'd, that it might entirely have taken up my wonder, had not her fair eyes challenged at least an equal part as their just proportion: in brief all things were so peculiar in her, that I could not say, this individual grace, or feature was exact according to the received rules of beauty, since hers were of a quality, that impos'd new ones; which had nothing of unhappiness in them, but the impossibility of having them imitated: Neither could her exterior graces transcend that rational faith I had assum'd of the beauties of her soul, which had manifested an absolute equality in the highest extreams; for her grief at her captivity had not dejected her, nor her joy at her restauration exalted her, but she continu'd in as perfect a calm, as if her minde secure in it self nor fear'd the frownes of Fortune, nor car'd for her smiles. Whil'st I was entertaining my thoughts on the stern deck with this part of my relation, the reliques of the Enemy were kild and taken, the Galley according to my orders was disburthen'd of the dead, and all the innocent prisoners were brought together into mine, where they had waited longer, had not my Lieutenant interrupted my Ravings, and invited me to dispose of them: which when I went to do; I found that Lady amongst them, who had in so moving a posture, before the fight began, invited my assistance. I desired her to acquaint me, who that beauty was she waited on, or accompany'd: To which she told me her Name was Mithridatia , that she was daughter to a Pontick Gentleman, who was highly lov'd by his King, and who was Lord of Lestos ; which that morning she had left, to go to her Father, who had concluded a marriage for her with a Cyprian Gentleman. This Newes did not a little surprize me; but least she might observe so much, I begg'd her pardon, if my curiosity were so uncivil as to desire to know, who that was, which had taken them prisoners, and seem'd to have so violent a passion for the fair Mithridatia . She reply'd, his Name was Nepturnus, that he was Admiral of the Cilician Pyrats; That some six Moons past, being forc'd into Mitilen the chief City of Lestos , by a furious storm, he had seen Mithridatia , and had assum'd a violent, but secret passion for her; that having been near her Father (who was then by Mithridates's command, contracting with him for a Cilician Fleet) when he sent orders, for her going to Pontus , he resolv'd (as this day he acknowledg'd to her) to intercept her at Sea, and to carry her into his own Countrey, where he declar'd he intended to make himself King, and having a Crown to present her, he hop'd she would not in an Hymen aeal way refuse it: he made her many Aoplogies for his being necessitated to such a proceeding, which yet operated so little upon her, that she was determined to have owed that obligation to death, which now she is indebted for to you. This Lady having thus finish'd her information, I gave her many retributions for it, and accompanyed with her, and follow'd by those late prisoners, I went to Mithridatia , and told her; Fortune, or the Mercy of Nepturnus had spar'd so many of her friends, which I desired her to accept of from my hands, to dispose of such of her Enemies as had avoided the fury of the Sword, and to name that place to which she would have us steer our course. The first she receiv'd with satisfaction, the second she begg'd me to act in, as I thought fit, and for the last, she nam'd Nicomedia the metropolis of Bithynia , the then residence of Mithridates , and consequently of her Father, who she assur'd me would acknowledge my obligation in a way much more proportionate to it self, than she had the power to do. The name of the Pontick Kings Court did so strangely surprize me, that when she mention'd it, I could not but repeat it; but recollecting my self again, with a deep sigh I sayd, I would obey her, though the place she had nam'd had in it horrors for me, which nothing but her commands could perswade me to engage my self in. She seem'd at this declaration to be as much surpriz'd, as I had been at what constrain'd me to make it, which made her conjure me to inform her, what high cause of aversion I had for that place; and since I had, that I would but land her on any Shore which obeyed Mithridates his power, Madam, I reply'd, the knowledge of what you desire will give me so deep a sadnesse,  & afford you so little satisfaction, that if it may not displease you, I should implore your revoking that comand; which yet if you do not, I shall obey it; but I must beg your pardo, if I observe not your last orders; for since they concern my particular, I should be too unworthy your Care should I accept of it: then pausing a little & recollecting my self I thus continued. No Madam, upon more serious consideration, I am now so far from being troubled at my going to the Pontick Court, and at my detestation of it, and perhaps of Mithridates person, that I passionately wish, if it were possible that the cause thereof were capable of accession, that in that performance you might be convinc'd, I have no consideration higher than to serve the fair Mithridatia . I found her a little troubled at what I had spoken; but finding I was unalterable in my resolution of waiting on her thither, she at length assented to my doing so; and we steer'd our course towards Nicomedia , to which place we had arriv'd in two dayes, had that obliging Gale which then follow'd us, continued so long: But it was soon forc'd to give place to a raging North-East winde, against which we struggled two dayes  & one night, but then it became so uncontrollable and furious, that the Pilote forsook the Helm, and we soon after our hopes; this was about an hour before day: during all the extreamity of the storm, I had declin'd giving the fair Mithridatia any full intimation of her danger, that if the Gods had delivered us out of it, she might have been exempted in some measure from the apprehensions of it; but now that the longer concealement of our condition might have proved a greater crime, than civility, I went trembling to the stern Cabin, and having desired, and obteined the permission of coming in; having first acquainted her of the danger with a dejected countenance, I told her; The Gods are my witnesses Madam, that the loss of my Life, would be my satisfaction, if thereby the eminent hazard yours is in might cease; but we are now involved in a ruin, where neither the actings of courage, nor the sacrificing my self for your safety can any way purchase the ambition'd end; My grief at these words rudely disabled me from speaking more, which gave the fair Mithridatia an invitation thus to answer me; That death, generous Callimachus , which you are so sensible of, merits not your sorrow, which might, upon a general account, be more justly employ'd for your own loss, than for mine; the World will lose by me but a person, who has hitherto given neither much hope, nor any evincement, of becoming considerable; but by you it will be deprived of so much, both by expectation and evidence, that your private loss may truly be lamented as a publick one: But when ever the Gods do call us, we ought to resign our selves as willingly to death as we would enjoy the felicity's of life, if they do assign us those for our portion; else we follow not their will, but ours; and serve not them, but our selves. These words, so obliging to me, and religious in themselves, made me resign all my fears, to admiratio, from which I was soon recall'd, by a hideous cry in the Galley, by which I too soon, & too clearly knew the Vessel was founder'd, had struck, or sprung some greedy Leak. The Horror of the noise and danger made me forget all respect; so that taking Mithridatia in my arms from off a bed on which she lay in her clothes, I carried her on the deck; whither I was no sooner come, but the conquer'd Galley open'd in the middle, & left us to the mercy of an Enemy, which she found had none. I was unalterably determin'd to carry what I held, on shore; or dy in the attempting my highest inclination and duty. Thrice by the fury of the Sea, the fair Mithridatia was struck out of my arms, and thrice I recover'd her again; but at last my strength failed me; and though I yielded to few in the World in the art of swimming, yet in such mountains of water, so much obscurity, and being confin'd to save another I was much more concern'd for, than I was for my self, my spirits were so diminish'd that I look'd for no more, than to finde my burial, in that Enemy from whom I receive my death; happy only in this; that I should not out-live a loss, that I much more apprehended than death, and that mine should be serving, nay expiring in the armes of a person, of as high a vertue as beauty: But the Gods who often delight to cast us into dangers, the more to indear that mercy which relieves us out of them, and to make us think upon a better place, by seeing the uncertainties of this, sent a plank of the broken Galley to me, just in that moment of time, upon which with very much difficulty I got, and had by that help a little leasure to recover my breath and strength; but finding both were too great a load for it, I begg'd the fair Mithridatia , having first acquainted her therewith, not to quit her hold, whil'st I would swim by it, and endeavour to shove it to land, which then by the dawn of the morning I discover'd not a furlong from us: But that generous person conjur'd me, not out of a vain hope of saving two lives, to forsake almost a certainty of saving one. Ah Madam, I reply'd, I beseech you do not hope to invite me to save my life, by an Action which will render me unworthy of it; nor think me capable of a performance, which if you beleeve I am, you must deny me that esteeme, which next to your safety, I value above all things else; No, Madam, I am unmovably resolved to bring you out of this danger, or to share in that Fate I want power to alter. Thereupon sliding from the Planke, I began to thrust it toward the shoar, where at length, through many hazards, we arrived, the sea, and the winde which had brought us to that extremity, now contributing to the freeing of us from it. Never did there appeare any thing so like Venus's ascension out of the sea, as the faire Mithridatia's did, and had not her rude usage by that element destroy'd that Faith, she could not but have beene taken for the Goddesse of it. But alas, as soone as she had recover'd the shore, what through the difficulties she had struggled with, what through the bruises she had receiv'd from the shelves near the land, she fell into a swound, and was so carried by me, to a house near the place where her fainting had seized on her: As I was performing this duty, casting my sight towards the sea, to observe whether any reliques of our small Fleet had beene spared by the furious waves, I discover'd a little Skiffe, with but one in it, which driven by the winde, was recovering that place I then was on; I had not the leasure to see the event of this discovery, or to afford that necessitous person in it my assistance; for the faire Mithridatia's condition took up all my thoughts & care, who I soone after brought to that house I intended, where promising those in it high rewards for their service and assistance, both they and I began to pay her, and afford her all we could; but her senses were no sooner return'd, than she was invaded by a violent Feaver, which yet could not render her condition more dangerous, than therefore it did mine. At the first appearance of this fatal disease, I posted away several Expresses for the most expert Physitians at Larissa , the nearest City to us (for we had beene shipwrack'd in that Gulph, which takes its name from the Mountaine Pelius , which is not many furlongs from the bottome of it. But as I was taking order that all the helps which Art could yield the faire Mithridatia , might be prepared for her, there came one all over wet into the house we were in, who to my joy  & wonder I found was Demetrius , an Athenian servant, which Telamon had taken whil'st he resided in Greece , and who had so faithfully, and chearfully serv'd me, during my residence at Miletus , that I had intrusted him with my most secret concernments: I learn'd from him, that 'twas he I had seene in the skiff, which with his naked sword in his hand, he had secured for me, when he had observ'd the Gally foundring; but that the care he had of me had beene fruitlesse, since the same wave which had broke the vessel, carried him out of it in the skiff, which having no man in it, but himselfe, was driven even by the storme to the shore: He farther presented me the small Cabinet, in which I had my preciousest Jewels, which he had carried with him to supply our want on the Land, if the Gods ever brought us in safety thither. I was not a little pleas'd at the escape of Demetrius , (who (continu'd Callimachus ) had abandon'd the world with me, and is one of the Society of this place) and at the care he evidenc'd, in saving so plentiful a preservative against want, which otherwise I might have apprehended in a strange Countrey, having my selfe only sav'd some Diamonds of good value, which I constantly carried about me. But alas, these faint satisfactions were rudely cast out, by the too eminent danger the Physitians, at their arrival, told me their faire Patient was in. Five dayes and nights her Feaver increas'd, during all which time, at seasonable hours, I never stirr'd from her feet, paying her all my respects and services; but the sixth night her malady gave the Physitians so little hope of her life, that they advised her to prepare her selfe for the losse of it. This advertisement was no sooner receiv'd then she sent for me into her chamber (for that night by her express commands I was removed into my own, my watchings and my distempers, having flung me into an indisposition, which they had assur'd her would prove hazardous, if not timely prevented) as soon as I came in, she commanded all else out of it, which being obey'd, she told me with much grace and calmness; Callimachus , that life which you have so often and so miraculously preserv'd at Sea, the Gods are now determined to lend me no longer, and I obey their summons with a joy, which assures me of that happy place whither I am now going. If I resent any trouble at this change, I assure you it proceeds from some regret I have of owing you so much; yet hereby of being rendred uncapable of any thing, but acknowledging it, and of being necessitated to conceal my real condition from you, which is occasion'd by a hasty vow I made, and caus'd all my Women to take, when you were disputing, as we then apprehended, only whose prisoners we should be; I conjure you to satisfie your self; nothing but such a Tye could have occasion'd my silence. Ah Madam (I reply'd, interrupting her) what I see and finde of you, renders my knowledge of your extraction unnecessary, and your goodnesse needed not have apologiz'd for your continuing me in that ignorance, since your Empire over me is so absolute, that the knowledge of what is your will, is the highest reason for me to be contented with it. But oh Gods! Madam, is it possible that so much beauty and virtue, as you possess, should be showed us, to make it as much our misery, as now 'tis our wonder; for the knowledge of it cannot more act to the performance of the Later, than this hasty deprivation of it will to the perfecting of the former. That little beauty and virtue, she answered, which I have, is but lent me by those, who have the power and the right to recal it, and who have been so merciful as to give me, till I received your obligations, no confinements to that life, they resolv'd to take so early from me, and who I believe have given me those, but the better to illustrate and set out my obedience, which could not have appear'd so clear, had it not had some difficulties to have contested with. These words she spoke in so low accents, that I feard they were her last, and that fear I found was not groundless; when immediatly stretching forth her hand towards me, her eyes soon lost their conquering light, and the small remainder of that Vermilion which was left in her Cheeks, fled hastily away, and resign'd the entire Empire to that colour, which by the Lawes of Nature and beauty, was but to have enjoy'd a share; and by a few sighes seem'd to celebrate the separation of a soul and body, which had once bin so excellently Match'd. PARTHENISSA. THE THIRD BOOK. such as waited in the next room, into Mithridatia's ; where all their Art and care proving unsuccessful, they forced me into my own chamber, for nothing else could have made me abandon a person, who though dead, I valu'd more than all things which were alive. I cannot tell you the horrors I was in; which though infinite, yet they could not transcend my joyes, when Demetrius came to my bed-side and told me, the fair Mithridatia which had layen six houres without motion, was, when the Phisitians had given her over, come again to life, and was fallen into a sweat, which they assur'd me was the Crisis of the disease. I could not credit this by the report of my ears, unless my eyes confirm'd it, which they soon did, and thereby gave me more felicity in that one service, than in all they had ever done me before. In brief the Physitians last thought was the truest, and in three dayes their fair patient was in so probable a way of recovery, that my fears had quite resign'd their places to my hopes. But she was no sooner out of danger, than I fell into no smal one, by a feaver, at least as violent as hers had been, partly through over-watching, partly through the disorders of the ship-wrack, partly through the grief which invaded me at the suppos'd death of the fair Mithridatia : But those Gods which had preserved her, extended the like mercy to me; but yet I fell into three relapses, which were much more dangerous than my first sicknesse; the last of those was so long and hazardous, that it rendred my recovery almost a miracle. This desperate condition I was in, being told the fair Mithridatia , she forced both her modesty and her weakness to give me a visit, which she might perform without exposing her self to the open air, my chamber being next to hers. As soon as I saw her come in, I told her; I know not, Madam, whether I have cause to rejoice, or be troubled at the honour I now receive; for if I consider my self, I have infinite reason for the first, but if I consider you, I have as much reason for the last: but I hope you come to oblige me with some of your commands; which will certainly present me my cure; for I cannot believe the Gods can esteem the punishment of my sins so necessary, as my obedience to you. This, she reply'd, which you now have spoken to acquaint me with that belief, might well hinder it any longer from being yours; The Gods cannot be what we must believe them, if we believe them to be Gods, and not to be offended at your esteeming civility, a greater debt from you to me, than is the acting of justice, from them upon you; do not I conjure you, Callimachus , by such discourses, give me more cause to fear your loss, than your sickness can; and be confident your declining to evidence your acknowledgements this way, will more pleasantly satisfie me of them, than any thing you can say in it. Madam, I answer'd, there is nothing could so entirely convince me of my being in a fault, as your declaring that I am; and nothing I hope can so much convince you, I will no more be guilty of it, as your having commanded it me: But Madam, will you permit me to believe, the Gods will restore me my health, now they and I finde you are concern'd in it? I do not onely, she reply'd, permit you to believe I am concern'd in it, but desire you to make it a part of your faith, as I assure you it shall be of my prayers, that what you have spoken in your sicknesse, may not provoke them to continue it. And to retrench you from the occasion, as well as to hinder those emotions, which I apprehend your civilities to me, and their necessitating me to such answers, may cast you into, I will retire into my own chamber, which immediatly she did, but with looks which told me my reprehensions were upon a score, which made them an Obligation. That night I took so much rest, that the next day I was capable of entertaining my self, in the just causes I had to admire the virtues and beauties of Mithridatia , which was my most constant imployment all the time I kept my chamber; and all the time I had the high priviledge to wait on her, in hers, I had new and fresh occasions to continue it. I cannot tell you what resolute opposition I made before I yielded, which when I had, I was in a far higher perplexity that I had made so much resistance, than formerly I had been, that I was able to make no more. My precedent usage from one of the fairest of her Sex, which thitherto I had considered as an invitation to hate all of it, I now look'd upon as an effect of my Fate, which had denyed me the less felicity, but to make me pursue the greater; and I could no longer quarrel at that inconstancy, which had already more oblig'd than it could injure me, since 'twas a Nobler happiness to solicite Mithridatia's esteem, than to possess Monyma's . These and a croud of such like suggestions, made me know I was a Lover, and not the repeating of any symptomes had appear'd in me in my first passion, which were as short of such as I then resented, as those were of my condition before I had resented any. Never perhaps did any beauties captivate at once with more Majesty and more sweetnesse, then the fair Mithridatia's did, which inspir'd me with a flame, so far transcending my first, that had I known whilest I serv'd Monyma , that I could have lov'd as much as I did, and had lov'd her no more then I then did, and that she had known the like, I must have both condemn'd my self, and have excused her: my former fire appear'd but a heat compar'd to this, and rather seem'd to have prepar'd my heart for this conquest, than to have acted one over it. I was not ignorant how difficult a design I engaged in; How unapt so severe a virtue as hers, would be to admit of an address; How improbable it was to invite so infinite a beauty, to believe any services could give any man a title to it; How unhappy I was in not knowing from whom I deriv'd my extraction, and in not having a Place or Friend to whom I might retire, and enjoy my happinesse, should her mercy confer it on me: and lastly, what just cause I had to believe (by what she had told me) that her blood proportion'd the greatness of her beauty and merit, and might render the first of those three as high an obstacle as the two last. This later consideration made me a thousand times resolve to acquaint her with my passion, before so powerful an obstruction was openly known unto me; But then those resolves soon vanish'd, when I throughly considered such a proceeding might appear to her, as a making use of her being in my power, which was a meannesse could hardly have been more punish'd, than by performing it. I was also loth by so precipitate a proceeding (if she told me what she did to hinder my manifesting to her, what she might have discover'd or fear'd in me) to have given her cause to believe, that any consideration of her quality could suppress the payment of a duty, which two higher considerations could not; besides, I esteemed it as uncivil, as unwise, to inform her of my adoration, till a succession of services had given me some title to it; and then also I concluded it more proportionate to her beauties and the passion I payd them, to let her discover it, than I; and indeed I was much more apprehensive she would do so to some, than not at all, I beg your pardons (continued Callimachus ) If I have too particularly retaild this part of my Story which I will endeavour to repair, by contracting some other. At length the Gods restor'd us both to our precedent Healths, which made me employ some men al along the Coast, to discover if our misfortune had been as favourable to any of our company, as to us, as also to hire a Galley of good force to continue that journey, which the late storm had so fatally interrupted; They perform'd the last part of their imployment; but as to the first, they could not hear of any that had escap'd alive the fury of the Seas, but a couple of ordinary men who had reship'd themselves again for Asia , and that divers dead bodies of Men and Women, and Ribs of several Vessels wrack'd had been cast upon the shore of Thessaly ; with this sad intelligence, by which we had just reason to apprehend our friends  & servants were lost, we prepar'd our selves for Nicomedia , to which place the fair Mithridatia was very scrupulous to go, because I had manifested some sensible aversion to the Pontick Court. Her civility had been so great, that ever since I had discovered an unwillingness to disclose the cause thereof, she had not desir'd to know it; but the fresh wounds shee had given me, had so entirely cur'd those I had received from Monyma's inconstancy which was the onely occasion I had to detest the Pontick King, and Court, that I thought the breaking of my silence was a duty I ow'd the civilitie of hers, and was indeed so far from being longer necessary, that I esteemed it would be disavantageous to me, since she might attribute my then speaking to those two causes which invited me to it. The day therfore before we wet to Sea, having spoken to her something which seem'd to relish of that which she had prohibited (though really 't was not meant so by me) to expiate that offence, I offer'd to tell her what it was, which had occasion'd my hating Mithridates Court; at this overture she assumed so unusual a satisfaction, that I found the knowledge of it was no indifferent thing unto her. This made me hasten to give her that account which I did in the same manner I have presented it to you. After I had finish'd my Story, she continued in silence for some time; but then she broke hers, to tell me: I am perswaded Callimachus , you will not think it so strange, being born a subject to Mithridates , if I do take his part; as being so, if I should do otherwise; 'tis therefore I must tell you, though your loss was great, yet the Pontick Kings injustice to you was not; for by your own relation, I finde he knew nothing of your addresses, nor of her engagement to you; And therefore if he injur'd any, 'twas Diocles , who openly, and by her Parents assent solicited her affection. Neither indeed was the criminal so much to you, as to Philopomanes , for she sinn'd more against him in loving you against his commands, than she did afterward against you in marrying Mithridates in obedience to them; The Paternal right preceding the right of Love, the first having existence from our birth, the latter onely from the time we are capable of those impressions which cannot also be legitimately received, till the former obligation be justly cancell'd. Madam, I reply'd, though you have said much more for her, than ever she has said for her self, yet I beg your pardon; if I assure you the Event of things, has more apologiz'd for her, than any thing I have heard said by her; for though some Priests have given the right to the Paternal power, before that of Love, yet the Gods those very Priests do adore, have given it by their actings to that Noble Passion, which seems to be the God of the gods, those being necessitated to submit to that. No, Madam, the charms of a Crown were greater with Monyma , than those of Love and Constancy; She could disobey her Father in Diocles's case, but she would not in Mithridates's : had her actings Madam proceeded from that filial duty you attribute so high a power unto, it would have manifested it self in the first, as well as in the last, the obedience consisting in observing what Philopomanes enjoin'd, and not relating to the disproportion between the persons for whom the injunctions were made; so that in one of her performances, she err'd, for either she should not have promisd me her affection, when he had commanded her to confer it on Diocles , or she should have continu'd it to me, after he had enjoin'd her to bestow it on Mithridates , I think, replyed the fair Mithridatia smiling, that you cannot justly believe, that having committed one offence, 'tis better to commit another, than to repair that, which, as I understand it, is the true state of your case. However, by her Letter I find she cannot think obeying her Father is more her duty, than she fears it will prove her punishment; which makes me for my Kings sake, as unwilling you should visit his Court, as you were formerly to do it for your own; since your presence may afford Monyma a disturbance which may invite Mithridates to sympathize in it. No Madam, I reply'd, the wrong has cured the wrong, which if it had not I have since met with what secures me from ever thinking on her again. These words fell from me unawares; but I had no sooner spoken them than I blush'd, and perceived Mithridatia did so too: so that had not Demetrius accidentally come in to acquaint me that the Captain of our Galley was come to speak with me, I had bin engaged in a difficulty I should not have so easily freed my self from, as I entered into it. But joyfully laying hold of that opportunity, I went out of her chamber, into my own, where having told the Captain we would set to Sea next morning, I dismist him to prepare himself accordingly. The house, in which we were, belonged to a Gentleman of Thessaly , who in his youth had so prodigally consum'd his estate, that in his age he was necessitated to that retirement: His Wife was dead, and had left him two daughters, the eldest of which (whose name was Nerea ) all the while of Mithridatia's sickness, and during her recovery, manifested so high a concern for her, and had with such care and diligence served her, that she enjoined me to move her Father, to permit her to go with her into Bithynia , which I did, and after many importunities obteined his consent; in requitall whereof, and for the use of his house and civilities during our continuation in it, I presented, and forced him to take, such a quantity of Jewels, as freed him from fear of want, and of being unable to provide for Nerea's sister. The next day we went aboard our Galley, and in three daies, without meeting any adventure worth your knowledge, unlesse the being assaulted by a Ship of War which we took, we safely arrived in the Port of Nicomedia , the residence of Mithridates , because Murena then threatned the invasion of Bithynia , of which that Citie was the chiefest: The Palace standing on the Sea-side, we landed there, and passing through one of the Gardens to go to the Prince Atafernes's Appartment, we observed all those we saw were in deep mourning; the fair Mithridatia desired me to ask the cause thereof; which I did of a Gentleman that was passing by, who told me 'twas for the death of the Princess Statira , the favorite daughter to the King; I acquainted her with it, at which she was in no small disorder; but hers was not comparable to mine, when immediately after, there came a throng of Gentlemen into the walk in which we were, amongst whom was one, to whom all the rest paid so high a respect, that I concluded it was one of the Kings Sons, and so it was: which so soon as Mithridatia was satisfied of, she lifted up her vail, and gave the Prince and all that waited on him the liberty of seeing her face, at which they all were amazed, and in a disorderly silence, seemed to evidence their surprize. At first I thought it was an effect of her beauty, which I knew was capable of as signal a production; but I was soon taken out of that belief, by the Prince Atafernes's crying out; Oh Gods! is it not Statira that I see? yes brother (replyed Mithridatia ) 'tis Statira that you see, who has been preserved by such strange means, that when you are acquainted with them, 'twill certainly make your gratitude as great to this Gentleman (looking upon me) as your wonder is at my return. These words were scarce spoken, when Atafernes flew into his sisters arms, and by a thousand imbraces celebrated his joy: But those being finished, he came to me, and in many obliging terms assured me, I had served a person, who could not have a higher sense for my having done so, than himself and all the rest of his family would eternally have; to these and many such assurances, I made him acknowledgments, as proportionable to his quality and civilities, as I was capable; and because Mithridates was that morning at his devotion with his Queen, and the Princess Roxana (sister to Statira) Atafernes , leading us into a less practis'd walk, conjur'd her to tell him by what miracle I had avoided that furious storm, for as for her deliverance from Nepturnus , he had learnt it from a couple of her servants who had escap'd out of one of the Galleyes upon the Coast of Greece , who a few daies before were safely arriv'd at Nicomedia , with the fatal news of her loss, which had put the King  & al the Court into that mourning, they would now cast off with a joy equal to that grief with which they had put it on. The Princesse to obey that brother, for whom she had the highest affection, gave him an account of his desires, and I believe in very advantageous tearms for me, since he came to me afresh with many embraces and vowes of perpetual friendship: This I say, because though I was present, yet the grief which invaded me, by finding to all my other difficulties, that additional one of Mithridatia's quality, deny'd me the power of listening to what she had related. But our retired entertainment was soon broken; for some of the Courtiers, knowing what infinite satisfaction the unexpected newes of the Princess's Arrival would be to Mithridates , went to him, and interrupting his devotions, acquainted him therewith, who suddenly after came to the place where we all were, and even in tears manifested his joy. The Prince Atafernes , and his fair sister, having given some time to those tender evincements of his affection, inform'd him that it was to me he owed, first her Liberty, then her Life, and at last her safe Return: I cannot tell you those various and passionate expressions the Pontick King gave me for what I had done, nor those many protestations of what he would do for me if ever he could finde an occasion, wherein his power should proportion his desire of gratitude. Mithridates then leading the Princess in one hand, and me in another, walked back towards the Palace, at the Gate whereof, the Queen and the Princesse Roxana met him; the first of which knowing the great affection her husband had for Statira , and being satisfied by the universal voice of the court, that never any person could have a better title to it, in transports of satisfaction embraced  & kissed her, and then hastily demanded, where that Gentleman was, to whom they all owed their present felicity. This is he, Madam, (reply'd Mithridates , taking me by the hand leading me to her) But as soon as she saw who I was; she stept two or three paces back, and looking upon me fixtly a while, she hastily begg'd the Kings pardon, if a sudden indisposition forced her to retire; and forthwith did so; it was happy for her and me, that Mithridates and the rest of the company were so throughly ingaged in looking upon and entertaining Statira , that she only observ'd the disorders of Monyma , which I was not displeas'd to finde she did, that she might believe in the future I could not but be prepossest with a higher passion by my having declin'd that which I once had for the Queen, when even she had not totally divested her self of that frienship she had once honoured me with, which her emotions at this meeting gave a pregnant evincement of. The two Princesses having by many manifestations of friendship demonstrated the greatnesse of theirs, they begg'd the Kings permission to follow Monyma , which they did, but found her in a condition which caused at once their pitty and wonder; she was the more willing that Mithridatia and Roxana might see her in that posture, that it might apologize the more effectually both to them and the King for her abrupt departure, and make all three believe what she was not a litle concern'd they should; for she did not so much as suspect, I had disclos'd any thing of my addresses to her, which the Pontick King was entirely ignorant of; for they had been actually private, and seemingly suppress'd, from the time Diocles had obtein'd Philopomanes favour; and from the time Mithridates had solicited hers, none was so unadvised as to have acquainted him with my Story; besides during his residence in Miletus , I had never stird out of my chamber. Whilest the two Princesses were paying their Care to the Queen in which Statira was most succesful (as best knowing her disease) The King was concernedly inquiring of me, who I was, and whether my affairs would permit me to reside with him, from whom he protested to me when I expected all in his power, I did not believe more than he intended: after I had with much humility acknowledged the obligingness of such expressions, I told him; my ignorance who I was, and the duty I owed a person who had given me my education, and perhaps was my Father, whom I had lost at Sea, had invited me to search all the West Coasts of Asia , and the East of Greece , to finde him out, which having unsuccesfully perform'd, I was now only hopefull the Land would restore him to me; and therefore I should with satisfaction embrace the offer he was pleased to make me for some time; which offer you may easily conceive (cosidering how inviolate a confinement I now had in his Court, and how impossible it was for me to have any plausible pretence for a longer continuance in it) was a thing I was more satisfied at, than he could be at my acceptance of it. Mithridates much pleas'd with my reply, told me, that he had but one desire more to make me, which was, that I would accept of Nepturnus's forfieture which was a very large pension he had setled on him during his life, upon his faithful engagement of bringing him a fleet of Cilicians able to dispute the Empire of the Sea. But this I absolutely declin'd, assuring him, that the greatest obligation he could do me, was to command me things wherein I might serve him, not my self. This refusal at once troubled him and made him admire; but at length I so well satisfied him in what I had done, that he prest me no more: for I protested to him, the offer should tye me to his service more than if I had accepted it, and that I had a private reason for my disobedience; which if I could acquaint him with, would invite him to excuse me for it. This I did, because I hoped 'twas the civilest way of letting the fair Mithridatia know, I aim'd at higher rewards than any of such a Nature; that I had Nobler confinements than profit to keep me in her Fathers Court, and that I was not of an inconsiderable condition, when I refus'd such high offers. The day after my arrival at Nicomedia , the Princess Statira sent to me to wait on her, in one of the palace gardens, where she told me two things had invited her to do it; the one to desire me to excuse the concealment of her quality, the other to give me her acknowledgements for my having promis'd, the King to make my Court his residence, since thereby she hoped to let me see by the confidence she would repose in me, that nothing but her vowes had occasion'd that incivility, and yet the name her governesse had told me was hers, was really so; since she was called Mithridatia as well as Statira , and her sister was known by the name of Roxana as well as Nissa . Madam (I reply'd) this acknowledgement is as far below you, as the excuse is above me; you had reason to make a vow of concealing your name and quality, whilest you knew not but in my success you might only have chang'd one of your enemies for another: and having made it, you had no reason to violate it. Neither, Madam, was there any necessity of disclosing who you were, your virtue & your beauty were too high for any extraction but that from whence you derive yours. But Madam, will you permit me the confidence of desiring to know whether all that your governess said was as true; for [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17026001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE47D60&area=prose&forward=textsFT) the informed me, you were sent for from Lesbos , to be married to a Cyprian Gentleman. That also (said Statira ) is true: That Cyprian Gentleman is the King of Cyprus , who having seen my picture, took such a fancy to me (for I can call it no better since it had no solider a foundation) that by a solemn Embassy he desired Mithridates's permission of making his addresses to me, which he has assented unto, his difference with the Romans rendring so powerful an alliance necessary to his affaires, especially that Iland being abundantly provided with Shipping, of which my Father was wholly disfurnish'd, by his peace with Scylla . 'Twas therefore I was sent for from Lesbos , where these three years I have resided in an impregnable Castle, because Mithridates was told by the oracle at Delphos that I should run a great hazard of marrying his open and mortallest Enemy. You cannot (generous Princes) but believe that this information operated powerfully upon me; yet not so much as to render me uncapable (after some introductory discourses,) humbly of asking her, whether she could think a passion, which had for foundation that only which a thousand casualties might impair, and which time must, was worthy of her; and whether she could prepare her self to receive a person for her Husband, which she had never seen; and pretended to her onely upon an invitation so disproportionate to her. If the Gods (she reply'd) had made me as much at my own dispose, as they have at Mithridates's , I might have liv'd perhaps free from al addresses, at lest not have received any, where beauty was the only motive of the: but since I am at anothers command, I can prepare my self for obedience, and afterwards esteem him to whom thereby I am subjected; and this I can act with less dissatisfaction than I can decline it, because the duty of the performance will lessen, if not take away the trouble of it; and the omission would invade me with a grief above the cure of any thing it could present me; And this, Callimachus , I believe I told you in anothers case as well as mine. It is true, Madam, you did so, and certainly since, though you declar'd 'twas your belief, you could not thereby make it mine; I must conclude the reasons are very clear and pregnant, which force me to the crime of my imbracing your judgement: And indeed, Madam, if you throughly consider it, by your Rule possibly you may finde you make a Father a Tyrant as well as a Father; or if he become not one, his childe owes it to his mercy not his justice. I think the utmost of the paternal right, is to hinder any which own it from marrying against that consent: a negative obedience is the farthest it can unoppressively extend it self; shall there be no distinction between what power a man has over his beast, and what he has over his child? and shall reason be esteem'd unfitter to rule, than Nature; which Madam according to what you argue (yet I hope do not believe) may follow? For if the paternal right is only founded upon that Title; he that does possess it, may have much less reason, than the person over whom he does exercise it, and then the certainst rule shall be laid aside for one that is not so: besides, Madam, your principle alwayes followed may make obedience due to an Idiot; there being as much difference between the most refin'd reason, and that which is but a degree above folly, as there is between that and Idiotisme it self: Neither, Madam, observing your Law are we freed from obeying a Parents passion, as well as obeying him; for if his aversion to his child, his revenge to her Lover, his ambition, his interest, or any other passion, be more predominant in him than Nature or reason, even those very passions must be obeyed as the Father; so that if the childes reason be not judge, when the Fathers just power, not his imperfections, act him; you must give his weaknesses as high a right to rule, as you say the Gods have given him. Such, reply'd the Princess, is the discrepant constitution of Man, that even the Gods cannot prescribe a Law, which in all things shall be equal; and who ever will not observe a Rule, because it has inconveniences in it, will at length finde he must walk by none at all. If a child were to be judge, whether the Parent or himself had the highest reason, or when his Father was acted by the principles of a just paternal power, or by his passion, 'tis as, if not more like, he might erre, as his Parent; and what was not consonant to his desires, he might say, proceeded from his Fathers having a less degree of reason than himself, or was occasion'd by his Passion; so that if the inconveniences of allowing the disobeying power to the child, and the undisputed power to the Parent, be equally great in themselves; and that the not having any Rule establish'd between both, is more prejudicial; certainly the giving of the precedency to the Father is but just, since it is most likely that a person who has many years experience more than another, should have a greater quantity of it; and doubtless there is some difference during ones life, due to the Author of it. But, she continu'd, I will desire no more than what you have already confess'd, to invite you to acknowledge the truth of what I have spoken: for that negative obedience of not marying a person, which a Parent has prohibited, and which you say is a duty owed by a Son to a Father, is as much as that I have argued for; since the misery of Marrying a person one does not love cannot be greater than the misery of being deny'd marrying one which one does love. Ah Madam, I hastily reply'd, because I saw the Prince Atafernes coming towards us; A Lover is not perfectly miserable so long as he has hope, and that he may injoy whilest another does not possess his Mistress: there is too some satisfaction, that if he be unhappy, his rival is so too; besides the difference is great between a Passive and an Active misery. 'Tis true, said the fair Statira , in some cases, but in this 'tis impossible to separate them; for he that is involved in the former, must consequently be the like in the latter. By this time we were so near the Prince, that I could make no reply, which I was not a little troubled at; her last words having given me a rise to have made one, which had been apt enough for what I drove at. Atafernes , as soon as he came neer us, told me, he came to make me an invitation to a Tilting, which the King had appointed to celebrate Mithridatia's return with, and Monyma's recovery; That his brother the Prince Pharnaces was Challenger, and he defendant; that Archilaus (who had commanded so many vast Armies under Mithridates , but now was suspected by him for that ignoble conclusion he had necessitated him to make with Scylla) Neptolemus, Dorilaus , and several others, were join'd with him: that Gordius and Craterus were of his own party, and if I would make one of that Number, he should not doubt of success: and that Statira was to give a Bracelet of Diamonds to whomsoever obteined it. I look'd upon the Princess, so soon as Atafernes had done speaking, as desiring to receive my Orders from her, that she might see where their obedience came in the Ballance, it outweigh'd even the respect I owed to Mithridates's Successor, which Pharnaces some few dayes before was declared to be. Mithridatia soon perceiv'd my meaning,  & as suddenly (lest what was a civility to her, might otherwise appear the contrary to her brother) desired me to add my assistance to a side, which she wish'd might be the conquering, and which then she would be assur'd would be so. I gave her my humble retributions for acquainting me which that was, that I might thereby be ascertaind of success in my party what ever I met with in my particular; only I begg'd that I might be exempted from running against the Prince Pharnaces , for he was brother to two persons I had so high a respect for, that it could not but extend it self to every one which related to them. This they both thanked me for, and then Statira retir'd to give us time to prepare for ensuing solemnity, which since it was in Mithridatia's sight,  & for a favour from her, I resolved to appear in it, in all the magnificence I could, & therefore gave order to Demetrius to cover my arms with the fairest Jewels were left me by Arsamnors care, and preserved by his; and that the rest of my equipage might be proportionate. But as soon as Pharnaces was inform'd by Atafernes of my desire of knowing the Arms he would wear, lest my ignorance might make me act a crime, which knowingly I would never be guilty of; he absolutely refus'd making use of my respect, saying it might be the Victory would come in competition between him and me, and that then he would not have my civility suspend him from it, nor decline to decide that, which he was confident his courage would advantageously forgive him; that therefore he was resolved none of his party should be known to the other. This Atafernes inform'd me of, lest otherwise hearing the denyal of my offer, and not the cause of it, I might have been unwilling to assist at the Tilting, or else since the words were spoken so publikely and therefore could not but come to my knowledge, he esteemed it more friendly to give me that information, than that any other should. But as soon as I received it, I determined to do my utmost to make him think my civility sprung not from that consideration to which he ascribed it. The day being come, and all the preparatory solemnities performed; The King, the Queen, the two Princesses, with the young Cleopatra their sister (who then gave admirable promises of beauty which she afterwards fully perform'd) with a throng of other persons of eminent quality, ascended those proud Scaffolds which were provided for them; and then the trumpets invited both parties to give the beholders the sport they were come to see. All the young Nobility began the justs, and by various misfortunes had cause to wish they had been upon the Scaffolds, rather than in the lists: at length Dorilaus had unhors'd so many of ours, that with some insolence he cry'd out, if we had no better Disputers of the Victory, 'twould be best to yield it. These words inflam'd Atafernes , who presented himself for his next Enemy, with so much agility, grace and strength together, that all the assistants by a loud shout seem'd to tell one another the advantageous thoughts they had of him, which he abundantly made good: for the first encounter they made, both their Launces shiver into the Aire: the second was but an exact repetition of the first; but the third, having taken the strongest Launces they could get, and being inraged that neither of them had worsted the other, they ran with such fury, that when they met, the Prince Atafernes carried Dorilaus clear off his Horse with his saddle between his leggs; but then his own Horse stunn'd with the fury of the shock was forced to touch the ground with his Cropper, and being incessantly spur'd to make him rise,  & perform his course, strugling to obey his Rider, unfortunatly he fell over upon him; and, though he did him no great hurt, yet, by that mischance he was disabled, as much from continuing the sport, as by his valour he had disinabled Dorilaus : which so soon as Atafernes perceived, he beckned me to come near him, and told me in my Ear, he left the hopes of his parties success to my management; and then was carryed off, arm'd as he was, and Dorilaus the like. The next which ran, were Neoptolemus and Craterus , but the third course (for the two first were equal) the first got the best of it. Then there remained of all our party but Gordius , who was Lieutenant General to Archilaus , and his creature; he desired me to permit him to break a Launce then, lest my skill might deny him that favour. This civility I could not refuse, though I was impatient enough, to have reveng'd Atafernes's fall, and to have been acting for a reward, which was to be received from the fair Statira's hands. But I was not long suspended from my desires, for Gordius was unhappily dismounted by Neptolemus , and left me only to make good our parties title to success, which I was as concern'd for, as hopeful of; the fair Mithridatia having not only exprest her inclinations for our Victory, but seem'd to have some confidence of it from me; Elevated with these thoughts, as well as with the honour of having our sides entire hopes left to my Arm, and somewhat troubled with those unhappinesses which had brought it to that pass, I began my course against Neptolemus , in which I was so successful, that being but a little shook in my Saddle, I carried him clear off his Horse, and made him measure his length in the dust. This action was solemnized with the acclamations of the people, whereunto to put a period, Archilaus soon appeared at my opposite end of the Careere, [I tell you now their Names (continued Callimachus ) in the order they fought, though I knew not any of them till after the Combate] who furious at his brothers disaster, came to revenge it, but at the second course he was forced to bear him company, and resigne his place to Pharnaces , who was esteemed one of the best Tilters in Asia , and therefore was not troubled at his parties want of success, since he was confident 'twould but the better set off his. We were by the Lawes of that day, to have but three courses, the first of which was perform'd so equally & furiously by both, that the people by a general clapping of their hands did applaud it; but having cast away the Truncheons of our broken Launces, we took stronger ones, and with them so rudely met one another, that both our Horses were forced to recoil four or five steps, and 'twas with many spurrings, that we made them perform their course. This too was celebrated by the people in as great a measure, nay it even invited the fair Mithridatia , the Princess Roxana , the Queen and the King to rise from their seats as some demonstration how much it had pleased them. But the third Course decided the Victory on my side; For I carryed Pharnaces clear off his Horse; but yet it cost me the losse of both my Stirrops,  & so rough a shaking in my Sadle, that I had near fallen out of it. When I had perfected my course, I turn'd about, and saw the Prince yet ly on the ground with his Helmet off, for by the rudeness of his fall, the Laces of it were broken; As soon as I perceiv'd who it was, I ran to him, and lighting from my Horse, with the sight of my Helmet up, I told him, Sir, I humbly begg your pardon for the crime my ignorance has made me commit; had you been pleased to have accepted of that motion, my respect and duty made you, you had exempted your self from this trouble, and me from a greater, by having occasion'd it: but I hope, Sir, you will remember 'tis a meer effect of my obedience to your commands which has made me so highly offend, and therefore you will be therein convinc'd, since I observe them against yourself, I shall not decline them against any other. I had much rather (said Pharnaces ) owe the loss of success to your better Fortune, than have deny'd trying it in that way you proposed; No Callimachus , civilities in Arms are never seasonable till after Victory, so that I cannot be more pleased with yours now, than I was offended at them before. That Sir I reply'd, which you are pleas'd to tearm my better Fortune, and which I should have called it against any other of your party, I shall tearm my unhappinesse against you, as I shall what I humbly motion'd by the Prince Atafernes , since I observe how contrary to my expectation 'tis resented: And to manifest the trueth of what I said I shall humbly beg you to make my Apology to the Princess Statira for not imploring a prize from her hands, which to receive from the Title I must own if I have it, would as much trouble me, as to go without it. No, said Pharnaces , I enjoin you to go and receive what is your due, since to deny it upon such a score were to violate the Lawes of this dayes recreation. Thereupon he commanded some Gentlemen to carry him to his Appartment, whither I would have waited on him, but he would in no wayes consent unto it. As soon as he was carryed out of the Lists to the extremity whereof I attended him, I went to the Scaffold on which the fair Statira was, and told her, Madam, that success which all here as well as my self may be convinced I owe entirely to Fortune, since I obtained it against the Prince Pharnaces , is so much my grief, and so little my due, that he himself will bear me witnesse I was asham'd of, and troubled at it; and would not have implored the prise from such fair and just hands as yours are, had not his commands of doing it given me that confidence, and confer'd on me a Title, I only depend upon Mithridates , satisfied with what I had done before the Justs, and more so with what I then did, came to me, and in embraces told me, that both my courage and civility gave me so high a right to the prize, that he knew his daughter upon either of those scores, much less upon both would not deny it me. This favourable sentence on my behalf, made the Princess present me the Bracelet, which I kneeld down to receive, and in the same posture told her; I have (Madam) by the great Mithridates decree, and by the Prince Pharnaces goodness so many Titles to this gift, that I cannot tell from which particular one I derive it; and to attribute a part to every one, were to injure all in not sufficiently obliging any: will you therefore (Madam) permit me to owe it entirely to your favour, that will hinder me from disobliging many other pretences, and oblige me more than all of them. This I presumed the less timorously to speak, because I observed the King, and divers others were then receiving an account of the two Princes's healths, from a Gentleman they had imploy'd to enquire after them. But she blushing at what I had said, told me, my success had given me a better Right than her favour. I had much ado to avoid telling her; but not, so desired a one. Presently after this great assembly broke up, and Mithridates, Monyma , and the two Princesses went to visit Pharnaces ; but finding him more troubled than hurt, soon after they visited Atafernes , from whence all but Statira (who stayed with her brother, as I did to wait on them both) went to take the Air to refresh themselves, after the heat of that dayes ceremony. As soon as they were gon out of the chamber, I told the Prince; Sir, I am come to give you an account of those commands you honour'd me with, when you left the lists, and to present you with what onely, by the power they gave me, I have acquired: If the Princess Mithridatia had been pleased to have given it me upon the account of her favour, which I once presum'd to implore, I would much rather have parted with my life than with it: but since she declined giving me that title to this prize, and gave it to my success, I could not, Sir, but bring it unto you, from whom I must alwayes acknowledge I entirely derived it. Atafernes , refusing my proffer and embracing me, reply'd, Statira could not have been more obliging, in giving you that Bracelet as a testimony of her favour, than she was just, in conferring it upon the score of your Victory, to which I have so little contributed, that my refusal of the prize, is infinitely short of what I owe you for obteyning it; and having no other way to evince my gratitude for your having done so, I do earnestly conjure my sister, to give you the prize upon the account upon which you once desired it. Atafernes having done speaking, we both look'd intently upon the Princess, whose face was immediatly cover'd with Blushes: which when her brother observ'd, he told her; you have often assur'd me, Mithridatia , that you gave me a higher share of your affection, than you gave any one else; I begg you manifest it in granting me this desire, 'tis not injurious to that strict vertue you profess to the World, and 'twill be consonant to that strict friendship you profess to me, which I shall set the greater value upon, when I experiment the effects of it do not only extend to me, but to a person I am equally concern'd for; and when it enables me to pay a debt, which otherwise I should be uncapable to discharge. Sir, I answer'd, had you owed me my debt, you had abundantly over-paid it, in thus desiring to do so. Then addressing my self to Statira , I told her; Madam, had I imagin'd the duty I have perform'd to the generous Atafernes , and acquainting him with the grounds on which I did it, would have occasioned those desires in him, and those troubles those desires have rais'd in you, I should rather have appear'd rude to you both by my silence, than have been found injurious to you in so breaking it; and therefore, Madam, I humbly beg you in the Princess Mithridatia's behalf, that you will not let her descend so much below her self, as to act what her brother asks of her, and I once implor'd, when it was only to avoyd receiving the prize, from a title which now I observe to own, will be less injurious, than to decline, and consequently your denial will be as favourable as your grant, nay more, having, Madam, a higher concernment for what I finde pleases you, than I can for what pleases my self. This I did speak with an accent and look which palpably manifested, my respect only made me do so, which invited Atafernes to fix his eies upon Statyra , who easily read in his countenance, how much her delay, if not denyal, was sensible unto him, and that was so prevalent, that turning to her brother, she told him (in no small disorders) I thought you were so fully satisfied of my affection, that you would not put it to fresh experiments; but since you will, you shall see I can disobey you in nothing: then looking upon me she said; Callimachus , that which I gave you, as due to your success, I now give you, in obedience to Atafernes desires, as a mark of my favour. Madam (I reply'd) since the Gods have plac'd every way so infinite a disproportion between you and me, that I cannot ever so much as hope to receive on my own account, what you are pleas'd to give me on your generous brothers: I cannot but acknowledge their goodnesse in raising me up so powerful an Intercessor; and yours in permitting him to be so. I spoke so much, being a little heightned in that act of friendship I had then received from Atafernes ; and I durst speak no more, lest by repining at having receiv'd no more, I should induce her to repent her having done so much. All the rest of that evening we spent in Atafernes's chamber, and after, having waited on the Princess to hers, I retir'd to my own [for, though a Ball was that night designed, yet, because the two Princes were unable to assist at it, 'twas deferr'd till a fitter opportunity] and past the greatest part of the Night in reflecting upon the passages of the preceding day. The strange difficulty Statira had made of letting me receive the prize as a mark of her favour, when upon the Scaffold I had lighted, upon no ill expedient to have clouded it with, and when thereby both she and I had adjudged the honour of that day to her favourite brother, and also had exempted me from carrying it away from her eldest brother; And her declaring, when she made me that obliging assurance in Atafernes's chamber, that it was to obey him, could not more perplex me, than I was pleased with what I inferr'd from that proceeding; for I flatter'd my self with an opinion, that thereby she had discovered my passion, and believ'd I was not ignorant she had done so; both which occasion'd that coldness, which was at once my satisfaction and my trouble. But if in this one carriage of hers, I had occasion to make that my Faith, by many a one in the future I had not so much as a shadow left me to suspect I was mistaken; for whereas formerly she often elected me to wait on her, above any other, she was afterwards careful to avoyd it; and from being friendly she only continued civil; but yet she was civil in a way, which assured me, she was not offended at any thing, but that for which, though I could have wish'd she would not have been, yet, I could not but expect she would. I was not ignorant in how improbable a design I had engag'd my self; that being but a private person, destitute of friends, and ignorant even of what I was; to lift up my sight towards a Princess, the greatest in the World, by her quality, and more formidable to me from her severe vertue, and her absolute resignation to her Fathers will; which she had but too positively acquainted me with, as he had her, that if she would observe his, she must give her self to the King of Cyprus , who was but forming a Fleet fit to assist her Father with, and an Equipage fit to make his Court in. But all this, and much more, was not so prevalent to disswade me from a resolution of adoring the fair Statira , as her virtues and beauties were, to confine me to do it; and having already gone through one of the most difficult performances, that of letting her know my passion in so little criminal a way, I despaired not of attaining the other, that of perswading her to permit it; for I was so obliging to my own hopes, as not to despair in an Age, when the Sword gave the Law; but by mine to present her with those Titles, which my birth had denied me, or my ill Fortune had conceal'd from me: And therefore in those high preparatives which were made for a War the ensuing spring against Nicomedes, Ariobarzanes , and Murena , I was not unactive; But there hapned an accident which was much more speedy and favourable to me, than I could have imagined; for at a solemn Feast made by Gordius , to which Archilaus, Neptolemus, Craterus (with whom I had contracted a strict friendship, and who was indeed a person of much honour) Dorilaus , my self, and many others were invited; Archilaus fell into discourses of a deep discontent, which is a disease that commonly proceedes from the highest power too long intrusted in one subjects hands, who finding the King uncapable to remunerate future services by having given all he can give, to preceding ones; do not consider that duty, if never rewarded, obliges him to all he can do; and if rewarded to the utmost, duty and gratitude bindes him equally to the like. I admir'd none there attempted to show him his error; but perceiving their respect to him, made him lay aside all his to his Prince, I could not but do that my self, which (though less concern'd then many which were present) I had condemned them for omitting. But Archilaus more provoked by my minding him of his dutie, so entirely cast it off, that what at first I had considered as an Act of heat and passion, I now looked upon as a providence of the Gods, who would make him disclose some Treason, which if he had continued silent, he might have acted. Therefore the more to make him discover himself, I told him; I see Archilaus , that your being General over so many gallant men as are here, makes them continue in a silence, their looks visibly detests; and therefore since I am not engaged to it by that obligation, I declare unto you, if to morrow morning you do not acknowledge before them, that your passion only has made you utter these criminal expressions, I shall expect reparation for them with your Sword; which if you decline, prepare your self to answer what you have said before Mithridates , to who I am too strictly bound, to hear him injur'd without endevoring to right him in one of those wayes I have proposed. Young man ( Archilaus furiously reply'd) the services I have done the King of Pontus are so many and signal, that they will be credited before thee, and therefore not to give thee satisfaction, but to punish thy insolence, I will give thee that meeting to morrow morning which thou desirest, where be as certain I will punish thy pride, as now thou mayst be that I resent it This answer so incenst me, that I could not abstain from answering him; Those duties which thou gloriest in, have not acquired so much for thy King, as thou gavest away from him unto Scylla ; but I will now speak no more, since thou hast assured me to morrow, of so certain a means to repair thy disrespect to thy Prince, and thy rudeness to me. Archilaus , losing all his patience at what I had spoken, laid his hand upon his Sword; as I immediatly did the like on mine: But the Company interpos'd to part us, which made me tell him, I shall expect thee to morrow morning early in the Meadow near the Sacred Grove, single, or with any person of honour that may witness we fought fairly; but know if thou failest, or that this be divulged; I am acquit from that silence, which otherwise I promise thee till then to keep. Archilaus only by a Nod of his head seem'd to tell me, he assented to what I had proposed, which made me immediatly retire to my appartment, to prepare for our intended duel, which I was confident of; for my Enemy was a man of known courage, and our dispute and assignation was only before persons who lov'd him, and had much rather have expos'd him to my Sword, than to my Accusation. In brief, according to assignment we met; Archilaus bringing with him Craterus as a mutual witness, who (he knew) was one I reposed no small confidence in, for my Enemy understood the Punctilios of honour, and was curious in their practise; so that if he had been as honest as gallant, we had never measur'd our Swords. The first pass, our clothes were only wounded, but the next he hurt me through my left Arm, as I did him through his right; and following my thrust, clos'd with him, flung him down, and disarm'd him. Craterus immediatly stept in, to hinder me from making any fatall use of my advantage, which I had no designe to do: for immediatly permitting him to rise, and restoring him his Sword, I told him; Archilaus , be satisfied, I am in the right by my success against you; and be as satisfied, that if you employ that Sword and Life I give you, for your King; he shall never know what you have spoke against him. Archilaus , with a deep sigh, only replyed; you are generous, and I am unfortunate; and then with Craterus went away: but lest my wound in my Arm might give some suspition of what we had been doing, I resolv'd to keep my chamber for a few dayes, as being indisposed in health; and being confident the Prince Atafernes would visit me, I caus'd the Chirurgion which drest my wound (whose privacy I strictly enjoyn'd) to let me blood in the same Arm I was hurt, that unsuspectedly I might carry it in a scarf; and to take away all cause of jelousy, I caus'd the blood he took from me, to be left in my chamber till Atafernes did come, which he suddenly after did; for 'twas my custome every morning to wait on him; which omission then, lest he should think strange, I sent to apologize for being rendred uncapable by an indisposition, which had necessitated me, to breath a vein; and would for a few dayes confine me to my Chamber: this information he had no sooner received, than he came thither, and by many tendernesses convinced me, I had a higher interest in his affection and friendship, than I either thought, or deserved. All that day he continu'd with me; and the next, return'd early to repeat that honour. I had then also the satisfaction of having the fair Mithridatia send one of her Gentlemen to enquire after my health, which I would alwayes have been deprived of, to have had it so obligingly sought after. The same day towards the Evening, Mithridates favour'd me with a visit, and during his stay with me, Craterus came hastily into the Chamber to acquaint his King, that Archilaus and Neptolemus were fled in disguises; that Archilaus had secured Chalcedon , and Neptolemus, Heraclea , the chiefest Towns of the Bosphorians and Colques, of which two Provinces they were Governours, and thereby possess'd themselves of all his Fleet, who were Randezvous'd in those two Havens; and that they had given out words which made it more tha probable that they would joyn with Nicomedes, Ariobarzanes and Murena ; the truth of which intelligence was not to be suspected, since 'twas impossible they could justifie their first crime, but by acting this second. Mithridates was sensibly surpris'd at this advertisement, and forthwith gave orders for all his chief Officers to meet, to advise of the best expedient against so threatning a danger; whilest the Councel was assembling some of the Guards which had got notice of the two brothers escape, seized upon and brought before the King, a Person, whom they found in the dusk of the Evening, stealing over the works; for no sooner was this Newes divulged, than all the Ports of Nicomedia were shut, and the Guards doubled, lest to the publike Revolt, some private attempt might have been made against his person: This man was soon known to be Archilaus Secretary, who confessing nothing, was forthwith condemned to the Wrack, which he had not resolution to endure, or scarcely to look on; so that he told Craterus , if he were brought to the King, and might only suffer death, without torture, he would discover all: the first being performed, and the last promised by Mithridates , he told him; Sir, since the agreement made by my Lord with Scylla , he found himself so little valued by you, that after a long dispute between his resentment and his Loyalty, the first obteined the superioritie; whereupon immediatly he made his secret applications to Nicomedes and Murena , who promised, if he delivered you, Sir, alive or dead into their hands, they would make him King of Pontus , which he should hold in fee from the people of Rome . This he promised within one Month to perform; which he had certainly done, if by his too little precaution at a Feast Gordius lately made, he had not spoken words of so high a discontent against you, that they necessitated Callimachus to that duel with him, which he was confident would not be so privately kept, but that it would come to your knowledge; and therefore not being ready to act his designes against your person, he thought it more advisable to revolt to your Enemies, and present them with your Fleet, and those two Provinces he and Neptolemus commanded, than run an apparant hazard of being discover'd, and prevented even of that. I was commanded by him to continue here, and endeavour to gain Dorilaus for him; but I had not so much as the opportunitie to speak with him; and having advertisement that the Ports were shutting, I apprehended 'twas the more probably to seize on me; I resolved to fly, but I was prevented; and therefore must submit to your Justice, and my Fate. This discourse was no sooner finish'd, than Mithridates and Atafernes looked upon me, in a way which (me thought) seemed to reproach my silence to the one, and my [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17026001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE47D60&area=prose&forward=textsFT) fiction to the other. But Craterus immediatly told the King all that had passed, and then thus continued; I am Sir, the most guilty, but I know nothing could have bribed me to so criminal a silence, but my Generals electing me to be a mutual second to both, which perhaps he knew, and therefore impos'd on me that employment: besides Sir, I was more than hopeful, his having given Callimachus that way of satisfaction, for what I thought proceeded from a distemper of company only, might have ascertain'd him from his accusation, and consequently have confin'd him to employ that Life in your service, which was given him by the Gods, and by his Enemy, for that end. As soon as Craterus had finish'd; Mithridates came to me, and in embraces and many words as obliging, acquainted me how sensible he was of the service I had done his State and Person, in so timely discovering a Treachery, which otherwise had ruin'd both. He also cast forth some words how happy he was in having a Friend, who, though a Stranger, had manifested more concernment for him, than all his subjects had done. I was (continued Callimachus ) a little in disorder to finde my acting gave some ground for this reproach to Craterus , and those other brave Men which had been present at our quarrel; and more, that by such a deciding it I had brought the safetie of Statira's Father, her generous Brothers,  & perhaps her own, to so hazardous an issue as a duel was, for which I made many excuses to Mithridates , extenuating too the supposed offence of Craterus & the rest's not doing what I did, by their being under Archilaus command, and by their belief that they were words of passion rather than designe; to repair all which, and to evidence I spar'd not my Enemy upon any criminal account, I humbly begg'd the King to employ us all against him, that by our actions we might obtain  & merit his belief to our professions, & that I in particular might endevor to destroy a person, I now found I had but too prodigally spar'd. Mithridates again embraced me for this desire, which he told me should be granted, professing openly he was confident that the same Sword which had worsted Archilaus in a Duel, would do the like in a Battail. Soon after, he went out of my Chamber to hold that Councel he had summon'd, and forthwith order'd the Secretary to be put to death. The Prince Atafernes , who had assisted at the Councel, came again to me that Night, and in raptures of joy acquainted me; That Mithridates having resolved on two Wars, the one against his Rebels, the other against Nicomedes, Ariobarzanes and Murena had then nominated two Generals, which were Pharnaces and himself. This to command against Archilaus , that against Nicomedes : That the King had made me his Lieutenant General, and Gordius his brothers; that Craterus was to go with him, as Dorilaus was to go with Pharnaces . I confesse this advertisement was not unpleasing to me, for it gave me a relation to that generous Prince, which fix'd me near his person, and put me in a possibility of acquiring Glory, which was the only way I had to court the fair Statira in: but I was a little troubled Craterus should have a command under mine: yet Atafernes soon made it cease by protesting he resented none thereat, but was rather pleas'd, being in effect as well as in profession, highly my Friend. Ten dayes after, having Randevouz'd on the Bankes of the River Calpas thirty thousand Foot, and ten thousand Horse of those with which Mithridates designed to make War against Murena , he order'd them to move towards Nicomedes and his Associates, who had furnish'd Neoptolemus with some considerable additional Forces to joyn with his brother, least in that peninsule he was in he might be worsted; and indeed it was high time, for Neoptolemus had already brought his Army over the Mountain Horminius , and after having cross'd the River Hyppias was hastily marching to gain the passes of the River Sangarus , after which he had nothing but Bodies of Men to hinder their so much desired conjunction. After Atafernes had perform'd the parting duty to his Father and Brother (to the first of which I pay'd many humble acknowledgements for the honour he had done me, and the trust he had reposed in me, which he answer'd too flatteringly to be repeated) he took me with him to the Queen's Appartment, where there then was the Princess Roxana , from whom as Atafernes was taking leave, Monyma , covering her Face with her Vail, told me; I know not, Callimachus , if what I was necessitated to do, has left you any belief, that I am still concern'd for you, or has left me any of that Empire over you, which you were once pleased to give me; but lest you should so much wrong me as to have a contrary thought, or lest I might so much wrong you as to believe you would impose that penalty on a necessitated Fault, which can only be due to a willing one, I conjure you in the War you are now undertaking, be not so covetous of honour, as wholly for it to neglect your safety, which is considerable, and perhaps but too much so, to me. I was so strangely surpris'd at these words, especially at the last of them, that doubtless I had been much troubled for an answer, if Atafernes having taken leave of Roxana , had not then come towards us, which gave me only time to replie; Madam, I have still paid so exact an obedience to all your commands, that I hope you cannot have cause to suspect I will decline that practise. This was the civilest, shortest, and resentfulst answer I could give her, which were the three ingredients I desired it should be composed of: soon after having kiss'd the Princess Roxana's hands, we went to the appartment of Mithridatia , which her brother did visit in the last place, as being that for which he had the highest concern, and resolved to bestow the most time upon. Never was there any separation so moving as that of these two excellent persons, and never did I see the fair Statira give so clear an evidence that the equality of her minde was conquerable, as in this occasion, which yet was a Noble Condescension, since even that weakness appear'd but the better to manifest the strength of her friendship; yet it hath made me many time since conclude she had some Prophetick fore- sight of the fatal miseries this War would produce. Three times in strict embraces they endeavour'd to part before they had the power to do it; which as soon as they had obteyned, I went to receive her Commands; which when she perceived, passing her hands before her face to cover the trouble Atafernes had rais'd in her, she told me with an accent and grace particular to her self. Callimachus , I owe you my Liberty and my Life, which are high obligations; and I can assure you are not, nor ever shall be, forgotten; but yet those I was not near so much concern'd in, as I am in Atafernes , whose safety I expresly recommend to your care. I know the earnestness of youth, and the first sollicitings of Victory, are motives will precipitate him into dangers from which only your courage will be able to free him; but I wish I could be as confident that your advice would preserve him from running into such perils, as I am, that your Sword, when they are run into, will disengage him out of them: I conjure you, moderate his Heat by your Counsel, and by representing to him the miseries my life must be replenish'd with, if his should be lost; against the apprehensions whereof, I am not a little fortifi'd, by the Gods, having chosen for him such a friend as Callimachus , who when he acts all that valour and friendship can produce, does but make good the opinion I have already of him. Madam, I repli'd, the duty and care I owe the Prince Atafernes , as he is himself, is uncapable of accession, any other wayes than by the relatio he has to the Princess Statira ,  & by those commands she has now been pleas'd to honour me with: I cannot doubt that a person who is so justly and highly in your care, can be denied that of the Gods; but yet I can no more hope the meanes to that end should be by my advice, than doubt it can be by any other, than by representing to him how certainly his death will occasion and accelerate yours; that is a sin, which to avoide, I believe he would not onely be content to decline the Courting of Glory, but even be an Enemy to it: No Madam, the Gods are too just to make you give your friendship to one, who can prefer any thing before it, or who would not despise al honour for that only of observing your Commands, which are of so unlimited a power, that what they enjoyn, they will inable me to perform, or render the not surviving my disobedience a just penalty for having been guilty of it. I cannot, said Statira , be invited to believe, that an addition to a loss, can any way repair it; and therefore if the Gods should call away Atafernes , I expect Callimachus should rather live to give me consolations, than by his death give me an higher need of them. These words she hastily spoke, because the Prince was come towards us, who had been taking leave of his sisters women; which I think he did, to allow me the more freely an opportunity of doing the like to her, whose obligingness in her last expressions, I endeavoured to acquaint her by some of mine, were as sensibly as humbly received. Soon after Atafernes took his last Farewell , which was in so many tears, that I could not more pitty Statira , than I did envy him. The next morning early all the Streets of Nicomedia eccho'd with the Trumpets, and were fill'd with the Guards which attended the two Princes to their Armies. Ours that Night we overtook, for it had been led but three easie dayes marches by Craterus , who brought Atafernes notice that Night to his Tent, that Archilaus the preceding day had made a General Muster on the Bankes of Psillis , that his Numbers were much superior to ours, and that he was therefore resolved to seek a Field for the decision of the War, unto which bold resolution he was as much invited from the advantage of his Numbers, as by his intelligence that Pharnaces was advanced towards Neoptolemus with a vast Army (for Mithridates had manifested the disproportion of his affection between those two Princes by the disproportion in the Number of their Forces, which was near double) whom he therefore was solicitous to joyn with, and would not decline an ingagement in pursuance of that designe. All which Craterus assur'd his General he had even then received from a faithful Spie. This advertisement made us resolve to prepare for the Battail, the avoiding whereof would be as advantageous for our Enemies as if we had lost it; but in regard their Number so much exceeded ours, it was esteem'd advisable to endeavour to divert a part of their Army, whilest we were fighting with the rest: and therefore I caus'd an Officer of ours to go as a Spie into their Camp (which by reason of their great advantage in Forces, and their immediate resolution of fighting, was not at all fortified) and there to act that part so grosly, that he could not but be seized upon for one; which when he was, and condemned (which would infallibly follow) then to let Archilaus know if he would save his Life, and give him an equal employment in his Army to that he lost in Atafernes's ; he would discover to him a secret, which probably might destroy his Enemies; which should be, that we had sent a third part of our Army to meet an additional supply (equal to that Number) which Mithridates had sent after us, hearing of the Enemies unexpected Forces; which if Archilaus would send to meet, he might with as much ease defeat, as having done that to them, he might the next day do the like to the rest. The attempt indeed was hazardous for the Undertaker; but the Laws of War render it just to employ Men upon things which were much more so, for the general advantage; His hire too was great, neither was it impossible but, if he were believ'd, he might get off, either by their trusting him, or by our success before they were able to discover and punish his delusion. But to leave as little to Fortune as such an affair would admit, I sent a Spie with him to bring me word if that same Night any part of Archilaus Army moved out of their Camp, that immediatly on Notice thereof we might do the like to fall on the Remainder. In brief, this Officer so well acted his part, that fifteen thousand, Horse and Foot, were sent (and he for their guide) about fall of the Night to intercept our imagin'd Recruits, and & three hours after, (which was the time spent in bringing that advertisement) we moved with all our Army (which was purposely kept in readiness) towards the Enemy, and by break of day came to their Camp, which after some little resistance we broke into, for they were so confident of their false intelligence that they did not so much as fancy we would attempt them till our believed supply and that part of our Army which went to secure them, was joyned with us. The execution was very bloody, for all but the usual Guards were taken asleep and in disorder; But yet Archilaus escaped in a Boat down the River of Psillis , at the mouth whereof his Fleet lay, with which he immediatly set Sail for Heraclea , least Neoptolemus's ignorance of this misfortune, might occasion his being involv'd in a parallel one. But to improve this success to the full, I forthwith caused our Soldiers to refresh themselves, to put on the clothes of them they had kill'd, to furle up their own colours, and march with those we had so lately taken towards the residue of that vanquish'd Army, leaving such behind in Archilaus Camp as were wounded or tyred, as also a competent Guard for Craterus person whose wounds disenabled him to stir out of it. A little before the fall of the Sun we came in sight of them, as they were sadly returning from their hoped Victory, (having put to death him that had deceived them) which was the time we desired to do it in, that seeing our Souldiers clothes and colours, they might the less suspect us: this also hapned as we had expected; so that some of the chief Officers riding fearlesly up to us, we seized upon the; the Body moving carelesly seeing their Officers joyn'd with us, were immediatly surpris'd; which so soon as they found they were, and heard Archilaus was defeated, and mercy offer'd to those which flung down their Arms, and would willingly take up that allegiance they had so slightly cast off, they all embraced that mercy, which was both their duty and safety: amongst those many prisoners which were there taken, there was a Bosphorian Lord called Lingarus , which had commanded these Forces, who had the repute of a man of honour and courage. Him I spoke with privately as we returned to Atafernes ; and desired to know the ground of his and so many other brave mens revolt; and whether Chalcedon and those other Cities Archilaus had seduced, would not on so signal a disowning of their Quarrel by the Gods, and an assurance of pardon, return to their former quiet and subjection. To which Lingarus answer'd, I am confident that neither this miraculous defeat, nor all the assurances of forgiveness, will any way prevail to perswade the Bosphorians to return under Mithridates's power, whilest he designes them that Governor, which Archilaus assur'd me he would give us, which did more for Archilaus than any other way he could have done for himself; but if instead of Pharnaces we may have Atafernes , I dare engage that considerable Province shall sheath their Swords, or cheerfully employ them against any Enemy, when led by so generous a Prince, whose eldest brother has given such undoubted and early markes of cruelty, that we thought it much less hazardous to oppose than submit to him, and wanting, by Archilaus and Neoptolemus change, a Friend which might acquaint Mithridates with our sense in such a way as we desired, as also being prest by them to prevent by Arms what we could not by petition, and that the crime of a Revolt, before Pharnaces was impos'd on us would appear less to the King, than to do it for that Reason, with their faithfull promises of never making a peace till we should be secured from that fear which made us make a War, invited us to what we have done, and has brought us to what we suffer. I was not a little pleas'd to understand so desired a truth, and that by making an internal peace we might be better enabled to carry on a War against Nicomedes and Murena , which promis'd more glory than this we now hoped so advantagiously to finish. 'Twas therefore that I fortifi'd Lingarus in his design of quietness having Atafernes for Governour, which I faithfully promis'd in few dayes to sollicite Mithridates for. The next day we returned to our Camp, where our General (who had stay'd there by reason of an incommodious hurt) gave me so many acknowledgements for what I had contrived and acted, that I was more satisfied at them then at the Victory. As soon as I had visited Craterus , whose wounds were more painful than dangerous, I returned to Atafernes Tent, to whom I imparted what Lingarus had acquainted me with, and what I had promised him, which I begg'd his permission and license to accomplish, whilest his Army was taking that refreshment their two harrasing marches required: I further represented to him the Command of so considerable a Province (which being so well affected to him before they knew his Government, and consequently would be so entirely when they did) might render him considerable to his Father and Brother, as well for his power as desert; and if the Province of Bosphorus were forthwith quieted, he might by joyning Armies, share in his glory, having acquired with much celerity, all that the War he was assign'd unto could produce, which might let the World see, the disproportion Mithridates placed between them was purely an effect of his inclinations, by his acting against evincements able to convert any thing else. I had scarce done speaking, when Atafernes embraced me and replyed; The Gods do now abundantly repair giving me such a Brother, in giving of me such a Friend; yes Callimachus I say, such a Brother, for till now I never disclosed, but to Statira , a wickedness of his, such as the very thought of it makes me tremble; for he no sooner saw Mithridates honour me with some marks of his affection (not content with the precedency he had therein) but he instantly calumniated me unto him, and finding the unfruitfulness of so unjust a proceeding, he hired one of my Domesticks to kill me, which the faithful Servant acquainted me with, and then fled into another Kingdome, knowing how unsafe this was after such a discovery to me, and such a disobedience to him; this not succeeding, he hired one to poyson me at a Feast he invited me to; but the Servant which was to do it, being accidentally call'd aside, another came to fill some Wine for Pharnaces , and took it out of the Fatal Bottle designed for me; but the other on his return found the mistake, and ran to his Prince to acquaint him with it, who before he came had drank the Wine, but having timely Notice he rose hastily from the Table pretending a sudden indisposition, and before the poyson had too much seized on his vitals, he forced himself to cast it up. This the design'd Actor hereof a few dayes since, as he lay on his Death-bed, repenting his sin, sent very privately for me and acquainted me with, begging my pardon and advertising me of my danger in the future. Neither has this cruel Brother desisted, though he has had so clear evidences how much the Gods detest his being so, but has highly sollicited the Marriage of Mithridatia to the King of Cyprus , that by her remove, my chiefest support might receive one, for she so perfectly affects me and is so highly valued by Mithridates that whilest she is near him, he can hardly that way act his designes. Sir, (I replyed) the crimes of your Brother render the motion I have made so necessary, that if you decline it, and that Pharnaces reach his ends, you are not only guilty of your own sufferings, but also of his actings, having so fair a way to prevent both. Go then, said Atafernes , and make me your debtor for my safety as well as success. That very hour I posted away towards Nicomedia where Mithridates resided, for whom I had a Letter from the Prince, which referr'd the relation of our late Victory to my making, with this flattering complement, [since the Actor would be the best describer of it.] I also presented Mithridates with all those Colours we had taken from Archilaus . His joy was exceeding great, so were his acknowledgements to me, in the heat whereof I so happily prest him, that he gave me a Commission for my General to be Governour of the Bosphorians, and to pardon all of them which he thought fit, wherein he enjoyned the using of all expedition, in regard he had then received certain intelligence that Nicomedes , with a considerable Army of it self, was joyned with Murena and Neoptolemus , and that they daily expected Ariobarzanes with some considerable accessionall Forces, which if united might over-power Pharnaces , with whom he earnestly desired Atafernes might joyn, as soon as ever he had put the affaires of the Bosphorians in any tollerable posture. But whilest Mithridates orders, and the Prince's commission was drawing up, Mithridates told me, 'twas but just the Queen should participate of the good Newes I brought, so that he forthwith led me to her appartment to give her an account thereof, during which I observed what but confirmed the opinion I had assum'd, by those words she spake when I last waited on her, which made me not a little rejoyce that Mithridates was present, lest otherwise she might have begun a discourse I would not willingly have been engaged in. The King soon after dismiss'd me to make my other visits, since I allow'd my self so little time for their performance. From thence I went to pay my duty to the Princess Roxana , who, after she had satisfied her self with questions concerning the Battail, and highly rejoyced at her Brother's success in it, asked me whether I had been with her Sister; to which I told her 'twas the next visit I intended, I will then said Roxana , accompany you thither; for you carry with you what will give her so much satisfaction, that it will be some to me to see it. I could not refuse this honour, though I was sensibly troubled at it; yet when I came to the fair Statira's appartment, I found Monyma there, whereby I perceived that privacy I was denied by Roxana's Company, I had otherwise been depriv'd of by the Queen's, which also did confirm me in a belief that she had discover'd the passion under which I suffreed, and in which I delighted. This made my visit short, and the discourses in it unfit for my Relation; only when I took leave of the fair Mithridatia , she told me softly, I had done so much for her Brothers glory in the Battail, and for his safety after, that the sense of those Obligations should alwayes continue with her. Immediatly after, having received my dispatch from Mithridates , I returned towards our Camp, all the way entertaining my thoughts with what had been said and done since my leaving it, though thereby I found or apprehended new obstacles in my passion (from Monyma's resentment and power with the King) equal to those I was prepar'd to contest with from Statira's disposition and quality, and from the lownesse of my own. As soon as I came to Atafernes , and had presented him with the effects of my journey and solicitations, for which he gave me higher marks of his favour and friendship than ever. He forthwith sent for Lingarus to whom he communicated his Commission, and upon his faithful engagement of acting, as he had promised me, he had his Pardon and Liberty, which he so well employ'd, that three dayes after, the strong City of Chalcedon sent Atafernes her Keyes and Submissions; and all the rest, by her example, did suddenly expell or seize on Archilaus Garisons, and returned to their former obedience, which gave Lingarus as high an interest in Atafernes , as he then manifested he had in his Country. This accelerated success was very opportune; For the Prince had no sooner thus settled his Province, than the first dayes march he made out of it to joyn with Pharnaces , he received advertisement from Mithridates , that it was impossible to do so: For Nicomedes and Murena by a subtilty of War finding the Pontick Army kept and camped neer the Bridge Omiris upon the River Sangarus , over which none could go to Nicomedia but by marching about to the source thereof, which would cost six dayes time; they caus'd some of their own Soldiers to run away to Pharnaces , and to inform him, that Ariobarzanes being not yet come, and understanding Atafernes had defeated Archilaus , (which really they had not then heard,) they were so terrified thereat, that they would have for the present dissolved their Army, had not their shame been superior to their fear, but that they were then beginning strongly to intrench themselves, till their expected supplies arrived, so that if they were immediatly attempted, the resistance would be small, and the probability of the Victory great; For though they had the River Hyppias before them, yet there were Foords enow ungarded some hundred furlongs above the Roman Camp, which they would undertake to guide the Pontick Army over. This advertisement confidently delivered by certain Bithynians , who acknowledged themselves weary of following their unfortunate King, and desired no other reward for so eminent a service, but that they might return quietly to their homes, and receive their Sepulture in that Countrey which gave them their Birth: This invited Pharnaces to communicate it to Gordius, Dorilaus and the rest of his principal Officers, who finding the designe full of hope and honour, as also one motive of the Enemies fear ( Archilaus defeat) true, which Newes was the precedent day come to Pharnaces , and perhaps envious at Atafernes glory, and fearful by a conjunction of Forces, (which that Prince's Victory enabled him to make,) He might further eclipse his; They resolved on the designe; and, making their Intelligencers their guides, they marched all the succeeding Night with all the Army (but a Guard they left to justifie some works they had cast up at the end of the Bridge Omiris ) to those Foords which were a dayes march above Nicomedes Camp, who having received advertisement thereof, leaving some few men to continue their fires therein till Pharnaces appearance, and then in Botes to recover their Fleet which Rid at the mouth of Hippius , he forth with marched over that river, broke down the Bridge, and thence sending four thousand Horse with Foote behinde them, to Omiris , those partly by deceipt, partly by force took the Fort which commanded it, and put all that defended it to the Sword: then marching his own Army over it, he broke that down also, as well to hinder Pharnaces following him, as to let his Souldiers know, they were to expect no safety but in their courages. The success of this excellent Stratagem could not give Nicomedes and Murena more joy, than the arrival of Archilaus by Sea that night invaded them with sorrow; for till then they had not heard of his defeat, a stiff Eastwinde having deny'd him a conjunction with his Associates, though the distance was not above a Nights sail. Nicomedes and Murena having given some houres that Night to sorrow began then to console themselves in that Fleet Archilaus had brought them, which made them absolute Masters at Sea, and in the hope they had of being speedily the like on the Land, by their having so well separated the two Brothers, and by being so near Nicomedia , the unfortified residence of Mithridates , which they design'd the next Evening to see,  & the next after to possess. The end of the third Book. PARTHENISSA THE Last Part THE FOURTH BOOK . his enemies, whose hasty advance made him often determine to desert the place of his usuall residence, and seek his safety in Atafernes Army, which he considered as a more hopefull Sanctuary than that large and unfortified City: But at length his Honour having conquered his apprehensions, he resolv'd to continue where he was, and not to increase Nicomedes advantages by two such signall accessions, as those of his owne flight, and of the losse of Nicomedia , which last would be an infallible consequence of the first. This intention once assum'd, he sent severall expresses to my Generall to acquaint him with it, and to command him to hasten out of his Army such a considerable strength to secure the City, as might rationally do so, till he came up with the residue, or till Pharnaces could come to his assistance. Atafernes having received these commands, resolved in person to take foure thousand Horse, and mounting as many select Foot behind them, to cast himselfe into Nicomedia , as knowing those services in which the King's safety is ascertain'd, and which he is a spectator of, are of deepest impression, and happiest advantage. The command of the Army he intrusted me with, though I passionately begg'd to wait upon him, both as 'twas my inclination, and duty to him, and the princess Statira's last commands, for which disobedience having undertook to excuse me, upon the necessity of the publique safety, and having pressingly invited Lingarus and the rest of the Bosphorian Nobility to increase his numbers, and to contribute to a battle which probably was to decide a War, the enemy having put themselves into a posture which rendred that belief a rationall one, he marched away taking Craterus with him, whose wounds made the towne more fit for his condition, than the field. Soone after I followed his steps, leaving yet nothing unessay'd to increase the Army to such numbers, as without Temerity we might conquer Nicomedes , and not be obliged to the assistance of Pharnaces , and thereby end both Wars, before he had begun one. Neither was I altogether indebted to my hopes for so flattering an imagination, but to my reason also; for Lingarus had so intently and actively imploy'd himselfe, that when I was come within a dayes march of Nicomedia , he overtook me with the flower of the nobility of Bosphorus , who perhaps thereby endeavoured to let Mithridates see, they were too considerable not to be continued his friends, or to be made his enemies. But alas my satisfaction then could not transcend my sorrow soone after, when by an expresse from the King, I understood that the same morning on which the letter was writ, the Prince Atafernes being furiously assaulted by the enemy (who knowing their condition admitted no recovery if they were not conquerours of Nicomedia , and of one Army before the other had joyned with it) and having with wonderfull resolution beat them off, had so far  & so briskly followed this dawning successe with all his horse, that before he saw his mistake, he was not in a capacity of remedying it, the whole Army having interposed between him and his retreat, which finding 'twas impossible to make, he and his were resolved so to signallize their defeate, that his foes might have as much cause to mourne, as to rejoyce at it. This designe he had fully acted; and at length he and all that followed him, overpressed with multitudes, were every one kill'd or taken; and whether he himselfe had fallen into the first or last of these misfortunes, was yet uncertaine, so that the Forces in Nicomedia being deprived of him, seem'd to be deprived of what had animated them; desending now the enemies renued and universall assault with such coldnesse, that 'twas deeply apprehended their resistance would not be long enough to render my reliefe worthy that Name. Oh Gods! you alone can tell my trouble at this sad advertisement, having of two person's I most valued, lost one, and being but in too high a probability of losing the other. But I had not time given me to deplore my unhappiness, nor hardly enough to prevent the increase of it; Therefore immediately marching away all the Horse I had, and appointing Megabizes a gallant and experienced Officer to follow me expeditiously with the foot, I bent my course with all imaginable celerity towards Nicomedia , resolv'd to put a period to the danger of those in it, or to my life. By the dawn of the day, I was come near enough to hear the shouts, and cryes of the Assailants, and defendents, and soon after to see all Nicomedes Army (except those imploy'd in the storm) under their Colours. By this I knew the place was not lost, and that the Enemy had no small hopes that it would soon be won. Thrust on by this apprehension, and elevated by that joy, I flew to charge a Body of near ten thousand Horse, which lay ready to receive that relief they believed Mithridates needed, and I would bring him. I strictly order'd all my Souldiers not to follow any success the Gods and their courages should give them, farther than might contribute to our entring of the City, which was then our only designe. The Fight was furious, and bloody, the hopes of both parties depending upon the event of it; but at last I singled out the General of their Horse, and in sight of both parties kill'd him, at which our Enemies gave ground, and soon after so precipitately lost all, that we entered Nicomedia , not having lessened our Numbers above four hundred, and having lessened five times as many of our adversaries; but as if Fate had designed that both the Streets and the Fields should be equally moystened with humane blood, as I entered the West-gate, Nicomedes in person entered the East, having left the generous Craterus for dead in the mouth of the breach, and fill'd up the graft with the dead Bodies which had so resolutely defended it, thereby having rendred those which had been the obstacle of their entrance, now the means of having it more easy. Had you seen the faces of the Nicomedians , you might have read their condition, for they equally participated of joy and fear, their friends being triumphant at one end of the Town, and their Enemies at the other: But the last Newes coming earlier to Mithridates than the first, he thought it no longer courage, but frenzie to expect relief in a place which he now esteemed uncapable of any. He therefore hastily abandoned the Palace, with the Queen, the Princesse Statira , the Princess Roxana , and the young Princess Cleopatra , and flying with them towards a little Fort which stood at the extremity of the street I was entred, and commanded the Sea, (to which Element he now only hoped to owe his deliverance,) he met me at the head of my Forces, covered with dust and blood, as most in the first Ranks were. The posture we were in, joyn'd with the intelligence of the Enemies having entred the City, made him no longer doubt but that his Fate was come, and in that belief he was going to act it with his own hands; but perceiving his mistake by the flight of those few Gards he had left,  & by the cryes of the Princesses, lifting up my helmet & turning the point of my sword to the ground, I rode up to the King, and conjur'd him not so much to wrong the Gods, and his own Souldiers, as by abandoning Nicomedia to evidence he doubted the goodness of the one, or the courages of the other, their having so freshly defeated a considerable part of the enemies Forces, and their now having so opportunely sent him a more considerable part of his own, were such good earnests of future mercies, if not themselves present ones, that to doubt a deliverance afterwards, were but to provoke them to deny it. Never words had a more fruitfull effect than these, not only upon Mithridates , but even upon the fair Statira too, who lifting up her fair eyes eclips'd with weepings, fix'd them so obligingly on me, that my felicity was thereby higher in my own apprehension, than their late danger had been in hers. Here (generous Princes, continued Callimachus ) I must acknowledge my crime, for I could not but bless the Gods which had cast her into such misfortunes, since they had destin'd me to free her from them. As soon as I was allighted, the King flew into my arms, and in expressions great as his Joy, he began to give me acknowledgements of the same Nature; but he was cut off in the midst of them; for by this Nicomedes had so far entered the City, that her Inhabitants and Garison by their hasty flight, and confused cryes, seem'd to acquaint him all was lost. I had only time to conjure him to return to his palace (which he was not many paces from) and to beg him to rest assur'd of a Victory which our Swords had in some measure begun, and were now going to perfect. Mithridates , whilest he was acting my desire, gave me so many assurances of his confidence in my courage, that it brought no small accession to it. But when (out of respect) I was helping the Queen to walk, he so expresly prohibited so dangerous a civility, and she to take away the opportunity of my continuing it, went so hastily from me, that thereby I got an occasion of telling the fair Statira (whose incessant weepings seem'd to reproach my having not paid her commands of never abandoning her brother, that obedience I owed and have faithfully promised them) Madam, had I followed my highest inclination, and my greatest duty, (for so I shall alwayes call that observance your orders exact from me) I had now freed that generous Prince from his misfortune, or not liv'd to see you so deeply deplore it. But his injunctions on me of following him with the Army, which by reason of Craterus wounds he would not trust with any other, and his reiterated vows of apologizing for me to you, has made me guilty of a crime, which by what I see, and feel, cannot be greater than my punishment. But Madam, I am now going by some eminent action to dry up your teares, and wash away my guilt, or else to convince you by my death, that I did not altogether merit that cruel command of your Brothers, which at once was to separate me from waiting on him, and from obeying of you. These words brought fresh teares into the fair Princess's eyes, and seem'd so to contract her Breast with sorrow, that she was onely able to tell me; The poor Atafernes has told me all which you have now spoken, and I think I have not been accustomed to give your words so little credit, as to provoke you in so fatal a way as you mention, to invite me to believe them: no Callimachus , though the Gods have so signally punished the Royal- house of Pontus , as to deprive it of that unhappy Prince (the uncertainty of whose death has hitherto hindred grief from acting mine) yet I believe their mercy will place limits to their justice, and not deprive it at the same time of so considerable a Friend, for whose particular preservation I shall as concernedly pray, as for the publick success. A hideous cry occasioned by some of Nicomedes Souldiers, who thirsty after blood, or pillage, had much advanc'd themselves before the rest of their Companions, rendred me uncapable of hearing what she farther said, or of speaking any more unto her; so that having hastily again recovered my Horse, I moved eagerly towards that Enemy, the shedding of whose blood could not be but a just and necessary expiation, for their having caus'd Mithridatia to shed so many Tears. I will not here enumerate the various accidents of that bloody Day: it may perhaps suffice to tell you, that Mithridates having seen the Streets of Nicomedia run with the blood of his Enemies: and his subjects, he at last saw after a little Battail, in a great Piazza , that by the last the first were expell'd the City, in which they left so considerable a part of their Army, that had they been alive, they had been enow to have kept it against the rest. I was not solicitous to follow the execution too far, lest I might have repeated the generous Atafernes misfortune, and thereby have left Statira without a defender, when she had honoured me with that Noble Title: besides I was not without apprehensions, that Nicomedes might believe it a more hopefull designe to cut off our Foot under Megabizes , than now to take Nicomedia ; and might with such celerity attempt it, that if any time were lost, that part of the Army might be so too; having therefore first diligently search'd for, and at last found the poor Craterus Body, which yet seem'd to have some life in it, and of which I took all imaginable care, I hastily caus'd that wide breach by which the Enemy had entred, and had been expell'd, to be made up; and whilest that was doing, I went to the King, gave him an account of what we had done, begg'd his permission forthwith to attempt those who interposed between Megabizes and me, and being joyn'd, to camp in those great Fields which neighbour'd the West-port; that our men having a Night's refreshment, they might be the earlier refresh'd for a Battail, which I was confident Nicomedes, Ariobarzanes , and Murena would so pressingly offer, that I must either accept it, or draw into the City, in which our Horse would be famished, before Pharnaces could come to our Reliefe, and by which our Army would be as much dejected, as the Enemies heightned; who also might when Pharnaces came near, silently rise in the Night, and fight him before we could get notice of their remove; wherein if they had success, all would too probably be lost: whereas if he permitted me to decide the quarrel in the Field, if we did not present him with Victory, yet at least we should so much diminish our adversaries Numbers, that our Friends should finde an easie way into it. Mithridates and all his Councel believed this too hazardous a Resolution; but I so confidently perswaded them the contrary was so, that at last they condescended to what I proposed. I was beginning to take my leave and to return to my Men, when the King perceived some blood drop from my Arm, at which he seem'd as much concerned, as if it had been from his own; and forthwith sending for a Chirurgeon to dress me, and for a Scarf to support it, the Queen not having one about her, & fearing 'twould take up too much time to send for one, she desired the fair Statira to spare me hers (for by a happy accident she had one which she had prepar'd for the unhappy Atafernes ) This that obliging Prinsces did, and I received it from the hands of Monyma , who by an excess of civility would needs put it on her self, though I endeavoured by many entreaties to free her from so low a trouble; But whilest she was ordering of it, I seem'd by my looks to acknowledge Mithridatia's goodnesse, more than the Queen's, and that the first had more oblig'd me in graunting the Request, than the last had, in having made it; and if I was capable of any dissatisfaction in so much happiness, 'twas only in deriving my Obligation from any but my Princess. But finding my hurt had more befriended me already than it could injure me, unless by longer expectance of one to dress it (which it's inconsiderableness needed not) I went away, having first paid my humble acknowledgements to the Princess, and the Queen, and so fully assured Mithridates of success, that he seemed to be then as desirous of the Event of my enterprise, as formerly he had been apprehensive of it. My Souldiers having (during this) taken a little refreshment, which the over- joyd Inhabitants willingly presented them, were all in Arms, at my returne. I told them, we were again by another Victory to joyn with those, which we had obteyned a Victory, to separate our selves from. This was so requisite a performance, that it appear'd such, to the meanest capacities there, which made the motion be received with military-shouts; at the conclusion whereof, we chearfully left Nicomedia by the same Gate by which we had entred it. We were not above two furlongs on our March, when we discovered many Divisions of Horse drawn up to intercept us, and all the Residue of Nicomedes Army (who easily foresaw our intention) moving to joyn with those, we were therefore hastily advancing to charge; which we did, with such fury, that all their resistance contributed but the more to their loss, and our glory. We had no sooner disintangled our selves from this bloody Impediment, than we prosecuted our intended designe, & with such diligence, that Nicomedes not being able to overtake me with his Foot, thought it was the more safe advice, to give his men refreshment, whilest I was harrasing of mine, that they might be the fitter next day to attempt the City if I did not return, or to give me Battail, if I did. 'Twas therefore that uninterruptedly I [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17026001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE47D60&area=prose&forward=textsFT) oyn'd with Megabizes , whom I met about thirty furlongs from the place we had so lately fought in, and with whom I found such brave accessional Forces, which Lingarus credit had drawn under our Ensignes, that I return'd with a firm resolution, no longer then the next Day, to decline a general engagement: and an hour before the Sun was set, I camped in some great inclosed Fields contiguous to the Walls of Nicomedia , where I order'd my Souldiers to take as much rest as their vicinity to so many ill Neighbours would admit: And having assembled a Councel, and resolved in what form we should give the intended Battail, leaving Megabizes the command of the Camp, I went into the City taking Lingarus with me, whom I presented to Mithridates with those Elogies I esteemed due to his merits. The Kings actions shewed he believed my words, and that gallant Man received so many kindnesses from his Prince, that it brought no small increase to the zeal he had already assumed for his Service. Whilest Mithridates was entertaining himself with him, and giving him many Professions that his present services had totally wiped away his preceding fault, one of those many Officers I had emploi'd amongst the prisoners to learn some intelligence of Atafernes , sent to speak with me in an anti- chamber, to whom I went hastily, and from whom I received information, that by a prisoner of quality he was assured that generous Prince had been taken alive, but much wounded, and yet not so dangerously, as to make the Chirurgeons despair of his recovery. Transported with this happy Newes I flew unto the King,  & acquainted him with it, who sending forthwith to the first informer of this joyful advertisement, and having received from him a full convincement of the certainty thereof, he told me; go Callimachus and stop the poor Statira's tears with this obliging assurance. This almost as obliging a command I hastned to obey, and having obteined the Princess's permission of waiting on her, I entered her Chamber, but did finde her so drown'd in sorrow, that for a while it made me forget my own grief, and that I was come with what would mitigate hers: but when I had found the uncivil cruelty of such a sympathizing, I told her; I was once, Madam, coming to implore the priviledge of mingling my tears with yours for our common Loss, and of lamenting, till I could revenge it: But now, Madam, I am come to tell you, that the Prince Atafernes hath not lost his life, but his liberty; which misfortune I hope by this time to morrow so to free him from, that you will have no trouble but in beholding of his, when he shall know those tears his Captivity has made you shed; and if he preferres not your satisfaction above his own, he cannot but believe his wounds and loss of Liberty a cheap price for discovering so high a friendship as thereby he experiments the Princess Statira honours him with; for my part, though I value him at the rate his vertues merit, yet if I can by restoring him to his Freedom give her as great a contentment, as the loss of it did give her a trouble, I shall hardly so much repine at his Fate, as I shall glory in my own. The Princess either did not, or would not hear my last words, but interrupting them, told me; Oh Gods! Callimachus , is it then possible that Atafernes is alive? or do you think my sorrow was so near sending me to bear him Company, that to deny that only remaining happiness you this way endeavour to suspend me from it now, and to morrow hope by repeated Victories I shall not finde room enough to entertain a killing grief in so general a cause of Joy? Madam (I reply'd) the Truth I have told you is as great as therefore my satisfaction is, and your generous Brother wants, I hope, but that Freedom which e're long he will enjoy; since Fortune which has honoured my Sword with some success when 'twas for your service, will not deny it the like when 'tis for your satisfaction. You have (said the Princess) done so much already for us, that I know not any thing which we may not expect from your Courage and Civility; and the next happiness to seeing my Brother at Liberty, is to receive an assurance of it from you; but yet Callimachus , have a care you give me as good an account of your self, as your promise; for your preservation will be as requisite for my satisfaction, as for the publique safety. Madam (I answered, transported with what she had spoken) till these glorious words, I never was acquainted with any thing which might flatter me into a belief that my preservation could be useful to the publicke, or as much as to my self; the Gods having kept me a stranger to my own extraction, and yet at the same time having given me a heart to aspire to what the sublimest only can legitimately pretend unto; Yes, Madam, I have such transcendent aimes, that I thought I could undertake nothing which was not inferiour to them, till the Gods destin'd me to your service, which goodness I must at the same instant acknowledge, and deplore; since for to make me useful to you, they have eclips'd the condition you were born unto, and have thought fit rather to diminish your greatness, that thereby I might become in some poor measure usefull to you, than continue it, wherby I should have been deny'd that honour; and since I finde by so unhoped for, yet obliging experiment, that such a manifestation is not indifferent unto them, nay rather than not evidence it, they have shaken the greatest Empire of the World, and troubled a Princess fit to be inthron'd in it; I shall no more doubt they will finish what they have begun, than I should rejoyce that my Opinion might have the honour to be yours; or if it be not, that you will pardon its being mine. All the while I was speaking, I was much more concern'd in Statira's looks than in what I spoke; for I could not but believe that a heart entirely hers, could be illegible to her, and therfore I was much more intent to know her sense of what was there, than to cloath that discovery in expressions fit for its self, or that admirable Person to whom it was made: Neither durst I, observing that more reserved look she put on when I began my discourse, conclude it in words of the same quality; but I so alter'd it, that the end might relish of the beginning, or of my great hopes of relieving her generous Brother: In which sense she seemed to receive what I had said, and therefore told me; Though the Gods have directly concealed from you what your extraction is, yet obliquely they seem to inform you of it; for by giving you such high aimes, you may thereby know your descent is not disproportionate: yet permit me to tell you that your designes of acquiring as great an Empire, as you preserve for Mithridates , is not to me so eminent a proof that your birth is high, as your so generously undertaking his quarrel against his Rebels, the relief of the oppressed being a clearer act of greatnesse, than winning of Kingdomes; this being most frequently the recompence of force, that being alway the illustration of vertue. But alas (she continued) would to the Gods I could believe the warres my father is plunged into, could be irrationally attributed to what you alledge: No, Callimachus , his own faults, and the crimes of his subjects are too visible, and great, to allow me any rise to ascribe our present confusions to any other cause; and if I have any hopes that they are sent only for our correction, not our ruine; 'tis that the Gods have sent us in our afflictions such a Friend, who doubtlesse would not have been permitted to have imploy'd his sword and conduct in a quarel designed to be unsuccesseful: Nor would those powers have so strangely preserved Ataphernes , but that every individual of this unfortunate family are destin'd to owe their safety unto you, that the Gods might not wholly destroy a house, in which possibly some unguilty persons are, and yet preserve it in such a way as might entirely silence any imaginations of their having acted towards that mercy: And it may be also to make those of it, in love with vertue, above power, when they shall experiment that the desart of an unknown person could more preserve them, than innumerable Armies too too empty thereof. I had not (continued Callimachus ) leisure enough to admire the excellent vertue, and resembling obligednesse of the faire Statira , nor indeed to pay by my acknowledgements any part of that vast debt, what she had said, had so justly engaged me unto; by reason the Princesse Roxana , and immediately after the Queen, came to congratulate with Mithridatia the happy news of Atafernes's being alive. Whilst the two sisters were entertaining one another, Monyma after some usual Discourses presenting me her hand, made me follow her to the farthest end of the chamber we were in, where having a while continued silent, she at length told me; I observe, Callimmachus , your carriage towards me has so much of indifferency in it, that it might justly provoke me to imitate you, which (doubtlesse) long agon I had done; were it not to convince you that in all things which entirely depend upon actings, I have an esteem for you uncapable of suppression, or as much as of diminution. Madam (I reply'd, strangely surprised at what she had spoke) I hope my carriage to you has relish'd of all sorts of respect due to your condition, and merit; if it has not, I humbly beg to be told my fault, that I may not onely repaire it, but also punish a crime so contrary to my duty and inclination. Your fault (the Queen reply'd, casting down her eyes and blushing) is better mended then told: but since you pretend to be ignorant, I shall finde out an opportunity not only to acquaint you with it, but also with what I am confident causes it. These words were scarce out of her mouth when she went away, and 'twas happy for me she did; for had she staid, she could not but have guessed by my disorders, what had occasion'd them: her last expression gave me so much feare, that I found my self too unfit to continue longer in the Princesses chamber, out of which I pretended to go, as a duty to the company there, having assured them, if the next day the enemy declin'd not the Battel, which I thought neither their condition nor courage would make them guilty of, I would leave no means unattempted to restore the Prince Atafernes to his liberty. After the civilities that promise did invite the Queen and Princesses to bestow upon me, I went to visit Craterus , whom I found more afflicted by his being unable to assist me in the intended Battel, than at those wounds which denied him that power, and me his help: from thence I went to Mithridates , who the nearer we grew to the execution of our designe, had the more aversenesse to it; but having again dissipated those cold apprehensions by words altogether Martial and promising, I retir'd towards the Camp, accompanied by all those Officers which then were in Nicomedia , resolving not to see that place again, till I were covered with Laurels, and till by eminent repeated services I might let the faire Statira see, I wanted not merit, but a sufficient quality to aspire unto the title of her servant. After, having given the requisite orders for the succeeding dayes businesse, I dismiss'd all men out of my Tent, but Demetrius , whom I order'd to imbelish my Armour with the richest stones I had, for designing to act remarkable things I was resolv'd to wear Armes which were so: And knowing that so signal an engagement could not but invite the Princesse to be a spectator of it, which from the Battelments of the Palace she might easily be, I thought my intended gallantry would be excusable; and I elected rather to be known to all my enemies, then not to be so to my Conquerour. All the night almost I entertained my selfe with the Capriciousnesse of my Fortune; by how rare an accident I had first seen Monyma ; and by a rarer lost her; how that to cure the reliques of that passion, I had elected a course of life which had cast me a greater; how Fortune seem'd to delight to engage me in love, by having enabled me to pay my two Mistresses higher services the first moment I saw them, than others could expect to performe in the whole course of their lives; And then that she was really more concern'd in making me unfortunate in it, having the first time perswaded me to pay my affection to a person from whose humour I could expect no success; and the last from whose quality I was to attend the like unhappinesse; how from nothing I was rais'd high enough to love, and not high enough to hope the reward of it; That if I prov'd successful in War, I should be no longer useful; and if unsuccessful, I could be no longer considerable; as also that if the War were protracted, the greatest glory of it would be lessened, even that of expedition; That the King of Cyprus was daily expected, whose Title and Power, joyn'd with the Authority of the Father, and the exact obedience of the Daughter, (whose principles I had but too resolutely been acquainted with, to allow me the least hope she would decline the practice of them) would soon involve me in infelicities as vast as those joyes which were to cause them. These and many other suggestions of as unpleasing a nature, my memory (conspiring with my fortune) represented to me in their liveliest colours, and would not so much as by sleep allow me an internal of rest, so that they were my constant and importunate Companions, till the day, and the military musick made them retire, and resigne their places to the thoughts of acquiring Victory, the possession or losse whereof some few houres would decide. The glory I possess'd in being the faire Statira's servant, and the glory I hoped that day to winne in being her brothers deliverer, so dissipated that melancholy the nights entertainment had infected me with, that when I began to draw out my Army, my looks so participated of my hopes, that my desire of successe could not therefore exceed the confidence my Souldiers had of it: And that which did yet more contribute to my hopes, was to see the Tarrase of the highest Tower in Nicomedia covered with Royal Pavilions, whereby I was satisfied Statira would honour us with her sight, whose influence could promise nothing lesse then Victory. But whilst the Mithridatick Army was drawing up in that forme I appointed, and the enemies were covering the opposite side of the plain with their divisions, an Officer from the head of one of those which was most advanced, came towards me, and turning the point of his Javelin to the earth in signe of friendship told me with a loud voice, that one of his Generals desired to speak with Callimachus between both Armies, and engaged his faith during the parly, and till his returne, nothing of violence should be offer'd, and that he intreated the like assurance. A compliance herein having a possibility of good, and a certainty of no hurt, I was advis'd to accept thereof by all the Officers which were neare me, whose opinions I more willingly followed, because of the passionate desire I had to learne the condition of the Prince Atafernes . I therefore told the Enemies Officer I would forthwith meet his General, for whose safety during the conference, and returne to his own Army after it, I engaged him my Faith. To which he (being told who I was) reply'd it was sufficient; and so return'd to the head of the Enemy's Army, from whence I saw a Gentleman advance single into the middle of the plaine, where immediately I met him, and where after, having lifted up the sights of our Helmets,  & performed all the civilities which are usual in such cases, he told me; If you now think it strange that I have desired a parly, when we are going to fight a Battel, possibly you may do so no longer, when I have told you I am Nicomedes King of Bithynia , that same Nicomedes , who owed principally to your Sword, and conduct, a naval Victory he obtained over Mithridates in the mouth of the Euxine sea; and that it is but even now I learnt you are that brave Callimachus , from whose courage I derived so signal an advantage; I must plainly confesse after this information, I could not but desire to expresse my trouble, both that you are engaged against me, and for him, who, to say no more, deserves not such a friend: But I come not now to Court you from him, I could not be worthy of your friendship if I now made you such a Request, neither could you be worthy of mine if you now granted it: all that I ask is, after this Battel, if the Gods make us outlive it, that you would take leave of him, and joyne your selfe to a quarel, which possibly deserves your embracing it; and to a Prince, who during his life will give you as large a share in his Fortunes, as he has already in his esteeme: This I hope will not be thought an immodest desire, since, as you once assur'd me, you are not Mithridates's Subject, and had too much cause to be his Enemy; and that you must fight to maintaine an usurper in the Throne, and to keep the Legitimate Princc out of it, who has not only a right thereunto by a lawful succession, but also even by the Pontick King's Treaty of peace with Scylla , and his reiterated engagements to Murena If the Gods too favour my Armes in this field, I hope I shall not need employ them to winne another, and though I should lose this day (which I have no cause to doubt, but your being my Enemy) I have yet so many powerful friends in Asia , nay the whole Roman Empire is so engaged in my quarel, that Mithridates to be quiet King of Bithynia , must be the like of the whole world. As soon as Nicomedes had done speaking, I reply'd: The honour I once had to do you a small service, is so nobly remembred, and paid, in what you formerly did, and now are generously pleas'd to offer, as well as in that high care you have of my reputation even when I am in Armes against you, that I hope you will conclude my confinements to Mithridates's service are not to be broken, since they continue firme after such powerful Assaults: Yes (great Prince) I take the Gods for witnesses, that your generosity will make me look upon successe with grief, and wish I had never worne a Sword, since it must be so unhappily employ'd. I can too with the like truth protest, if the now difference between the Pontick King, and you, were ended, that I would as freely hazard my life to restore you to your Kingdome, as now I will to preserve Mithridates from losing his: And though possibly his innocence towards you might not be perfect, yet I beg you, generous Nicomedes , to consider how unfit it would be for me to hear it accused; and let that consideration prevaile with you to send me away, with the sorrow of being compell'd to draw my Sword against a King, from whom I have received many obligations, and never any dissatisfaction; I say compell'd, and that too by causes so undisputable, that I must act what I do, though I were as fully convinc'd of the Justice of your quarel, as you your self are. After this Declaration, be pleased rather to pity then condemne my not accepting of your favour, and be confident I would not have said so much, but to one I perfectly honour, and to whom I am a servant in heart, though my hand may Act against that truth. This I spoke, being truly affected with the injustice I did to the King of Bithynia in opposing his undoubted right, and being as perfectly vanquish'd with his civilities. His answer too was so moving, and full of Obligation, that thereby I the more clearly discovered the height of my passion for the Princess Statira , which made me deaf to friendship, and justice, and resigne the power entirely even to a hopeless Love; but yet to a Love so glorious, and so charming, that not to have given it the precedency of all other considerations would have bin a greater Crime than to have done it. What need I tell you more (generous Princes) then that this conference ended with the high satisfaction and trouble of us both, the one to see we had such invitation to be friends, and the other that there was such an impossibility of becoming so. But before I took leave of the unhappy Nicomedes, I begg'd him to tell me what was become of Atafernes , to which he reply'd, if he were living, he was in the power of Murena's Souldiers, for he had been taken by the Roman Legionaries. This doubt rais'd in me so many fears, and troubles, that they were visible to the King of Bithynia , who therefore assured me, since he perceived I was concerned for him, he would thenceforth be the like. I payd him as many acknowledgements for that promise, as for all his other respects which he increased by telling me; Lest you may believe the denyal of your friendship to me, has supprest mine to you; permit me to tell you, your disorders at Atafernes danger, may be prejudicial to you; for I see our Army is ready to begin the Battail having Ariobarzanes and Murena to supply my absence, and that yours probably having none to supply yours, may sustain a prejudice, which this way I would not have it endure, werc it commanded by Mithridates himself, much less being 'tis by the brave Callimachus , whose refusal of my offers I cannot be offended at, since, by what he has told me, I must believe it springs from a cause to which not only a desired friendship has been inferiour, but even a formed one, and which I have experimented has been so prevalent with me, that I cannot be offended at its now being so against me. These words made me at once joyd, and confounded; this that he should know the truth of the thing (though not of the person) and that, that it had produced so obliging an effect. In brief we parted, and I believe as full of thoughts at what had past, as at what was to come, he galloping to the head of his Troops, as I did to the head of mine, where I gave all the chief Officers a Relation of Nicomedes desires to me, which only had occasioned and continued our conference, of which also I sent an account to the Pontick King, that he might have no cause to suspect my fidelity, which was tyed unto him by an Obligation, though secret, yet incorruptible. This being done, I forthwith sent every Commander to his respective place, and having in a short speech incited the Souldiers to manifest their courages for, and before their King, I commanded the signal of Battail to be given, and then the military Musick began to invite us to that glory which so Noble a Field was to present the Conquerour: never perhaps was there a Battail in which so many Kings, & of Royall blood were Actors, or Beholders; and never perhaps were Armies so brave, and glittering, as these. The King of Bithynia and the King of Cappadocia appeard in an Equipage, and with forces worthy their Titles and their hopes; and Murena manifested that the people of Rome were sometimes as exorbitant as the Asiaticks, which their pride or wisedom so much condemn'd. On the other side Mithridates Troopes which consisted (for the most part) of the young Nobility, and Gentry of his Dominions, which their honour, as much as his danger, had incited under his Ensignes, were so gallant and rich in their Furnitures, as were also all those Courtiers which shame or glory had drawn out of Nicomedia , that they look'd rather like going to triumph after a Victory, than to win one; Who even that morning had beheld the various multitudes of colours, the Winde and those which carryed them did wanton with; The glistering of Armes, and Swords, the vast Numbers of brave Horse, all seeming as impatient of delay as their very Riders; the variety of Nations and Habits, and their dictinct martial Countenances; the exact regularity every individual Battalion had within its self, and the perfect proportion all of them had with each other; whoever too had heard the neighing of the Horse, the shouts of the Souldiers, & the military instruments could not but have confess'd how deformed soever the face of War uses to appear, yet that day it had Charmes enow to have captivated even that Sex whose Nature is compos'd of pitty. I must acknowledge how greedy soever I was of a Victory, which I hoped might in some measure repair the unhappiness or ignorance of my Birth, yet I was so delighted with that Noble entertainment, and prospect, that it was with some reluctancy I put a period to it. The Enemies forces consisted (as I may say) of three Armies, and were commanded by Nicomedes, Ariobarzanes and Murena , out of all which Archilaus and Neoptolemus had a great body of Horse and Foot given them to leade, who acted so many high things that day, that had it been for their Countrey (as it was against it) their precedent guilt might have been thereby entirely defac'd. In imitation of the Enemies Order, I had divided my Army into three equal parts, having first chosen out a select number, as a general reserve to answer all emergencies: and because I was exceedingly over-powered in Foot, I placed behind every Battalion of my Foot, a Reserve of Horse to countenance and second them, which proved of no small use. Secretly, behinde the outwardmost divisions of our winges of Horse, I placed some of our best Archers , who when we were going to Charge, discovered themselves, and thereby not onely amazed, but so gall'd our Enemies with their Arrowes, that the wounded Horses by their disorders made sufficient breaches for us to enter at; This too did not a little help us; but that which did most, was this which I am now going to tell you; (for I never saw it practis'd before, and it was then of so great an advantage, that you will perhaps pardon my particularising of it, and possibly one day have occasion to make use of it; which if you have, I wish it may be as succesfull to the followers, as to the beginner of it.) I found when our Armies faced one another that the Enemy did much overwing us, and that possibly therefore he had neglected to secure his left Flank with a deep stream which ran some three furlongs from it, so that hee had so much of Champion ground on that wing, and had much more on the other. In our embattailing therefore I let him see how much he outwingd us on both sides; but when we moved to the Charge, I gave strict order to all my Army to shog still toward the Right-hand; so that by the time we came to mingle, we out-winged their Left Flank, as much as their Right wing out-winged our Left, and thereby in a great measure shared the inconveniences with them, which by their numbers they might have entirely cast upon us, if they had taken the advantage of the place in keeping the stream on their left Flank. I shall not trouble you in giving a minutes description of this day's action, 'tis enough you know, though the Mithridatians did behave themselves like men of honour, yet the Romas, [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17026001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE47D60&area=prose&forward=textsFT) led by Nicomedes (for Murena had been dangerously wounded, and was carryed off in the beginning of the fight, and all Nicomedes's Forces had been broken and dispers'd) so signally manifested their courages and kept their discipline, that I was twice reduced to our General Reserve, and to a Body of Foot which had been kept entire onely by the help and countenance of some Horse, which had been their reserve. That which had reduced us to this extreamity was not onely the fall of Megabizes (who though he lost his Life, yet he got a Reputation which was much more worth) but also the dangerous wounds which Lingarus received, who thereby was carryed out of the Field senseless, and speechless, yet accompanied with so many elogies, that none which was a Friend to honour, would have declin'd the bloody Rate, at which he had purchas'd his great Gods! what did I not think, and what did I not say, when I saw my self reduced to so sad an extremitie, to be worsted in Statira's quarrel, nay even in her sight; and thereby expose her to lose her own Liberty, whose beauties were capable to deprive all men of theirs? To presume to lift up my eyes to such a person, and be defeated at the head of such an Army; To have had success enough to give me such exalted hopes, and then from the height of them to precipitate me, were considerations too too sufficient to make me cast my self into the Arms of Death, to put a period unto them. I may truly say (generous Princess) that this despair made me act strange things, even worthy the fair Mithridatia's sight, and perhaps her commendation, which yet I even blush'd at, to finde that any motive could inspire my Arm, more, then the Noblest Passion for the Noblest Object. I kill'd in this fury Neoptolemus at the head of his Forces, and took Ariobarzanes in the Center of his, and by the help of Lingarus Son, who had rallied a Body of the young Bosphorian Nobility, I stopp'd the current of Nicomedes success, and thereby gave my own Forces time and opportunity to Rally, which they did, and with which we soon made our Friends see we were Conquerours, and our Enemies feel it. Never was there in such a number so horrid an execution, scarcely Nicomedes and Murena loaden with wounds, could recover a little Boat, which with much hazard carryed them to Archilaus's Fleet, where he himself soon after did arrive, cursing fortune which had given them such hopes, only to make their loss the more unsupportable. But amidst the blood and confusion of our Victory, I caus'd the Name of Atafernes to be ecchoed in all places, and by all Persons under my Command, promising high rewards to any which could bring me Newes of him, but finding those wayes unsuccesfull I sent severall partyes of Horse towards the Sea, presupposing when the Enemy had seen the probability of their defeat they might have sent him towards their Fleet, as the onely place to secure so considerable a prisoner in. And that nothing might be left unessay'd, and something acted according to my own minde, gallopped I my self away at the head of some Horse, to seek that generous Prince, for whose Freedom I had higher desires than for Victory. I was already come within sight of the Sea without discovering what I sought, and was even turning back when I perceived coming out of a small wood a Body of Horse, who bended their course towards a Gally which rode near the Shoar, but yet they marched so leasurely that I concluded in so general a Flight they carryed off some considerable person, whose then condition would not admit of a speedier motion. I therefore resolved to attempt them, and having sent some Horse to engage them and to retard their March, I came up at last with all those I had with me, and after some Resistance broke and defeated the Enemy: But, Oh Gods! what was my joy when I found in a Littor the Prince Atafernes alive? but so weak and changed with his wounds that 'twas some time before I knew him, and 'twas with much difficulty that he embraced me. This addition to the winning of the Battail, made me need but one desire more. With Atafernes I joyfully took up our way to the Camp, whither as we were going, he so signally owned the services I had payd him and his Family, and in such pressing words assur'd me they had nothing in their power above my merit, that thereby he flatter'd a despair, which his fair Sister could only suppress. He told me too that he owed his life to me, before I had this last time redeem'd it; for Murena enraged at his wounds,  & thinking the day would be lost, since those necessitated him to retire, had commanded his Souldiers to (whom I was a prisoner, and who then guarded me) that if they could not recover the Fleet before they were overtook, they should put me to Death; which (being once pursued) they were about to perform, when by accident Nicomedes in his flight passing by, not only hindred, but discharged those Romans of Murena , placed a Troope of Bithynians and Cappadocians about me, with order if they were overtook, or worsted, they should leave me untouch'd; and having acquainted me therewith, he added, 'twas for Callimachus sake who had desired his care of me. This generosity I was inform'd of with much satisfaction, and with no less trouble, to finde my Fate had destin'd me to be an Enemy to a Prince, who by many confinements merited my Service. We were no sooner arrived at the Camp, than the shoutes of Victory were drown'd in those Atafernes life, and Liberty, occasioned in the Souldiers, whose joyes yet had not a higher production, than a cause. 'Twas then I waited upon Ariobarzanes , where having pay'd him all the civilities due to his Title, and given him all those consolations due to his condition, I sent him to Mithridates , accompanied with the chief Officers of the Army. But to let you see the instability of the most promising earthly condition, as I was environed with some thousands of Conquerours, and in the embraces of a generous Prince, there came a young man of an excellent [![Cross Reference](images/xref.gif)](/searchFulltext.do?id=17026001&idType=xref&divLevel=0&trailId=15EDFE47D60&area=prose&forward=textsFT) Men, and in a Garb which shewed him to be of some quality, who desired to speak with me, promising a piece of intelligence worthy my knowledge. I must confess I trembled at it, fearing it might be some discovery where. Nicomedes was concealed, and therefore I would have put him off; but he so pressingly importun'd my attention, that in the end I gave it him, but instead of what he promised, he plung'd a Dagger into my breast up to the Handle, and would have doubled his stroke, but that I had strength enough left to force it out of his hand, and return his bloody present, at which he fell, and had only Life enough left to say, that he was Neoptolemus Son; and that since I had destroy'd his Father and family, having no other way to act his Revenge, he had chosen that, which he hoped his high wrongs and necessitated condition would apologize for. His immediate Death saved him from those torments the rage and grief of the Souldiers had design'd him; but such abundance of blood gushed out of my wound, that I soon after fell, and 'twas with much art and payn, that my wound was bound up. The generous Atafernes took me into his Littor; and the pallace in Nicomedia being the nearest place we could retire unto, we advanced thither. Never was there Triumph so sad as this, and never was there Laurel and Cypress so exactly mingled; the whole Army march'd by the Littor carrying the trophies of their success, and washing them with their tears; so that when the King, the Queen, and the Princesses, came to meet us at the Court-gate, to honour and share in the joy of our success, they found so many evincements of grief in all the Armies looks, that they knew not what to fear, and yet did fear every thing; the sadded Souldiers which marched in the first Ranks, gave so imperfect an account of what they were demanded, as did also all those which followed, that their eyes were their first  & truest- intelligencers; and though at the same time they saw Atafernes alive, and free, yet seeing me with so little life by him, and all disfigured with blood, it seem'd to chase away all their causes of satisfaction; and I found by as sad as high a proof, that my life was not inconsiderable to so many eminent persons, and above all, to that fair Princess to whose service I had devoted it: The shrieks she made when she saw me in so dangerous a case, drew me from that Dying-slumber I had bin in, and as soon as my eyes were open, they met with hers, which suddenly after wept such a deluge of tears, that had I not ascribed them al to her Noble Brother's condition, I had neither deplor'd my own, nor her grief. I would have forced my self to rise, but I found I could not; which she perceiving, forbad me any more attempts of that Nature; by which I had scarce strength enough humbly to acknowledge her care. This made them the more hasten up to the Prince's chamber, where he would have me Ly, causing another Bed to be set up. We were no sooner in a condition to receive a visit, than the two Princesses, and the King gave us one (a sudden indisposition of the Queen's then confining her from stirring out) who after he had spent some time with me in evincements of his satisfaction, for what I had done, and sorrow for what I was reduced to, and in kindnesses to his Son, he went immediately after to the Queen's appartment, out of which he seldome did use to stir, when any distemper tyed her unto it: The two Princesses stayed with Atafernes , who perhaps to oblige me (for I believe he then suspected my Passion) desired his favourite sister to entertain me, whilest he did the Princess Roxana . That admirable person did me therefore the honour to come near my Bed, and told me; I see, Callimachus , how deceitful and uncertain all humane things are; for had I known that this day you should have brought us home Victory, and Atafernes , I could not have believed there had been unhappiness enough left to have clouded our satisfaction; but your wounds and danger make it impossible at once to express gratitude, and joy. Madam, (I replyed) there can hardly be a higher evincement how unestimable most Wordly things deserve to be, than to see that so inconsiderable a persons condition should cloud and disturb yours; but, Madam, how sad soever it appears, I have yet sufficient cause to bless the Gods, which have given me life enough to deliver you from your Enemies, your Brother from his imprisonment, and to see you once more, to give you such an account of the honour of your Commands: And possibly now there would remain no addition to these happinesses, but that I left the World, lest the future actions of my life might be inferiour to these, and consequently more unfit for you to receive, or me to pay. The Actions you have perform'd (the Princess replyed) in a few dayes, are so signal and eminent, that upon the glory of that stock you may spend a longer life, than your condition or courage will (I fear) lend you; and though in the future you should never more oblige us, what you have done already has left such deep impressions in me, that I must lose my memory to lose the sense I have of them; your favours being of the like quality with Life, which needs not still be renewed, it's first principle being so powerful, that it still carries it self on in the strength and vigour thereof. Madam, I answered, by so telling me of what I have done, you tell me what I should have done, had my power of serving you proportioned my desire of it; and though you could flatter me into a belief that you are so good as to credit what you say, yet that Rule I have set up to my self in serving you, does so far transcend all you have spoke, that whilest I do any thing short of what may be done, and whilst I ever intermit acting at that Rate, I am such a reproach unto my self, that my dissatisfaction surpasses what ever you can imagine of it. At the end of these words Mithridates came hastily into the chamber, with what did more wound me than the young Neoptolemus Sword; 'twas with Newes that the King of Cyprus with a vast Fleet, appeared before the Harbour, and had sent some of his Nobility to advertise him thereof, and to beg his permission to land, that he might offer his Forces to him, and his service to the Princess Statira . Oh Gods! continued Callimachus , how great a torment this was, you only know, and I only did feel; 'twas such, that before I could be master over my own motions, I sighed so loud, that the Princess not only took notice of it, but had the goodnesse to enquire what had caus'd it: I was a thousand times going to tell her the truth, and then in a Sea of blood to have expiated the confidence of that discovery, as well as to have avoyded that indignation it could not but have raised in her; but then the Majesty which shined in her eyes, which could not inspire me with higher admiration, than it did with Reverence and Respect, stifled those thoughts even in their Birth, and rendred them guilty only in designe, not in act. But I was then as much troubled what to say, as I had been what not to say, and finding no better expedient than to attribute it to the payn of my wound, I made use of that, whereat she assumed so high a grief, that I perswaded my self she could not then entertain any other guest. Mithridates observing the visible sadness in the Princess's eyes and looks, came towards her and ask'd her, what could in such general causes of joy make her express so little of it? to which she replyed, whilest the recovery of her Brother's wounds was so uncertain, and mine so dangerous, the dictates of Nature and Gratitude would sufficiently apologize for her sorrow. The King answered, there is so little fear for the one, and so much glory in the other, that I must not only desire but expect, that you will divest your self of whatever may render you unlike that Statira , whose shadow has conquered the King of Cyprus . The Princess made no reply, but by bowing her selfseemed to say she had too long practis'd obedience, then to decline it. The King at least (I believe) placed that interpretation upon what she had done, for he suddenly after went to the Port to receive his designed Son-in- law, who made so magnifick a descent from his Fleet, that all concluded he could not be less than a King, and a Lover. In the mean while, the fair Statira continued alone in Atafernes Chamber, her Sister after Mithridates was gone returning to Monyma , who otherwise had been left unaccompanied. That generous Prince who perfectly lov'd her, beginning then to consider that to be Ascanius's (for so the Cyprian King was called) he must be deprived of her, told her; would to the Gods, Statira ; you did not consider duty above friendship, for then I might be certain to enjoy your Company whilest I enjoy'd my life; but now a Fathers power will give that happiness to a Stranger, which otherwise I should have possess'd; and that affection I have for you, must endure an absence which cannot more bless him, than it will trouble me. These words he spoke so loud, that I not only heard them, but also that she thus answer'd him; If it were lawful to break those Tyes the Gods have confined us unto, the King of Cyprus should have been exempted from giving both himself and me this trouble; but since the violating a Divine Rule cannot bring a satisfaction so great, as the sin is, I shall strive to evidence as little discontent in obeying Mithridates , as I am certain I should have known if he had commanded me not to receive any addresses, which are to banish me from Atafernes , in whose affection and company I finde so high a contentment, that I am capable of begging no higher than to be continued in it: since, reply'd the Prince, you are devoted to that obedience, ah that Callimachus were King of Cyprus , I could then finde some consolation in my loss, and without reluctancy part with my best happiness, to him I esteemed best worthy of it: Blush not Statira , at what I have spoke, for since I am unable any way to evince my friendship in Actions, deny me not the priviledge of doing it in wishes. This (continued Callimachus ) was so strange and unexpected an expression, and consequently had so universal an operation on me, that my wound gush'd out a bleeding, and thereby so entirely conquer'd those few spirits I had left, that casting open my Armes and fetching a deep groan, I fell into a swound. The Princess was not so confounded at what her Brother had spoke, but that she had heard my last manifestation of life; so that turning her eyes towards me, she saw my condition, and therefore shrieking out, she went hastily into the Antichamber, and called in all the servants which waited there, by whose help I was soon brought to my self again, and the Chirurgeons which some ran for, having bound up my wound, desired all persons to leave the roome, left I might repeat the like sad accident; Statira , who possibly was glad of such a pretence, civily to decline her Brothers company, whilest he was addicted to discourses of that Nature, having first desired me to take a special care of my self, which the more powerfully to invite me to, she told me she should receive it as an Obligation, immediately withdrew, and left me to contend with difficulties too strong for me, though I had not been reduced to a weakness, which for the many causes I had to despair, I rather wish'd were greater, than less. Atafernes , not to oppose the prescriptions the Chirurgions had made, continuing silent, thereby gave me the uninterrupted leave of entertaining my own thoughts which were so confused, that for a while I could not reduce them to any method, but as soon as I had in some degree compos'd them, I began to consider that Fortune continued her usual practise, and by mingling felicities, and torments, gave me still at once cause to adore, and hate her: The glories which the beginning of that day had thrown upon me, and the miseries which the conclusion of it had involved me in, appear'd so admirable, that though I enjoyed those, and felt these, yet I could hardly believe either: but when I began to consider that all my Victories made but an easier way for my Rival to possess Statira , that the nearer I had acted to deserve her made my deprivation of her the more sensible, and when that by a miracle her generous Brother had let fall expressions whereby without a crime I might in some measure have disclos'd what her thoughts were towards me before she had pass'd any engagement to Ascanius , or have found so much cause of despair as I might no longer have flatter'd my self into a suspence more unsupportable than the highest effect of it; then to fall into a fainting which had hinder'd it; I could no longer contein my self, but by loud exclaimings condemn'd that Fate, which I wanted power to prevent or alter. Atafernes finding thereby that his silence was so far from contributing to my good, that he apprehended it had done the contrary, soon broke it, and after some introductory discourses, having first commanded all those which in the outward chamber might have been within hearing, to keep at a greater distance, told me; That friendship Callimachus which we have contracted, merits we should have nothing in reserve to each other, and if it does not confine you to tell me all the secrets you know, yet at least it does to acquaint me with the truth of those I shall discover; In a word, either my observations have strangely deluded me; or you have something in your breast, which though I may be concern'd in, yet I am kept a Stranger unto; and though possibly I might hitherto have had but cause to suspect it, yet what these few hours has produced, makes me confident of it; so that if any thing can perswade me to excuse your so long silence, it will be your persevering in it no longer. You cannot but imagine (generous Princess) that what Atafernes then spoke, made me repeat as high emotions as any that day I had been invaded with; for I found my self necessitated either to deny the truth, and thereby become guilty to my Friend; or reveal it, and thereby become guilty to my Princess; but at length, finding to adore her could not be a greater duty, than to conceal any thing from her Noble Brother, and be a crime, especially, hee then extorting a confession from me by the powerfullest Rack, the conjuration of a Friend, blushing and trembling all-over, and fetching a deep sigh, I spoke to him to this effect: If, generous Prince, I have concealed any thing from you, it is that only which I thought unfit I my self should know; and I was too much concern'd to continue the blessing of your esteem, to acquaint you with what might too justly invite you to deprive me of it: but since what I am to say is a pure effect of my obedience to your command, I do with the less trouble lay my Secret before you, knowing you are too vertuous to require a discovery, and then abhor me for making it. Here I paus'd a little, being startled at what I was about to say, but finding I had said so much, that not to speak more might be as ill resented as if I spoke all, I thus continued; I must confess, great Prince, I must confess the beauties of your admirable Sister gave me the confidence of lifting up my eyes towards her, or rather denyed me the possibility of doing otherwise; and ever since I first beheld her, I have languished away in flames which only her eyes are able to kindle, and which death only is able to quench; 'tis therefore that long since I had embraced that cure, had I not thought I was obliged as much to be just to her, in punishing my sin, as I had been to her beauties, in committing it; and therefore not to put a period to my torments was too much a duty, to let the ease of ending it perswade me to so criminal an Act: this, great Prince, hath hitherto to kept me from laying violent hands upon my self, and perhaps I might not ly if I assur'd you, I have had as high a dispute, not to embrace that remedy, as I have had to avoyd that presumption which will render it necessary. This is that concealement I have so long labour'd under, and if now I have discovered it, permit me to say it springs from a friendship as great as my passion; and nothing inferiour unto that, could have made me discover this. Now you know my miserable condition, be not I beseech you so cruel as to deny me your pity, if you do your pardon. After I had done speaking, Atafernes was some time before he answer'd me, but at last he thus spoke; If I have been so long silent, 'tis not that I am surpris'd with what you have now say'd, for I consider it rather as a confirmation of what I formerly thought, than a disclosure of what I was ignorant of, but yet I see so infinite a distance between what you aim at, and what possibly I wish you may possess, that I do not only believe your unhappiness is great, but also I highly sympathize with you in it. Statira's disposition, Mithridates's authority and engagement, Ascanius's passion and presence, joyned with the ignorance of your extraction, are difficulties so insuperable, that to assure you of all my assistance is to promise you at once what ever I am capable of, and yet nothing: But yet not to leave any thing unessay'd, and to let you see I am your Friend in impossibilities, as well as in things of hope, I will not only let her know your passion, but employ all my interest in her, to make her approve and accept it. I will tell her, that the Sword which has captivated Kings, will present her with Kingdomes; that vertue is preferrable to power; and that being more a friend to her happiness, than her Titles, I will conjure her to elect Callimachus without a Crown, sooner than Ascanius with one. This, dear Callimachus , is all I can do, and this therefore is the least I will do; wherein if the success answers not my endeavours, be confident I shall resent as vast a trouble thereat as you your self can, and where my power cannot serve you, my friendship shall suffer with you. Generous Prince (I replyed, bowing my self as low as my wounds would admit) you have already manifested so much obligingness and condescention to me, that I finde my scores of gratitude are as unpayable to the Brother, as those of adoration are to the Sister: you have done so much in the best extream, that nothing but my acceptance thereof could make me do the like in the worst. But, Sir, I have not told you my secret to invite your assistance, but to illustrate my obedience; and if I expect your favour in any thing, 'tis in your pardon, not your solicitation; which later yet I cannot more want, than I desire the former. No, Sir, though my starres have destin'd me to a passion for the Princess without hope, yet it is not without satisfaction, and what I should not patiently undergo as their imposition, I shall as her due. Possibly (said Atafernes interrupting me) you cannot think this discourse fitter for you, than I do, that acting the contrary is so for me; and therefore as I do not quarrel with you for making such desires, so I shall expect you will not be offended with me, if I grant them not: Mithridates owes her unto you, and she owes her self unto you, and though you have not a Kingdome to give her, yet this day you have given her Father one, and preserved him another, whereby you have made his condition such, that he need not find that a want in you. Doubtlesse he would have given you Statira this morning to have been certain of what you have placed him in this Evening; therefore why should you despair he would buy success at a higher Rate than he will reward it? for my Fathers promises to the King of Cyprus , they were made but to engage him to undertake that which you have performed without him, and thereby not only removed the invitation to that performance, but secured Mithridates against the Cyprians resentment at it, should he have any: besides our new Lover may be perswaded to lay aside that Title, by Statira's appearing averse unto it, which if the King once give her a Rise to do, let it be my care to improve it to that height your condition will need, and my friendship will therefore undeniably endeavour: it is not a new thing for a Lover to fail of his Mistress's affection, nor for a Father in that case to decline making his Daughter miserable, to prevent a strangers becoming so. He will more secure his Empire, and probably enlarge it in tying you by his alliance to his service, than by giving his Daughter to any Neighbour Prince; the doing the like is an action so common, that it seldome produces an effect which is extraordinary; but the bestowing of Statira upon Callimachus , will not appear more rare to the World, than 'twill prove advantagious to him; for what returnes may not be expected, when the largest cause of gratitude, is placed upon a person the most replenish'd with it; and to whom the Gods have given so much vertue and courage, that thereby his power of being thankful, wil equal his will. As for Statira , I strangely mistake, if she will not prefer him who deserves a Crown, before him that only weares one, and when I shall acquaint her with your passion for her, and my friendship for you, possibly if the one does not move, the other may; and the just ascendent she hath over Mithridates , may prevail with him to free her from Ascanius ; and your repeated services may in time force him to believe no Reward under her deserves that Name; so that when it comes in competition, whether he must do nothing, or so much, he will rather elect This, than that. Ah Sir! I replyed; do not I beseech you, so much as mention acquainting the fair Statira with my flame: I am scarce able to undergo my own knowledge of it, and therefore shall never be able to support hers: your pardoning my crime is so much above my desert; and your offering to attempt to reward it, is so much above my hope, that I cannot be that gratefull person you were pleased to speak me; if I did not hinder your undertaking a designe which must lose you, your Father and your Sister, and that too upon my account: No, generous Prince, let not my passion make any other unhappy, nor give me so low an opinion of my offence, as to finde by such an experiment, as great a misery as it self can befall me by it. My afflictions will either be supportable, and then they will not need your care; or unsupportable, and then my death will render me uncapable of it. Do not, I beg you, believe I do this out of a modestie which none could want that had so many pregnant causes to raise it, but out of conviction that I am tied in duty when she knowes I have done her the highest injury out of my power, to do her also the highest Right is in my power to present her; to dare to have said I love her is That, and to dare to kill my self afterwards is This; so that if you would not have me punish my self, now I have accused my self, let that be a secret to you, which shall be one besides to all the World. Many such implorings, continued Callimachus , I was forced to make, and many such reasons to present to his consideration, before I could extort that promise from him which I had so passionately desired, which soon after I had obteyned, a Gentleman came to tell us the Cyprian King was entered the Palace, and was gone to wait upon the Queen and the Princesses; and not long after Mithridates accompanied with Ascanius came to visit Atafernes . Gods! what agitations was I exercised under, when I not only saw my Rival come into the chamber, but found him a person of an admirable good mean, and of a fashion not inferiour: I must acknowledge I was so mean, as then to hope I might discover in his discourse what might have secur'd those fears his out-side had raised in me; but it was but just I should be defeated of so low and unworthie a hope, and so I was; for I found in what he spoke to the Prince, he was as much beholding to Nature, and education, for the guifts of his minde, as he had been to either, for those of his Bodie. After his civilities were performed to Atafernes , the King told him; This roome, Sir, containes a person worthie your knowledge, and by whose courage and success you have enjoy'd so peaceably an entrie here. The merits of Callimachus (said Ascanius ) are so well known to me though his person be not, that though the motives be very high which make me desire his friendship, yet they cannot exceed the passion I have to acquire, or merit it. After these words he saluted me with so much obligingness, and with so good grace, that in spight of all the causes I had to abhor him, I could not abstain from giving him a Reply, that relish'd of that civilitie which had acted over my resentments such a Conquest. After many discourses of an usual quality, Mithridates took a Rise to inform him by retail, of al those transactions which had hapned so recently within and near Nicomedia , and did it with such elogies in my favour, that Ascanius cryed out; Happy Callimachus! that not only perform'd the highest things, but acted them for and before the persons most worthie of them: would to the Gods I had by all my blood purchas'd that glory, which has cost you but a part of yours. Mithridates , who found by this ardent ejaculation, that the subject of his discourse had rather rais'd Ascanius envie, than satisfaction, by degrees disintangled himself out of what he had so far engaged in, and then conducted him to his apartment where all things relish'd of the highest Luxurie Asia was never guiltie of, or the profusest Actor of it, ever practis'd. He was not long gone, when the Queen (then recovered of her indisposition) with the two Princesses came to visit Atafernes , who earnestly enquiring how he made his first addresses, received an assurance from both those which were least concerned in it, that never man had in such an occasion, acquitted himself with so much gallantrie: His humilitie to Statira was at once full of deep respect, and of Majestie, as if thereby he would shew, to be a King, and her Slave, were not inconsistent, but rather that this Title did help to heighten that; his looks had in them at once so much passion mingled with reverence, that either seemed to be as uncapable of addition, as change; and his discourse, and entertainment had peculiar charmes, so that in effect there were hardly any of the senses which found not in him, sufficient to captitate them. These, and many other expressions as wounding to me, fell from Monyma and Roxana which the obliging Atafernes easily guest, and therefore made the more hast to put a period to them; which when he had done, the Queen leaving her two Companions with their Brother, came to me, and observing they were probably engaged in a discourse with him, which might not suddenly interrupt hers with me, she began it in these words, If at your return with so much glory, I did not come to congratulate it with you, I may truly say you are the cause thereof, for when I saw the bloody rate of your purchase, a sudden horrour so invaded me, that till now, I could not free my self from so many of its effects, as to be able to visit you, and to let you know why I did not so, sooner. Madam, I replyed, that little blood I have spent in your service, is too prodigally payd, by what you now are pleased to act, & speak; and had I known my wounds had so sensibly touch'd you, they would have been more painfull to me upon that account than their own. I should (she answered blushing) have believed those words, had they been spoken to me at Miletus , or were I a person not far from hence, who though I must confess merits them better, yet perhaps would not receive them with that satisfaction, I should if I thought them not words of civilitie, rather than Truth. Madam, I replyed, (being somewhat moved to be still struck by her in so sensible a place and if possibly, to make her think she was mistook) permit me to say that had you never given me cause any more to doubt your words, than I have given you to doubt mine; you had been free from the Trouble of such discourses, and I from the unhappiness of your believing I deserved them. Alas Callimachus (said she, interrupting me) why do you delight so much to torment me, as not only to mind me of my unhappiness, but to acquaint me you think I was the Author of it: No, I attest the Gods, I would now, even with joy descend from the Throne, to be that to you, which I am to Mithridates , & rather be his who deserves the greatest Empire of the World, than his, who possesses it: but (she continued letting some few tears steal from her eyes,) since the Gods have otherwise designed it, I beg but this, That you will esteem it a punishment sufficient for me to have lost you, & do not augment it so much as to let me see another has got you; this is all the unfortunate Monyma desires; and if there be any unreasonableness therein, ascribe it to a passion which makes me act more illegitimate things for you, than I ask of you. She went away at the end of these words without staying for an answer, and telling the company a relapse of her indisposition was going to assault her, she hastily retir'd to her apartment; and not long after the hour of rest being come, Atafernes enjoyning me to try if I could take any, and endeavouring the like himself, thereby gave me a licence to reflect upon some things past, which so powerfully entertained my thoughts, that I could not for some time so much suppress them as by sleep to enjoy that refreshment, my mind and my body but too much wanted. These last words of the Queen, I soon concluded, sprang from a passion which would not be easily quenched, and which had a being would so much interrupt any progress in that I payd the fair Statira , that it self would have been a sufficient impediment, had I conquerd the misfortune of many greater. I was too proud at my insensibilitie when I saw a Queen weeping before me, and one so full of youth, and beauty, that she could not be a greater wonder for her charmes, than I was in resisting them. I must confess I was a little grieved, that so signal an evincement of my constancy should not be known to her who was the cause of it; but then when I considered that the misfortune could not be greater, then consequently the merit of it was, I concluded she deserved all I could suffer, and therefore I had more cause to rejoyce I had done so much, than to be troubled that she knew no more. Whilest I entertain'd these parts of my fate, it was only with sorrow, but when I thought upon those parts which related to Ascanius , how he was come to rob me of my hopes, which was all I had left, or indeed ever had,  & how a few dayes would invest him in that felicity I was to lose, Rage and Resentment so entirely govern'd all my faculties, that if I did not follow the extreamest dictates of them, 'twas only because I thought them too low and disproportionate to their cause. At last not having strength enough to persevere in such entertainments, sleep by degrees began to conquer me, and held me a prisoner for some few houres, which yet it could not have so long done, but by letting Dreams continue what my waking had begun, whereby, and by the emotion of the precedent day, the next morning I found my Wound was so inflamed, and my Body so feaverish that the Chirurgeons doubted of my Life, and informed Atafernes so much, who easily imagining the cause, having freed the room of all which waited in it, told me so many flattering things, and then so reiterately vowed if I mended not he would tell Statira what caused my languishments, that partly through hope, but much more for fear of that, I began patiently to receive those Medicines which the Physicians and the Chirurgeons prescrib'd, whereby in few dayes I was past all danger of Death, as I wish'd I had been of Life. I knew not with what designe I liv'd, and yet I could not oppose my doing so, carryed on by an internal motion, whose cause I was as ignorant of, as unable to resist its effects. Mithridatia every day she visited her Brother had so much humility as to enquire of me of my own health, and as my answers were of its impairing or mending, so her looks put on melancholy or satisfaction. Atafernes was so generous as constantly to enquire of the Princess what progress Ascanius had made in the acquisition of her esteem, yet could never learn any thing from her, but that her dutie to Mithridates had left her nothing but obedience. This strange perseverance and submissiveness that generous Prince acquainted me with, and thereby prepared me to receive a stroak, which soon after wounded me, but alas! not enough to relieve my pain, but increase and continue it. 'Twas with the fatal Newes that at the expiration of fourteen dayes Mithridates had publickely declared, the Nuptials between Statira and Ascanius should be celebrated; who thereupoo sent half of his Fleet into the Euxine Sea, to conquer what that Element had saved of Nicomedes, Ariobarzanes , and Murena's ruins: The revolt of Archilaus and Neoptolemus having depriv'd the Pontick King of most of his Navall-forces, and his design'd Son-in-law's being so strong, that he rather thought that proportion of the largest than the least; reserving also the residue to carry back his Queen with more pompe into Cyprus , which happy Countrie had been once destin'd to the Queen of Love, and now to a beautie which more justly merited that Title. In the mean while Pharnaces returned with his Army, more troubled that his Father had by Atafernes received his deliverance than if he had entirely failed of it, and if he had any thoughts which refresh'd him, they were only those which did rise from the speedy probabilitie of Statira's removal, and consequently of his Brother's being thereby deprived of his powerfullest friend; and therefore he so incessantly prest the speedy celebration of the Nuptials, that thereby he gained as high an interest in Ascanius as a performance so acceptable to an impatient Lover could possibly procure. At last the eve of the long'd for day arrived, and now nothing was seen but preparatives for celebrating of it, which was to produce the highest extreames in the Cyprian King and me. The Armyes had received orders to express their Military joyes in all those wayes wich could give the highest evidence of them; the Streets were already beautified with triumphal Arches; The Courtiers did all strive who should out-shine each other; The Priests had prepared heards of sacrifices; And in a word, all things had put on their chearfullest looks, but Statira, Atafernes , and I, the first continuing that same equal temper which had been so long her practise that I fear'd it was turn'd her Nature; the second sympathising in his Friends sorrows, wore them so visibly that they were at once both my comfort and my trouble; the third you may too too easily imagine had such infinite causes of grief that their effects were proportionate. Had it been the hour of my death which was come so near me as the hour of losing Statira , I should have consider'd it with much less trouble. Sometimes I resolv'd to go and tell her I ador'd her, with a passion which could much rather make me elect the Grave, than to see her Ascanius's ; and though I was able to live and not possess her, yet I was unable to live and see another do it, and then act that truth as well as speak it; sometimes I resolved to let the Cyprian King know how absolutely impossible it was for him to enjoy Statira , and I my life, and therefore that he must deprive me of This to possesse That, and thereby either avoid being sensible of my loss, or hinder him from acting it: sometimes too I thought of going to Mithridates , of laying my services before him, and of acquainting him Ascanius had never acted, but what all men living would, adored the highest beauty and desired to enjoy her; that my Sword had put him past the needing such a Friend, or at lest the buying him at such a Rate; that if he would make her the blessing of my services, I would engage to carry his Ensignes where the Roman Eagles yet could never fly, and seat her in a Throne as little unworthy of her as the Earth could produce; that as soon as Mithridatia's beauty was as well known to the World as to Ascanius , all the Kings of it would do more for hope of that Reward than Ascanius could do for possessing it: sometimes too I was determin'd to present my self to those Forces to whom I had so often shewed the way to Victory, and by disclosing my despair have provoked their Swords to have cured it. These and many as extravagant thoughts were the productions of my distemper, which when a little consideration had let me see they were, I cast them off as such. But though my Reason shew'd me what I was not to do, yet it could not what I was to do, so that when the Night came, the last Night of all my hopes, I was as unresolved what to do, as I was certain, doing nothing, what I was to suffer. I had some little glimpse of comfort to feel I was not able to go to the Temple, and be a looker on, lest thereby I might have been snatch'd from my self, and forced into a Revenge, which I had so long endeavoured to reason (at least perswade) my self out of; but this appearing only a hindering of me from doing ill, and not any thing of advancement in my doing well, I had as little time to reflect upon it, as I have spent in telling it. The generous Atafernes did scarce abandon me one moment, knowing my condition needed all the consolation, though it was above all service of a Friend. The Night was not an hour old, when Ascanius leading in Statira came into Atafernes Chamber, which bare sight had near overthrown all the sober thoughts of the preceding day, but they stay'd not long, Mithridates carrying them away to see some fires of joy the Nicomedians had made to grace the Eve of the intended Marriage: some two hours after, Atafernes and I, having disengag'd our selves from our many Visitors, went to try if we could walk in a Gallery contiguous to his Bed- chamber, where we had not long been, when Statira and Roxana came into it to visit their Brother having miss'd him in his Chamber. That obliging Prince so dexterously managed the business that he got his elder Sister to him at one end of the Gallery, and left me with my Princess at the other. I thought this was an opportunity not to be lost, and yet could not imagine how it might be improved, but to begin a discourse which might give me the opportunity to say something if by a miracle I should finde a Rise for my so doing: I told her you are now (Madam) going to place Ascanius in a felicity so great, that if thereby you could place your self in a resembling one, you would not leave your Servants any thing to wish, or your self to desire. I know not (she replyed) whether my satisfaction will be great, I am certain my obedience is: but acting what lyes on my part, I shall have this comfort, that if the end answers not my expectation, I may condemn my fate, but not my self. Ah Madam! I answer'd, permit me to believe you go upon a clearer principle than you mention, for else what comfort can it be to you if Ascanius should not still be as much your Servant and Adorer, as he is now to know your mis- fortune is an effect of your vertue, and that your obedience which you so highly magnify should make you more miserable than the declining of it could possibly have done? No Madam, I cannot but believe, if it were fit for me to beg a knowledge of the Truth, or that you should condescend so low as to speak it, but that the Charmes of Ascanius person and conversation contribute as much to his happiness, as your obedience to Mithridates . You make me blush (the Princess reply'd passing her hand before her Face) but yet if you are not seemingly but really concern'd in what you say, I will satisfy your doubts. Concern'd Madam, I hastily answered; yes Madam I am concern'd, and shall be whilest I live in all things relating to you: and therefore, Madam, permit me to beg of you a certainty of that upon which I must ground all my felicity or trouble, because by it I must judge of yours. Then, said Statira , I do assure you it as a real truth, that nothing renders Ascanius more acceptable to me than Mithridates commands, and possibly I should not ly if I said nothing else; but then I tell you as great a truth when I say, that that it self is more powerful with me than any thing which can flow from my own inclinations, for I know by observing those I may erre, but by observing that I cannot. For as to what you mentioned, that it would add unto my trouble to consider that my vertue occasioned it; I answer, it would much more afflict me to avoyd an evil by an evil, than to endure an evil for having done what was good, for the event is only in the power of the Gods, but the performance of duty is in my own. Never, continued Callimachus , never did any words at once so much care and so much wound as these, and never was any confidence higher rewarded and higher punished, than mine, which asking such a question received such an answer. But, not to appear too much surprised at what she had last said, I replied; I have heard, Fortune delights to make some men perfectly happy, and some as perfectly miserable; which last I have, and do experiment, and the first you have now justified in Ascanius , for nothing could cloud his felicity, but to know, your obedience only does invest him in it, and that he is as unlikely to know, as not knowing it he is unlikely to think any happiness is equal to his; or indeed if he knew it, it might still leave him in that condition, for what you say would not be highly considerable, when what you do is so infinitely so: Nor Madam, will I presume to argue in the future against your obediece since I feel you are so unchangably fix'd upon it, and so far engaged in it, that though I might convince your Reason, I should not be able to change your Resolution; Pardon me, Madam, if I have made use of an expression, which, had been too arrogant had I spoke it upon my own score, and may be pardonable from so great a goodness as yours, it being spoken on your generous Brother's, who will not only by your Marriage be deprived of his powerfullest supporter, even when Pharnaces anger will most need your continuing such, but also tear you from him, whom he as certainly values above all things, as you merit to be so, And if, Madam, after what I have said I may be permitted to mention any thing so low and inconsiderable, as my own contentment, excuse me if I say, after you are Queen of Cyprus , I shall never expect to see any, the sadness that Title will involve your Noble Brother in, were there no other consideration, will strike me with a grief I should much rather elect to dy by than to live under. This, generous Princes, (continued Callimachus ) was all I did say, and indeed all I durst; and I had more reason to think I had spoke too much than too little, when I heard her thus answer; would to the Gods, Callimachus ; I had miss'd this last discourse with you, for it hath left so deep an impression in me, that I can hardly hope it will ever be defaced. I confess I tremble when I think upon Pharnaces humour, and how naked Atafernes will be left when I am removed at a distance, unable to do him those services, my interest in my Father gave me hitherto power to pay him. I cannot too without horror reflect upon my eternal separation from that poor Prince, in whose society and friendship I have enjoyd a happiness I must despair of finding in all things else: I must also confess I resent no little trouble at my being to be banished from Callimachus , who has placed on me so many indelible obligations, and in whom without flattery I have found such eminent and singular worth, that I know nothing he could wish that I do not wish him: nay I attest the Gods, had they made me the Distributor of their Rewards, I would joyfully have placed him in what ever he ambitions, and that without any reservation: this, generous Callimachus , is all my unhappy condition makes me able to do for you, and therefore I hope will be accepted of by you. Madam I replied, prostrating my self at her Feet (which I the boldlier did, because I saw Roxana and Atafernes had their Backs toward us, and were looking out of a window) what you are, and what you say, makes me attest the self-same Gods as my witnesses, that had I by Birth or vertue possessed all the Empires of the World, I would have lay'd all them and my self at your Feet, and have more gloried in doing that, than in commanding them: But since the Gods have concealed from me my Birth, and given me only a Sword to raise my self with, whereby I am unable to act any thing worth your acceptance, permit me at least to say, what my performances should have said for me; that never, never was there any passion like to that I have for your service, and never any life could be so nobly emploi'd and ended as I should think mine would be were it to be spent and were I to dy therein, nor would I ever desire a higher recompence for doing so, then I should receive in doing so: possibly Madam studying too much for what I should say, I minde not well what I say, and therein may have offended; by which you may in some measure judge what an unfortunate person I am, that even for those expressions by which I would deserve your favour, I must absolutely need it. But (Madam) will you pardon me, if I am forced to ask you if you do not think there is as just a debt due to a Friend that is also a Brother, as to a Father; and whether you have endeavoured all you can to pay that before you engage your self too positively to pay this. I know (Madam) I could scarce be guilty of this confidence, nor were it indeed pardonable, but upon the score of the Prince Atafernes , whose contentment you have so often recommended to my care, that I had rather trouble you in obeying that command, than avoid doing it by so criminal a silence. The fair Statira having first commanded and made me to rise, told me, Your care for my Brother which I have so often recommended to you, is so much my desire, and has been so much my satisfaction, that I cannot condemn any production of it, though this does both violate what you even now promised, and encreases a grief which is of it self alreadie but too unsupportable; and therefore I will not scruple to assure you, that in the sense of my being to be banished from Atafernes, I have been so importunate with Mithridates to free me from Ascanius addresses, that you cannot think me so religious a worshipper of obedience, as I fear he does the contrary. Let this truth therefore which I have now spoke, and which I am resolved never to speak again, or ever thought to disclose, be sufficient to absolve me in your judgement, and henceforwards do not condemn, but pity an unfortunate person, who having tried all just wayes to avoid being so, has at last elected to submit to a fate, which she cannot decline, but by what would render her too worthy of it. Here (said Callimachus ) that admirable equalitie which this fair Princess had so unintermissively practised, was overcome by some tears which the end of her discourse drew from her, which suddenly after being asham'd of, and to let me see hers had rather been surprised than conquered, drying up her fair eyes, and putting on her usuall looks, she told me: I know not Callimachus what influence you have over me, but you have made me do and say more than I thought even Atafernes himself could. And since you have so far pierced into my secrets, allow me a little to enquire after yours, and tell me what discourse you could have with the Queen, which could send her so hastily, and in such disorders from you; for if I be not much deceived, her eyes were full of Tears, and her face of sadness, when she retired. Ah Madam, I replied, after what you have told me, do not think I am capable of doing any thing but of lamenting your condition, and of offering you my Sword and Life to redress it. The Gods forbid (she hastily answered) you should have so criminal a thought: No Callimachus , I tell you positively, if ever you should again mention such a thing to me, much more endeavour it, you would cast me into greater miseries than you would free me from, and convert that high friendship I have for you, into a Proportionate hate. Before the Princess had fully ended these words, Pharnaces came into the Gallery, and thereby put a period to an entertainment which had darklie given me some smal satisfaction, and had clearely discovered, That was all I was to expect. As soon as the Princesses and Pharnaces were gone, I gave Atafernes a million of acknowledgements for that opportunity I had derived from his favour, and an accompt how I had emploied it. I will not trouble you with a relation of those generous offers he made me of acting himself, what Statira's commands had bound me from, nor of those reasons and prayers I made use of to divert him from it; neither will I tell you how I entertained my self that fatal Night, during which I slept as little as I do now; being too sensibly afflicted with the considerations, that it should be the last of my hopes, and that my miserie was denied the common consolation, of having it build the felicity of my Mistris, who in one performance was to make her self and me unhappy; nor indeed can I tell you all those confused thoughts, my Love and despair dictated to me, which left me not till the Day appeared, and that the hurry and noise of the preparatives for the Nuptials made me begin to feel I was to provide to endure an unhappiness, I was not able to prevent. Here Callimachus observing the heat of the Sun began to be too offensive,  & by this time being come to the River Cyris (which not many furlongs off, continuing still navigable, falls into the Euphrates ) the banks whereof were shaded with divers Trees which might afford an obliging shelter against that Enemy they endeavoured to avoid, desired Artabanes and Artavasdes to take the benefit of that natural defence, whilest his Servants would prepare an entertainment as good as the place would afford. Our two Heroes had been so pleas'd with his Relation, that (doubtless) had they not had more care of him, than of themselves, they would have declin'd accepting of such a proffer, especially in such a part of his Historie; but the Lawes of Respect being more prevalent than those of their curiositie, they left the high way, and took a path which lead them to a tuft of Trees which had many neighbours of the like bigness and growth, but when they came thither, they saw a Horse tied unto an Oak, at the foot whereof the Master of him lay: His Armor was all black without any thing in it which might give the least rise to judge the cause of his sadness, and his Face was turned to the ground, whereby they were disinabled from the hopes of discovering who he was by a sight thereof. The noise which they made when they came near him, did not alter the posture he was in, whereby they concluded a deep sleep or a proportionate sorrow had seized upon him, and therefore they withdrew to another shady place not far from thence; but before they had well seated themselves in it, they discovered a Bote ascending the River by force of Oares, which soon after came to the Shore on the same side they were of, out of which there landed a young Gentleman of an admirable mean;  & soon after there descended out of the same Bote by his help, two Ladies, which though vaild, had yet in their stature and fashion so admirable a grace, and so like unto Parthenissa's and Altizeera's , that had not Artabanes and Artavasdes esteemed it as great a crime to have thought any therin could have resembled their Princesses as an impossibilitie that these could be them, they must have judged against their eyes, or have concluded the first of them had seen a miracle,  & the last what he would as much have priz'd. These two excellent persons being landed, there came out of the Bote after them only three Women, and as many Men, who all together took the way to a neighbour Village, to go to which they were unavoidably to pass not far from the Thicket, where Callimachus and his generous Friends were; who observing it, took as conceal'd places, and as near the way as they could; soon after the Strangers coming thither, and finding they needed the shade they were in, that lovely young man which lead them, advised their continuance there, whilest he sent one of the Servants before to prepare an accommodation for them in the Village, or to carrie them to the vestal Nuns at the Temple. This motion being assented unto by all, and a servant emploied about it, he that made it having first sent away all the rest at a good distance, embracing and kissing the two Beauties which were with him, told them; this recompence of my services which I now take, you will both confess is not above their merit; for now I have brought you within a few furlongs of the place to which I undertook to coduct you, where I hope the Gods wil soon give you cause to believe they will henceforth reward that constancy they have so long permitted men to persecute; and possibly the mercy of preserving us in so long a journy, is but an earnest of a greater. I confess (one of the two replied) this last smile of Fortune is more than we have been acquainted with this long while, and might therefore invite us to believe she has a minde to be reconciled; but I have found her so treacherous, that whilest she can be my Enemy, I must fear she will: you know too we are not yet safe, neither do I know till I hear of my generous Friend, whether my condition will require being so; possibly what he may have heard alreadie, has occasioned him to do that which may invite me to believe, what I have been freed from, may be that which I may wish had not been, and which I may have cause to elect again. Ah, Madam, the other replied, how preferable is your condition to mine, you but fear that loss which I have already suffered. 'Tis true (said she that had first spoken) but then you are to consider, though the generous Prince you have lost possessed your affection, yet there is a generous Prince living who deserves it, and who you have confess'd had a juster Title to it than he which by death has now lost it: you are (Madam) a felicitie great enough for two, and therefore the Gods have destin'd you to reward those two which have best merited it. Oh Gods! Madam, the other replied, be pleased not to wound me afresh with such remembrances, mine being a grief, which if it be to be conquered, will be better so, by time, than by discourse. I know not, said the young Gentleman, what others may do hereafter, but for the present I pretend so great an interest in you both, and you daily give me such evincements of it, that if either of your former Lovers should chance to see it, they would conclude me more happy then they could expect to be, and think I had took too large a possession to be cast out of it, or possibly that 'twere worth their pain to do it: But since your discourses rob you of your quiet, and that sleep may restore you to it, I would move you till the return of your Servant, to endeavour to take all this place will afford you. This motion being relished by both, he took off a loose garment he had on, & spreading it upon the ground, the two Ladies and he laid themselves upon it, and having all of them embraced each other, endeavoured in that posture to finde a repose, which the distemper of their Bodies, but much more those of their mindes did render so necessary. All the while these lovely Strangers were thus discoursing and thus doing, Artabanes and Artavasdes were in transports higher than till then they had ever been acquainted with; for though many things in those two Ladies resembled Parthenissa and Altezeera , yet their voices did it in such perfection, that our Heroes were often going openly to have resolved their doubts, and had certainly done so, if their immodest kisses and embraces had not assured them of their mistake. Artabanes could much sooner believe his Princess was revied, than that she should be unchast; and Artavasdes , as perfect a Lover as he was, could easilier believe that another might be like Altezeera , than that she could do things so unlike her self; so that what ever hopes or thoughts their ears and sight had given them, were destroied by the actions of those two fair Strangers. A thousand times they ran over al the words they had spoke: and though they found therein something which might have come from their two Princesses, had the one been living, and the other in that place; yet other parts of it had so little connection with those, that the repetitions they made, served rather to increase their wonder, than resolve their doubts; sometimes also they believed it a delusion of the Devils, who conspiring with Fortune endeavoured in this last essay to conquer Constancies, which-till then they could never but assault: they were sometimes too about to try if they could see their Faces plainly, which during their discourse they had but imperfect glimpses of. But those Resolutions soon vanished: for to think those could be Parthenissa and Altezeera which had done such strange things, would have appeared as admirable in our Heroes, as that very immodesty would have done in their Princesses. But Callimachus who perceived their disorders, and who being the least interessed, was the fittest to counsel them, advised they would leave Symander in that concealement from whence they had made their discovery, and that they themselves would retire to a shade at a farther distance, where they might take some refreshment, and the better consider and advise what was to be done when Symander should bring notice of their being awake. This proposal was no sooner made, than accepted of, and our two Heroes with Callimachus went to a place within sight of the first, where having received a refreshment more proportionate to the Prince of Venus's Priest, than the place, they conjur'd him to prosecute his Story, though what they had seen and heard gave them impatiencies, which nothing but their desires of knowing so generous a Friends Fortunes, could have dispensed with.
