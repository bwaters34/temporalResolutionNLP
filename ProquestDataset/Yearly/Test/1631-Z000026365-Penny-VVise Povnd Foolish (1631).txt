 In these few papers is the Map of the whole world; London, Bristow, and Venice, are (here) the Figures of all other Citties. In all other Citties are Curtizans; and all Curtizans, haue Idolatrous fooles to Adore them. The Discourse is hid, (like our Ladies heads in Taffatie purse-nets) vnder the Masques of Ferdinand and Annabell . Their Liues and their Loues are enclosed in this Nut-shell: Which, if you Crack, without hurting your Teeth, the Kernell is sweet in the Chewing. The Apples pluck'd from this little Tree, may serue to turne in the Fire, in your Christmasse Nights, and not much amisse all the Winter after. So fall to, and farewell. is a very faithfull Messenger,  & the best errand it goes vpon, is when a Rich man sends his commendations by it to a Beggar. The Rich-man giues, and the Poore-man takes; no, the Poore-man giues, and the Rich-man takes, for the Prayers of the Poore, encrease the blessings of the Rich. Poore Penny, how much good therefore art thou able to doe; nay, how much good doest thou daily and hourely, when those that are thy betters, and a thousand times beyond thee in substance and estate, will not part from a farthing. A Penny is the Doale for which a wretched creature cries, Good Master bestowe a Penny vpon mee: hee does not begge Two-pence, but a Penny, a single Penny. A Penny will content a Carier, when a pound will not satisfie a Curmudgeon. Land in olde times no doubt was sold good cheape, for men vsed to say, They bought it with their Penny: But in these dayes the case is altred (quoth Ployden ,) Law hath taught Land buyers to speake another Language. A Penny had wont to pay for a Pot of happy Ale; but now a Pot of Ale defies the company of a Penny. And yet for all this, a Penny will be a braue companion still: olde men loue it, and are therefore called Penny-Fathers: Trades-men loue it, for they cry, Take it for a Pennymore. Water-men loue it, for they aske but a Penny to crosse the Water, and when a man hath not a Penny in his purse, then he sweares hee hath not one crosse about him. So that as a Penny is the least Crosse that a man can carry, there can be no greater crosse than for a man to goe without a Penny. A Blacke Wench, if she be Penny-white, passes for current money, where a Faire Wench that hath no pence, shall be nayled vp for a counterfet. A Penny then being in such extraordinary request, for the generall good it does to so many, how much more ought wee to make of it, when for a Penny a man may buy Wit? That Market does now begin; And how much Wit a Merchant had for so small a piece of Siluer, lend your Attention, and the History of that Penny-bargain, shall be worth at lest two-pence to any man that heares it. Or a Bristow Diamond set in two Rings, and both crackt. In the Citty of Bristow , not much aboue two twelue-moneths past, did liue a Merchant in the brauery of his youth, in the heigth of full fortunes, and in the excellency of all perfection, both for a comely proportion of body, and vnmatchable ornaments of minde. Hee had all those things, which in this world make a man to be counted happy, and wanted none of those, the lacke of which teach men to beleeue they are miserable. One onely Blessing was absent, whose possession would haue set a Crowne vpon all the other, And that was the mariage of some delicate faire young woman, to so wealthy and hansome a young man. This Gentlemans name will wee call Ferdinand , (his true both Christian name and surname for diuers reasons shall be concealed.) And albeit, he might haue had in Bristow the choise of many Maydens, both answerable to himselfe in state and beauty, (that Citty being as richly stored with faire and sweet proportioned women as any be in the world: yet M. Ferdinand vsing often (by way of Trafficke in Merchandize) to repaire to London , happened to cast his eye on the most beautifull face of a very worthy, and very wealthy Cittizens daughter of London , her name being Annabell , but how she was called otherwise, her succeeding fortunes forbid mee to discouer. The parents and friends of this beauteous Damosell (who was called the starre of this Citty, as well for her delicacie of body, as for modesty,) giuing way to a Match so suitable to their owne desires, and their daughters liking, little wooing needed, so that the marriage was not so ioyfully on all sides appointed, as it was with pompous ceremony of friends inuited, Feastings, Masques, Dauncing, and Reuelling solemnized. No couple through the whole Citty of London , were held so happy as these beauteous payre: Ferdinand and Annabell drew all eyes after them wheresoeuer they went. But it was not enough for Ferdinand to be thus followed with praises in London; nor to haue his delicate young wife gazed at, and enuied by the curious Dames of this Citty: No, there was a fire of Uaine-glory in him, to haue all the eyes of Bristow behold what gallant Prize he had taken at London , nor was the beauty of his faire Bed-fellow behinde-hand with him, in the same pride and ambition. Her longings that way were as great as his. Their desires thus spreading the same wing, the parents and friends loath to loose two such Iewels, yet necessity snatching them from them. Away doe they hasten to Bristow . Wonder there lookes vpon them, Ioy and ten thousand welcomes embrace them: It was hard to tell whether the Merchants of that Towne did think him more happy in being Master of such a treasure, as so delicate a Wife, or whether the braue Dames of that Citty did hold her more fortunate, in being lodged euery night within the armes of so hansome a Husband. But Admiration being neuer long-liu'd, let vs after a quarter or halfe a yeares entertainment of Mistris Annabell , amongst her Husbands friends in Bristow , leaue her there, attended vpon with all those commendable glories which set forth excellent Women, whilst we follow him backe againe from Bristow to London . Whither being come and welcommed by his Wifes father and kindred, Ioyes were redoubled to heare of her health, and to see his welfare. In a short time had hee dispatched the businesse, for which he came touching his Merchandize, to finish which he made the more hast, as thinking euery day spent here, a thousand yeares lost at home, vntill againe hee might rest in the bosome of his beloued, but though the Sayles of his desire and affection were spread faire, yet the windes grew churlish, they blustred and conspired to part our two new-married Louers asunder: For, the brauery of this Bristow -Merchants minde being obserued by our Gallants here in the Citty, his comlinesse of person, affability in language, and royalty in expences, kindled a fire of good liking in many, to be partners in his society; And hee tooke as great a glory to enioy their appointments and meetings, as they did his. Youth led him on to these ingagements of pleasure: New acquaintance (which still grew faster and faster vpon him) begat new inuitations, those inuitations brought forth new delights, and those delights, seru'd as pullies to draw on fresher and larger expences; All these seruing together as so many hookes, nay as so many cast-Anchors, to fasten him from setting forward in his intended voyage homeward. In this multiplicity of acquaintance, Iollities and Iouiall meetings, Ferdinand did often happen into the familiarity of diuers Merchants Wiues of London , whose beauties (though they were excellent) and behauiours able to tempt any man, to admire and dote vpon them, yet to him they were but as colours to a blinde man: the musicke of their enchanting tongues but songs to the deafe: he had (as he thought) a brighter starre of his owne to sayle by: these painted fires gaue to him no heate, the sunne-beames that lent warmth to him, were those which were shot from the sparkling eyes of his most dearely-beloued Annabell . The Fates had spunne good and euen threeds for him, had they still continued winding vpon this white bottome, but then altred the Distaffe, and so drew out his misery, and his Wiues misfortune. This constancy of his, was but a watry sunne-shine; it seemed built vpon a rocke, but the foundation was not sound; this Oake that stoode vp so high and strong, in resolution neuer to be shaken with any allurements, is now in danger to be riuen in sunder, and cleft euen to the roote, by the lightning flying from the eyes of a strange woman. For one day chancing in a company of young Gallants like himselfe, to fall into priuate discourse, with a delicate creature, rich in Attire, costly in Iewels, rare in the proportion both of face and body, sweet in voyce, and of a winning bewitching behauiour, Ferdinand was on a suddaine taken prisoner by her beauty. Her charmes were strong, and hee lay fast bound in them. Hee vpon this first comming into the field, made suite to be her seruant, and she after a few slight skirmishing words, yeelded her selfe to be his Mistresse. The next day, he wooed his young Mistresse, that her seruant might be so happy, as to be suffered to visite her at her own lodging: And she feeling what fish nibled at her bayte, gaue him line and leaue enough to play, and told him, she was not so vnworthy as not to bid so new, and so noble a seruant welcome. The day wearing away, and the assembly in which Ferdinand and his new-found Lady had beene merry together, being weary of their pleasures (as feasting, dancing, drinking healthes, courting, and such like,) the Spell brake, and dissolued those chaines, which had almost a whole day bound them within this circle. Night approched, and all parted. Ferdinand being come home, and locking himselfe into his priuate Chamber, hee begins thus to contemplate vpon the beauties, graces, and perfections of his rare and most admired Mistresse: if euer man met an Angell vpon earth, in the shape of a woman, this is shee: if euer woman was too worthy to be touched by any man, this was shee. Had she beene borne when Idolatry was first committed, to her onely had the heathen giuen adoration. In fashioning her Idaea , or the figure of her body in his phantacy, her eyes through the windowes of his soule, presented themselues to him like a paire of starres. Her face he called the Master-peece of all Art, sweetnesse, and proportion, to equall which, nay to come but neere it in picture, it was not possible for any Painter in the world to doe it with his Pensill: Her hand he called his booke of palmestry: her foote the first steppe to the stateliest Measure, that euer was prosecuted by Motion: In briefe, her whole body (to the eye of his imagination) appeared a Mine, stored with treasures beyond all valuation. No Arithmetick could summe vp her excellencies, no figures set downe the hopes of that happinesse which he conceiued in his vnmatchable Mistresse. But after his cogitations had thus ranne diuision on her praises, his Understanding began to fall into another time, and his Memory to be set to this Note, to call to minde his deare and disconsolated Annabell in Bristow , presenting her therefore to his Remembrance, and the full volume of all her Uertues, being printed in his soule, he thus brake forth into a passionate reprehension of his new conceiued folly. And shall thy youth, thy beauty, thy integrity, modesty, and innocence (O my dearest sweet-heart) be by me forgotten? can I proue a traytor to thy pillow, who (I dare sweare it) art most true to mine? Must all my vowes made to thee when I wooed thee, all those Matrimoniall obligations, which I sealed to thee before Angels in the holy Temple, and all those protestations I left in kisses vpon thy lips, when I late and last parted from thee, must all this be forgotten, all written in sand, and left floating on the water! O Uillaine that I am, to fixe mine eye on a Beade of worthlesse christall, and preferre it before the rarest Diamond in the world: this woman sure, who hath made choyse of mee to be her seruant, is some Mermayde enticing mee to runne vpon the rockes of destruction: Stop then thine eares, and auoyde the danger by not listning to her enchantments. A Goddesse is ready to receiue thee into her armes at home, and a painted Witch opens hers, to kill thee in her false embraces abroade; I will not be caught by this sorcerous woman, I must not, I dare not. At this he fetched a deepe sigh, And then his soule and her entring into conference together; Why (quoth hee) though I haue all the delicatest meates standing on mine owne table, may not I sit downe at another mans boord. What Wife is true to her Husband. Why then should any Husband be true to his Wife? Wee are all borne free, why should marriage make vs bondslaues? Shall the ceremony onely of a golden Ring, be a charme to binde me from enioying my pleasures? I am satisfied with a Wife, cloyed with her enioyments, my appetite is young, and must tast varieties. The fishes in the sea are not married; birdes in the ayre choose their Ualentines, and that's their wedding; All the beasts vpon earth haue a liberty in desires to range how they will, and to take whom they will, why then should man be made a captiue to any woman? O my sweetest, dearest, most delicious Mistresse, I dye if I liue not to doe thee seruice, I cannot be beaten from thee with frownes, with swords, with Death: yes, Death onely can force our seperation, nothing else shall. Hauing thus spent the night in these passionate perturbations, the morning summoned him to appeare before the Saint he so honoured. Up in all hast hee rises, and hastens to the lodging of his Mistresse; who not willing to loose such a golden Flie, as she made account this her new Burring- seruant would proue, was weauing her curious Loome-workes, with the best and surest Art she could. For she left her bed betimes, to make her face by painting shew more excellent, which of it selfe was absolute before: He came, and saluted, and kist her, and in that kisse, felt all his blood put into a terrible burning: he saw her in brauery, rich as a Queene, bright in Iewels as the morning-sunne, breathing from her apparell, perfumes more pretious than those which the Spring giues to the earth: hee saw her, and stoode astonished to behold her: hee saw her, and forgat that euer he saw a Wife, to whom his eyes did owe that duty and tribute which he payde to a Curtizan. But shee to put him out of this traunce, tooke her Lute, which she touched sweetly, and sung to it more sweetly, and by this striuing to awaken him, shee cast him into a deeper sleepe: out of which againe she startled him by the Magick of her enticing lips, on which dwelling with a languishing delightfull pleasure, tasted, nay was so filled with sweets, that he thought one Apple in this Garden, worth a whole Orchard of his Wifes at home. Dalliance thus charming them into a liking one of another, Ferdinand vowes euer to be hers, and none but hers, she sweares euer to be his, and none but his. Dayes, weekes, and moneths were consumed between these two vnchast Louers, in all kindes of varied pleasures, that ryot could inuent. There was no new fashions in apparell, but she had them; no Iewell (how costly so euer) but shee was Mistresse of it. A Caroach and Coach-horses he brought for her, in which he and she together were sometimes whorried to Play-houses, somtimes to Brainford , to lye there, then to Barnet , to lye there, then to Bow to be merry there, then to Black-wall to see the Ships there, and hen to Bloomesbury to solace themselues there. And so to all bawdy Bees lying neere and about London . His Wife seeing her Beloued stay beyond the time limitted by himselfe for his returne, at first began to wonder, then to mistrust, then to lament for his absence. But ill newes being swifter of wing than any other bird, came flying into Bristow , and alighting in Annabells eare, (that was open day and night listning for some good tydings of her lost Husband) did there sing to her a sad note of the lewd and lasciuious courses of Ferdinand with a Courtizan. Hereupon shee tore her haire, beat her white breasts, cursed her hard fortunes, and wish'd that either she had beene borne deformed, that none might euer haue loued her, or that her face had been made as enticing as that Strumpets, on whom her Husband doates, for then she had kept him to her selfe, where now in this wandring shee is in danger to loose him for euer. To poast after him to London , would but proclaime his faults, which shee was willing to hide from the world: to come and teare out those bewitching eyes of his Harlot, she had not a heart to hurt, that which her Husband had chosen to loue so dearely. Wauering thus betwixt many doubts & feares, fed with hopes, that yet he would come home, & frighted with despaire, that she should neuer more see him, (for sinne is a luscious meate, and the more we taste it, the more we desire it: It is a Sea, and being once got into it, (without a good Pilot) tis not so easie to returne againe to shoare:) vpon these considerations, she writ many louing Letters, to call and recall her deare Husband home. But he (as the papers came) still shewing them to his Mistresse, the passions of a Wife, were commicall Playes to a Strumpet: the teares which the one sent, dropping on the Letters as she writ them, were pledg'd in kisses by the other, on her Husbands cheekes, and in Claret-wine and Sugar. The young Womans Father and friends likewise hearing of these dissolute courses taken by Ferdinand , found him out, and both by soft perswasions, and harsh threatnings did their best to winne him to his Wife, but he laugh'd to scorne their counsell. At last, the bonefires of his prodigality being almost burnt out, his purse shrinking, his money melting, his credite decaying, and his debts encreasing to such a mountaine, it was not possible for him to climbe well ouer them, without tumbling into one of the Coumpters, hee priuately with many ostentations and oathes to his Mistresse, to returne from Bristow so soone as hee could furnish himselfe there with moneyes, tooke his leaue of her, she distilling from her eyes some fewe drops of hot waters, which her faigned sorrow dranke off to him, to comfort his heart, at the farewell: but she hauing other Sickles to cut downe her corne than his, the shower of teares which she rayned vpon her whorish cheekes being soone dried vp, the storme was quickly blowne ouer, and she was to prouide for another golden haruest. But leaue we her, plucking pleasure and diseases out of one and the same Well: and let vs follow him to Bristow: whither being secretly come, and with all expressions of a noble, louing, and forgiuing Wife, welcommed by the vertuous Annabell: shee weeped for ioy, and as she weeped, mildly chid him, and as she chid him, gaue him a thousand kisses. He ashamed to abuse such an excellent Goodnesse, shut vp his wrongs to her in as sweete language, as he could hansomly meete with; and told her, there was no staying for him in safety either in Bristow or London: his estate (he said) was weake, yet not so weake, but that he had a staffe to hold it vp from falling, and that was certaine bagges of money, left in a trusty friends hands, when he departed for London , which money hee would closely, and instantly disburse in Merchandize, and in some good Shippe (of which he himselfe would be Captaine) and with a Ging of good fellowes, try his fortune at Sea: Shee vnwillingly willing, yeelds to this, so into the Straights hee ventures. At Scanderoone hee goes on shore, and vents such Commodities as hee had by Carauans, vp at Aleppo , amongst the Turkes, and such Christian Merchants as there were in Trafficke: in so much, that by his industrie and knowledge in Commerce, he might haue made a reasonable good voyage, if vpon the sale of his Wares brought thither, and lading his Ship with Commodities from thence, hee had returned home, without encountring any second fortune. But Heauen smiling vpon him, appointed a Turkish Pirate (richly furnished) to set vpon our Captaine of Bristow , and his mad merry company: who were all English-men, couragious, skilfull, resolute, and tall Sea-men, euery one of them swearing to liue and dye with their noble Captaine. The Turke set vpon them, they brauely returned an English defiance. The Turkes called vpon Mahomet , the Christians cried St. George , but called vpon Him whom they knew could helpe them. The Fight was short, but cruell, the victory doubtfull, but speedy; for the Turkish Pirate being boarded, and as fast throwne ouer-board, as the English could enter, a noble and rich spoile was made, the true man robd the thiefe: Captaine Ferdinands Ship was doubly laden, with treasure, and with acclamations of ioy, the Turkes went sneaking to their holes, and the English put in at a hither part of Christendome, to refresh their wounded men, and to giue them good victuals. I must here put you in minde of one thing, which before when Ferdinand was to come from Bristow , I should haue remembred, and that was this: At the time when he was ready to prepare for his Sea-voyage, he told his Wife, All that he could get together, was little enough to furnish him forth for so waighty a businesse, yet hee would leaue sufficient to maintaine her in his absence: And then merrily asking her what shee would venture with him, she answered, shee would aduenture all that she had, and that was her body, and her poore life: no, sayes her Husband, you shall not: I will not hazard all our substance in one bottome: Why then, quoth shee, though my body must stay at home, my heart shall goe with you, and vpon what shoare so euer you land, my good wishes for your prosperity, and prayers for your health shall euer wayte vpon you as your seruants: And yet because it shall not be said, but that both by Sea and Land, my fortunes shall still set their foote by yours, I will put in my share in your Aduenture: What (my good sweet-heart said her Husband:) Sir, replyed his Wife, you haue often layd out much money, which neuer brought home any profit, I dare therefore not trust you with much; All that I put into your hands, is onely one single penny. Hee smiling vpon her, asked what he should doe with that penny; marry (quoth shee) onely buy and bring home for that mony a penny-worth of wit. Hee glad to see her so pleasantly conceited, protested hee would lay out her money, to the best aduantage he could: and so tooke his leaue of her. You heard before, that after the Fight was ended betweene Ferdinand and the Turkish Pirates our Bristow Captaine went on shoare to refresh his men. During his absence in a Port-towne of Spaine (called Saint Lucar de Barameda in Andaluzia , for there his Ship put in,) one of the Marriners who stayd aboard, (being a merry conceipted fellow, and one that knew all the passages of Ferdinands life, all his wilde humours, and mad fits playde betweene him, his Wife, and his Curtizan) intending to pin some merriment vpon his Captaines shoulder, disguised his face like to a tann'd Gipsey, and put himselfe into nothing but ragges, like a begger, and in this manner stoode waiting on the shore, till his Captaine was to come backe to take shipping: Ferdinand being then passing by him, this supposed Roague, setting out a wide throate, cryed out in a bigge voyce, Noble Captaine, braue honest Captaine, bestowe one single penny vpon a poore man, vpon an English man, vpon your Country-man; that shall pray you may haue a boone voyage, good worthy Captaine, one penny, one poore single penny. Ferdinand hearing the name of English-man, and that word, single penny, cast his eye backe vpon my counterfet beggar, and the sound of single penny put him in minde of his Wife, and her venture of a penny, and what he was to buy with it. So, turning to the Fellow, Troth honest Countrey-man (said he) for so I perceiue thou art by thy tongue; what thou beggest for I haue about me, and so drew forth his Wifes penny; looke thou, here's a new single penny, but I haue other imployment for it, than to bestow it on a Beggar, for it is an aduenture put into my hands by my Wife, and I am to buy with it, for her, a penny-worth of wit. O Master, cries the Begger, you were better giue me the penny, than trauaile so long, till you buy so rich a commodity as Witte, for so poore a summe of money. Many come into this Countrey, and others on this side the Seas, and spend they care not what, onely to get wit, and knowledge, and experience, but in the end returne home as arrant Coxcombes as I did, when I came from trauell. Many a thousand pound haue I layde out to purchase Wit, but I could neuer reach to so much as a farthings worth. Thou many a hundred pounds (said Ferdinand ,) Yes Captaine (answered the Begger) no dispraise to your person, I once held myselfe as braue a Gallant as your selfe: my Silkes and Sattins on my backe, men at my heeles, roaring Boyes at my beck, my Comrades at a call. And how (quoth the Captaine) commest thou to be so poore? I will tell you how (said tother.) One part of my mony ranne away with Come on sixe, and Come on seuen: I could play at Novum, Passage, In and In, Mum Chance, at Tables, Irish, Tick-tack, any thing, at Cardes, Maw, Sant, Primero, Primanista, Gleeke, Poast and Paire, Whiske, all Games, Noddy, and any Game where a Knaue was to be turn'd vp. All the money I either woonne or lost this way, went sure to the Deuill, for I had it with damnable swearing, and parted from it, with abominable tearing of God, blasphemy, and cursing. Another part of my money melted away in Sack and Claret, but I lickd my lips prettily well at this Feast; for I met for my money, Wine, good Cheere, good Fires, good Wenches, good Musick, and good knocking Reckonings. A third part of my money I spent, nay, cast away vpon a Whore, a dainty one, a young one, a proud-one. So long as my siluer lasted, her brazen-face was alwayes at my nose, kissing me: but when my cheekes grew leane, and my Pockets empty, away flies my Wag-tayle. Now my noble Captaine, if (as I know most of our English Gallants doe) you haue a liquorish tooth in your head, and keepe a Punk, hang her, dam her, trust her not, sheele graze vpon thy meddow so long, as there's a blade of grasse, that gone, shee leapes ouer hedge and ditch into any Butchers Pasture. But if (my braue Captaine and Country-man) thou hast a Wife, kisse her, coll her, trust her, try her, for shee will runne for Aqua-vitae to recouer thy fortunes, when thy Cockatrice shall cast them into a swound. Should thy Shippe lye here vpon a sand, and could not stirre for want of water to fetch thee off, thy Strumpet would not throw out the Bason in which shee washes her hands (vnlesse for her owne benefit) where thy Wife (if thou hast a good-one) would draw a sea out of her eyes to saue thee from sinking. The Captaine hearing the Begger-man talke thus, with a smiling countenance, gaue him, his Wifes single penny, and told him, he did not thinke, but that the money was layde out as she desired: for that penny should peraduenture send him and his Ship home with a richer Lading, than fiue hundred pound could furnish him with: And so thanking the poore Fellow for his Discourse, hee gaue him besides at parting, foure peeces of Eight for a farewell to drinke his Health, which the Begger swore he would doe. Ferdinand presently gets aboard to make for England , and the mad Marriner as nimbly teares off his ragges (vnknowne to any man) and leapes into the Ship almost as soone as the Captaine. In this interim of Ferdinands being at Sea, his faire Mistresse, wondring at his long absence, considering his vehement oathes (with all speede possible to returne) and being loath to loose such a Gold-Finch, that sung so sweetly in her eare: shee (partly for a kinde of loue shee bare him (he being a very proper man) but chiefely for his estate, which she knew was great, and to catch which she did angle) came in her thundering Caroach like some great Lady to Bristow , with this resolution, If Ferdinand were there, then to enioy him as before, if not there, yet she would repaire her losses and charge of the Iourney vpon any other whom she next lighted on, fit to be made a property, as no doubt but Bristow had store of such tame fowle, as well as any other Citty. Her wishes and intentions hit the markes she shot at: for Tarsell-gentle, in abundance came to the fist of our shee-Faulkconer. By this time, (winde and weather faueuring him) Ferdinand is as secretly arriued at Bristow ; as hee departed closely from thence: and stepping priuately to a deare friend, enquires what newes in the Towne, how all the mad Girles did, and what new Wenches were come to Bristow; so that in the end by way of merry Discourse, and descanting vpon other Women, he perceiu'd (but conceal'd it) that his Mistresse had followed him thither, and his heart (leaning to his old byas) began almost to leape for ioy, to thinke that hee found his noble sweet-heart so kinde. But then remembring his Wifes single penny, and the Beggers counsaile, hee meant to make triall what his Wifes Uenture would come to; and so putting himselfe into ragges like a Begger, with a short Cudgell in his hand, he found out her lodging, and knock'd to speake with her. One of her seruants seeing such a totterdemalion Rascall, enquired scuruily what he would haue; tother replied as scuruily, I must speake with your Lady or Mistresse: Away you lowzie Slaue, cried the Pandar, my Mistresse a companion for such a Nitty- breech as thou art, to talke to her! but my counterfet Bristow -Maunderer, in a very pittifull voyce told him, that hee had Letters from one Ferdinand a Merchant, and somewhat else by word of mouth to deliuer to her. Upon this he was called vp into her Chamber, and then requesting to deliuer his message in priuate; all were commanded out of the roome, but himselfe and her, and then asking, if she knew him not by his voyce, (for by his tattred attire and face she could not) he told her, he was that Ferdinand , whom once she loued so dearely, and shee that Mistresse of his that commanded both his life and fortunes; all the happinesse hee had on earth, was to enioy her presence: tells her how he was taken Prisoner by the Turke, made a Gally- slaue, tugg'd at the Oare, had an hundred blowes on the naked backe with a Bulls peezell, fed on course browne-bread and water, and hardly got away (but most miraculously) with life; entreates her (what needes intreaties) hee presumes shee is so noble, that she will lodge him in her bosome as shee had woont; prayes her to send into the Towne for cloathes to make him braue, for good cheere to fill his belly, for some cleane linnen, for he was lowzie, and that hee might haue a good fire to shift himselfe by: But she casting an eye of scorne at his basenesse, reuiled him, kick'd at him, bid him Auant, called for her seruants to thrust him out of dores: but he falling on his knees, begg'd as shee was a Woman, to let him lye in some Hay-loft, in some Stable, vpon a heape of Horse-dung, for since his comming to shoare, hee had killed a man that misused him; and if shee turned him out of dores, it was his assured death and confusion. Nay, you base scum (cried she) and so tumbling him into the street, shut the dores vpon him. He then (all ragged as he was) went in priuate home to his Wife; shee for all the misery round about him, knew his face, hung about his necke, wept for ioy, and enquired what mischance sent him to her in this pittifull estate. He told her, his Ship was burnt by Pirates, his Goods taken from him, his men slaine, and himselfe onely scaped with life. And that's all (quoth his Wife) which I desire: let Ship, Goods, and all be lost, so I finde thee: my Rings, Iewels, Plate, nay, my owne apparell Ile presently pawne, or sell out-right, to furnish my deere Husband fitting to his worth: but he ouer-ioyed at this her admirable loue, and vnfaigned expressions of a noble Wife, pluck'd off his ragges, and vnder them discouered a faire habite; but entreating her, to pardon his absence for an houre or two, for the dispatch of a most especiall businesse, hee leaues her full of ioy, both at his vnexpected Arriuall, and at his prosperous Uoyage, of which in some fewe words, hee gaue her a firme assurance. Ferdinand then richly attiring himselfe, and taking foure or fiue of his Marriners, neatly apparelled, passed by the Curtizans dore once or twice; shee spying him, sent after him, the seruant saying, his Mistresse entreated him by any meanes to come backe, and speake with her. He did so, when she at his entrance into her Chamber, ranne and fell vpon his cheekes, printing on them and his lips an 100. kisses, and telling him that a base Rascall, in shape of a Begger, came to her, and tooke his name vpon him. That very Begger, sweetest Mistresse (quoth Ferdinand ) was I my selfe, and came to you in that pouerty, to try if you would releeue mee, but it was an easie matter for you to scorne me, as not knowing me in that loathsome apparence, I therefore pardon it; and to shew, how deepely (euen in absence) you were printed in my memory, and that you are to me the same beloued Mistris, that heretofore you haue bin; behold, as a part of my good Uoyage, I present to your white hands this rich Cabinet, full of the most pretious Iewels, that are to be found in this part of the world. Shee was reaching out her hands to lay hold vpo them. But (quoth he) my most endeared Mistresse, I remember I haue giuen you many Rings, Bracelets of Diamonds, Chaines of Pearles and Gold, and many costly Iewels, I doubt in my absence you haue bestowed these vpon some other sweethearts: shew mee these therefore, and I shall be in the better hope, that for my sake you will preserue these likewise. Hereupon, shee fetches all the braueries, and costly gifts that he euer presented to her; which seene, he seiz'd vpon them, told her, he found her to be a Bristow Diamond, she was a cunning, a cheating, and hard-hearted Curtizan; and so giuing her sufficient meanes and money (for his owne reputation sake) to rid her from Bristow , and ship her for London: on his Wife he bestowed all those Iewels, and tolde her, that the Wit which hee bought with the single Penny, shee ventured in his Ship, was worth all the Merchandize he brought home besides. The Bed where a Husband and Wife ly[illeg.] is that Musicke-roome, where the soules of them [illeg.]lay in the most excellent Consort: All Discords b[illeg.]re here put into time, all Iarres so winded vp, with [illeg.] Strings of Concord, that no Harmony can be sweeter. Such a Bed is an Altar, where a paire of louing Hearts are offered, and no gall mingled with the Sacrifice. Such a Bed is a Cradle, where pleasure, content, and all earthly happinesse rocke man and wife a sleepe: kisses perfuming the pillowes, as if they were bankes of Roses, and warme teares of ioy (there to be reconciled one to another) being the soft showers, that make those Rosie kisses grow fairer, and in more abundance. Ferdinand (our young and now rich Merchant of Bristow ,) enioying his beauteous Annabell , a whole night together; the pleasure of their embraces, were encreased, by his relation of his wilde courses, dalliances, and delights which he tooke at London , in that bewitching Mistresse of his (the Curtizan) but ten times more doubled in her free, and noble forgiuenesse, of whatsoeuer had passed betweene them. Hee (thereupon) promised to be to his Wife, a new man, a new-molded Husband, and she vowed to him, to be an euer-loyall, and euer-louing Wife. Whilst thus they lay talking, the Sunne casting his eye vpon them in at the window, tolde them, it was time to rise, and that the Marriners who ventured their liues and fortunes with him in his Uoyage, were all attending for him. Upon this summons of the Sunne, they both forsooke their Beds, made them ready, and came downe: Ferdinand deliuering to euery one of them, whatsoeuer in right they could claime for wages, or any thing else, and withall (because they should not report they met with an vnworthy or ingratefull person) hee bestowed vpon them (as his bounteous gift) twenty pounds amongst them all, ouer and aboue their due, to drinke his Wifes Health and his, at a Dinner or Supper, which they with merry countenances, swore to performe. And then Ferdinand (his Wife the faire Annabell being by) relating how happily he met with a poore Begger, at his returne to his Ship, when they went a shoare in Spaine , and that bestowing his Wifes single Penny vpon that poore man; hee found since, that the penny-worth of Wit (which the Begger gaue him there, and serued him well to for so little money) had done him a great deale of good since his Arriuall, and that to the last day of his life, hee would be a faire gayner by the Beggers bargaine. Annabell smiling, tolde him, Hee was as much or more beholding to her, as to that poore man, for that her Uenture of a single Penny, was the first and principall occasion of meeting so excellent and vn- valluable a commodity as Wit. Hee confest it, and tolde his wife, before all those witnesses, that hee was deepe in her debt. But then the Marriner, who counterfaited the Begger, not being able to glew vp his lips any longer, tolde them all, that hee was that Rag-a-muffin, who begg'd an Almes on the shoare, onely to put his Captaine in minde of his Wife, and her Penny, because hee knew how the single Penny was deliuered, and therefore in his Beggerly Oration to him, hee touch'd him to the quicke, as knowing into how many wilde and crooked currents the streame of his Captaines life had runne; yet if this bolde attempt of his had succeeded well, hee hoped his offence, was the more easily pardoned. Pardoned (quoth Annabell! ) yes, and rewarded too: and thereupon, remembring and putting her Husband in minde of his owne words in Bed to her, which were, that but for the aduice the supposed Begger gaue him for his Penny, he had neuer put that triall vpon his Curtizan, but doubtlesse (comming home so rich) had both powred and rayned downe golden showers into her lap, and his soule (as before) into her bosome: she therefore hung about her Husbands necke, and for the content she her selfe encountred with, by this Marriner (whose name was Theobald ) as also for the blessing heauen crown'd his owne life with, by the hands of that good Sea-man, she entreated, nay, importunately begg'd, nay by all the bonds of affection betweene them, coniured him, to make vp that single Penny hee gaue him, a full one hundred pounds, and so set him a floate in the world. Ferdinand being willing to winne his Annabell to him by any meanes, sithence hee had giuen her iust cause for euer to loose her: and considering, the request, easie (in regard it was but a droppe to the full-Sea his riches swum in) and iust, in respect of the golden haruest, his Wifes Penny, and the Marriners counsell brought him; He not onely, very nobly, freely, and cheerefully deliuered an hundred pounds as his Wifes gift, but to shew how much hee desired to make her ioyes full in all things, hee lent one hundred pound more to Theobald , without script or scrowle, to be payd him, when it should please the heauens to command the winds and the waues, to send him home, a merry, a prosperous, and a wealthy voyager. Theobald with infinite thankes for these vndeserued courtesies on her part, and vnexpected on his, acknowledges his life euer to be their debter; and so in a very short time (hauing so many golden starres to sayle by) away puts he to Sea: where we wil leaue him carefully, industriously, and like a toyling Ant, prouiding sufficient in the Summer of his youth, how to maintaine him in the winter of his age. And now let vs cast our eyes once more vpon Ferdinand and Annabell , who grew vp in Bristow , (like two faire trees) looked at by all, admired by all, and loued by all. That reputation of his, which ran-a-ground at London, is in Bristow fetchd off safely from all shelfes, and sandes: a harlot vndid his fortunes there, a wife restores them here. His former Riots, are now turned to good husbandry, his feasting in Tauernes, to a ciuill entertainement in his owne house, his roaring-boyes companyes, to a braue society of Merchants, and his roaging beggerly noyses of scraping Fidlers, to the most excellent musicke of sweet and harmlesse stories told betweene him and his wife, or els, to the cunning touch of her hand vpon the stringes of her Lute, guided by the ecchoes of a rauishing voice, in both of which shee exceeded euen skilfull Musitians. What woundes hee got in his estate by borrowing, hee now cured by paying euery penny: so that vpon his word hee might either in Bristow or London , haue taken vp more money, then many that caryed their heads higher in the Aire, and more proudly iet on the Stage of opinion, could procure vpon their bondes. Abundance filled his bagges, rich Merchandise his Cellers and Warehouses, Cupbords of Plate waited on his Table, and both Men-seruants, and Mayd- seruants on him and his wife; superfluitie of all wordly blessings, thus casting his youthfull mind into a surfet: hee began not onely to be weary of Bristow , but of his owne naturall countrey, burning with an immoderate and vnquenchable desire to trauell beyond the Seas, to come acquainted with the manners, fashions, and conditions of forren nations. The bellows that kindled these flames within him, were the praises giuen to him by young Merchants and gallants that had trauelled, of the delicate faces of other women abroad, of their queint dressings, curious attires, and most bewitching complements our english Ladies, and Merchants wiues of London being but course creatures, dowdyes and doddipolls, either to the Germaine Frow, the french pretty, parlying Madamoiselle, or the cherrylipd, wanton-eyed, plump, Italian, Bona Roba, and besides these Spurres of longings clapd to his heeles to set him going; his wife (albeit a delicate creature) began (after this frenzy of dreaming after other women, though hee neuer saw them) not to seeme so hansome in his eye as shee was wont or if she did, lett our owne pasture be neuer so fatt, neuer so full, neuer such wholesome feeding, wee thinke our neighbours better, though farre worse. As in Tauernes, when fault is found in the wine, though there be none in it, If the drawer goes but to change it, and brings the same againe O cryes all the company, now drawer thou hast gon right indeed: so that the sick part about vs is our opinion; tis our iudgement is poisned. Ferdinand therefore being thus (as it were) with childe to see fashions abroad, could finde no ease in minde or body vntill he fell into Trauell; and for that purpose, he fraighted a Ship with rich and vendible commodities to be sent to Venice , and himselfe to goe as Chiefe in her. His wife was much against his going, shee feard her bird whom shee had kept so long, getting now out of the Cage, would fly shee knew not whither, and grow wilde. But he shewing many reasons for his venturing in person, as that it was hard trusting Factors, his gaines might be trebled by his being there; the eye of the Master fatts the Horse: It would besides the double profit, returne to his minde an infinite pleasure to behold other Cities, other people, and conuerse with other Merchants: his knowledge would hereby growe perfect, his experience be confirmed, and that little knowledge he hath in the Italian tongue be much betterd, his ambition hauing euer beene to be cunning in that language. These reasons and others, being put into the ballance, weighed downe her feares, and so she yeilded at length to let him goe. Ferdinand (hauing winde and water, as swift as his owne wishes) in a short time arriued at Venice (one of the wonders, for a City, in the world, as hauing the foundation layd in, and the whole frame of the building raised out of the Mediteranean Sea.) His commodities being excellent good, and exceeding rich, dwelt not long in the shippe, But on Siluer pullies were drawne into Uenetian-merchants houses, who payd him downe for them presently: so that his purse was soone full, but his eyes and longings empty, of inioying the Rarities of that renowned Citie, Some few dayes made him Master of them all: The Rialta was as familiar to him, as the Exchange in Cornehill is to Merchants, or the new Burse in the Strand is to Courtiers, and Lawyers: Saint Markes Church, hee knew as well as Paules Steeple, and the Murano , where all the Venice -glasses are made, hee visited more often then Vintners doe the glasse-house in Broadstreete , to furnish themselues there with these brittle carowsing bowles. The Arsenale , (which is a Store, house, to arme both men, and gallyes with all warlike prouision) by mony and friendship, he went into with desire, and came forth with admiration. The many thousands of bridges, which crosse euery streete through the whole Citie, put him into as much wonder, as London bridge did a Northren man, who at first gaping at it, swore hee thought in his conscience it cost aboue vortie shillings. His eyes could neuer haue beene bloodshotten had they onely fed vpon these obiects: as it was no hurt for him to looke vpon wood, and stone, and workemen: nor to haue beene caryed in one of their Uenetian Gundeloes , rowing vp and downe the riuer (that embraces the Citie) called the Grand Canale. None of these inticing flowers caryed poison in their sent. No: As before in London hee was insnard by one English whore, so here found hee ten thousand Uenetian Courtizans, the worst of them all, hauing sorcery enough in her eyes and behauiour, to inchant him. With the butterfly hee flew from herbe to herbe, and from weed to weed, but in the end alighted vpon one, which he liked aboue all the rest. Here he stayed, Here hee set vp his rest. It was a creature sufficiently faire, had she bene indifferently good and resonably-good shee might haue beene, but that the custome of the countrey (which authorizeth Brothelry) makes her beleeue, it is not sinne in her, so to sell and prostitute her body, and in her body her soule. You talke of the poore Cat-a-mountaines in Turne-bull , who venture vpon the pikes of damnation for singlemoney; and you wonder at the fethered Estridges in Westminster, Strand, Bloomsbury &c. how they can liue; where these Venetian Madonaes , carry the ports of Ladyes, liue in houses faire enough to entertaine Lords. Into such a lodging was Ferdinando receiued, vpon such a Curtizan did he fasten his lustfull affection. No gold was spared to warme her white hands with the fires of such sparckling Sunne-beames: No musick keepe dumb by her whose voice shee knew would entice him to heare it. This Strumpets name was Liuia Ferramonti , well-descended, and therefore taught by her education, how to winne, and how to hold fast, when once shee had a man in her nets. Her behauiour was pleasing, her complements courtly, her apparence Stately, yet how strongly-guarded soeuer this Castle of beauty, seemed by her eyes, (in shew disdainefull) and a tongue proud in parlies, yet Fernand mounting his siluer Ordinance, chargde with golden bullets, the Fort of womanish frailty, quickly yeilded, but vpon this composition, that hee should suffer no other Italian dame but herselfe share in her embraces; ielozie is a booke that all our Italian dames, and signiors reade, and if (quoth shee) you euer giue me cause to open that book (strung with yellow ribbon) I shal giue you cause to curse my acquaintance, and you wil teach me hereafter to hate for euer an Englishman. Hee told her, (nay most vehemently protested, by the faith of a gentleman, and by all those fires burning in the breast of a Louer,) that she should haue no cause to speake to him that language. And so, shee (being a Merchantesse for the flesh, and to sell her ware, as deare as shee could hold it vp) agreed with Ferdinand , that for 500 crownes a moneth, hee should Inioy her body, her bed, her house, and all that belonged to her command. The greatest Magnifico in Venice (shee told him) would bee glad to bee sharer with two more, and so inioy her by tournes, yet each of them to allow her so poore a Summe: nay the brauest Clarissimo , to inioy her, as now shee comes to him, (alone) would into her Apron euery moneth cast a thousand crownes, but hee being an englishman, and gratious in her eye, shee would exact but that slender hire: It being the custome of Venice , that whatsoeuer a Courtizan, and a whoremaster bargaynes for, (be it for a day, a night, a weeke, a moneth, or a yeare) shee has law on her side to recouer it, and make him pay it, and she is his (for that time) as absolutely as a beast bought in Smythfield, or a rotten ioynt of mutton sold at pye-corner: Her Enamorato being likewise (during the continuance of this agreemet) more sure of his Itlia hackney, tha many englishmen are of their wiues, though a housholdfull of eyes be fixed vpon them; for if shee flyes out from him to any other, an action at the case here is nothing to that case, which the Bona roba , shall be in there, if once shee be found faulty: moneths, and moneths were consumed in libidinous and adulterous embraces, by these two; Ferdinand , euer and anon, sending into England some slight Italian toyes to his wife with letters, expressing his great care to increase his estate, kept him so long from her, and that the delight hee tooke in seeing those Cities, and noble entertainement hee found amongst those Merchants, had caryed him vp higher into the countrey, but that hee would shorten his iourney and cut off much of his imployment, out of a desire to be agen in the armes of his Annabell . Shee good soule belieued all this, vpon receipt of her husbands letters; but he intended no such matter. Hee was too fast entangled in the allurements of a Wanton, and too farre engaged in purse and reputation to get off without exceeding losse, if not danger of life. For when an Italian Strumpet feeles her Louer flying from her, and in disdaine leauing her, a poysoned banquet, or a stab from a Panderly Brauo , soone ends her discontentment. But our Bristow Merchant was too farre plunged in affection, to fall off, or grow coole in desires to her, vpon whose beauties he did more than doate: And therefore to shew that he was a right English-man, who will venture life and liuing, and all that hee hath in the world, before hee will loose his Wench, hee not onely (more than his bargaine tyed him, of 500. crownes a moneth) had in banquets, costly Dinners and Suppers, and rich new Gownes and Tires for her, spent a world of money vpon her: but also, (the faster as he thought to tye her to him, though he could not easily shake her off) hee bestowed a company of admirable faire Iewels vpon his dearest Liuia . Faire were those Iewels in outward shew (as the wearer of them was) but many (or rather most) of the Stones were counterfet. For Ferdinand , by meanes of keeping company with many braue Italian Merchants, came acquainted with a Uenetian Iew, (whose name was Caleb Mosolomon . This Iewe was wondrous wealthy and wondrous wary, and as wicked in his wayes to get mony (especially from Christians) as any of his Hebrew tribes could be. Ferdinand came oft to his house, and was as often welcommed, but this feast of Iewish welcomes should be payd for at last in the tale of the reckoning. Mosolomon had abundance of as costly, true, and pretious Iewels of all fashions, as could be made, or bought for gold and siluer in the world, for it was his trade to deale with most Princes in Christendome by his Factours for such Commodities; but as amongst men and women some are good, some bad: So Caleb (our subtill Iew) perceiuing Ferdinand to be an vnthrift, that his Ships rich lading was swallowed vp, in a Uenetian gulph, (a Uenetian Whore) and that to fill such a Barne, a foole cared not, what corne field hee reaped, nor from whose Sheafes he stole (were it but a handfull) hee saw he would sinke, and therefore to rid him out of his paine, hee would tye some of his Plummets to his heeles. Hereupon, shewing one day, to our Bristow Lapidarie (that dealt in none but false Stones) a goodly heape of counterfet Iewels, (as faire to the eye, as any that were worne in Italy , and the falshood not easie to be found out, but by a very cunning workman) hee liked them so well, that being wondrous importunate to buy them, albeit the Iew held them at an vnreasonable rate, yet he had them for Time, a Bond being drawne to pay to Mosolomon , double the value, if he had not his mony iust vpon the day. The match pleased them both, the Iew laughed in his sleeue, to see how hee had ouerreached a leacherous Christian, and the other as proudly hastned to his Italian Hen-Sparrow, to shew what costly and glorious Feathers he had bought to stick her with; the Iewels were with thousands of thanks receiued, and as many kisses payd backe to him on his lips, which he accepted as a sufficient satisfaction. The day of payment for these Iewels being come, the Iew (as busie as a Kite ouer his prey) soares ouer Ferdinands lodging, still looking when the money would be tendred: but a day or two being past ouer, and no Cash appearing, Caleb leapes for ioy, that now he shall haue the double: the Forfaiture to him would be as a feast; a Christian to lye in Prison at his Suite, was a brauer triumph than when Turkish Gallies boord English Pirates: he sweares by his Hebrew Tribe from whence he is descended: hee will flea him aliue with miseries, if he hath not his monies: not a Christian Farthing of Copper, or Brasse, no, not an olde Leaden Chandlers Token should be abated. An Officer, (nay a whole kennell of Hounds are let loose to seize vpon him, and to dragge him to Prison. But Ferdinand , being an English-man, and vnderstanding by his experience of London and Bristow , what it was to fall into Catchpoles hands, and how such Beagles where they fastned, did not onely bite, but draw bloud, kept himselfe out of the way, so that Ben Mosolomon was ready to runne mad with anger: that Iewes-trump in his mouth (his tongue) playd nothing but curses, his great nose swell'd twice so much as it was before, by his thumping end plucking it, almost off from his face, in rage, to thinke he should be so cousoned by a wenching Rascall, a Christian Whoremaster, and yet he said to himselfe, It was no wonder for him to be so gull'd, sithence twas too well knowne that English-men are as cunning as any Cheaters in the world. In this interim of Ferdinand his wasting of his youth, his estate, and his honour, and the hazarding both of life and soule vpon an enticing Strumpet; Did one Signior Iouanni Guidanes returne to Venice from trauell: hee had before he went, made choise (amongst all the faces in that Citty) of this Liuia Ferachoise to be his Mistresse, Shee perceiuing by the Iew, and others of whom Ferdinand had taken vp round summes of money, how the windes blew, and that the breath of his fortunes grew colder and colder, and being glad to heare that Iouanni was come home, writ a few wanton, but witty Uerses, (for the Italian Women are excellent in those qualities) to welcome him from Trauell, and to inuite him to her lodging, vnknowne to her English sweetheart, who now hung the wing, as being full of sicke feathers. A stately Banquet (one appointed euening) was prepared at the Curtizans House, to which Signior Iouanni , attended vpon with one man onely, came, with resolution to renew his loue to his sweetest Mistresse, and that night to pay such tribute to her embraces, as was due to her by his so long absence. Ferdinand not daring in the day to walke the streetes, came mufled in his cloake in the darke, with a Rapier by his side, to visite his Lady; and spying euery roome so full of lights, as if all the Starres had forsooke the Moone, to come and shine in her lodging, and (withall) hearing admirable voyces and instruments within, for shee had prouided all content, to please Iouanni: Ferdinand boldly knock'd at dore, presuming he had payd deere enough for the opening of her Wicket. A Brauo ; or ruffianly hee-Bawde comes, and tels him, there was no Cushion for him to sit vpon to night; another was made Doctor of his Italian Chaire; the Ring-taile which hee lou'd to cut vp, was to be seru'd vp, and be layd on a Uenetian Gentlemans Trencher (one Signior Iouanni Guidanes, Sonne to rich Antonio Guidanes , one of the chiefest Clarisimo's ) and so bidding him to be packing, or if he were so hot for a Whore, there were enough i'th Citty, and if hee could not fall vpon them, Stand there still and coole his heeles, and (with that) shut the dores vpon him. Iealousie and Reuenge, the Furies that haunt euery Italian, layd hold (vpon this base affront of the Pandar) on Ferdinand , the cust[illeg.] of the people, and the inconstancy of the Women, teaching euen Strangers, if they dwell but a while amongst them, to snatch the fire-brandes out of those two Furies hands, and to be as madde as the Uenetians themselves. Taking therefore this abuse offered to him by the Brauo , for an act of the Mistris, as knowing hee durst not haue done so without her consent, hee vowes to kill this Iouanni , whatsoeuer hee should be, leauing his body at her very dores, as the monument of a Strumpets falsehood, and an englishmans noble reuenge vpon a corriuall, and this done by the ayde of darknes to escape, get a gundelo, and so shifting from Venice to fly first into France , ouer the Alpes, & after that into England . For this purpose the Spleenefull Ferdinand , walkes vp and downe, watching when this gallant should come forth; but hee was too fast lockd in his Mistresses armes, to take any danger from a naked rapier: yet going to bedde with his beloued Madona , hee commanded his man to get him to his lodging, and attend for him next morning. The fellow being lighted out of dores, and Ferdinand , who stood watching, not knowing the Master from the man, tooke this to bee the gentleman that wrongd him, and so running at him, the glimpse of the candle made him spie the weapon, which nimbly though hee put by, yet was hee wounded in two or three places, murder then being cryed, and more candles being held out at seuerall windowes, the seruant that was hurt, was carryed off, and Ferdinand haled to prison. The next morning, criminall Iudges hauing the examination of this businesse, the Brauo giuing in euidence that he came to his Mistresses house, to quarrell, and doe some mischiefe, and Ferdinand being halfe mad that his reuenge fell so vnluckily on a poore vnworthy fellow, his aime being (as hee confest freely) to haue sped that Iouanni , who lodged there that night, in the armes of a Strumpet, whose flesh hee had bought, and paid dearely for: the matter then grew more fowle in that besides the drawing-blood from one, his intent was to murder another, yea and to murder such a gentleman so nobly descended as Guidanel was, for the loue, which all Venice bare, both to father, and sonne, the whole senate set a heauy fine on Ferdinands head, for his intent of murder, and albeit the fellowes wounds were not mortall, yet was hee (besides a doome of imprisonment) adiudged to pay for the cure, and to satisfie the seruant for his hurts. The Iew (hearing of this imprisonment) laughed, and leaped for ioy, that the great fish was taken, which brake through his net, but sithence hee was in, hee would weare out his fingers ends, with tying knots, but hee should be fast enough, and so layd an Action vpon him of 14000. crownes. He then hoping for all this to finde some comfort at his Mistrisses hands, writ in Italian to her, but shee vnderstood not his language: to him shee could not send, (without loosing an Italian-friend worth twenty English) and come to him shee would not. Upon this, casting his eyes backe at his fore-passed fortunes, and his now present miseries, hee began to thinke that heauen had iustly layd this shame and these crosses vpon him, for not still making vse of that counsell which the Marriner in shape of a Beggar, gaue to him for his wifes single Penny: had hee followed it, comming to this Curtizan in Venice , as hee did when hee tryed that other in England, hee had neuer met such occasion to curse his folly, in making himselfe a mockery to all his country-men, especially to Merchants, but most especially to the Merchants in Bristow . To call to minde the wrongs done to his wife, was to him more then a death to thinke what summes of money his lust, and riot had in Venice consumed, euery piece of siluer fetchd drops of blood from his heart. Hee that flung away pounds would now bee glad of a Penny: hee wished himselfe in his owne countrey, sitting in some high way begging one single farthing, with no worse a conscience than those poore wretches, his country-men doe, that so liue vpon good mens charity: would hee (hee cryes out) had liued so euer: hee should not then answere for the lauish wasting of that, which was sufficient to maintaine thousands, where now, the remembrance of those fond expences as much torment his soule, as the want of the money afflicts his body; happy, he protests, are those that begging a farthing-token, and making vp, foure of them, peraduenture sit now in England by a good fire, with a cuppe of strong drink in their hand, where I in this noisome and stincking dungeon, would be glad of cleane water to quench my thirst, and of a coale of fire to blow my nayles ouer. Being driuen almost to the very dores of despaire, by these miseries, the last refuge hee had was to send for his wife from Bristow , and to perswade her with all possible speede to turne all the estate hee left with her, all his plate, all her chaynes, rings, and iewells, yea euen to sell all his houshold- stuffe, to turne it into money, and if euer shee loued him, now to shew it, by redeeming him from a miserable captiuity: That word, if euer shee did loue him, was a charme strong enough to make her fly ouer worlds of waters, and wildernesses of land to finde him out, and found to set him at liberty, and being free from Iewes, Harlots, hard-hearted Christians, to lay him in her warme bosome, to forgiue whats past, to vpbrayd him with nothing, and in his wants to loue him as dearely, as euer shee did in his greatest abundance. And all this did the vertuous woman (his wife.) Suppose then you see them both come fro beyond seas, not so beaten with windes and waues, as bitten by hunger. His dissolute courses causing all his owne friends to scorne to cast an eye of pitty on him, and the constant loue shee carryed to her distressed husband, taking from her friends all desire to helpe or comfort her, lest hee should be a sharer in those benefits. So that not a Sunne-beame of compassion shining from any friends, kindred, or acquaintance vpon either of them, in the end they both, (by the intercession, and teares, and modest countenance of the woman, got to be trusted with a few pipes, a little tobacco, and a small narrow shop, which was both their halt, bed-chamber, kitchen and Celler. This was but a poore liuing for him, that had wont to fraight ships with rich commodities, now to sit filling a pipe of tobacco; and for a penny, that single penny comes oft into his minde, and vpbrayds him with his ill husbandry. The world is changed with him, it runs not now vpon wheeles, as once it did: hee that was wont to make Tauernes roare with the noise of gallon pots, and drawers to run vp stayres, and downe stayres, crying anon, anon, onely at his call, is now glad without any roaring or noyse-making, to be any mans drawer for a penny-pot of ale & his braue fires in a Tauerne chimney, are turned to a little panne of small coales, ouer which hee sits blowing, to light his customers pipes; his riotous dinners and Suppers are forgotten, and instead of them, a poore dinner of sprats, now and then, for fish dayes, and a sheepes Geather or a sheepes head on fleshdayes, and very good cheere too: in former times, neither hee or his wife could tell what a fasting day meant, but now they could hardly meete with any other; and albeit a man that has euer gon with full pockets, continually fed at full tables, and neuer felt what want was, could not without much repining, cursing, and disdaine, vndergoe so low and wretched a course of life: yet with such a noble patience did his vertuous wife, both beare her owne sorrowes, and councelled him not to sinck vnder his, that hee by her example was as Iouiall , in this his pouerty, as euer before hee was in plenty, and (how great soeuer their wants were knowen to themselues) yet would shee sett a goodface vpont, and not once shew a sad or heauy countenance, for feare to displease, or discomfort her husband. It was a wonder to see, and heare, how people would descant vpon these two, for their making shift to liue in this order; Some laughed him to scorne, and said, pride had now caught a fall, the Peacocks fethers were plucked, and such like, others were glad to see him take any honest course to liue, considering in what high brauery hee spread his sailes before, but all persons (both men and women, did mightily commend the wife, who in all these misfortunes was neuer seene to knit a brow, or heard to vpbrayd her husband with any of his dissolute former courses, by which they were both brought to this beggery. It being then bruited vp and downe the City, that Ferdinand , the braue young Merchant that came from Bristow , was fallen to decay, and liude in that meane manner as you haue heard before, a gentleman who knew him when hee was in his Iollity, and had taken notice of the state hee was in now, came to the Courtizan vpon whom hee spent so much in London , when he called her Mistris, and as a most strange newes told her, that her seruant Ferdinand , (whom she followed to Bristow ) was in London , but exceeding poore. A pox on him quoth shee) so when I was in Bristow , hee put a trick vpon mee, and came like a roague to mee in his plymouth-cloake, and cheated mee of all the rings, Iewells, bracelets, and any thing of any worth, that euer he gaue me, sending me home like a sheepe new shorne with scarce any wooll on my back: why then said the gentleman, hees payd in the same crackd money, which hee deliuered to you; Hee that shaued is now shauen, and so close cut, that what wooll, you carryed on your back, I know not, but I feare hee has scarce wooll, or skin on his back, for hee is so poore that his wife and he are glad to keepe a tobacco-shop: a tobacco-shop (cryed his quondam Mistris) O strang. It shall neuer be said, that I loued a man, in his brauery, and would not looke vpo him in his necessity, the iniury he did me at Bristow , I deserued it, and pardon it: his wrongs I forget, but not him, the many iouiall dayes and nights hee and I haue spent together, are so freshly, and deepely printed in my memory, that if I should not with gladnesse call them to minde, I would count my selfe ingratefull. It shall neuer be reported that a man, a gentleman, a noble-minded young fellow, spent his money vpon mee, when hee was full of golden pieces, and let them fly, but now hee wants those pieces, and is become poore, I will spend part of what I haue, vpon him. This is not the common humor of mad wenches (such as I am) about the Citie, that get their liuing by the labour of their thighes, and care not so they suck mens estates (like their bodies) to the bare bones: I am altred from the creature, I was at Bristow , and so, intreating the gentleman, to direct her to the shoppe which Ferdinand kept, shee making herselfe very gallant, went thither, whom hee beholding, blushed, as red as fire, for shame shee came vpon him so vnwares, into so homely a roome, his wife and hee being so meanely habited: But this Mistris of his, (being a wench of a lusty spirit) stepd to his wife, and kissing her, told her, shee was come to begge pardon for a robbery shee had committed, in stealing away her husband, some dayes from her board, and some nights from her pillow: but protests hee shall neuer play the trewant more with her: is sorry for what was past, and wishes hee had layd out his riots at no worse a market in Venice , then hee met with, in London , and that his Italian banquet had beene no dearer then that which shee inuited him to in England. Annabell in a milde voice, tels her partner, that shee has crost the booke of all former reckonings: the debt of her anger (both at her, and her husband) is all payd, shee forgiues them both, so, they runne no more vpon a new score with her, which both of them vow neuer to doe, and then the Courtizan swearing likewise neuer againe to breake into her orchard, to steale away those apples, which are for her owne eating, nor if shee can helpe it, neuer hereafter to come into the company of her husband, in some part of satisfaction towards all expences betweene them, shee deliuers to his wife as a free gift, twenty Pieces, and so takes her leaue in this vnexpected kindnesse, conquering all ill opinion conceiued against her, and that small summe of money of twenty peices, redeeming all the lauish spendings vpon his Mistris, and making more amends to Ferdinands wife, then all his riotous layings out, did doe her hurt before. Misfortunes sildome walke alone, and so when blessings doe knocke at a mans dore, they lightly are not without followers and fellowes. For iust vpon this golden visitation (not vsually put in practice by creatures of her quality) came home Theobald , the Marriner from Sea, vpon whom our Bristow Merchant at his Wifes request, bestowed one hunded pound, for the good he receiued by the single Penny; and trusted him with another hundred pound to be repayed, if euer heauens should send him a Boone voyage , that he might be able to spare it: With those two hundred pounds this Marriner playing the good Husband beyond the Seas, in Barbary , and other places within the Straights , had so encreased his Stocke, that hee was esteemed a rich man, and his credite very good vpon the Exchange: He comming to this Tobacco-Shop, his face much sunne- burnt with trauell, and his cheekes growne ouer with haire, called for a Pipe of smoake, and was not knowne. Ferdinand perceiuing by his tann'd complexion, and habite, that he was a Sea-man, asked in what part of the world he had lately beene, and the other replying, both in Barbary , and some other places within the Straights, Ferdinand prayes him to tell him, if hee knowes not one Theobald , and whether he saw him not in Barbary , yes (quoth Theobald ) I both knew him, and saw him; but now hee's past either my knowledge or sight in this world, for these very hands help'd to bury him in the bottome of the Sea, where he dyed. Ferdinand started at this, and looking pale, with a deepe sigh from his heart, exprest a great deale of sorrow for the losse of so faithfull and honest a friend; and his Wife hearing the sad Storie, clapping her hand on her knee (as she sate) O sweet heart (said she) if Theobald be gone, the best of our hopes lye a dying: for it was likely, if euer heauen had prospered him, he would not haue showne himselfe vnthankfull to you or to me, for the courtesies you and I did him. No remedy (quoth her Husband) wee must all dye one day, and since one of our best Cards is out of the bunch, let vs shuffle and cut in the world as well as wee can: one good, true friend as he was, (reckoning the treachery amongst men in these dayes) is worth a rocke of Diamonds, and though we are cheated of him by death, yet let vs two be true to one another, for the loue of man and wife is the noblest friendship. By this time, our Marriner, or rather now our Merchant, had whiff'd off three Pipes of Tobacco, for which he was to pay three pence. And drawing out a whole handfull of gold, told them, he had no white mony, & they could not change any one peece; yet looking in another pocket, hee asked if they would take Tokens, yes (said Ferdinand ) they are as welcome to mee now, as Angels and double Soueraines haue beene in diebus illis , in my mad dayes, (for I haue spent some.) The other then told him, he could make but eight Tokens, and that was but two pence, a penny lesse than his due; no matter Sir (answered our new Tobacco-man) for his sake whom you say you knew, and saw him buried at Sea, let it alone, you shall pay nothing, and if you please, drinke as much more; nay, cryed tother, shall I goe a'th score, or drinke in forma pauperis , my Pockets hauing such gay lynings in them. See, see, I now can make vp your money, for there's eight Tokens, and a single penny in siluer (looke you) tyed with a string through the hole in it, for feare of running away, and I can tell you, I part very vnwillingly with that Penny: Ferdinand and his Wife seeing the silke string, and noting the Penny, O (cryed she) Husband, this is the single Penny you had of me, when you went to Sea, and which afterwards you tyed about his arme that is dead. I did indeede (said he) and he swore, it should neuer from his arme, so long as there was any breath in his body. He was as good as his word then (replyed Theobald ) for when he yeelded vp the ghost, I (as before he bid me) tooke it from his arme: And because you shall know I am no counterfet Messenger, looke vpon me well, hath my kissing the sunne so altred my face, I am that Theobald , this is the same Penny, for which you gaue me an hundred pound in gold, for the good it did you: that Penny hath done me good too, I am a made man by it, and shall not onely my selfe euer loue a Penny, but counsell euery man else to make much of a Penny when he hath it; It is a Beggers stock, and a rich mans stewardship. You my noble Captaine, and worthy Master, made one lucky Uoyage with it, and brought home Witte for it, (though since I heare, by your trauelling without it, you came home a looser:) I haue made another Uoyage with the same Penny, and praise be giuen to heauen, I haue brought home wealth by it: Much am I in your debt, but am come honestly to pay you all: you bestowed this single Penny vpon me, when you tooke me for a Begger, I returne your owne Penny backe againe vpon you, whom I now take, not to be very rich: the one hundred pound my good Mistresse woo'd you to giue me, behold I lay for them an hundred golden pictures in her lap, with the other hundred pound you trusted me with, to be payd, when the Seas and I playing together, I should get a lucky hand: that houres come, I now haue it, and all that I am owner of, comming to mee by your meanes, not onely euery Penny that is mine shall be yours, but euery pound be sent of an errand to fetch in profit. Hee was as good as his word, for he lent them so much money, as put him againe into his trade of Merchandize, and at this houre is he a very worthy Merchant in London .
