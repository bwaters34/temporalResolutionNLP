His purpo[s]e is neither [s]elfi[s]h nor temporary, but aims at the illu[s]tration of [s]ome important branches of the moral con[s]titution of man. Whether this tale will be cla[s][s]ed with the ordinary or [s]rivolous [s]ources of amu[s]ement, or be ranked with the few productions who[s]e u[s]efulne[s]s [s]ecures to them a la[s]ting reputation, the reader mu[s]t be permitted to decide. The incidents related are extraordinary and rare. Some of them, perhaps, approach as nearly to the nature of miracles as can be done by that which is not truly miraculous. It is hoped that intelligent readers will not di[s]approve of the manner in which appearances are [s]olved, but that the [s]olution will be found to corre[s]pond with the known principles of human nature. The power which the principal per[s]on is [s]aid to possess can [s]carcely be denied to be real. It mu[s]t be acknowledged to be extremely rare; but no fact, equally uncommon, is supported by the [s]ame [s]trength of hi[s]torical evidence. Some readers may think the conduct of the younger Wieland impo[s][s]ible. In [s]upport of its po[s][s]ibility the Writer mu[s]t appeal to Phy[s]icians and to men conver[s]ant with the latent [s]prings and occa[s]ional perver[s]ions of the human mind. It will not be objected that the in[s]tances of [s]imilar delu[s]ion are rare, becau[s]e it is the bu[s]ine[s]s of moral painters to exhibit their subject in its mo[s]t in[s]tructive and memorable forms. If hi[s]tory furni[s]hes one parallel fact, it is a [s]ufficient vindication of the Writer; but mo[s]t readers will probably recollect an authentic ca[s]e, remarkably [s]imilar to that of Wieland. It will be nece[s][s]ary to add, that this narrative is addre[s][s]ed, in an epi[s]tolary form, by the Lady who[s]e [s]tory it contains, to a [s]mall number of friends, who[s]e curio[s]ity, with regard to it, had been greatly awakened. It may likewi[s]e be mentioned, that the[s]e events took place between the conclu[s]ion of the French and the beginning of the revolutionary war. The memoirs of Carwin, alluded to at the conclu[s]ion of the work, will be publi[s]hed or [s]uppre[s][s]ed according to the reception which is given to the pre[s]ent attempt. C. B. B.

[ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-010.jpg) \- external link  - Page 001. ] I Feel little reluctance in complying with your reque[s]t. You know not fully the cau[s]e of my [s]orrows. You are a [s]tranger to the depth of my di[s]tre[s][s]es. Hence your efforts at con[s]olation mu[s]t nece[s][s]arily fail. Yet the tale that I am going to tell is not intended as a claim upon your [s]ympathy. In the mid[s]t of my de[s]pair, I do not dildain to contribute what little I can to the benefit of mankind. I acknowledge your right to be informed of the events that have lately happened in my family. Make what u[s]e of the tale you [s]hall think proper. If it be communicated to the world, it will inculcate the duty of avoiding deceit. It will exemplify the force of early impre[s][s]ions, and [s]how the immeasurable evils that flow from an erroneous or imperfect di[s]cipline. My [s]tate is not de[s]titute of tranquillity. The [s]entiment that dictates my feelings is not hope. Futurity has no power over my thoughts. To all that is to come I am perfectly indifferent. With [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-011.jpg) \- external link  - Page 002. ] regard to my[s]elf, I have nothing more to fear. Fate has done its wor[s]t. Henceforth, I am callous to misfortune. I addre[s]s no [s]upplication to the Deity. The power that governs the cour[s]e of human affairs has cho[s]en his path. The decree that a[s]certained the condition of my life, admits of no recal. No doubt it [s]quares with the maxims of eternal equity. That is neither to be que[s]tioned nor denied by me. It suffices that the pa[s]t is exempt from mutation. The [s]torm that tore up our happine[s]s, and changed into drearine[s]s and de[s]ert the blooming [s]cene of our existence, is lulled into grim repo[s]e; but not until the victim was transfixed and mangled; till every ob[s]tacle was di[s][s]ipated by its rage; till every remnant of good was wre[s]ted from our gra[s]p and exterminated. How will your wonder, and that of your companions, be excited by my [s]tory! Every [s]entiment will yield to your amazement. If my te[s]timony were without corroborations, you would reject it as incredible. The experience of no human being can furni[s]h a parallel: That I, beyond the re[s]t of mankind, [s]hould be re[s]erved for a de[s]tiny without alleviation, and without example! Li[s]ten to my narrative, and then [s]ay what it is that has made me de[s]erve to be placed on this dreadful eminence, if, indeed, every faculty be not [s]u[s]pended in wonder that I am [s]till alive, and am able to relate it. My father's ance[s]try was noble on the paternal [s]ide; but his mother was the daughter of a merchant. My grand-father was a younger brother, and a native of Saxony. He was placed, when he had reached the [s]uitable age, at a German college. During the vacations, he employed him[s]elf in traversing the neighbouring territory. On one [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-012.jpg) \- external link  - Page 003. ] occasion it was his fortune to vi[s]it Hamburg. He formed an acquaintance with Leonard Wei[s]e, a merchant of that city, and was a frequent gue[s]t at his hou[s]e. The merchant had an only daughter, for whom his gue[s]t [s]peedily contracted an affection; and, in [s]pite of parental menaces and prohibitions, he, in due [s]ea[s]on, became her hu[s]band. By this act he mortally offended his relations. Thenceforward he was entirely di[s]owned and rejected by them. They refu[s]ed to contribute any thing to his [s]upport. All intercour[s]e cea[s]ed, and he received from them merely that treatment to which an ab[s]olute [s]tranger, or dete[s]ted enemy, would be entitled. He found an a[s]ylum in the hou[s]e of his new father, who[s]e temper was kind, and who[s]e pride was flattered by this alliance. The nobility of his birth was put in the balance again[s]t his poverty. Wei[s]e conceived him[s]elf, on the whole, to have acted with the highe[s]t di[s]cretion, in thus di[s]po[s]ing of his child. My grand-father found it incumbent on him to [s]earch out [s]ome mode of independent [s]ub[s]i[s]tence. His youth had been eagerly devoted to literature and mu[s]ic. The[s]e had hitherto been cultivated merely as [s]ources of amu[s]ement. They were now converted into the means of gain. At this period there were few works of ta[s]te in the Saxon dialect. My ance[s]tor may be con[s]idered as the [s]ounder of the German Theatre. The modern poet of the [s]ame name is [s]prung from the [s]ame family, and, perhaps, [s]urpa[s][s]es but little, in the fruitfulness of his invention, or the [s]oundne[s]s of his ta[s]te, the elder Wieland. His life was [s]pent in the compo[s]ition of [s]onatas and dramatic pieces. They were not unpopular, but merely afforded him a [s]canty [s]ub[s]i[s]tence. He died in the bloom of his life, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-013.jpg) \- external link  - Page 004. ] and was quickly followed to the grave by his wife. Their only child was taken under the protection of the merchant. At an early age he was apprenticed to a London trader, and pa[s][s]ed [s]even years of mercantile [s]ervitude. My father was not fortunate in the character of him under who[s]e care he was now placed. He was treated with rigor, and full employment was provided for every hour of his time. His duties were laborious and mechanical. He had been educated with a view to this profe[s][s]ion, and, therefore, was not tormented with un[s]atisfied de[s]ires. He did not hold his pre[s]ent occupations in abhorrence, becau[s]e they withheld him from paths more flowery and more [s]mooth, but he found in unintermitted labour, and in the [s]ternne[s]s of his ma[s]ter, [s]ufficient occasions for di[s]content. No opportunities of recreation were allowed him. He [s]pent all his time pent up in a gloomy apartment, or traver[s]ing narrow and crowded [s]treets. His food was coar[s]e, and his lodging humble. His heart gradually contracted a habit of moro[s]e and gloomy reflection. He could not accurately define what was wanting to his happine[s]s. He was not tortured by compari[s]ons drawn between his own [s]ituation and that of others. His [s]tate was [s]uch as [s]uited his age and his views as to fortune. He did not imagine him[s]elf treated with extraordinary or unju[s]tifiable rigor. In this re[s]pect he [s]uppo[s]ed the condition of others, bound like him[s]elf to mercantile [s]ervice, to re[s]emble his own; yet every engagement was irk[s]ome, and every hour tedious in its lap[s]e. In this [s]tate of mind he chanced to light upon a book written by one of the teachers of the Albigenses, or French Prote[s]tants. He entertained no [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-013a.jpg) \- external link  - Page 005. ] reli[s]h for books, and was wholly uncon[s]cious of any power they po[s][s]e[s][s]ed to delight or in[s]truct. This volume had lain for years in a corner of his garret, half buried in du[s]t and rubbi[s]h. He had marked it as it lay; had thrown it, as his occa[s]ions required, from one [s]pot to another; but had felt no inclination to examine its contents, or even to inquire what was the [s]ubject of which it treated. One Sunday afternoon, being induced to retire for a few minutes to his garret, his eye was attracted by a page of this book, which, by [s]ome accident, had been opened and placed full in his view. He was [s]eated on the edge of his bed, and was employed in repairing a rent in [s]ome part of his clothes. His eyes were not confined to his work, but occasionally wandering, lighted at length upon the page. The words "Seek and ye [s]hall find," were tho[s]e that fir[s]t offered them[s]elves to his notice. His curiosity was rou[s]ed by the[s]e [s]o far as to prompt him to proceed. As [s]oon as he fini[s]hed his work, he took up the book and turned to the fir[s]t page. The further he read, the more inducement he found to continue, and he regretted the decline of the light which obliged him for the pre[s]ent to clo[s]e it. The book contained an expo[s]ition of the doctrine of the [s]ect of Cami[s][s]ards, and an hi[s]torical account of its origin. His mind was in a [s]tate peculiarly fitted for the reception of devotional sentiments. The craving which had haunted him was now [s]upplied with an object. His mind was at no lo[s]s for a theme of meditation. On days of business, he ro[s]e at the dawn, and retired to his chamber not till late at night. He now [s]upplied him[s]elf with candles, and employed his nocturnal and Sunday hours in [s]tudying this book. It, of cour[s]e, abounded with allu[s]ions to the Bible. All its [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-015.jpg) \- external link  - Page 006. ] conclusions were deduced from the [s]acred text. This was the fountain, beyond which it was unnece[s][s]ary to trace the [s]tream of religious truth; but it was his duty to trace it thus far. A Bible was ea[s]ily procured, and he ardently entered on the [s]tudy of it. His under[s]tanding had received a particular direction. All his reveries were fa[s]hioned in the [s]ame mould. His progre[s]s towards the formation of his creed was rapid. Every fact and [s]entiment in this book were viewed through a medium which the writings of the Camissard apo[s]tle had [s]ugge[s]ted. His con[s]tructions of the text were ha[s]ty, and formed on a narrow [s]cale. Every thing was viewed in a di[s]connected po[s]ition. One action and one precept were not employed to illu[s]trate and re[s]trict the meaning of another. Hence aro[s]e a thou[s]and [s]cruples to which he had hitherto been a [s]tranger. He was alternately agirated by fear and by ec[s]tacy. He imagined him[s]elf be[s]et by the [s]nares of a [s]piritual foe, and that his [s]ecurity lay in cea[s]ele[s]s watchfulne[s]s and prayer. His morals, which had never been loo[s]e, were now modelled by a [s]tricter [s]tandard. The empire of religious duty extended it[s]elf to his looks, ge[s]tures, and phra[s]es. All levities of [s]peech, and negligences of behaviour, were pro[s]cribed. His air was mournful and contemplative. He laboured to keep alive a [s]entiment of fear, and a belief of the awe-creating pre[s]ence of the Deity. Ideas foreign to this were [s]edulou[s]ly excluded. To [s]uffer their intru[s]ion was a crime again[s]t the Divine Maje[s]ty inexpiable but by days and weeks of the keene[s]t agonies. No material variation had occurred in the lap[s]e of two years. Every day confirmed him in his pre[s]ent modes of thinking and acting. It was to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-014.jpg) \- external link  - Page 007. ] be expected that the tide of his emotions would [s]ometimes recede, that intervals of de[s]pondency and doubt would occur; but the[s]e gradually were more rare, and of [s]horter duration; and he, at la[s]t, arrived at a [s]tate con[s]iderably uniform in this re[s]ect. His apprentice[s]hip was now almo[s]t expired. On his arrival of age he became entitled, by the will of my grand-father, to a [s]mall [s]um. This [s]um would hardly [s]uffice to [s]et him afloat as a trader in his pre[s]ent [s]ituation, and he had nothing to expect from the genero[s]ity of his ma[s]ter. Re[s]idence in England had, be[s]ides, become almo[s]t impo[s][s]ible, on account of his religious tenets. In addition to the[s]e motives for [s]eeking a new habitation, there was another of the mo[s]t imperious and irre[s]i[s]table nece[s][s]ity. He had imbibed an opinion that it was his duty to di[s][s]eminate the truths of the go[s]pel among the unbelieving nations. He was terrified at fir[s]t by the perils and hard[s]hips to which the life of a mi[s][s]onary is expo[s]ed. This cowardice made him diligent in the invention of objections and excu[s]es; but he found it impo[s][s]ible wholly to [s]hake off the belief that [s]uch was the injunction of his duty. The belief, after every new conflict with his passions, acquired new [s]trength; and, at length, he formed a re[s]olution of complying with what he deemed the will of heaven. The North-American Indians naturally pre[s]ented them[s]elves as the fir[s]t objects for this [s]pecies of benevolence. As [s]oon as his [s]ervitude expired, he converted his little fortune into money, and embarked for Philadelphia. Here his fears were revived, and a nearer [s]urvey of [s]avage manners once more [s]hook his re[s]olution. For a while he relinquished his purpo[s]e, and purcha[s]ing a farm on Sehuylkill, within a few miles of the city, [s]et [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-017.jpg) \- external link  - Page 008. ] himself down to the cultivation of it. The cheapne[s]s of land, and the [s]ervice of African [s]laves, which were then in general u[s]e, gave him who was poor in Europe all the advantages of wealth. He pa[s][s]ed fourteen years in a thrifty and laborious manner. In this time new objects, new employments, and new a[s][s]ociates appeared to have nearly obliterated the devout impre[s][s]ions of his youth. He now became acquainted with a woman of a meek and quiet di[s]po[s]ition, and of [s]lender acquirements like him[s]elf. He proffered his hand and was accepted. His previous indu[s]try had now enabled him to di[s]pen[s]e with per[s]onal labour, and direct attention to his own concerns. He enjoyed lei[s]ure, and was vi[s]ited afre[s]h by devotional contemplation. The reading of the [s]criptures, and other religious books, became once more his favorite employment. His ancient belief relative to the conver[s]ion of the savage tribes, was revived with uncommon energy. To the former ob[s]tacles were now added the pleadings of parental and conjugal love. The [s]truggle was long and vehement; but his [s]en[s]e of duty would not be [s]tifled or enfeebled, and finally triumphed over every impediment. His efforts were attended with no permanent success. His exhortations had [s]ometimes a temporary power, but more frequently were repelled with insult and deri[s]ion. In pur[s]uit of this object he encountered the mo[s]t imminent perils, and underwent incredible fatigues, hunger, [s]ickne[s]s, and [s]olitude. The licence of [s]avage pa[s][s]ion, and the artifices of his depraved countrymen, all oppo[s]ed them[s]elves to his progre[s]s. His courage did not for[s]ake him till there appeared no rea[s]onable ground to hope for [s]ucce[s]s. He de[s]i[s]ted not till his heart was relieved from the [s]uppo[s]ed obligation to per[s]evere. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-016.jpg) \- external link  - Page 009. ] With a con[s]titution [s]omewhat decayed, he at length returned to his family. An interval of tranquillity [s]ucceeded. He was [s]rugal, regular, and [s]trict in the performance of dome[s]tic duties. He allied himself with no [s]ect, becau[s]e he perfectly agreed with none. Social wor[s]hip is that by which they are all di[s]tingui[s]hed; but this article found no place in his creed. He rigidly interpreted that precept which enjoins us, when we wor[s]hip, to retire into solitude, and [s]hut out every [s]pecies of [s]ociety. According to him devotion was not only a [s]ilent office, but mu[s]t be performed alone. An hour at noon, and an hour at midnight were thus appropriated. At the di[s]tance of three hundred yards from his hou[s]e, on the top of a rock who[s]e [s]ides were [s]teep, rugged, and encumbered with dwarf cedars and [s]tony a[s]perities, he built what to a common eye would have [s]eemed a [s]ummer-hou[s]e. The ea[s]tern verge of this precipice was [s]ixty feet above the tiver which flowed at its foot. The view before it con[s]i[s]ted of a tran[s]parent current, fluctuating and rippling in a rocky channel, and bounded by a rising [s]cene of cornfields and orchards. The edifice was [s]light and airy. It was no more than a circular area, twelve feet in diameter, who[s]e flooring was the rock, cleared of mo[s]s and [s]hrubs, and exactly levelled, edged by twelve Tu[s]can columns, and covered by an undulating dome. My father furni[s]hed the dimen[s]ions and outlines, but allowed the arti[s]t whom he employed to complete the structure on his own plan. It was without [s]eat, table, or ornament of any kind. This was the temple of his Deity. Twice in twenty-four hours he repaired hither, unaccompanied by any human being. Nothing but phy[s]ical inability to move was allowed to ab[s]truct or [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-019.jpg) \- external link  - Page 010. ] postpone this vi[s]it. He did not exact from his family compliance with his example. Few men, equally [s]incere in their faith, were as [s]paring in their censures and re[s]trictions, with re[s]pect to the conduct of others, as my father. The character of my mother was no le[s]s devout; but her education had habituated her to a different mode of wor[s]hip. The loneline[s]s of their dwelling prevented her from joining any e[s]tabli[s]hed congregation; but [s]he was punctual in the offices of prayer, and in the performance of hymns to her Saviour, after the manner of the di[s]ciples of Zinzendorf. My father refused to interfere in her arrangements. His own [s]y[s]tem was embraced not, accurately [s]peaking, because it was the be[s]t, but becau[s]e it had been expreslly pre[s]cribed to him. Other modes, if practifed by other per[s]ons, might be equally acceptable. His deportment to others was full of charity and mildne[s]s. A [s]adne[s]s perpetually over[s]pread his features, but was unmingled with [s]ternne[s]s or discontent. The tones of his voice, his ge[s]tures, his [s]teps were all in tranquil uni[s]on. His conduct was characterised by a certain forbearance and humility, which [s]ecured the e[s]teem of tho[s]e to whom his tenets were mo[s]t obnoxious. They might call him a fanatic and a dreamer, but they could not deny their veneration to his invincible candour and invariable integrity. His own belief of rectitude was the foundation of his happine[s]s. This, however, was de[s]tined to find an end. Suddenly the [s]adne[s]s that con[s]tantly attended him was deepened. Sighs, and even tears, [s]ometimes e[s]caped him. To the expo[s]tulations of his wife he [s]eldom an[s]wered any thing. When he de[s]igned to be communicative, he hinted that his peace of mind was flown, in con[s]equence of deviation from [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-018.jpg) \- external link  - Page 011. ] his duty. A command had been laid upon him, which he had delayed to perform. He felt as if a certain period of he[s]itation and reluctance had been allowed him, but that this period was pa[s][s]ed. He was no longer permitted to obey. The duty assigned to him was transferred, in con[s]equence of his di[s]obedience, to another, and all that remained was to endure the penalty. He did not de[s]cribe this penalty. It appeared to be nothing more for [s]ome time than a [s]en[s]e of wrong. This was [s]ufficiently acute, and was aggravated by the belief that his offence was incapable of explation. No one could contemplate the agonies which he [s]eemed to [s]uffer without the deepest compa[s][s]ion. Time, in[s]tead of lightening the burthen, appeared to add to it. At length he hinted to his wife, that his end was near. His imagination did not prefigure the mode or the time of his decea[s]e, but was fraught with an incurable persuasion that his death was at hand. He was likewise haunted by the belief that the kind of death that a waited him was [s]trange and terrible. His anticipations were thus far vague and indefinite; but they [s]ufficed to poi[s]on every moment of his being, and devote him to cea[s]ele[s]s angui[s]h. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-021.jpg) \- external link  - Page 012. ] Early in the morning of a [s]ultry day in August, he left Mettingen, to go to the city. He had [s]eldom pa[s][s]ed a day from home [s]ince his return from the [s]hores of the Ohio. Some urgent engagements at this time exi[s]ted, which would not admit of further delay. He returned in the evening, but appeared to be greatly oppre[s][s]ed with fatigue. His [s]ilence and dejection were likewi[s]e in a more than ordinary degree con[s]picuous. My mother's brother, who[s]e profe[s][s]ion was that of a [s]urgeon, chanced to [s]pend this night at our hou[s]e. It was from him that I have frequently received an exact account of the mournful cata[s]trophe that followed. As the evening advanced, my father's inquietudes increa[s]ed. He [s]at with his family as u[s]ual, but took no part in their conver[s]ation. He appeared fully engro[s][s]ed by his own reflections. Occasionally his countenance exhibited tokens of alarm; he gazed [s]tedfa[s]tly and wildly at the ceiling; and the exertions of his companions were [s]carcely sufficient to interrupt his reverie. On recovering from the[s]e fits, he expre[s][s]ed no [s]urprize; but pre[s][s]ing his hand to his head, complained, in a tremulous and terrified tone, that his brain was [s]corched to cinders. He would then betray marks of in[s]upportable anxiety. My uncle perceived, by his pul[s]e, that he was indisposed, but in no alarming degree, and a[s]cribed appearances chiefly to the workings of his mind. He exhorted him to recollection and compo[s]ure, but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-020.jpg) \- external link  - Page 013. ] in vain. At the hour of repo[s]e he readily retired to his chamber. At the per[s]ua[s]ion of my mother he even undre[s][s]ed and went to bed. Nothing could abate his re[s]tle[s][s]ne[s]s. He checked her tender expostulations with [s]ome [s]ternne[s]s. "Be [s]ilent," [s]aid he, "for that which I feel there is but one cure, and that will [s]hortly come. You can help me nothing. Look to your own condition, and pray to God to [s]trengthen you under the calamities that await you." "What am I to fear?" [s]he answered. "What terrible di[s]a[s]ter is it that you think of?" "Peace---as yet I know it not my[s]elf, but come it will, and [s]hortly." She repeated her inquiries and doubts; but he [s]uddenly put an end to the di[s]cour[s]e, by a [s]tern command to be [s]ilent. She had never before known him in this mood. Hitherto all was benign in his deportment. Her heart was pierced with [s]orrow at the contemplation of this change. She was utterly unable to account for it, or to figure to her[s]elf the [s]pecies of di[s]a[s]ter that was menaced. Contrary to cu[s]tom, the lamp, in[s]tead of being placed on the hearth, was left upon the table. Over it again[s]t the wall there hung a [s]mall clock, [s]o contrived as to [s]trike a very hard [s]troke at the end of every [s]ixth hour. That which was now approaching was the [s]ignal for retiring to the fane at which he addre[s][s]ed his devotions. Long habit had occasioned him to be always awake at this hour, and the toll was in[s]tantly obeyed. Now frequent and anxious glances were ca[s]t at the clock. Not a [s]ingle movement of the index appeared to e[s]cape his notice. As the hour verged towards twelve his anxiety vi[s]ibly augmented. The trepidations of my mother kept pace with tho[s]e of her hu[s]band; but [s]he was intimidated into [s]ilence. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-023.jpg) \- external link  - Page 014. ] All that was left to her was to watch every change of his features, and give vent to her [s]ympathy in tears. At length the hour was [s]pent, and the clock tolled. The [s]ound appeared to communicate a [s]hock to every part of my father's frame. He ro[s]e immediately, and threw over him[s]elf a loo[s]e gown. Even this office was performed with difficulty, for his joints trembled, and his teeth chattered with dismay. At this hour his duty called him to the rock, and my mother naturally concluded that it was thither he intended to repair. Yet the[s]e incidents were [s]o uncommon, as to fill her with astonishment and foreboding. She [s]aw him leave the room, and heard his [s]teps as they ha[s]tily de[s]cended the [s]tairs. She half re[s]olved to ri[s]e and pur[s]ue him, but the wildne[s]s of the [s]cheme quickly [s]ugge[s]ted it[s]elf. He was going to a place whither no power on earth could induce him to [s]uffer an attendant. The window of her chamber looked toward the rock. The atmo[s]phere was clear and calm, but the edifice could not be di[s]covered at that di[s]tance through the du[s]k. My mother's anxiety would not allow her to remain where [s]he was. She ro[s]e, and [s]eated her[s]elf at the window. She [s]trained her [s]ight to get a view of the dome, and of the path that led to it. The fir[s]t painted it[s]elf with [s]ufficient di[s]tinctne[s]s on her fancy, but was undi[s]tingui[s]hable by the eye from the rocky ma[s]s on which it was erected. The [s]econd could be imperfectly [s]een; but her hu[s]band had already pa[s][s]ed, or had taken a different direction. What was it that [s]he feared? Some di[s]a[s]ter impended over her hu[s]band or her[s]elf. He had predicted evils, but profe[s][s]ed him[s]elf ignorant of what nature they were. When were they to come? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-022.jpg) \- external link  - Page 015. ] Was this night, or this hour to witne[s]s the accomplishment? She was tortured with impatience, and uncertainty. All her fears were at pre[s]ent linked to his per[s]on, and [s]he gazed at the clock, with nearly as much eagerne[s]s as my father had done, in expectation of the next hour. An half hour pa[s][s]ed away in this [s]tate of suspence. Her eyes were fixed upon the rock; suddenly it was illuminated. A light proceeding from the edifice, made every part of the [s]cene vi[s]ible. A gleam diffu[s]ed it[s]elf over the intermediate [s]pace, and in[s]tantly a loud report, like the explo[s]ion of a mine, followed. She uttered an involuntary [s]hriek, but the new [s]ounds that greeted her ear, quickly conquered her [s]urpri[s]e. They were piercing [s]hrieks, and uttered without intermi[s][s]ion. The gleams which had diffu[s]ed them[s]elves far and wide were in a moment withdrawn, but the interior of the edifice was filled with rays. The fir[s]t [s]ugge[s]tion was that a pi[s]tol was discharged, and that the [s]tructure was on fire. She did not allow her[s]elf time to meditate a [s]econd thought, but ru[s]hed into the entry and knocked loudly at the door of her brother's chamber. My uncle had been previou[s]ly rou[s]ed by the noi[s]e, and in[s]tantly flew to the window. He al[s]o imagined what he [s]aw to be fire. The loud and vehement [s]hrieks which [s]ucceeded the fir[s]t explo[s]ion, [s]eemed to be an invocation of [s]uccour. The incident was inexplicable; but he could not fail to perceive the propriety of ha[s]tening to the [s]pot. He was unbolting the door, when his [s]i[s]ter's voice was heard on the out[s]ide conjuring him to come forth. He obeyed the [s]ummons with all the [s]peed in his power. He [s]topped not to que[s]tion her, but hurried down [s]tairs and acro[s]s the meadow which lay [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-025.jpg) \- external link  - Page 016. ] between the hou[s]e and the rock. The [s]hrieks were no longer to be heard; but a blazing light was clearly di[s]cernible between the columns of the temple. Irregular [s]teps, hewn in the [s]tone, led him to the [s]ummit. On three [s]ides, this edifice touched the very verge of the cliff. On the fourth [s]ide, which might be regarded as the front, there was an area of [s]mall extent, to which the rude [s]tairca[s]e conducted you. My uncle [s]peedily gained this [s]pot. His [s]trength was for a moment exhau[s]ted by his ha[s]te. He pau[s]ed to re[s]t him[s]elf. Meanwhile he bent the mo[s]t vigilant attention towards the object before him. Within the columns he beheld what he could no better de[s]cribe, than by [s]aying that it re[s]embled a cloud impregnated with light. It had the brightness of flame, but was without its upward motion. It did not occupy the whole area, and ro[s]e but a few feet above the floor. No part of the building was on fire. This appearance was a[s]toni[s]hing. He approached the temple. As he went forward the light retired, and, when he put his feet within the apartment, utterly vani[s]hed. The [s]uddenne[s]s of this tran[s]ition increa[s]ed the darkne[s]s that [s]ucceeded in a tenfold degree. Fear and wonder rendered him powerle[s]s. An occurrence like this, in a place a[s][s]igned to devotion, was adapted to intimidate the [s]toute[s]t heart. His wandering thoughts were recalled by the groans of one near him. His [s]ight gradually recovered its power, and he was able to di[s]cern my father [s]tretched on the floor. At that moment, my mother and [s]ervants arrived with a lanthorn, and enabled my uncle to examine more clo[s]ely this [s]cene. My father, when he left the hou[s]e, be[s]ides a loo[s]e upper ve[s]t and [s]lippers, wore a [s]hirt and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-024.jpg) \- external link  - Page 017. ] drawers. Now he was naked, his [s]kin throughout the greater part of his body was [s]corched and brui[s]ed. His right arm exhibited marks as of having been [s]truck by [s]ome heavy body. His clothes had been removed, and it was not immediately perceived that they were reduced to a[s]hes. His [s]lippers and his hair were untouched. He was removed to his chamber, and the requisite attention paid to his wounds, which gradually became more painful. A mortification [s]peedily [s]hewed it[s]elf in the arm, which had been mo[s]t hurt. Soon after, the other wounded parts exhibited the like appearance. Immediately [s]ub[s]equent to this di[s]a[s]ter, my father [s]eemed nearly in a [s]tate of in[s]en[s]ibility. He was pa[s][s]ive under every operation. He [s]carcely opened his eyes, and was with difficulty prevailed upon to an[s]wer the que[s]tions that were put to him. By his imperfect account, it appeared, that while engaged in [s]ilent ori[s]ons, with thoughts full of confusion and anxiety, a faint gleam [s]uddenly [s]hot athwart the apartment. His fancy immediately pictured to it[s]elf, a per[s]on bearing a lamp. It [s]eemed to come from behind. He was in the act of turning to examine the vi[s]itant, when his right arm received a blow from a heavy club. At the [s]ame in[s]tant, a very bright [s]park was [s]een to light upon his clothes. In a moment, the whole was reduced to a[s]hes. This was the [s]um of the information which he cho[s]e to give. There was somewhat in his manner that indicated an imperfect tale. My uncle was inclined to believe that half the truth had been [s]uppre[s][s]ed. Meanwhile, the di[s]ea[s]e thus wonderfully generated, betrayed more terrible [s]ymptoms. Fever and delirium terminated in lethargic [s]lumber, which, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-027.jpg) \- external link  - Page 018. ] in the cour[s]e of two hours, gave place to death. Yet not till in[s]upportable exhalations and crawling putrefaction had driven from his chamber and the hou[s]e every one whom their duty did not detain. Such was the end of my father. None [s]urely was ever more my[s]terious. When we recollect his gloomy anticipations and unconquerable anxiety; the [s]ecurity from human malice which his character, the place, and the condition of the times, might be [s]uppo[s]ed to confer; the purity and cloudlessness of the atmo[s]phere, which rended it impo[s][s]ible that lightning was the cau[s]e; what are the conclusions that we mu[s]t form? The prelu[s]ive gleam, the blow upon his arm, the fatal [s]park, the explo[s]ion heard [s]o far, the fiery cloud that environed him, without detriment to the [s]tructure, though compo[s]ed of combustible materials, the [s]udden vani[s]hing of this cloud at my uncle's approach---what is the inference to be drawn from the[s]e facts? Their truth cannot be doubted. My uncle's te[s]timony is peculiarly worthy of credit, becau[s]e no man's temper is more [s]ceptical, and his belief is unalterably attached to natural cau[s]es. I was at this time a child of [s]ix years of age. The impre[s][s]ions that were then made upon me, can never be effaced. I was ill qualified to judge re[s]pecting what was then pa[s][s]ing; but as I advanced in age, and became more fully acquainted with the[s]e facts, they oftener became the [s]ubject of my thoughts. Their re[s]emblance to recent events revived them with new force in my memory, and made me more anxious to explain them. Was this the penalty of di[s]obedience? this the [s]troke of a vindictive and invi[s]ible hand? Is it a fre[s]h proof that the Divine Ruler interferes in human affairs, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-026.jpg) \- external link  - Page 019. ] meditates an end, [s]elects, and commi[s][s]ions his agents, and enforces, by unequivocal [s]anctions, [s]ubmi[s][s]ion to his will? Or, was it merely the irregular expan[s]ion of the fluid that imparts warmth to our heart and our blood, cau[s]ed by the fatigue of the preceding day, or flowing, by e[s]tabli[s]hed laws, from the condition of his thoughts? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-029.jpg) \- external link  - Page 020. ] The [s]hock which this di[s]a[s]trous occurrence occa[s]ioned to my mother, was the foundation of a di[s]ea[s]e which carried her, in a few months, to the grave. My brother and my[s]elf were children at this time, and were now reduced to the condition of orphans. The property which our parents left was by no means incon[s]iderable. It was entru[s]ted to faithful hands, till we [s]hould arrive at a [s]uitable age. Meanwhile, our education was a[s][s]igned to a maiden aunt who re[s]ided in the city, and who[s]e tenderne[s]s made us in a [s]hort time cea[s]e to regret that we had lo[s]t a mother. The years that [s]ucceeded were tranquil and happy. Our lives were mole[s]ted by few of tho[s]e cares that are incident to childhood. By accident more than de[s]ign, the indulgence and yielding temper of our aunt was mingled with re[s]olution and [s]tedfa[s]tne[s]s. She [s]eldom deviated into either extreme of rigour or lenity. Our [s]ocial plea[s]ures were [s]ubject to no unrea[s]onable re[s]traints. We were in[s]tructed in mo[s]t branches of u[s]eful knowledge, and were [s]aved from the corruption and tyranny of colleges and boarding-[s]chools. Our companions were chiefly [s]elected from the children of our neighbours. Between one of the[s]e and my brother, there quickly grew the mo[s]t affectionate intimacy. Her name was Catharine Pleyel. She was rich, beautiful, and contrived to blend the mo[s]t bewitching [s]oftne[s]s with the mo[s]t exuberant vivacity. The tie by which my brother and [s]he were united, [s]eemed to add force to the love which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-030.jpg) \- external link  - Page 021. ] I bore her, and which was amply returned. Between her and my[s]elf there was every circum[s]tance tending to produce and [s]ofter friend[s]hip. Our [s]ex and age were the [s]ame. We lived within [s]ight of each other's abode. Our tempers were remarkably congenial, and the [s]uperintendants of our education not only pre[s]cribed to us the [s]ame pur[s]uits, but allowed us to cultivate them together. Every day added [s]trength to the triple bonds that united us. We gradually withdrew our[s]elves from the [s]ociety of others, and found every moment irk[s]ome that was not devoted to each other. My brother's advance in age made no change in our [s]ituation. It was determined that his profe[s][s]ion [s]hould be agriculture. His fortune exempted him from the nece[s][s]ity of per[s]onal labour. The ta[s]k to be performed by him was nothing more than superintendance. The [s]kill that was demanded by this was merely theoretical, and was furni[s]hed by ca[s]ual in[s]pection, or by clo[s]et [s]tudy. The attention that was paid to this [s]ubject did not [s]eclude him for any long time from us, on whom time had no other effect than to augment our impatience in the absence of each other and of him. Our ta[s]ks, our walks, our mu[s]ic, were [s]eldom performed but in each other's company. It was ea[s]y to [s]ee that Catharine and my brother were born for each other. The pa[s][s]ion which they mutually entertained quickly broke tho[s]e bounds which extreme youth had [s]et to it; confessions were made or extorted, and their union was po[s]tponed only till my brother had pa[s][s]ed his minority. The previous lap[s]e of two years was constantly and u[s]efully employed. O my brother! But the ta[s]k I have [s]et my[s]elf let me perform with [s]teadine[s]s. The felicity of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-031.jpg) \- external link  - Page 022. ] that period was marred by no gloomy anticipations. The future, like the pre[s]ent, was [s]erene. Time was [s]uppo[s]ed to have only new delights in [s]tore. I mean not to dwell on previous incidents longer than is nece[s][s]ary to illu[s]trate or explain the great events that have [s]ince happened. The nuptial day at length arrived. My brother took possession of the hou[s]e in which he was born, and here the long protracted marriage was [s]olemnized. My father's property was equally divided between us. A neat dwelling, [s]ituated on the bank of the river, three quarters of a mile from my brother's, was now occupied by me. The[s]e domains were called, from the name of the fir[s]t po[s][s]e[s][s]or, Mettingen. I can [s]carcely account for my refusing to take up my abode with him, unle[s]s it were from a di[s]po[s]ition to be an economi[s]t of plea[s]ure. Self-denial, [s]ea[s]onably exerci[s]ed, is one means of enhancing our gratifications. I was, be[s]ide, desirous of admini[s]tering a fund, and regulating an hou[s]ehold, of my own. The [s]hort di[s]tance allowed us to exchange vi[s]its as often as we plea[s]ed. The walk from one man[s]ion to the other was no undelightful prelude to our interviews. I was sometimes their vi[s]itant, and they, as frequently, were my gue[s]ts. Our education had been modelled by no religious [s]tandard. We were left to the guidance of our own under[s]tanding, and the ca[s]ual impre[s][s]ions which [s]ociety might make upon us. My friend's temper, as well as my own, exempted us from much anxiety on this account. It mu[s]t not be [s]uppo[s]ed that we were without religion, but with us it was the product of lively feelings, excited by reflection on our own happine[s]s, and by the grandeur of external nature. We [s]ought not a ba[s]is [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-032.jpg) \- external link  - Page 023. ] for our faith, in the weighing of proofs, and the di[s][s]ection of creeds. Our devotion was a mixed and ca[s]ual [s]entiment, [s]eldom verbally expre[s][s]ed, or [s]olicitou[s]ly [s]ought, or carefully retained. In the mid[s]t of pre[s]ent enjoyment, no thought was bestowed on the future. As a con[s]olation in calamity religion is dear. But calamity was yet at a distance, and its only tendency was to heighten enjoyments which needed not this addition to [s]atisfy every craving. My brother's [s]ituation was [s]omewhat different His deportment was grave, con[s]iderate, and thoughtful. I will not [s]ay whether he was indebted to [s]ublimer views for this di[s]po[s]ition. Human life, in his opinion, was made up of changeable elements, and the principles of duty were not ea[s]ily unfolded. The future, either as anterior, or [s]ub[s]equent to death, was a [s]cene that required [s]ome preparation and provi[s]ion to be made for it. The[s]e po[s]itions we could not deny, but what di[s]tingui[s]hed him was a propen[s]ity to ruminate on the[s]e truths. The images that vi[s]ited us were blith[s]ome and gay, but tho[s]e with which he was mo[s]t familiar were of an oppo[s]ite hue. They did not generate affliction and fear, but they di[s][s]u[s]ed over his behaviour a certain air of forethought and [s]obriety. The principal effect of this temper was vi[s]ible in his features and tones. The[s]e, in general, be[s]poke a [s]ort of thrilling melancholy. I [s]carcely ever knew him to laugh. He never accompanied the lawle[s]s mirth of his companions with more than a [s]mile, but his conduct was the [s]ame as ours. He partook of our occupations and amu[s]ements with a zeal not le[s]s than ours, but of a different kind. The diver[s]ity in our temper was never the parent of di[s]cord, and was [s]carcely a topic of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-033.jpg) \- external link  - Page 024. ] regret. The [s]cene was variegated, but not tarni[s]hed or di[s]ordered by it. It hindered the element in which we moved from [s]tagnating. Some agitation and concu[s][s]ion is requi[s]ite to the due exerci[s]e of human under[s]tanding. In his [s]tudies, he pur[s]ued an au[s]terer and more arduous path. He was much conver[s]ant with the hi[s]tory of religious opinions, and took pains to a[s]certain their validity. He deerned it indi[s]pen[s]able to examine the ground of his belief, to [s]ettle the relation between motives and actions, the criterion of merit, and the kinds and properties of evidence. There was an obvious re[s]emblance between him and my father, in their conceptions of the importance of certain topics, and in the light in which the vici[s][s]itudes of human life were accu[s]tomed to be viewed. Their characters were [s]imilar, but the mind of the [s]on was enriched by [s]cience, and embellished with literature. The temple was no longer a[s][s]igned to its ancient u[s]e. From an Italian adventurer, who erroneously imagined that he could find employment for his [s]kill, and [s]ale for his [s]culptures in America, my brother had purcha[s]ed a bu[s]t of Cicero. He profe[s][s]ed to have copied this piece from an antique dug up with his own hands in the environs of Modena. Of the truth of his a[s][s]ertions we were not qualified to judge; but the marble was pure and poli[s]hed, and we were contented to admire the performance, without waiting for the [s]anction of connoisseurs. We hired the [s]ame arti[s]t to hew a [s]uitable pede[s]tal from a neighbouring quarry. This was placed in the temple, and the bu[s]t re[s]ted upon it. Oppo[s]ite to this was a harp[s]ichord, [s]heltered by a temporary roof from the weather. This was the place of re[s]ort in the evenings of [s]ummer. Here [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-034.jpg) \- external link  - Page 025. ] we [s]ung, and talked, and read, and occa[s]ionally banqueted. Every joyous and tender [s]cene mo[s]t dear to my memory, is connected with this edifice. Here the performances of our mu[s]ical and poetical ancestor were rehear[s]ed. Here my brother's children received the rudiments of their education; here a thou[s]and conver[s]ations, pregnant with delight and improvement, took place; and here the [s]ocial affections were accu[s]tomed to expand, and the tear of delicious [s]ympathy to be [s]hed. My brother was an indefatigable [s]tudent. The authors whom he read were numerous, but the chief object of his veneration was Cicero. He was never tired of conning and rchear[s]ing his productions. To under[s]tand them was not [s]ufficient. He was anxious to di[s]cover the ge[s]tures and cadences with which they ought to be delivered. He was very [s]crupulous in [s]electing a true [s]cheme of pronuciation for the Latin tongue, and in adapting it to the words of his darling writer. His favorite occupation con[s]i[s]ted in embelli[s]hing his rhetoric with all the proprieties of ge[s]ticulation and utterance. Not contented with this, he was diligent in settling and re[s]toring the purity of the text. For this end, he collected all the editions and commentaries that could be procured, and employed months of [s]evere [s]tudy in exploring and comparing them. He never betrayed more [s]atisfaction than when he made a di[s]covery of this kind. It was not till the addition of Henry Pleyel, my friend's only brother, to our [s]ociety, that his pa[s][s]ion for Roman eloquence was countenanced and fostered by a [s]ympathy of ta[s]tes. This young man had been [s]ome years in Europe. We had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-035.jpg) \- external link  - Page 026. ] separated at a very early age, and he was now returned to [s]pend the remainder of his days among us. Our circle was greatly enlivened by the acce[s][s]ion of a new member. His conver[s]ation abounded with novelty. His gaiety was almo[s]t boi[s]terous, but was capable of yielding to a grave deportment, when the occa[s]ion required it. His di[s]cernment was acute, but he was prone to view every object merely as [s]upplying materials for mirth. His conceptions were ardent but ludicrous, and his memory, aided, as he hone[s]tly acknowledged, by his invention, was an inexhau[s]tible fund of entertainment. His re[s]idence was at the [s]ame di[s]tance below the city as ours was above, but there [s]eldom pa[s][s]ed a day without our being favoured with a vi[s]it. My brother and he were endowed with the [s]ame attachment to the Latin writers; and Pleyel was not behind his friend in his knowledge of the hi[s]tory and metaphy[s]ics of religion. Their creeds, however, were in many re[s]pects oppo[s]ite. Where one discovered only confirmations of his faith, the other could find nothing but rea[s]ons for doubt. Moral nece[s][s]ity, and calvini[s]tic in[s]piration, were the props on which my brother thought proper to repo[s]e. Pleyel was the champion of intellectual liberty, and rejected all guidance but that of his rea[s]on. Their di[s]cu[s][s]ions were frequent, but, being managed with candour as well as with [s]kill, they were always li[s]tened to by us with avidity and benefit. Pleyel, like his new friends, was fond of mu[s]ic and poctry. Henceforth our concerts con[s]i[s]ted of two violins, an harp[s]ichord, and three voices. We were frequently reminded how much [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-036.jpg) \- external link  - Page 027. ] happiness depends upon [s]ociety. This new friend, though, before his arrival, we were [s]en[s]ible of no vacuity, could not now be [s]pared. His departure would ocen[s]ion a void which nothing could till, and which would produce in[s]upportable regrer, Even my brother, though his opinions were hourly a[s][s]ailed, and even the divinity of Cicero conte[s]ted, was captivated with his friend, and laid a[s]ide [s]ome part of his ancient gravity at Pleyel's approach. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-037.jpg) \- external link  - Page 028. ] Six years of uninterrupted happine[s]s had rolled away, [s]ince my brother's marriage. The [s]ound of war had been heard, but it was at [s]uch a distance as to enhance our enjoyment by affording objects of compari[s]on. The Indians were repulsed on the one [s]ide, and Canada was conquered on the other. Revolutions and battles, however calamitous to tho[s]e who occupied the [s]cene, contributed in [s]ome [s]ort to our happine[s]s, by agitating our minds with curio[s]ity, and furni[s]hing cau[s]es of patriotic exultation. Four children, three of whom were of an age to compen[s]ate, by their per[s]onal and mental progre[s]s, the cares of which they had been, at a more helple[s]s age, the objects, exerci[s]ed my brother's tenderne[s]s. The fourth was a charming babe that promi[s]ed to di[s]play the image of her mother, and enjoyed perfect health. To the[s]e were added a [s]weet girl fourteen years old, who was loved by all of us, with an affection more than parental. Her mother's [s]tory was a mournful one. She had come hither from England when this child was an infant, alone, without friends, and without money. She appeared to have embarked in a ha[s]ty and clande[s]tine manner. She pa[s][s]ed three years of [s]olitude and angui[s]h under my aunt's protection, and died a martyr to woe; the [s]ource of which [s]he could, by no importunities, be prevailed upon to unfold. Her education and manners be[s]poke her to be of no mean birth. Her la[s]t moments were rendered [s]erene, by the a[s][s]urances [s]he received from [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-038.jpg) \- external link  - Page 029. ] my aunt, that her daughter [s]hould experience the [s]ame protection that had been extended to her[s]elf. On my brother's marriage, it was agreed that [s]he [s]hould make a part of his family. I cannot do ju[s]tice to the attractions of this girl. Perhaps the tenderne[s]s [s]he excited might partly originate in her per[s]onal re[s]emblance to her mother, who[s]e character and misfortunes were [s]till fre[s]h in our remembrance. She was habitually pen[s]ive, and this circum[s]tance tended to remind the [s]pectator of her friendle[s]s condition; and yet that epithet was [s]urely mi[s]applied in this ca[s]e. This being was cheri[s]hed by tho[s]e with whom [s]he now re[s]ided, with un[s]peakable fondne[s]s. Every exertion was made to enlarge and improve her mind. Her [s]afety was the object of a [s]olicitude that almo[s]t exceeded the bounds of di[s]cretion. Our affection indeed could [s]carcely tran[s]cend her merits. She never met my eye, or occurred to my reflections, without exciting a kind of enthu[s]ia[s]in. Her [s]oftne[s]s, her intelligence, her equanimity, never [s]hall I [s]ee surpassed. I have often [s]hed tears of plea[s]ure at her approach, and pre[s][s]ed her to my bo[s]om in an agony of fondne[s]s. While every day was adding to the charms of her per[s]on, and the [s]tores of her mind, there occurred an event which threatened to deprive us of her. An officer of [s]ome rank, who had been di[s]abled by a wound at Quebec, had employed him[s]elf, [s]ince the ratification of peace, in travelling through the colonies. He remained a con[s]iderable period at Philadelphia, but was at la[s]t preparing for his departure. No one had been more frequently honoured with his vi[s]its than Mrs. Baynton, a worthy lady with whom our family were intimate. He went to her house with a view to perform a farewell vi[s]it, and was on [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-039.jpg) \- external link  - Page 030. ] the point of taking his leave, when I and my young friend entered the apartment. It is impo[s][s]ible to de[s]cribe the emotions of the [s]tranger, when he fixed his eyes upon my companion. He was motionless with [s]urpri[s]e. He was unable to conceal his feelings, but [s]at [s]ilently gazing at the [s]pectacle before him. At length he turned to Mrs. Baynton, and more by his looks and ge[s]tures than by words, be[s]ought her for an explanation of the [s]cene. He [s]eized the hand of the girl, who, in her turn, was [s]urpri[s]ed by his behaviour, and drawing her forward, [s]aid in an eager and faultering tone, Who is [s]he? whence does [s]he come? what is her name? The an[s]wers that were given only increa[s]ed the confu[s]ion of his thoughts. He was [s]ucce[s][s]ively told, that [s]he was the daughter of one who[s]e name was Loui[s]a Conway, who arrived among us at [s]uch a time, who [s]eduou[s]ly concealed her parentage, and the motives of her flight, who[s]e incurable griefs had finally de[s]troyed her, and who had left this child under the protection of her friends. Having heard the tale, he melted into tears, eagerly cla[s]ped the young lady in his arms, and called him[s]elf her father. When the tumults excited in his brea[s]t by this unlooked-for meeting were [s]omewhat [s]ub[s]ided, he gratified our curio[s]ity by relating the following incidents. "Mi[s]s Conway was the only daughter of a banker in London, who di[s]charged towards her every duty of an affectionate father. He had chanced to fall into her company, had been [s]ubdued by her attractions, had tendered her his hand, and been joyfully accepted both by parent and child. His wife had given him every proof of the fonde[s]t attachment. Her father, who po[s][s]e[s][s]ed immen[s]e wealth, treated him with di[s]tingui[s]hed re[s]pect, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-040.jpg) \- external link  - Page 031. ] liberally [s]upplied his wants, and had made one condition of his con[s]ent to their union, a re[s]olution to take up their abode with him. "They had pa[s][s]ed three years of conjugal felicity, which had been augmented by the birth of this child; when his profe[s][s]ional duty called him into Germany. It was not without an arduous [s]truggle, that [s]he was per[s]uaded to relinqui[s]h the de[s]ign of accompanying him through all the toils and perils of war. No parting was ever more di[s]tre[s]sful. They [s]trove to alleviate, by frequent letters, the evils of their lot. Tho[s]e of his wife, breathed nothing but anxiety for his [s]afety, and impatience of his absence. At length, a new arrangement was made, and he was obliged to repair from We[s]tphalia to Canada. One advantage attended this change. It afforded him an opportunity of meeting his family. His wife anticipated this interview, with no le[s]s rapture than him[s]elf. He hurried to London, and the moment he alighted from the [s]tage-coach, ran with all [s]peed to Mr. Conway's hou[s]e. "It was an hou[s]e of mourning. His father was overwhelmed with grief, and incapable of answering his inquiries. The [s]ervants, [s]orrowful and mute, were equally refractory. He explored the hou[s]e, and called on the names of his wife and daughter, but his [s]ummons was fruitle[s]s. At length, this new di[s]a[s]ter was explained. Two days before his arrival, his wife's chamber was found empty. No [s]earch, however diligent and anxious, could trace her [s]teps. No cau[s]e could be a[s][s]igned for her di[s]appearance. The mother and child had fled away together. "New exertions were made, her chamber and cabinets were ran[s]acked, but no ve[s]tige was found [s]erving to inform them as to the motives of her [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-041.jpg) \- external link  - Page 032. ] flight whether it had been voluntary or otherwi[s]e, and in what corner of the kingdom or of the world [s]he was concealed. Who [s]hall de[s]cribe the [s]orrow and amazement of the hu[s]band? His re[s]tle[s][s]ne[s]s, his vici[s][s]itudes of hope and fear, and his ultimate de[s]pair? His duty called him to America. He had been in this city, and had frequently pa[s][s]ed the door of the hou[s]e in which his wife, at that moment, re[s]ided. Her father had not remitted his exertions to elucidate this painful my[s]tery, but they had failed. This di[s]appointment ha[s]tened his death; in consequence of which, Loui[s]a's father became po[s][s]e[s][s]or of his immen[s]e property." This tale was a copious theme of [s]peculation. A thou[s]and que[s]tions were [s]tarted and di[s]cu[s][s]ed in our dome[s]tic circle, re[s]pecting the motives that influenced Mrs. Stuart to abandon her country. It did not appear that her proceeding was involuntary. We recalled and reviewed every particular that had fallen under our own ob[s]ervation. By none of the[s]e were we furni[s]hed with a clue. Her conduct, after the mo[s]t rigorous [s]crutiny, [s]till remained an impenetrable [s]ecret. On a nearer view, Major Stuart proved him[s]elf a man of mo[s]t amiable character. His attachment to Loui[s]a appeared hourly to increa[s]e. She was no [s]tranger to the [s]entiments [s]uitable to her new character. She could not but readily embrace the [s]cheme which was propo[s]ed to her, to return with her father to England. This [s]cheme his regard for her induced him, however, to po[s]tpone. Sometime was nece[s][s]ary to prepare her for [s]o great a change and enable her to think without agony of her separation from us. I was not without hopes of prevailing on her father entirely to relinqui[s]h this unwelcome de[s]ign. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-042.jpg) \- external link  - Page 033. ] Meanwhile, he pur[s]ued his travels through the [s]outhern colonies, and his daughter continued with us. Loui[s]a and my brother frequently received letters from him, which indicated a mind of no common order. They were filled with amu[s]ing details, and profound reflections. While here, he often partook of our evening conver[s]ations at the temple; and [s]ince his departure, his correspondence had frequently [s]upplied us with topics of discourse. One afternoon in May, the blandne[s]s of the air, and brightne[s]s of the verdure, induced us to assemble, earlier than u[s]ual, in the temple. We females were bu[s]y at the needle, while my brother and Pleyel were bandying quotations and [s]yllogi[s]ms. The point di[s]cu[s][s]ed was the merit of the oration for Cluentius, as de[s]criptive, fir[s]t, of the genius of the [s]peaker; and, [s]econdly, of the manners of the times. Pleyel laboured to extenuate both the[s]e [s]pecies of merit, and ta[s]ked his ingenuity, to [s]hew that the orator had embraced a bad cau[s]e; or, at lea[s]t, a doubtful one. He urged, that to rely on the exaggerations of an advocate, or to make the picture of a [s]ingle family a model from which to [s]ketch the condition of a nation, was ab[s]urd. The controver[s]y was [s]uddenly diverted into a new channel, by a mi[s]quotation. Pleyel accu[s]ed his companion of [s]aying " polliciatur " when he [s]hould have [s]aid " polliccretur ." Nothing would decide the conte[s]t, but an appeal to the volume. My brother was returning to the hou[s]e for this purpo[s]e, when a [s]ervant met him with a letter from Major Stuart. He immediately returned to read it in our company. Be[s]ides affectionate compliments to us, and paternal benedictions on Louifa, his letter contained [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-043.jpg) \- external link  - Page 034. ] a de[s]cription of a waterfall on the Monongahela. A [s]udden gu[s]t of rain falling, we were compelled to remove to the hou[s]e. The [s]torm pa[s][s]ed away, and a radiant moon-light [s]ucceeded. There was no motion to re[s]ume our [s]eats in the temple. We therefore remained where we were, and engaged in [s]prightly conver[s]ation. The letter lately received naturally [s]ugge[s]ted the topic. A parallel was drawn between the cataract there de[s]cribed, and one which Pleyel had di[s]covered among the Alps of Glarus. In the [s]tate of the former, [s]ome particular was mentioned, the truth of which was que[s]tionable. To [s]ettle the di[s]pute which thence aro[s]e, it was propo[s]ed to have recour[s]e to the letter. My brother [s]earched for it in his pocket. It was no where to be found. At length, he remembered to have left it in the temple, and he determined to go in [s]earch of it. His wife, Pleyel, Loui[s]a, and my[s]elf, remained where we were. In a few minutes he returned. I was [s]omewhat intere[s]ted in the di[s]pute, and was therefore impatient for his return; yet, as I heard him a[s]cending the [s]tairs, I could not but remark, that he had cxecuted his intention with remarkable di[s]patch. My cyes were fixed upon him on his entrance. Methought he brought with him looks con[s]iderably different from tho[s]e with which he departed. Wonder, and a [s]light portion of anxiety were mingled in them. His eyes [s]eemed to be in [s]earch of [s]ome object. They pa[s][s]ed quickly from one per[s]on to another, till they re[s]ted on his wife. She was [s]eated in a carele[s]s attitude on the [s]ofa, in the [s]ame [s]pot as before. She had the [s]ame mu[s]lin in her hand, by which her attention was chiefly engrossed. The moment he [s]aw her, his perplexity vi[s]ibly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-044.jpg) \- external link  - Page 035. ] increa[s]ed. He quietly [s]eated him[s]elf, and fixing his eyes on the floor, appeared to be ab[s]orbed in meditation. The[s]e [s]ingularities [s]u[s]pended the inquiry which I was preparing to make re[s]pecting the letter. In a [s]hort time, the company relinquished the [s]ubject which engaged them, and directed their attention to Wieland. They thought that he only waited for a pau[s]e in the di[s]cour[s]e, to produce the letter. The pau[s]e was uninterrupted by him. At length Pleyel [s]aid, "Well, I [s]uppo[s]e you have found the letter." "No," [s]aid he, without any abatement of his gravity, and looking [s]tedfa[s]tly at his wife, "I did not mount the hill."---"Why not?"---"Catharine, have you not moved from that [s]pot [s]ince I left the room?"---She was affected with the solemnity of his manner, and laying down her work, answered in a tone of [s]urpri[s]e, "No; Why do you a[s]k that que[s]tion?"---His eyes were again fixed upon the floor, and he did not immediately an[s]wer. At length, he [s]aid, looking round upon us, "Is it true that Catharine did not follow me to the hill? That [s]he did not ju[s]t now enter the room?"---We assured him, with one voice, that [s]he had not been ab[s]ent for a moment, and inquired into the motive of his que[s]tions. "Your a[s][s]urances," [s]aid he, "are [s]olemn and unanimous; and yet I mu[s]t deny credit to your a[s][s]ertions, or di[s]believe the te[s]timony of my [s]en[s]es, which informed me, when I was half way up the hill, that Catharine was at the bottom." We were confounded at this declaration, Pleyel rallied him with great levity on his behaviour. He li[s]tened to his friend with calmne[s]s, but without any relaxation of features. "One thing," [s]aid he with empha[s]is, "is true, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-045.jpg) \- external link  - Page 036. ] either I heard my wife's voice at the bottom of the hill, or I do not hear your voice at pre[s]ent." "Truly," returned Pleyel, "it is a [s]ad dilemma to which you have reduced your[s]elf. Certain it is, if our eyes can give us certainty, that your wife has been [s]itting in that [s]pot during every moment of your ab[s]ence. You have heard her voice, you [s]ay, upon the hill. In general, her voice, like her temper, is all [s]oftne[s]s. To be heard acro[s]s the room, the is obliged to exert her[s]elf. While you were gone, if I mi[s]take not, [s]he did not utter a word. Clara and I had all the talk to our[s]elves. Still it may be that [s]he held a whi[s]pering conference with you on the hill; but tell us the particulars." "The conference," [s]aid he, "was [s]hort; and far from being carried on in a whi[s]per. You know with what intention I left the hou[s]e. Half way to the rock, the moon was for a moment hidden from us by a cloud. I never knew the air to be more bland and more calm. In this interval I glanced at the temple, and thought I [s]aw a glimmering between the columns. It was [s]o faint, that it would not perhaps have been vi[s]ible, if the moon had not been [s]hrowded. I looked again, but [s]aw nothing. I never vi[s]it this building alone, or at night, without being reminded of the fate of my father. There was nothing wonderful in this appearance; yet it [s]uggefted [s]omething more than mere [s]olitude and darkne[s]s in the [s]ame place would have done. "I kept on my way. The images that haunted me were [s]olemn; and I entertained an imperfect curio[s]ity, but no fear, as to the nature of this object. I had a[s]cended the hill little more than half way, when a voice called me from behind. The accents were clear, di[s]tinct, powerful, and were uttered, as I fully believed, by my wife, Her voice [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-046.jpg) \- external link  - Page 037. ] is not commonly [s]o loud. She has [s]eldom occa[s]ion to exert it, but, neverthele[s]s, I have [s]ometimes heard her call with force and eagerne[s]s. If my ear was not deceived, it was her voice which I heard. "Stop, go no further. There is danger in your path." The [s]uddenne[s]s and unexpectedne[s]s of this warning, the tone of alarm with which it was given, and, above all, the per[s]ua[s]ion that it was my wife who [s]poke, were enough to di[s]concert and make me pau[s]e. I turned and li[s]tened to a[s][s]ure my[s]elf that I was not mi[s]taken. The deepe[s]t [s]ilence [s]ucceeded. At length, I [s]poke in my turn. Who calls? is it you, Catharine? I [s]topped and pre[s]ently received an anfwen "Yes, it is I; go not up; return in[s]tantly; you are wanted at the hou[s]e." Still the voice was Catharine's, and [s]till it proceeded from the foot of the [s]tairs. "What could I do? The warning was mysterious. To be uttered by Catharine at a place, and on an occa[s]ion like the[s]e, enhanced the my[s]tery. I could do nothing but obey. Accordingly, I trod back my [s]teps, expecting that [s]he waited for me at the bottom of the hill, When I reached the bottom, no one was vi[s]rble. The moon-light was once more univer[s]al and brilliant, and yet, as far as I could [s]ee no human or moving figure was discernable. If [s]he had returned to the hou[s]e, [s]he mu[s]t have u[s]ed wonderous expedition to have pa[s][s]ed already beyond the reach of my eye. I exerted my voice, but in vain. To my repeated exclamations, no an[s]wer was returned. "Ruminating on the[s]e incidents, I returned hither. There was no room to doubt that I had heard my wife's voice; attending incidents were not ea[s]ily explained; but you now a[s][s]ure me that nothing [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-047.jpg) \- external link  - Page 038. ] extraordinary has happened to urge my return, and that my wife has not moved from her [s]eat." Such was my brother's narrative. It was heard by us with different emotions. Pleyel did not scruple to regard the whole as a deception of the [s]en[s]es. Perhaps a voice had been heard; but Wieland's imagination had mi[s]led him in [s]uppo[s]ing a re[s]emblance to that of his wife, and giving [s]uch a [s]ignificantion to the [s]ounds. According to his cu[s]tom he [s]poke what he thought. Sometimes, he made it the theme of grave di[s]cu[s][s]ion, but more frequently treated it with ridicule. He did not believe that [s]ober reasoning would convince his friend, and gaiety, he thought, was u[s]eful to take away the [s]olemnities which, in a mind like Wieland's, an accident of this kind was calculated to produce. Pleyel propo[s]ed to go in [s]earch of the letter. He went and [s]peedily returned, bearing it in his hand. He had found it open on the pede[s]tal; and neither voice nor vi[s]age had ri[s]en to impede his de[s]ign. Catharine was endowed with an uncommon portion of good [s]en[s]e; but her mind was acce[s][s]ible, on this quarter, to wonder and panic. That her voice [s]hould be thus inexplicably and unwarrantably a[s][s]umed, was a [s]ource of no [s]mall disquietude. She admitted the plau[s]ibility of the arguments by which Pleyel endeavoured to prove, that this was no more than an auricular deception; but this conviction was [s]ure to be [s]haken, when [s]he turned her eyes upon her hu[s]band, and perceived that Pleyel's logic was far from having produced the [s]ame effect upon him. As to my[s]elf, my attention was engaged by this occurrence. I could not fail to perceive a [s]hadowy re[s]emblance between it and my father's [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-048.jpg) \- external link  - Page 039. ] death. On the latter event, I had frequently reflected; my reflections never conducted me to certainty, but the doubts that exi[s]ted were not of a tormenting kind. I could not deny that the event was miraculous, and yet I was invincibly aver[s]e to that method of [s]olution. My wonder was excited by the in[s]crutablene[s]s of the cau[s]e, but my wonder was unmixed with [s]orrow or fear. It begat in me a thrilling, and not unplea[s]ing solemnity. Similar to the[s]e were the [s]en[s]ations produced by the recent adventure. But its effect upon my brother's imagination was of chief moment. All that was de[s]nable was, that it [s]hould be regarded by him with indifferenced. The wor[s]t effect that could flow, was nor indeed very formidable. Yet I could not bent to think that his [s]en[s]es [s]hould be the victims of [s]uch delusion. It argued a di[s]ea[s]ed condition of his frame, which might [s]how it[s]elf herea[s]ter in more dangerous [s]ymptoms. The will is the tool of the understanding, which mu[s]t fa[s]hion its conclu[s]ions on the notices of [s]en[s]e. If the [s]en[s]es be depraved, it is impo[s][s]ible to calculate the evils that may flow from the con[s]equent deductions of the under[s]tanding. I [s]aid, this man is of an ardent and melancholy character. Tho[s]e ideas which, in others, are ca[s]ual or ob[s]cture, which are entertained in moments of ab[s]traction and [s]olitude, and ea[s]ily e[s]cape when the [s]cene is changed, have obtained an immoveable hold upon his mind. The conclu[s]ions which long habit has rendered familiar, and, in [s]ome [s]ort, palpable to his intellect, are drawn from the deepestsources. All his actions and practical [s]entiments are linked with long and ab[s]tru[s]e deductions from the [s]y[s]tem of divine government and the laws of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-049.jpg) \- external link  - Page 040. ] our intellectual con[s]titution. He is, in [s]ome respects, an enthu[s]ia[s]t, but is fortified in his belief by innumerable arguments and [s]ubtilties. His father's death was always regarded by him as flowing from a direct and [s]upernatural decree. It vi[s]ited his meditations oftener than it did mine. The traces which it left were more gloomy and permanent. This new incident had a vi[s]ible effect in augmenting his gravity. He was le[s]s di[s]po[s]ed than formerly to conver[s]e and reading. When we [s]i[s]ted his thoughts, they were generally found to have a relation, more or le[s]s direct, with this incident. It was difficult to a[s]certain the exact [s]pecies of impression which it made upon him. He never introduced the [s]ubject into conver[s]ation, and li[s]tened with a [s]ilent and half-[s]erious [s]mile to the [s]atirical effu[s]ions of Pleyel. One evening we chanced to be alone together in the temple. I [s]eized that opportunity of investigating the [s]tate of his thoughts. After a pau[s]e, which he [s]eemed in no wife inclined to interrupt, I [s]poke to him---"How almo[s]t palpable is this dark; yet a ray from above would di[s]pel it." "Ay," [s]aid Wieland, with [s]ervor, "not only the phy[s]ical, but moral night would be di[s]pelled." "But why," [s]aid I, "mu[s]t the Divine Will addre[s]s its precepts to the eye!" He [s]miled [s]ignificantly. "True," [s]aid he, "the under[s]tanding has other avenues." "You have never," [s]aid I, approaching nearer to the point---"you have never told me in what way you con[s]idered the late extraordinary incident." "There is no determinate way in which the subject can be viewed. Here is an effect, but the cau[s]e is utterly in[s]crutable. To [s]uppo[s]e a deception will not do. Such is po[s][s]ible, but there are [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-050.jpg) \- external link  - Page 041. ] twenty other [s]uppo[s]itions more probable. They mu[s]t all he [s]et a[s]ide before We reach that point." "What, are the[s]e twenty suppositions?" "It is needle[s]s to mention them. They are only le[s]s improtiable than Pleyel's. Time may convert one of them into certaitily. Till then it is u[s]ele[s]s to expatiate on them." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-051.jpg) \- external link  - Page 042. ] Some time had elap[s]ed when there happened another occurrence, [s]till more remarkable. Pleyel, on his return from Europe, brought information of con[s]iderable importance to my brother. My ancestors were noble Saxons, and po[s][s]e[s][s]ed large domains in Lu[s]atia. The Pru[s][s]ian wars had de[s]troyed tho[s]e per[s]ons who[s]e right to the[s]e e[s]tates precluded my brother's. Pleyel had been exact in his inquiries, and had di[s]covered that, by the law of male-primogeniture, my brother's claims were [s]uperior to tho[s]e of any other per[s]on now living. Nothing was wanting but his pre[s]ence in that country, and a legal application to e[s]tabli[s]h this claim. Pleyel [s]trenuou[s]ly recommended this mea[s]ure. The advantages he thought attending it were numerous, and it would argue the utmo[s]t folly to neglect them. Contrary to his expectation he found my brother aver[s]e to the [s]cheme. Slight efforts, he, at fir[s]t, thought would [s]ubdue his reluctance; but he found this aver[s]ion by no means [s]light. The intere[s]t that he took in the happine[s]s of his friend and his [s]i[s]ter, and his own partiality to the Saxon [s]oil, from which he had likewi[s]e [s]prung, and where he had [s]pen; [s]everal years of his youth, made him redouble his exertions to win Wieland's con[s]ent. For this end he employed every argument that his invention could [s]ugge[s]t. He painted, in attractive colours, the [s]tate of manners and government in that country, the [s]ecurity of civil rights, and the freedom of religious [s]entiments. He [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-052.jpg) \- external link  - Page 043. ] dwelt on the privileges of wealth and rank, and drew from the [s]ervile condition of one cla[s]s, an argument in favor of his [s]cheme, [s]ince the revenue and power annexed to a German principality afford [s]o large a field for benevolence. The evil flowing from this power, in malignant hands, was proportioned to the good that would ari[s]e from the virtuous u[s]e of it. Hence, Wieland, in forbearing to claim his own, withheld all the po[s]itive felicity that would accrue to his va[s][s]als from his [s]ucce[s]s, and hazarded all the mi[s]ery that would redound from a le[s]s enlightened proprietor. It was ea[s]y for my brother to repel the[s]e arguments, and to [s]hew that no [s]pot on the globe enjoyed equal [s]ecurity and liberty to that which he at pre[s]ent inhabited. That if the Saxons had nothing to fear from mi[s]-government, the external cau[s]es of havoc and alarm were numerous and manife[s]t. The recent deva[s]tations committed by the Pru[s][s]ians furni[s]hed a [s]pecimen of the[s]e. The horrors of war would always impend over them, till Germany were [s]eized and divided by Au[s]trian and Pru[s][s]ian tyrants; an event which he [s]trongly [s]u[s]pected was at no great di[s]tance. But [s]etting the[s]e con[s]iderations a[s]ide, was it laudable to gra[s]p at wealth and power even when they were within our reach? Were not the[s]e the two great [s]ources of depravity? What [s]ecurity had he, that in this change of place and condition, he [s]hould not degenerate into a tyrant and voluptuary? Power and riches were chiefly to be dreaded on account of their tendency to deprave the po[s][s]e[s][s]or. He held them in abhorrence, not only as in[s]truments of mi[s]ery to others, but to him on whom they were con[s]erred. Be[s]ides, riches were comparative, and was he not rich already? He lived at pre[s]ent in the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-053.jpg) \- external link  - Page 044. ] bo[s]om of [s]ecurity and luxury. All the in[s]truments of plea[s]ure, on which his rea[s]on or imagination [s]et any value, were within his reach. But the[s]e he mu[s]t forego, for the [s]ake of advantages which, whatever were their value, were as yet uncertain. In pur[s]uit of an imaginary addition to his wealth, he mu[s]t reduce him[s]elf to poverty, he mu[s]t exchange pre[s]ent certainties for what was di[s]tant and contingent; for who knows not that the law is a [s]y[s]tem of expence, delay and uncertainty? If he [s]hould embrace this [s]cheme, it would lay him under the nece[s][s]ity of making a voyage to Europe, and remaining for a certain period, [s]eparate from his family. He mu[s]t undergo the perils and discomforts of the ocean; he mu[s]t dive[s]t him[s]elf of all dome[s]tic plea[s]ures; he mu[s]t deprive his wi[s]e of her companion, and his children of a father and instructor, and all for what? For the ambiguous advantages which overgrown wealth and flagitious tyranny have to be[s]tow? For a precarious po[s][s]e[s][s]ion in a land of turbulence and war? Advantages, which will not certainly be gained, and of which the acquistion, if it were [s]ure, is nece[s][s]arily di[s]tant. Pleyel was enamoured of his [s]cheme on account of its intrin[s]ic benefits, but, likewi[s]e, for other reasons. His abode at Leip[s]ig made that country appear to him like home. He was connected with this place by many [s]ocial ties. While there he had not e[s]caped the amorous contagion. But the lady, though her heart was impre[s][s]ed in his favor, was compelled to be[s]tow her hand upon another. Death had removed this impediment, and he was now invited by the lady her[s]elf to return. This he was of cour[s]e determined to do, but was anxious to obtain the company of Wieland; he could not bear to think of an eternal [s]eparation from his pre[s]ent [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-054.jpg) \- external link  - Page 045. ] a[s][s]ociates. Their intere[s]t, he thought, would be no le[s]s promoted by the change than his own. Hence he was importunate and indefatigable in his arguments and [s]olicitations. He knew that he could not hope for mine or his [s]i[s]ter's ready concurrence in this [s]cheme. Should the [s]ubject be mentioned to us, we [s]hould league our efforts again[s]t him, and [s]trengthen that reluctance in Wieland which already was [s]ufficiently difficult to conquer. He, therefore, anxiou[s]ly concealed from us his purpo[s]e. If Wieland were previou[s]ly enli[s]ted in his cau[s]e, he would find it a le[s]s difficult ta[s]k to overcome our aver[s]ion. My brother was [s]ilent on this [s]ubject, becau[s]e he believed him[s]elf in no danger of changing his opinion, and he was willing to [s]ave us from any unea[s]ine[s]s. The mere mention of [s]uch a [s]cheme, and the possibility of his embracing it, he knew, would considerably impair our tranquillity. One day, about three weeks [s]ub[s]equent to the my[s]terious call, it was agreed that the family [s]hould be my gue[s]ts. Seldom had a day been pa[s][s]ed by us, of more [s]erene enjoyment. Pleyel had promised us his company, but we did not [s]ee him till the [s]un had nearly declined. He brought with him a countenance that betokened di[s]appointment and vexation. He did not wait for our inquiries, but immediately explained the cau[s]e. Two days before a packet had arrived from Hamburgh, by which he had [s]lattered him[s]elf with the expectation of receiving letters, but no letters had arrived. I never [s]aw him [s]o much [s]ubdued by an untoward event. His thoughts were employed in accounting for the [s]ilence of his friends. He was [s]eized with the torments of jealou[s]y, and [s]u[s]pected nothing le[s]s than the infidelity of her to whom he had devoted his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-055.jpg) \- external link  - Page 046. ] heart. The [s]ilence mu[s]t have been concerted. Her [s]ickne[s]s, or ab[s]ence, or death, would have increased the certainty of [s]ome one's having written. No [s]uppo[s]ition could be formed but that his mistress had grown indifferent, or that [s]he had transferred her affections to another. The mi[s]carriage of a letter was hardly within the reach of po[s][s]ibility. From Leip[s]ig to Hamburgh, and from Hamburgh hither, the conveyance was expo[s]ed to no hazard. He had been [s]o long detained in America chiefly in con[s]equence of Wieland's aver[s]ion to the [s]cheme which he propo[s]ed. He now became more impatient than ever to return to Europe. When he reflected that, by his delays, he had probably forfeited the affections of his mi[s]tre[s]s, his [s]en[s]ations amounted to agony. It only remained, by his [s]peedy departure, to repair, if po[s][s]ible, or prevent [s]o intolerable an evil. Already he had half re[s]olved to embark in this very [s]hip which, he was informed, would [s]et out in a few weeks on her return. Meanwhile he determined to make a new attempt to [s]hake the re[s]olution of Wieland. The evening was [s]omewhat advanced when he invited the latter to walk abroad with him. The invitation was accepted, and they left Catharine, Loui[s]a and me, to amu[s]e our[s]elves by the be[s]t means in our power. During this walk, Pleyel renewed the [s]ubject that was neare[s]t his heart. He re-urged all his former arguments, and placed them in more forcible lights. They promi[s]ed to return [s]hortly; but hour after hour pa[s][s]ed, and they made not their appearance. Engaged in [s]prightly conver[s]ation, it was not till the clock [s]truck twelve that we were reminded of the lap[s]e of time. The ab[s]ence of our friends excited [s]ome unea[s]y apprehen[s]ions. We were [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-056.jpg) \- external link  - Page 047. ] expressing our fears, and comparing our conjectures as to what might be the cau[s]e, when they entered together. There were indications in their countenances that [s]truck me mute. The[s]e were unnoticed by Catharine, who was eager to expre[s]s her [s]urprize and curio[s]ity at the length of their walk. As they li[s]tened to her, I remarked that their [s]urprize was not le[s]s than ours. They gazed in [s]ilence on each other, and on her. I watched their looks, but could not under[s]tand the emotions that were written in them. The[s]e appearances diverted Catharine's inquiries into a new channel. What did they mean, [s]he a[s]ked, by their [s]ilence, and by their thus gazing wildly at each other, and at her? Pleyel profited by this hint, and a[s][s]uming an air of indifference, framed [s]ome trifling excu[s]e, at the [s]ame time darting significant glances at Wieland, as if to caution him again[s]t di[s]clo[s]ing the truth. My brother [s]aid nothing, but delivered him[s]elf up to meditation. I likewi[s]e was [s]ilent, but burned with impatience to fathom this my[s]tery. Pre[s]ently my brother and his wife, and Loui[s]a, returned home. Pleyel proposed, of his own accord, to be my gue[s]t for the night. This circum[s]tance, in addition to tho[s]e which preceded, gave new edge to my wonder. As [s]oon as we were left alone, Pleyel's countenance a[s][s]umed an air of [s]eriou[s]ne[s]s, and even consternation, which I had never before beheld in him. The [s]teps with which he mea[s]ured the floor betokened the trouble of his thoughts. My inquiries were [s]u[s]pended by the hope that he would give me the information that I wanted without the importunity of que[s]tions. I waited [s]ome time, but the confusion of his thoughts appeared in no degree to abate. At length I mentioned the apprehen[s]ions which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-057.jpg) \- external link  - Page 048. ] their unu[s]ual ab[s]ence had occa[s]ioned, and which were increa[s]ed by their behaviour [s]ince their return, and [s]olicited an explanation. He [s]topped when I began to [s]peak, and looked [s]tedfa[s]tly at me. When I had done, he [s]aid, to me, in a tone which faultered through the vehemence of his emotions, "How were you employed during our ab[s]ence?" "In curning over the Della Cru[s]ca dictionary, and talking on different [s]ubjects; but ju[s]t before your entrance, we were tormenting our[s]elves with omens and progno[s]ticks relative to your ab[s]ence." "Catharine was with you the whole time?" "Yes," "But are you [s]ure?" "Mo[s]t [s]ure. She was not ab[s]ent a moment." He [s]tood, for a time, as if to a[s][s]ure him[s]elf of my [s]incerity. Then, clenching his hands, and wildly lifting them above his head, "Lo," cried he, "I have news to tell you. The Barone[s]s de Stolberg is dead?" This was her whom he loved. I was not surprised at the agitations which he betrayed. "But how was the information procured? How was the truth of this news connected with the circumstance of Catharine's remaining in our company?" He was for [s]ome time inattentive to my que[s]tions. When he [s]poke, it [s]eemed merely a continuation of the reverie into which he had been plunged. "And yet it might be a mere deception. But could both of us in that ca[s]e have been deceived? A rare and prodigious coincidence! Barely not impo[s][s]ible. And yet, if the accent be oracular--- There[s]a is dead. No, no," continued he, covering his face with his hands, and in a tone half broken into [s]obs, "I cannot believe it. She has not written, but if [s]he were dead, the faithful Bertrand would have given me the earlie[s]t information. And yet if he knew his ma[s]ter, he mu[s]t have ea[s]ily [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-058.jpg) \- external link  - Page 049. ] gue[s][s]ed at the effect of [s]uch tidings. In pity to me he was [s]ilent." "Clara, forgive me; to you, this behaviour is my[s]terious. I will explain as well as I am able. But [s]ay not a word to Catharine. Her [s]trength of mind is inferior to your's. She will, be[s]ides, have more rea[s]on to be [s]tartled. She is Wieland's angel." Pleyel proceeded to inform me, for the fir[s]t time, of the [s]cheme which he had pre[s][s]ed, with [s]o much earne[s]tne[s]s, on my brother. He enumerated the objections which had been made, and the indu[s]try with which he had endeavoured to confuse them. He mentioned the effect upon his re[s]olutions produced by the failure of a letter. "During our late walk," continued he, "I introduced the [s]ubject that was neare[s]t my heart. I re-urged all my former arguments, and placed them in more forcible lights. Wieland was [s]till refractory. He expatiated on the perils of wealth and power, on the [s]acredne[s]s of conjugal and parental duties, and the happine[s]s of mediocrity. "No wonder that the time pa[s][s]ed, unperceived, away. Our whole [s]ouls were engaged in this cau[s]e. Several times we came to the foot of the rock; as [s]oon as we perceived it, we changed our cour[s]e, but never failed to terminate our circuitous and devious ramble at this [s]pot. At length your brother ob[s]erved, "We [s]eem to be led hither by a kind of fatality. Since we are [s]o near, let us a[s]cend and re[s]t our[s]elves a while. If you are not weary of this argument we will re[s]ume it there." "I tacitly con[s]ented. We mounted the [s]tairs, and drawing the [s]ofa in front of the river, we [s]eated our[s]elves upon it. I took up the thread of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-059.jpg) \- external link  - Page 050. ] our di[s]cour[s]e where we had dropped it. I ridiculed his dread of the [s]ea, and his attachment to home. I kept on in this [s]train, [s]o congenial with my disposition, for [s]ome time, uninterrupted by him. At length, he [s]aid to me, "Suppo[s]e now that I, whom argument has not convinced, [s]hould yield to ridicule, and [s]hould agree that your [s]cheme is eligible; what will you have gained? Nothing. You have other enemies be[s]ide my[s]elf to encounter. When you have vanqui[s]hed me, your toil has [s]carcely begun. There are my [s]i[s]ter and wife, with whom it will remain for you to maintain the conte[s]t. And tru[s]t me, they are adver[s]aries whom all your force and [s]tratagem will never [s]ubdue." I in[s]inuated that they would model them[s]elves by his will: that Catharine would think obedience her duty. He an[s]wered, with [s]ome quickne[s]s, "You mi[s]take. Their concurrence is indispensable. It is not my cu[s]tom to exact [s]acrifices of this kind. I live to be their protector and friend, and not their tyrant and foe. If my wife [s]hall deem her happine[s]s, and that of her children, mo[s]t con[s]ulted by remaining where [s]he is, here [s]he [s]hall remain." "But," [s]aid I, "when [s]he knows your plea[s]ure, will [s]he not conform to it?" Before my friend had time to an[s]wer this que[s]tion, a negative was clearly and di[s]tinctly uttered from another quarter. It did not come from one [s]ide or the other, from before us or behind. Whence then did it come? By who[s]e organs was it fa[s]hioned? "If any uncertainty had exi[s]ted with regard to the[s]e particulars, it would have been removed by a deliberate and equally di[s]tinct repetition of the [s]ame mono[s]yllable, "No." The voice was my [s]i[s]ter's. It appeared to come from the roof. I [s]tarted from my [s]eat. Catharine, exclaimed I, where are you? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-060.jpg) \- external link  - Page 051. ] No an[s]wer was returned. I [s]earched the room, and the area before it, but in vain. Your brother was motionle[s]s in his [s]eat. I returned to him, and placed my[s]elf again by his [s]ide. My astonishment was not le[s]s than his." "Well," [s]aid he, at length, "What think you of this? This is the [s]elf-[s]ame voice which I formerly heard; you are now convinced that my ears were well informed." "Yes," [s]aid I, "this, it is plain, is no fiction of the fancy." We again [s]unk into mutual and thoughtful [s]ilence. A recollection of the hour, and of the length of our ab[s]ence, made me at la[s]t propo[s]e to return. We ro[s]e up for this purpo[s]e. In doing this, my mind reverted to the contemplation of my own condition. "Yes," [s]aid I aloud, but without particularly addre[s][s]ing my[s]elf to Wieland, "my re[s]olution is taken. I cannot hope to prevail with my friends to accompany me. They may doze away their days on the banks of Schuylkill, but as to me, I go in the next ve[s][s]el; I will fly to her pre[s]ence, and demand the rea[s]on of this extraordinary [s]ilence." "I had [s]carcely fini[s]hed the [s]entence, when the [s]ame my[s]terious voice exclaimed, "You [s]hall not go. The [s]eal of death is on her lips. Her [s]ilence is the [s]ilence of the tomb." Think of the effects which accents like the[s]e mu[s]t have had upon me. I [s]huddered as I li[s]tened. As [s]oon as I recovered from my fir[s]t amazement, "Who is it that [s]peaks?" [s]aid I, "whence did you procure the[s]e di[s]mal tidings?" I did not wait long for an an[s]wer. "From a [s]ource that cannot fail. Be [s]atisfied. She is dead." You may ju[s]tly be [s]urpri[s]ed, that, in the circumstances in which I heard the tidings, and notwithstanding the my[s]tery which environed him by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-061.jpg) \- external link  - Page 052. ] whom they were imparted, I could give an undivided attention to the facts, which were the [s]ubject of our dialogue. I eagerly inquired, when and where did [s]he die? What was the cau[s]e of her death? Was her death ab[s]olutely certain? An an[s]wer was returned only to the la[s]t of the[s]e questions. "Yes," was pronounced by the [s]ame voice; but it now [s]ounded from a greater di[s]tance, and the deepe[s]t [s]ilence was all the return made to my [s]ub[s]equent interrogatories. "It was my [s]i[s]ter's voice; but it could not be uttered by her; and yet, if not by her, by whom was it uttered? When we returned hither, and di[s]covered you together, the doubt that had previously exi[s]ted was removed. It was manife[s]t that the intimation came not from her. Yet if not from her, from whom could it come? Are the circum[s]tances attending the imparting of this news proof that the tidings are true? God forbid that they [s]hould be true." Here Pleyel [s]unk into anxious [s]ilence, and gave me lei[s]ure to ruminate on this inexplicable event. I am at a lo[s]s to de[s]cribe the [s]en[s]ations that affected me. I am not fearful of [s]hadows. The tales of apparitions and enchantments did not po[s][s]e[s]s that power over my belief which could even render them intere[s]ting. I [s]aw nothing in them but ignorance and folly, and was a [s]tranger even to that terror which is plea[s]ing. But this incident was different from any that I had ever before known. Here were proofs of a [s]en[s]ible and intelligent exi[s]tence, which could not be denied. Here was information obtained and imparted by means unquestionably [s]uper-human. That there are con[s]cious beings, be[s]ide our[s]elves, in exi[s]tence, who[s]e modes of activity and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-062.jpg) \- external link  - Page 053. ] information [s]urpa[s]s our own, can [s]carcely be denied. Is there a glimp[s]e afforded us into a world of the[s]e [s]uperior beings? My heart was [s]carcely large enough to give admittance to [s]o [s]welling a thought. An awe, the [s]weete[s]t and mo[s]t [s]olemn that imagination can conceive, pervaded my whole frame. It for[s]ook me not when I parted from Pleyel and retired to my chamber. An impul[s]e was given to my [s]pirits utterly incompatible with [s]leep. I pa[s][s]ed the night wakeful and full of meditation. I was impre[s][s]ed with the belief of my[s]terious, but not of malignant agency. Hitherto nothing had occurred to per[s]uade me that this airy mini[s]ter was bu[s]y to evil rather than to good purpo[s]es. On the contrary, the idea of [s]uperior virtue had always been a[s][s]ociated in my mind with that of [s]uperior power. The warnings that had thus been heard appeared to have been prompted by beneficent intentions. My brother had been hindered by this voice from a[s]cending the hill. He was told that danger lurked in his path, and his obedience to the intimation had perhaps [s]aved him from a de[s]tiny [s]imilar to that of my father. Pleyel had been re[s]cued from tormenting uncertainty, and from the hazards and fatigues of a fruitle[s]s voyage, by the [s]ame interpo[s]ition. It had a[s][s]ured him of the death of his There[s]a. This woman was then dead. A confirmation of the tidings, if true, would [s]peedily arrive. Was this confirmation to be deprecated or de[s]ired? By her death, the tie that attached him to Europe, was taken away. Henceforward every motive would combine to retain him in his native country, and we were re[s]cued from the deep regrets that would accompany his hopele[s]s ab[s]ence from us, Propitious was the [s]pirit that imparted the[s]e tidings. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-063.jpg) \- external link  - Page 054. ] Propitious he would perhaps have been, if he had been in[s]trumental in producing, as well as in communicating the ridings of her death. Propitious to us, the friends of Pleyel, to whom has thereby been [s]ecured the enjoyment of his [s]ociety; and not unpropitious to him[s]elf; for though this object of his love be [s]natched away, is there not another who is able and willing to con[s]ole him for her lo[s]s? Twenty days after this, another ve[s][s]el arrived from the [s]ame port. In this interval, Pleyel, for the mo[s]t part, e[s]tranged him[s]elf from his old companions. He was become the prey of a gloomy and un[s]ociable grief. His walks were limited to the bank of the Delaware. This bank is an artificial one. Reeds and the river are on one [s]ide, and a watery mar[s]h on the other, in that part which bounded his lands, and which extended from the mouth of Hollander's creek to that of Schuylkill. No [s]cene can be imagined le[s]s enticing to a lover of the picture[s]que than this. The [s]hore is deformed with mud, and incumbered with a fore[s]t of reeds. The fields, in mo[s]t [s]ea[s]ons, are mire; but when they afford a firm footing, the ditches by which they are bounded and inter[s]ected, are mantled with [s]tagnating green, and emit the mo[s]t noxious exhalations. Health is no le[s]s a [s]tranger to tho[s]e [s]eats than plea[s]ure. Spring and autumn are [s]ure to be accompanied with agues and bilious remittents. The [s]cenes which environed our dwellings at Mettingen con[s]tituted the rever[s]e of this. Schuylkill was here a pure and tran[s]lucid current, broken into wild and cea[s]ele[s]s mu[s]ic by rocky points, murmuring on a [s]andy margin, and reflecting on its [s]urface, banks of all varieties of height and degrees of declivity. The[s]e banks were chequered by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-064.jpg) \- external link  - Page 055. ] patches of dark verdure and [s]hapele[s]s ma[s][s]es of white marble, and crowned by cop[s]es of cedar, or by the regular magnificence of orchards, which, at this [s]ea[s]on, were in blo[s][s]om, and were prodigal of odours. The ground which receded from the river was [s]cooped into valleys and dales. Its beauties were enhanced by the horticultural [s]kill of my brother, who bedecked this exqui[s]ite a[s][s]emblage of [s]lopes and ri[s]ings with every [s]pecies of vegetable ornament, from the giant arms of the oak to the clu[s]tering tendrils of the honey-[s]uckle. To [s]creen him from the unwhole[s]ome airs of his own re[s]idence, it had been propo[s]ed to Pleyel to [s]pend the months of [s]pring with us. He had apparently acquie[s]ced in this propo[s]al; but the late event induced him to change his purpo[s]e. He was only to be [s]een by vi[s]iting him in his retirements. His gaiety had flown, and every pa[s][s]ion was absorbed in eagerne[s]s to procure tidings from Saxony. I have mentioned the arrival of another ve[s][s]el from the Elbe. He de[s]cried her early one morning as he was pa[s][s]ing along the [s]kirt of the river. She was ea[s]ily recognized, being the [s]hip in which he had performed his fir[s]t voyage to Germany. He immediately went on board, but found no letters directed to him. This omi[s][s]ion was, in [s]ome degree, compen[s]ated by meeting with an old acquaintance among the pa[s][s]engers, who had till lately been a re[s]ident in Leip[s]ig. This per[s]on put an end to all [s]u[s]pen[s]e re[s]pecting the fate of There[s]a, by relating the particulars of her death and funeral. Thus was the truth of the former intimation atte[s]ted. No longer devoured by [s]u[s]pen[s]e, the grief of Pleyel was not long in yielding to the influence of [s]ociety. He gave him[s]elf up once more to our company. His vivacity had indeed been [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-065.jpg) \- external link  - Page 056. ] damped; but even in this re[s]pect he was a more acceptable companion than formerly, [s]ince his seriousness was neither incommunicative nor [s]ullen. The[s]e incidents, for a time, occupied all our thoughts. In me they produced a [s]entiment not unallied to plea[s]ure, and more [s]peedily than in the ca[s]e of my friends were intermixed with other topics. My brother was particularly affected by them. It was ea[s]y to perceive that mo[s]t of his meditations were tinctured from this [s]ource. To this was to be a[s]cribed a de[s]ign in which his pen was, at this period, engaged, of collecting and inve[s]tigating the facts which relate to that my[s]terious per[s]onage, the Daemon of Socrates. My brother's [s]kill in Greek and Roman learning was exceeded by that of few, and no doubt the world would have accepted a treati[s]e upon this [s]ubject from his hand with avidity; but alas! this and every other [s]cheme of [s]elicity and honor, were doomed to [s]udden bla[s]t and hopele[s]s extermination. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-066.jpg) \- external link  - Page 057. ] I now come to the mention of a per[s]on with who[s]e name the mo[s]t turbulent [s]en[s]ations are connected. It is with a [s]huddering reluctance that I enter on the province of de[s]cribing him. Now it is that I begin to perceive the difficulty of the ta[s]k which I have undertaken; but it would be weakne[s]s to [s]hrink from it. My blood is congealed: and my fingers are pal[s]ied when I call up his image. Shame upon my cowardly and infirm heart! Hitherto I have proceeded with [s]ome degree of composure, but now I mu[s]t pau[s]e. I mean not that dire remembrance [s]hall [s]ubdue my courage or baffle my de[s]ign, but this weakne[s]s cannot be immediately conquered. I mu[s]t de[s]i[s]t for a little while. I have taken a few turns in my chamber, and have gathered [s]trength enough to proceed. Yet have I not projected a ta[s]k beyond my power to execute? If thus, on the very thre[s]hold of the [s]cene, my knees faulter and I [s]ink, how [s]hall I support my[s]elf, when I ru[s]h into the mid[s]t of horrors [s]uch as no heart has hitherto conceived, nor tongue related? I [s]icken and recoil at the pro[s]pect, and yet my irre[s]olution is momentary. I have not formed this de[s]ign upon [s]light grounds, and though I may at times pau[s]e and he[s]itate, I will not be finally diverted from it. And thou, O mo[s]t fatal and potent of mankind, in what terms [s]hall I de[s]cribe thee? What words are adequate to the ju[s]t delineation of thy character? How [s]hall I detail the means which rendered [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-067.jpg) \- external link  - Page 058. ] the [s]ecrecy of thy purpo[s]es unfathomable? But I will not anticipate. Let me recover if po[s][s]ible, a [s]ober [s]train. Let me keep down the flood of pa[s][s]ion that would render me precipitate or powerless. Let me [s]tifle the agonies that are awakened by thy name. Let me, for a time, regard thee as a being of no terrible attributes. Let me tear my[s]elf from contemplation of the evils of which it is but too certain that thou wa[s]t the author, and limit my view to tho[s]e harmle[s]s appearances which attended thy entrance on the [s]tage. One [s]unny afternoon, I was [s]tanding in the door of my hou[s]e, when I marked a per[s]on pa[s][s]ing clo[s]e to the edge of the bank that was in front. His pace was a carele[s]s and lingering one, and had none of that gracefulne[s]s and ea[s]e which distinguish a per[s]on with certain advantages of education from a clown. His gait was ru[s]tic and aukward. His form was ungainly and disproportioned. Shoulders broad and [s]quare, brea[s]t [s]unken, his head drooping, his body of uniform breadth, [s]upported by long and lank legs, were the ingredients of his frame. His garb was not ill adapted to [s]uch a figure. A [s]louched hat, tarni[s]hed by the weather, a coat of thick grey cloth, cut and wrought, as it [s]eemed, by a country tailor, blue wor[s]ted [s]tockings, and [s]hoes fa[s]tened by thongs, and deeply di[s]coloured by du[s]t, which bru[s]h had never di[s]turbed, con[s]tituted his dre[s]s. There was nothing remarkable in the[s]e appearances; they were frequently to be met with on the road, and in the harve[s]t field. I cannot tell why I gazed upon them, on this occa[s]ion, with more than ordinary attention, unle[s]s it were that [s]uch figures were [s]eldom [s]teen by me, except on the road or field. This lawn was only traver[s]ed by men [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-068.jpg) \- external link  - Page 059. ] who[s]e views were directed to the plea[s]ures of the walk, or the grandeur of the [s]cenery. He pa[s][s]ed [s]lowly along, frequently pau[s]ing, as if to examine the pro[s]pect more deliberately, but never turning his eye towards the hou[s]e, [s]o as to allow me a view of his countenance. Pre[s]ently, he entered a cop[s]e at a [s]mall di[s]tance, and disappeared. My eye followed him while he remained in [s]ight. If his image remained for any duration in my fancy after his departure, it was becau[s]e no other object occurred [s]ufficient to expel it. I continued in the [s]ame [s]pot for half an hour, vaguely, and by fits, contemplating the image of this wanderer, and drawing, from outward appearances, tho[s]e inferences with re[s]pect to the intellectual hi[s]tory of this per[s]on, which experience affords us. I reflected on the alliance which commonly [s]ub[s]i[s]ts between ignorance and the practice of agriculture, and indulged my[s]elf in airy [s]peculations as to the influence of progre[s][s]ive knowledge in di[s][s]olving this alliance, and embodying the dreams of the poets. I a[s]ked why the plough and the hoe might not become the trade of every human being, and how this trade might be made conducive to, or, at lea[s]t, con[s]i[s]tent with the acqui[s]ition of wi[s]dom and eloquence. Weary with the[s]e reflections, I returned to the kitchen to perform [s]ome hou[s]ehold office. I had u[s]ually but one [s]ervant, and [s]he was a girl about my own age. I was bu[s]y near the chimney, and [s]he was employed near the door of the apartment, when [s]ome one knocked. The door was opened by her, and [s]he was immediately addre[s][s]ed with "Pry'thee, good girl, can[s]t thou [s]upply a thir[s]ty man with a gla[s]s of buttermilk?" She an[s]wered that there was none in the hou[s]e. "Aye, but [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-069.jpg) \- external link  - Page 060. ] there is [s]ome in the dairy yonder. Thou knowe[s]t as well as I, though Hermes never taught thee, that though every dairy be an hou[s]e, every hou[s]e is not a dairy." To this [s]peech, though [s]he under[s]tood only a part of it, [s]he replied by repeating her assurances, that [s]he had none to give. "Well then," rejoined the [s]tranger, "for charity's [s]weet [s]ake, hand me forth a cup of cold water." The girl [s]aid [s]he would go to the [s]pring and fetch it. "Nay, give me the cup, and [s]uffer me to help my[s]elf. Neither manacled nor lame, I [s]hould merit burial in the maw of carrion crows, if I laid this ta[s]k upon thee." She gave him the cup, and he turned to go to the [s]pring. I li[s]tened to this dialogue in [s]ilence. The words uttered by the per[s]on without, affected me as somewhat [s]ingular, but what chiefly rendered them remarkable, was the tone that accompanied them. It was wholly new. My brother's voice and Pleyel's were mu[s]ical and energetic. I had fondly imagined, that, in this re[s]pect, they were [s]urpa[s][s]ed by none. Now my mi[s]take was detected. I cannot pretend to communicate the impre[s][s]ion that was made upon me by the[s]e accents, or to depict the degree in which force and [s]weetne[s]s were blended in them. They were articulated with a distinctness that was unexampled in my experience. But this was not all. The voice was not only mellifluent and clear, but the empha[s]is was [s]o ju[s]t, and the modulation [s]o impa[s][s]ioned, that it [s]eemed as if an heart of [s]tone could not fail of being moved by it. It imparted to me an emotion altogether involuntary and incontroulable. When he uttered the words "for charity's [s]weet [s]ake," I dropped the cloth that I held in my hand, my heart overflowed with [s]ympathy, and my eyes with unbidden tears. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-070.jpg) \- external link  - Page 061. ] This de[s]cription will appear to you trifling or incredible. The importance of the[s]e circum[s]tances will be manife[s]ted in the [s]equel. The manner in which I was affected on this occa[s]ion, was, to my own apprehen[s]ion, a [s]ubject of a[s]toni[s]hment. The tones were indeed [s]uch as I never heard before; but that they [s]hould, in an in[s]tant, as it were, di[s][s]olve me in tears, will not ea[s]ily believed by others, and can [s]carcely be comprehended by my[s]elf. It will be readily [s]uppo[s]ed that I was [s]omewhat inqui[s]itive as to the per[s]on and demeanour of our vi[s]itant. After a moment's pau[s]e, I [s]tepped to the door and looked after him. Judge my [s]urprize, when I beheld the [s]elf-[s]ame figure that had appeared an half hour before upon the bank. My fancy had conjured up a very different image. A form, and attitude, and garb, were in[s]tantly created worthy to accompany [s]uch elocution; but this per[s]on was, in all vi[s]ible re[s]pects, the rever[s]e of this phantom. Strange as it may [s]eem, I could not [s]peedily reconcile my[s]elf to this di[s]appointment. In[s]tead of returning to my employment, I threw my[s]elf in a chair that was placed oppo[s]ite the door, and [s]unk into a fit of mu[s]ing. My attention was, in a few minutes, recalled by the [s]tranger, who returned with the empty cup in his hand. I had not thought of the circumstance, or [s]hould certainly have cho[s]en a different [s]eat. He no [s]ooner [s]hewed him[s]elf, than a confused [s]en[s]e of impropriety, added to the [s]uddenne[s]s of the interview, for which, not having fore[s]een it, I had made no preparation, threw me into a [s]tate of the mo[s]t painful embarra[s][s]ment. He brought with him a placid brow; but no [s]ooner had he ca[s]t his eyes upon me, than his face was as glowingly [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-071.jpg) \- external link  - Page 062. ] [s]uffu[s]ed as my own. He placed the cup upon the bench, [s]tammered out thanks, and retired. It was [s]ome time before I could recover my wonted compo[s]ure. I had [s]natched a view of the [s]tranger's countenance. The impre[s][s]ion that it made was vivid and indelible. His cheeks were pallid and lank, his eyes [s]unken, his forehead over[s]hadowed by coar[s]e [s]traggling hairs, his teeth large and irregular, though [s]ound and brilliantly white, and his chin di[s]coloured by a tetter. His [s]kin was of coar[s]e grain, and [s]allow hue. Every feature was wide of beauty, and the outline of his face reminded you of an inverted cone. And yet his forehead, [s]o far as [s]haggy locks. would allow it to be [s]een, his eyes lu[s]trou[s]ly black, and po[s][s]e[s][s]ing, in the mid[s]t of haggardne[s]s, a radiance inexpre[s][s]ibly [s]erene and potent, and [s]omething in the re[s]t of his features, which it would be in vain to de[s]cribe, but which [s]erved to betoken a mind of the highe[s]t order, were e[s][s]ential ingredients in the portrait. This, in the effects which immediately flowed from it, I count among the mo[s]t extraordinary incidents of my life. This face, [s]een for a moment, continued for hours to occupy my fancy, to the exclu[s]ion of almo[s]t every other image. I had purpo[s]ed to [s]pend the evening with my brother, but I could not re[s]i[s]t the inclination of forming a [s]ketch upon paper of this memorable vi[s]age. Whether my hand was aided by any peculiar inspiration, or I was deceived by my own fond conceptions, this portrait, though ha[s]tily executed, appeared unexceptionable to my own ta[s]te. I placed it at all di[s]tances, and in all lights; my eyes were rivetted upon it. Half the night pa[s][s]ed away in wakefulne[s]s and in contemplation of this picture. So flexible, and yet [s]o [s]tubborn, is the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-072.jpg) \- external link  - Page 063. ] human mind. So obedient to impul[s]es the mo[s]t tran[s]ient and brief, and yet [s]o unalterably ob[s]ervant of the direction which is given to it! How little did I then fore[s]ee the termination of that chain, of which this may be regarded as the fir[s]t link? Next day aro[s]e in darkne[s]s and [s]torm. Torrents of rain fell during the whole day, attended with ince[s][s]ant thunder, which reverberated in stunning echoes from the oppo[s]ite declivity. The inclemency of the air would not allow me to walk out. I had, indeed, no inclination to leave my apartment. I betook my[s]elf to the contemplation of this portrait, who[s]e attractions time had rather enhanced than dimini[s]hed. I laid a[s]ide my u[s]ual occupations, and [s]eating my[s]elf at a window, con[s]umed the day in alternately looking out upon the [s]torm, and gazing at the picture which lay upon a table before me. You will, perhaps, deem this conduct [s]omewhat [s]ingular, and a[s]cribe it to certain peculiarities of temper. I am not aware of any [s]uch peculiarities. I can account for my devotion to this image no otherwi[s]e, than by supposing that its properties were rare and prodigious. Perhaps you will [s]u[s]pect that [s]uch were the fir[s]t inroads of a pa[s][s]ion incident to every female heart, and which frequently gains a [s]ooting by means even more [s]light, and more improbable than the[s]e. I [s]hall not controvert the rea[s]onablene[s]s of the suspicion, but leave you at liberty to draw; from my narrative, what conclu[s]ions you plea[s]e. Night at length returned, and the [s]torm cea[s]ed. The air was once more clear and calm, and bore an a[s][s]ecting contra[s]t to that uproar of the elements by which it had been preceded. I [s]pent the darksome hours, as I [s]pent the day, contemplative and [s]eated at the window. Why was my mind [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-073.jpg) \- external link  - Page 064. ] absorbed in thoughts ominous and dreary? Why did my bo[s]om heave with [s]ighs, and my eyes overflow with tears? Was the tempe[s]t that had ju[s]t pa[s]t a [s]ignal of the ruin which impended over me? My [s]oul fondly dwelt upon the images of my brother and his children, yet they only increa[s]ed the mournfulne[s]s of my contemplations. The [s]miles of the charming babes were as bland as formerly. The [s]ame dignity [s]at on the brow of their father, and yet I thought of them with anguish. Something whi[s]pered that the happine[s]s we at pre[s]ent enjoyed was [s]et on mutable foundations. Death mu[s]t happen to all. Whether our felicity was to be [s]ubverted by it to-morrow, or whether it was ordained that we [s]hould lay down our heads full of years and of honor, was a que[s]tion that no human being could [s]olve. At other times, the[s]e ideas [s]eldom intruded. I either forbore to reflect upon the de[s]tiny that is re[s]erved for all men, or the reflection was mixed up with images that di[s]robed it of terror; but now the uncertainty of life occurred to me without any of its u[s]ual and alleviating accompaniments. I [s]aid to my[s]elf, we mu[s]t die. Sooner or later, we mu[s]t di[s]appear for ever from the face of the earth. Whatever be the links that hold us to life, they mu[s]t be broken. This [s]cene of exi[s]tence is, in all its parts, calamitous. The greater number is oppre[s][s]ed with immediate evils, and tho[s]e, the tide of who[s]e fortunes is full, how [s]inall is their portion of enjoyment, [s]ince they know that it will terminate. For [s]ome time I indulged my[s]elf, without reluctance, in the[s]e gloomy thoughts; but at length, the dejection which they produced became insupportably painful. I endeavoured to di[s][s]ipate it with mu[s]ic. I had all my grand-father's melody as well [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-074.jpg) \- external link  - Page 065. ] as poetry by rote. I now lighted by chance on a ballad, which commemorated the fate of a German Cavalier, who fell at the [s]iege of Nice under Godfrey of Bouillon. My choice was unfortunate, for the [s]cenes of violence and carnage which were here wildly but forcibly pourtrayed, only [s]ugge[s]ted to my thoughts a new topic in the horrors of war. I [s]ought refuge, but ineffectually, in [s]leep. My mind was thronged by vivid, but confu[s]ed images, and no effort that I made was [s]ufficient to drive them away. In this [s]ituation I heard the clock, which hung in the room, give the [s]ignal for twelve. It was the [s]ame in[s]trument which formerly hung in my father's chamber, and which, on account of its being his workman[s]hip, was regarded, by every one of our family, with veneration. It had fallen to me, in the divi[s]ion of his property, and was placed in this a[s]ylum. The [s]ound awakened a [s]eries of reflections, re[s]pecting his death. I was not allowed to pur[s]ue them; for [s]carcely had the vibrations cea[s]ed, when my attention was attracted by a whi[s]per, which, at fir[s]t, appeared to proceed from lips that were laid clo[s]e to my ear. No wonder that a circum[s]tance like this [s]tartled me. In the fir[s]t impul[s]e of my terror, I uttered a [s]light [s]cream, and [s]hrunk to the oppo[s]ite [s]ide of the bed. In a moment, however, I recovered from my trepidation. I was habitually indifferent to all the cau[s]es of fear, by which the majority are afflicted. I entertained no apprehen[s]ion of either gho[s]ts or robbers. Our [s]ecurity had never been mole[s]ted by either, and I made u[s]e of no means to prevent or counterwork their machinations. My tranquillity, on this occa[s]ion, was quickly retrieved. The whi[s]per evidently proceeded from one who was po[s]ted at my bed-[s]ide. The fir[s]t idea that [s]ugge[s]ted [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-075.jpg) \- external link  - Page 066. ] it[s]elf was, that it was uttered by the girl who lived with me as a [s]ervant. Perhaps, [s]omewhat had alarmed her, or [s]he was [s]ick, and had come to request my a[s][s]i[s]tance. By whi[s]pering in my ear, [s]he intended to rou[s]e without alarming me. Full of this per[s]ua[s]ion, I called; "Judith," [s]aid I, "is it you? What do you want? Is there any thing the matter with you?" No an[s]wer was returned. I repeated my inquiry, but equally in vain. Cloudy as was the atmo[s]phere, and curtained as my bed was, nothing was vi[s]ible, I withdrew the curtain, and leaning my head on my elbow, I li[s]tened with the deepe[s]t attention to catch [s]ome new [s]ound. Meanwhile, I ran over in my thoughts, every circum[s]tance that could a[s][s]i[s]t my conjectures. My habitation was a wooden edifice, con[s]i[s]ting of two [s]tories. In each [s]tory were two rooms, [s]eparated by an entry, or middle pa[s][s]age, with which they communicated by oppo[s]ite doors. The pa[s][s]age, on the lower [s]tory, had doors at the two ends, and a [s]tair-ca[s]e. Windows an[s]wered to the doors on the upper [s]tory. Annexed to this, on the ea[s]tern [s]ide, were wings, divided, in like manner, into an upper and lower room; one of them comprized a kitchen, and chamber above it for the servant, and communicated, on both [s]tories, with the parlour adjoining it below, and the chamber adjoining it above. The oppo[s]ite wing is of [s]maller dimen[s]ions, the rooms not being above eight feet [s]quare. The lower of the[s]e was u[s]ed as a depository of hou[s]ehold implements, the upper was a clo[s]et in which I depo[s]ited my books and papers. They had but one inlet, which was from the room adjoining. There was no window in the lower one, and in the upper, a [s]mall aperture which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-076.jpg) \- external link  - Page 067. ] communicated light and air, but would [s]carcely admit the body. The door which led into this, was clo[s]e to my bed-head, and was always locked, but when I my[s]elf was within. The avenues below were accu[s]tomed to be clo[s]ed and bolted at nights. The maid was my only companion, and [s]he could not reach my chamber without previou[s]ly pa[s][s]ing through the oppo[s]ite chamber, and the middle pa[s][s]age, of which, however, the doors were u[s]ually unfa[s]tened. If [s]he had occa[s]ioned this noi[s]e, [s]he would have an[s]wered my repeated calls. No other conclu[s]ion, therefore, was left me, but that I had mi[s]taken the [s]ounds, and that my imagination had transformed [s]ome ca[s]ual noi[s]e into the voice of a human creature. Satisfied with this [s]olution, I was preparing to relinqui[s]h my li[s]tening attitude, when my ear was again [s]aluted with a new and yet louder whi[s]pering. It appeared, as before, to i[s][s]ue from lips that touched my pillow. A [s]econd effort of attention, however, clearly [s]hewed me, that the [s]ounds i[s][s]ued from within the clo[s]et, the door of which was not more than eight inches from my pillow. This [s]econd interruption occa[s]ioned a [s]hock le[s]s vehement than the former. I [s]tarted, but gave no audible token of alarm. I was [s]o much mi[s]tre[s]s of my feelings, as to continue li[s]tening to what [s]hould be [s]aid. The whi[s]per was di[s]tinct, hoar[s]e, and uttered [s]o as to [s]hew that the [s]peaker was desirous of being heard by [s]ome one near, but, at the [s]ame time, [s]tudious to avoid being overheard by any other. "Stop, [s]top, I [s]ay; madmam as you are! there are better means than that. Cur[s]e upon your ra[s]hne[s]s! There is no need to [s]hoot." Such were the words uttered in a tone of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-077.jpg) \- external link  - Page 068. ] eagerness and anger, within [s]o [s]mall a di[s]tance of my pillow. What con[s]truction could I put upon them? My heart began to palpitate with dread of [s]ome unknown danger. Pre[s]ently, another voice, but equally near me, was heard whi[s]pering in answer. "Why not? I will draw a trigger in this bu[s]ine[s]s, but perdition be my lot if I do more." To this, the fir[s]t voice returned, in a tone which rage had heightened in a [s]mall degree above a whi[s]per, "Coward! [s]tand a[s]ide, and [s]ee me do it. I will gra[s]p her throat; I will do her bu[s]ine[s]s in an in[s]tant; [s]he [s]hall not have time [s]o much as to groan." What wonder that I was petrified by [s]ounds [s]o dreadful! Murderers lurked in my clo[s]et. They were planning the means of my destruction. One re[s]olved to [s]hoot, and the other menaced [s]uffocation. Their means being cho[s]en, they would forthwith break the door. Flight instantly [s]ugge[s]ted it[s]elf as mo[s]t eligible in circumstances [s]o perilous. I deliberated not a moment; but, fear adding wings to my [s]peed, I leaped out of bed, and [s]cantily robed as I was, ru[s]hed out of the chamber, down [s]tairs, and into the open air. I can hardly recollect the proce[s]s of turning keys, and withdrawing bolts. My terrors urged me forward with almo[s]t a mechanical impul[s]e. I [s]topped not till I reached my brother's door. I had not gained the thre[s]hold, when, exhau[s]ted by the violence of my emotions, and by my [s]peed, I [s]unk down in a [s]it. How long I remained in this [s]ituation I know not. When I recovered, I found my[s]elf [s]tretched on a bed, [s]urrounded by my [s]i[s]ter and her female [s]ervants. I was a[s]tonished at the [s]cene before me, but gradually recovered the recollection of what had happened. I an[s]wered their importunate [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-078.jpg) \- external link  - Page 069. ] inquiries as well as I was able. My brother and Pleyel, whom the [s]torm of the preceding day chanced to detain here, informing them[s]elves of every particular, proceeded with lights and weapons to my de[s]erted habitation. They entered my chamber and my clo[s]et, and found every thing in its proper place and cu[s]tomary order. The door of the clo[s]et was locked, and appeared not to have been opened in my ab[s]ence. They went to Judith's apartment. They found her a[s]leep and in [s]afety. Pleyel's caution induced him to forbear alarming the girl; and finding her wholly ignorant of what had pa[s][s]ed, they directed her to return to her chamber. They then fa[s]tened the doors, and returned. My friends were di[s]po[s]ed to regard this transaction as a dream. That per[s]ons [s]hould be actually immured in this clo[s]et, to which, in the circumstances of the time, acce[s]s from without or within was apparently impo[s][s]ible, they could not [s]eriou[s]ly believe. That any human beings had intended murder, unle[s]s it were to cover a [s]cheme of pillage, was incredible; but that no [s]uch de[s]ign had been formed, was evident from the [s]ecurity in which the furniture of the hou[s]e and the clo[s]et remained. I revolved every incident and expre[s][s]ion that had occurred. My [s]en[s]es a[s][s]ured me of the truth of them, and yet their abruptne[s]s and improbability made me, in my turn, [s]omewhat incredulous. The adventure had made a deep impre[s][s]ion on my fancy, and it was not till after a week's abode at my brother's, that I re[s]olved to re[s]ume the po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of my own dwelling. There was another circum[s]tance that enhanced the my[s]teriou[s]ne[s]s of this event. After my recovery it was obvious to inquire by what means the attention of the family had been drawn to my [s]ituation. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-079.jpg) \- external link  - Page 070. ] I had fallen before I had reached the thre[s]hold, or was able to give any [s]ignal. My brother related, that while this was tran[s]acting in my chamber, he him[s]elf was awake, in con[s]equence of [s]ome [s]light indi[s]po[s]ition, and lay, according to his cu[s]tom, mu[s]ing on [s]ome [s]avorite topic. Suddenly the [s]ilence, which was remarkably profound, was broken by a voice of mo[s]t piercing [s]hrillne[s]s, that [s]eemed to be uttered by one in the hall below his chamber. "Awake! ari[s]e!" it exclaimed: "hasten to [s]uccour one that is dying at your door." This [s]ummons was effectual. There was no one in the hou[s]e who was not rou[s]ed by it. Pleyel was the fir[s]t to obey, and my brother overtook him before he reached the hall. What was the general a[s]toni[s]hment when your friend was di[s]covered [s]tretched upon the gra[s]s before the door, pale, gha[s]tly, and with every mark of death! This was the third in[s]tance of a voice, exerted for the benefit of this little community. The agent was no le[s]s in[s]crutable in this, than in the former ca[s]e. When I ruminated upon the[s]e events, my [s]oul was [s]u[s]pended in wonder and awe. Was I really deceived in imagining that I heard the clo[s]et conver[s]ation? I was no longer at liberty to question the reality of tho[s]e accents which had formerly recalled my brother from the hill; which had imparted tidings of the death of the German lady to Pleyel; and which had lately [s]ummoned them to my a[s][s]i[s]tance. But how was I to regard this midnight conversation? Hoar[s]e and manlike voices con[s]erring on the means of death, [s]o near my bed, and at [s]uch an hour! How had my ancient [s]ecurity vani[s]hed! That dwelling, which had hitherto been an inviolate a[s]ylum, was now be[s]et with danger to my life. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-080.jpg) \- external link  - Page 071. ] That [s]olitude, formerly [s]o dear to me, could no longer be endured. Pleyel, who had con[s]ented to re[s]ide with us during the months of [s]pring, lodged in the vacant chamber, in order to quiet my alarms. He treated my fears with ridicule, and in a [s]hort time very [s]ight traces of them remained: but as it was wholly indifferent to him whether his nights were pa[s][s]ed at my hou[s]e or at my brother's, this arrangement gave general [s]atisfaction. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-081.jpg) \- external link  - Page 072. ] I will not enumerate the various inquiries and conjectures which the[s]e incidents occa[s]ioned. After all our efforts, we came no nearer to di[s]pelling the mi[s]t in which they were involved; and time, in[s]tead of facilitating a [s]olution, only accumulated our doubts. In the mid[s]t of thoughts excited by the[s]e events, I was not unmindful of my interview with the [s]tranger. I related the particulars, and [s]hewed the portrait to my friends. Pleyel recollected to have met with a figure re[s]embling my de[s]cription in the city; but neither his face or garb made the [s]ame impression upon him that it made upon me. It was a hint to rally me upon my prepo[s][s]e[s][s]ions, and to amu[s]e us with a thou[s]and ludicrous anecdotes which he had collected in his travels. He made no [s]cruple to charge me with being in love; and threatened to inform the [s]wain, when he met him, of his good fortune. Pleyel's temper made him [s]u[s]ceptible of no durable impre[s][s]ions. His conver[s]ation was occasionally vi[s]ited by gleams of his ancient vivacity; but, though his impetuo[s]ity was [s]ometimes inconvenient, there was nothing to dread from his malice. I had no fear that my character or dignity would [s]uffer in his hands, and was not heartily di[s]plea[s]ed when he declared his intention of profiting by his fir[s]t meeting with the [s]tranger to introduce him to our acquaintance. Some weeks after this I had [s]pent a toil[s]ome day, and, as the [s]un declined, found my[s]elf di[s]po[s]ed to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-082.jpg) \- external link  - Page 073. ] [s]eek relief in a walk. The river bank is, at this part of it, and for [s]ome con[s]iderable [s]pace upward, [s]o rugged and [s]teep as not to be ea[s]ily de[s]cended. In a rece[s]s of this declivity, near the [s]outhern verge of my little deme[s]ne, was placed a [s]light building, with [s]eats and lattices. From a crevice of the rock, to which this edifice was attached, there bur[s]t forth a [s]tream of the pure[s]t water, which, leaping from ledge to ledge, for the [s]pace of [s]ixty feet, produced a fre[s]hne[s]s in the air, and a murmur, the mo[s]t delicious and [s]oothing imaginable. The[s]e, added to the odours of the cedars which embowered it, and of the honey-[s]uckle which clu[s]tered among the lattices, rendered this my favorite retreat in [s]ummer. On this occa[s]ion I repaired hither. My [s]pirits drooped through the fatigue of long attention, and I threw my[s]elf upon a bench, in a [s]tate, both mentally and per[s]onally, of the utmo[s]t [s]upinene[s]s. The lulling [s]ounds of the waterfall, the fragrance and the du[s]k combined to becalm my [s]pirits, and, in a [s]hort time, to [s]ink me into [s]leep. Either the unea[s]ine[s]s of my po[s]ture, or [s]ome [s]light indisposition mole[s]ted my repo[s]e with dreams of no cheerful hue. After various incoherences had taken their turn to occupy my fancy, I at length imagined my[s]elf walking, in the evening twilight, to my brother's habitation. A pit, methought, had been dug in the path I had taken, of which I was not aware. As I carele[s][s]ly pur[s]ued my walk, I thought I [s]aw my brother, [s]tanding at [s]ome distance before me, beckoning and calling me to make ha[s]te. He [s]tood on the oppo[s]ite edge of the gulph. I mended my pace, and one [s]tep more would have plunged me into this aby[s]s, had not [s]ome one from behind caught [s]uddenly my arm, and exclaimed, in a voice of eagerne[s]s and terror, "Hold! hold!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-083.jpg) \- external link  - Page 074. ] The [s]ound broke my [s]leep, and I found my[s]elf, at the next moment, [s]tanding on my feet, and surrounded by the deepe[s]t darkne[s]s. Images [s]o terrific and forcible di[s]abled me, for a time, from distinguishing between [s]leep and wakefulne[s]s, and withheld from me the knowledge of my actual condition. My fir[s]t panics were [s]ucceeded by the perturbations of [s]urprize, to find my[s]elf alone in the open air, and immer[s]ed in [s]o deep a gloom. I [s]lowly recollected the incidents of the afternoon, and how I came hither. I could not e[s]timate the time, but [s]aw the propriety of returning with [s]peed to the hou[s]e. My faculties were [s]till too confu[s]ed, and the darkne[s]s too inten[s]e, to allow me immediately to find my way up the [s]teep. I [s]at down, therefore, to recover my[s]elf, and to reflect upon my [s]ituation. This was no [s]ooner done, than a low voice was heard from behind the lattice, on the [s]ide where I [s]at. Between the rock and the lattice was a cha[s]m not wide enough to admit a human body; yet, in this cha[s]m he that [s]poke appeared to be [s]tationed. "Attend! attend! but be not terrified." I [s]tarted and exclaimed, "Good heavens! what is that? Who are you?" "A friend; one come, not to injure, but to [s]ave you; fear nothing." This voice was immediately recognized to be the [s]ame with one of tho[s]e which I had heard in the clo[s]et; it was the voice of him who had propo[s]ed to [s]hoot, rather than to [s]trangle, his victim. My terror made me, at once, mute and motionle[s]s. He continued, "I leagued to murder you. I repent. Mark my bidding, and be [s]afe. Avoid this [s]pot. The [s]nares of death encompa[s]s it. El[s]ewhere danger will be di[s]tant; but this [s]pot, [s]hun it as you [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-084.jpg) \- external link  - Page 075. ] value your life. Mark me further; profit by this warning, but divulge it not. If a [s]yllable of what has pa[s][s]ed e[s]cape you, your doom is [s]ealed. Remember your father, and be faithful." Here the accents cea[s]ed, and left me overwhelmed with di[s]may. I was fraught with the per[s]ua[s]ion, that during every moment I remained here, my life was endangered; but I could not take a [s]tep without hazard of falling to the bottom of the precipice. The path, leading to the [s]ummit, was [s]hort, but rugged and intricate. Even [s]tar-light was excluded by the umbrage, and not the fainte[s]t gleam was afforded to guide my [s]teps. What [s]hould I do? To depart or remain was equally and eminently perilous. In this [s]tate of uncertainty, I perceived a ray flit acro[s]s the gloom and di[s]appear. Another succeeded, which was [s]tronger, and remained for a pa[s][s]ing moment. It glittered on the [s]hrubs that were scattered at the entrance, and gleam continued to succeed gleam for a few [s]econds, till they, finally, gave place to unintermitted darkne[s]s. The fir[s]t vi[s]itings of this light called up a train of horrors in my mind; de[s]truction impended over this [s]pot; the voice which I had lately heard had warned me to retire, and had menaced me with the fate of my father if I refu[s]ed. I was de[s]irous, but unable, to obey; the[s]e gleams were [s]uch as preluded the [s]troke by which he fell; the hour, perhaps, was the [s]ame---I [s]huddered as if I had beheld, [s]u[s]pended over me, the exterminating [s]word. Pre[s]ently a new and [s]tronger illumination bur[s]t through the lattice on the right hand, and a voice, from the edge of the precipice above, called out my name. It was Pleyel. Joyfully did I recognize his accents; but [s]uch was the tumult of my thoughts [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-085.jpg) \- external link  - Page 076. ] that I had not power to an[s]wer him till he had frequently repeated his [s]ummons. I hurried, at length, from the fatal [s]pot, and, directed by the lanthorn which he bore, a[s]cended the hill. Pale and breathie[s]s, it was with difficulty I could [s]upport my[s]elf. He anxiou[s]ly inquired into the cau[s]e of my affright, and the motive of my unusual ab[s]ence. He had returned from my brother's at a late hour, and was informed by Judith, that I had walked out before [s]un-[s]et, and had not yet returned. This intelligence was [s]omewhat alarming. He waited [s]ome time; but, my ab[s]ence continuing, he had [s]et out in [s]earch of me. He had explored the neighbourhood with the utmo[s]t care, but, receiving no tidings of me, he was preparing to acquaint my brother with this circum[s]tance, when he recollected the [s]ummer-hou[s]e on the bank, and conceived it po[s][s]ible that [s]ome accident had detained me there. He again inquired into the cau[s]e of this detention, and of that confu[s]ion and di[s]may which my looks te[s]tified. I told him that I had [s]trolled hither in the afternoon, that [s]leep had overtaken me as I [s]at, and that I had awakened a few minutes before his arrival. I could tell him no more. In the pre[s]ent impetuosity of my thoughts, I was almo[s]t dubious, whether the pit, into which my brother had endeavoured to entice me, and the voice that talked through the lattice, were not parts of the [s]ame dream. I remembered, likewi[s]e, the charge of [s]ecrecy, and the penatly denounced, if I [s]hould ra[s]hly divulge what I had heard. For the[s]e rea[s]ons, I was [s]ilent on that [s]ubject, and [s]hutting my[s]elf in my chamber, delivered my[s]elf up to contemplation. What I have related will, no doubt, appear to you a fable. You will believe that calamity has [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-086.jpg) \- external link  - Page 077. ] [s]ubverted my rea[s]on, and that I am amu[s]ing you with the chimeras of my brain, in[s]tead of facts that have really happened. I [s]hall not be [s]urprized or offened, if the[s]e be your [s]u[s]picions. I know not, indeed, how you can deny them admi[s][s]ion. For, if to me, the immediate witne[s]s, they were fertile of perplexity and doubt, how mu[s]t they affect another to whom they are recommended only by my testimony? It was only by [s]ub[s]equent events, that I was fully and inconte[s]tibly a[s][s]ured of the veracity of my [s]en[s]es. Meanwhile what was I to think? I had been a[s][s]ured that a de[s]ign had been formed again[s]t my life. The ruffians had leagued to murder me. Whom had I offended? Who was there with whom I had ever maintained intercour[s]e, who was capable of harbouring [s]uch atrocious purpo[s]es? My temper was the rever[s]e of cruel and imperious. My heart was touched with [s]ympathy for the children of misfortune. But this [s]ympathy was not a barren [s]entiment. My pur[s]e, [s]canty as it was, was ever open, and my hands ever active, to relieve di[s]tre[s]s. Many were the wretches whom my per[s]onal exertions had extricated from want and di[s]ea[s]e, and who rewarded me with their gratitude. There was no face which lowered at my approach, and no lips which uttered imprecations in my hearing. On the contrary, there was none, over who[s]e fate I had exerted any influence, or to whom I was known by reputation, who did not greet me with [s]miles, and di[s]mi[s]s me with proofs of veneration; yet did not my [s]en[s]es a[s][s]ure me that a plot was laid again[s]t my life? I am not de[s]titute of courage, I have [s]hewn my[s]elf deliberative and calm in the mid[s]t of peril. I have hazarded my own life, for the pre[s]ervation [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-087.jpg) \- external link  - Page 078. ] of another, but now was I confu[s]ed and panic [s]truck. I have not lived [s]o as to fear death, yet to peri[s]h by an un[s]een and [s]ecret [s]troke, to be mangled by the knife of an a[s][s]a[s][s]in, was a thought at which I [s]huddered; what had I done to de[s]erve to be made the victim of malignant pa[s][s]ions? But [s]oft! was I not a[s][s]ured, that my life was [s]afe in all places but one? And why was the treason limited to take effect in this [s]pot? I was every where equally defencele[s]s. My hou[s]e and chamber were, at all times, acce[s][s]ible. Danger [s]till impended over me; the bloody purpo[s]e was [s]till entertained, but the hand that was to execute it, was powerle[s]s in all places but one! Here I had remained for the la[s]t four or five hours, without the means of re[s]i[s]tance or defence, yet I had not been attacked. A human being was at hand, who was con[s]cious of my pre[s]ence, and warned me hereafter to avoid this retreat. His voice was not ab[s]olutely new, but had I never heard it but once before? But why did he prohibit me from relating this incident to others, and what [s]pecies of death will be awarded if I di[s]obey? He talked of my father. He intimated, that disclosure would pull upon my head, the [s]ame destruction. Was then the death of my father, portentous and inexplicable as it was, the con[s]equence of human machinations? It [s]hould [s]eem, that this being is appri[s]ed of the true nature of this event, and is con[s]cious of the means that led to it. Whether it [s]hall likewi[s]e fall upon me, depends upon the ob[s]ervance of [s]ilence. Was it the infraction of a [s]imilar command, that brought [s] horrible a penalty upon my father? Such were the reflections that haunted me during the night, and which effectually deprived me of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-088.jpg) \- external link  - Page 079. ] [s]leep. Next morning, at breakfa[s]t, Pleyel related an event which my di[s]appearance had hindered him from mentioning the night before. Early the preceding morning, his occa[s]ions called him to the city; he had [s]tepped into a coffee-hou[s]e to while away an hour; here he had met a per[s]on who[s]e appearance in[s]tantly be[s]poke him to be the [s]ame who[s]e ha[s]ty vi[s]it I have mentioned, and who[s]e extraordinary vi[s]age and tones had [s]o powerfully affected me. On an attentive [s]urvey, however, he proved, likewi[s]e, to be one with whom my friend had had [s]ome intercour[s]e in Europe. This authori[s]ed the liberty of acco[s]ting him, and after [s]ome conver[s]ation, mindful, as Pleyel [s]aid, of the footing which this [s]tranger had gained in my heart, he had ventured to invite him to Mettingen. The invitation had been cheerfully accepted, and a vi[s]it promi[s]ed on the afternoon of the next day. This information excited no [s]ober emotions in my brea[s]t. I was, of cour[s]e, eager to be informed as to the circum[s]tances of their ancient intercour[s]e. When, and where had they met? What knew he of the life and character of this man? In an[s]wer to my inquiries, he informed me that, three years before, he was a traveller in Spain. He had made an excur[s]ion from Valencia to Murviedro, with a view to in[s]pect the remains of Roman magnificence, [s]cattered in the environs of that town. While traver[s]ing the [s]cite of the theatre of old Saguntum, he lighted upon this man, [s]eated on a [s]tone, and deeply engaged in peru[s]ing the work of the deacon Marti. A [s]hort conver[s]ation en[s]ued, which proved the [s]tranger to be Engli[s]h. They returned to Valencia together. His garb, a[s]pect, and deportment, were wholly Spani[s]h. A re[s]idence of three years in the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-089.jpg) \- external link  - Page 080. ] country, indefatigable attention to the language, and a [s]tudious conformity with the cu[s]toms of the people, had made him indi[s]ting ui[s]hable from a native, when he cho[s]e to a[s][s]ume that character. Pleyel found him to be connected, on the footing of friend[s]hip and re[s]pect, with many eminent merchants in that city. He had embraced the catholic religion, and adopted a Spani[s]h name in[s]tead of his own, which was Carwin, and devoted him[s]elf to the literature and religion of his new country. He pur[s]ued no profession, but [s]ub[s]i[s]ted on remittances from England. While Pleyel remained in Valencia, Carwin betrayed no aver[s]ion to intercour[s]e, and the former found no [s]mall attractions in the [s]ociety of this new acquaintance. On general topics he was highly intelligent and communicative. He had vi[s]ited every corner of Spain, and could furni[s]h the mo[s]t accurate details re[s]pecting its ancient and pre[s]ent [s]tate. On topics of religion and of his own hi[s]tory, previous to his transformation into a Spaniard, he was invariably [s]ilent. You could merely gather from his di[s]cour[s]e that he was Engli[s]h, and that he was well acquainted with the neighbouring countries. His character excited con[s]iderable curio[s]ity in this ob[s]erver. It was not ea[s]y to reconcile his conversion to the Romi[s]h faith, with tho[s]e proofs of knowledge and capacity that were exhibited by him on different occa[s]ions. A [s]u[s]picion was, [s]ometimes, admitted, that his belief was counterfeited for [s]ome political purpo[s]e. The mo[s]t careful ob[s]ervation, however, produced no di[s]covery. His manners were, at all times, harmle[s]s and inartificial, and his habits tho[s]e of a lover of contemplation and seclusion. He appeared to have contracted an affection for Pleyel, who was not [s]low to return it. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-090.jpg) \- external link  - Page 081. ] My friend, after a month's re[s]idence in this city, returned into France, and, [s]ince that period, had heard nothing concerning Carwin till his appearance at Mettingen. On this occa[s]ion Carwin had received Pleyel's greeting with a certain di[s]tance and [s]olemnity to which the latter had not been accu[s]tomed. He had waved noticing the inquiries of Pleyel re[s]pecting his de[s]ertion of Spain, in which he had formerly declared that it was his purpo[s]e to [s]pend his life. He had a[s][s]iduou[s]ly divertted the attention of the latter to indifferent topics, but was [s]till, on every theme, as eloquent and judicious as formerly. Why he had a[s][s]umed the garb of a ru[s]tic, Pleyel was unable to conjecture. Perhaps it might be poverty, perhaps he was [s]wayed by motives which it was his intere[s]t to conceal, but which were connected with con[s]equences of the utmo[s]t moment. Such was the [s]um of my friend's information. I was not [s]orry to be left alone during the greater part of this day. Every employment was irk[s]ome which did not leave me at liberty to meditate. I had now a new [s]ubject on which to exerci[s]e my thoughts. Before evening I [s]hould be u[s]hered into his pre[s]ence, and li[s]ten to tho[s]e tones who[s]e magical and thrilling power I had already experienced. But with what new images would he then be accompanied? Carwin was an adherent to the Romi[s]h faith, yet was an Engli[s]hman by birth, and, perhaps, a prote[s]tant by education. He had adopted Spain for his country, and had intimated a de[s]ign to [s]pend his days there, yet now was an inhabitant of this di[s]trict, and di[s]gui[s]ed by the habiliments of a clown! What could have obliterated the impressions of his youth, and made him abjure his religion [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-091.jpg) \- external link  - Page 082. ] and his country? What [s]ub[s]equent events had introduced [s]o total a change in his plans? In withdrawing from Spain, had he reverted to the religion of his ance[s]tors; or was it true, that his former conver[s]ion was deceitful, and that his conduct had been [s]wayed by motives which it was prudent to conceal? Hours were con[s]umed in revolving the[s]e ideas. My mediatations were inten[s]e; and, when the [s]eries was broken, I began to reflect with a[s]toni[s]hment on my [s]ituation. From the death of my parents, till the commencement of this year, my life had been [s]erene and bli[s]sful, beyond the ordinary portion of humanity; but, now, my bo[s]om was corroded by anxiety. I was vi[s]ited by dread of unknown dangers, and the future was a [s]cene over which clouds rolled, and thunders muttered. I compared the cau[s]e with the effect, and they [s]eemed disproportioned to each other. All unaware, and in a manner which I had no power to explain, I was pu[s]hed from my immoveable and lo[s]ty [s]tation, and ca[s]t upon a [s]ea of troubles. I determined to be my brother's vi[s]itant on this evening, yet my re[s]olves were not unattended with wavering and reluctance. Pleyel's in[s]inuations that I was in love, affected, in no degree, my belief, yet the con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s that this was the opinion of one who would, probably, be pre[s]ent at our introduction to each other, would excite all that confusion which the pa[s][s]ion it[s]elf is apt to produce. This would confirm him in his error, and call forth new railleries. His mirth, when exerted upon this topic, was the [s]ource of the bittere[s]t vexation. Had he been aware of its influence upon my happiness, his temper would not have allowed him to per[s]i[s]t; but this influence, it was my chief [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-092.jpg) \- external link  - Page 083. ] endeavour to conceal. That the belief of my having be[s]towed my heart upon another, produced in my friend none but ludicrous [s]en[s]ations, was the true cau[s]e of my di[s]tre[s]s; but if this had been discovered by him, my di[s]tre[s]s would have been unspeakably aggravated. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-093.jpg) \- external link  - Page 084. ] As [s]oon as evening arrived, I performed my visit. Carwin made one of the company, into which I was u[s]hered. Appearances were the [s]ame as when I before beheld him. His garb was equally negligent and ru[s]tic. I gazed upon his countenance with new curio[s]ity. My [s]ituation was [s]uch as to enable me to be[s]tow upon it a deliberate examination. Viewed at more lei[s]ure, it lo[s]t none of its wonderful properties. I could not deny my homage to the intelligence expre[s][s]ed in it, but was wholly uncertain, whether he were an object to be dreaded or adored, and whether his powers had been exerted to evil or to good. He was [s]paring in di[s]cour[s]e; but whatever he [s]aid was pregnant with meaning, and uttered with rectitude of articulation, and force of empha[s]is, of which I had entertained no conception previou[s]ly to my knowledge of him. Notwith[s]tanding the uncouthne[s]s of his garb, his manners were not unpolished. All topics were handled by him with [s]kill, and without pedantry or affectation. He uttered no [s]entiment calculated to produce a disadvantageous impre[s][s]ion: on the contrary, his observations denoted a mind alive to every generous and heroic feeling. They were introduced without parade, and accompanied with that degree of earnestness which indicates [s]incerity. He parted from us not till late, refu[s]ing an invitation to [s]pend the night here, but readily con[s]ented to repeat his vi[s]it. His vi[s]its were frequently repeated. Each day introduced us to a more intimate [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-094.jpg) \- external link  - Page 085. ] acquaintance with his [s]entiments, but left us wholly in the dark, concerning that about which we were mo[s]t inqui[s]itive. He [s]tudiou[s]ly avoided all mention of his pa[s]t or pre[s]ent [s]ituation. Even the place of his abode in the city he concealed from us. Our [s]phere, in this re[s]pect, being [s]omewhat limited, and the intellectual endowments of this man being indi[s]putably great, his deportment was more diligently marked, and copiou[s]ly commented on by us, than you, perhaps, will think the circum[s]tances warranted. Not a ge[s]ture, or glance, or accent, that was not, in our private a[s][s]emblies, di[s]cu[s][s]ed, and inferences deduced from it. It may well be thought that he modelled his behaviour by an uncommon [s]tandard, when, with all our opportunities and accuracy of ob[s]ervation, we were able, for a long time, to gather no [s]atisfactory information. He afforded us no ground on which to build even a plau[s]ible conjecture. There is a degree of familiarity which takes place between con[s]tant a[s][s]ociates, that ju[s]tifies the negligence of many rules of which, in an earlier period of their intercour[s]e, politene[s]s requires the exact ob[s]ervance. Inquiries into our condition are allowable when they are prompted by a di[s]intere[s]ted concern for our welfare; and this [s]olicitude is not only pardonable, but may ju[s]tly be demanded from tho[s]e who chu[s]e us for their companions. This [s]tate of things was more [s]low to arrive on this occasion than on mo[s]t others, on account of the gravity and loftine[s]s of this man's behaviour. Pleyel, however, began, at length, to employ regular means for this end. He occa[s]ionally alluded to the circum[s]tances in which they had formerly met, and remarked the incongruou[s]ne[s]s between the religion and habits of a Spaniard, with tho[s]e of a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-095.jpg) \- external link  - Page 086. ] native of Britain. He expre[s][s]ed his a[s]toni[s]hment at meeting our gue[s]t in this corner of the globe, e[s]pecially as, when they parted in Spain, he was taught to believe that Carwin [s]hould never leave that country. He in[s]inuated, that a change [s]o great mu[s]t have been prompted by motives of a [s]ingular and momentous kind. No an[s]wer, or an an[s]wer wide of the purpo[s]e; was generally made to the[s]e in[s]inuations. Britons and Spaniards, he [s]aid, are votaries of the [s]ame Deity, and [s]quare their faith by the [s]ame precepts; their ideas are drawn from the [s]ame fountains of literature, and they [s]peak dialects of the [s]ame tongue; their government and laws have more resemblances than differences; they were formerly provinces of the [s]ame civil, and till lately, of the [s]ame religious, Empire. As to the motives which induce men to change the place of their abode, the[s]e mu[s]t unavoidably be fleeting and mutable. If not bound to one [s]pot by conjugal or parental ties, or by the nature of that employment to which we are indebted for [s]ub[s]i[s]tence, the inducements to change are far more numerous and powerful, than oppo[s]ite inducements. He [s]poke as if de[s]irous of [s]hewing that he was not aware of the tendency of Pleyel's remarks; yet, certain tokens were apparent, that proved him by no means wanting in penetration. The[s]e tokens were to be read in his countenance, and not in his words. When any thing was [s]aid, indicating curiosity in us, the gloom of his countenance was deepened, his eyes [s]unk to the ground, and his wonted air was not re[s]umed without vi[s]ible struggle. Hence, it was obvious to infer, that [s]ome incidents of his life were reflected on by him with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-096.jpg) \- external link  - Page 087. ] regret; and that, [s]ince the[s]e incidents were carefully concealed, and even that regret which flowed from them laboriou[s]ly [s]tifled, they had not been merely di[s]a[s]trous. The [s]ecrecy that was ob[s]erved appeared not de[s]igned to provoke or baffle the inquisitive, but was prompted by the [s]hame, or by the prudence of guilt. The[s]e ideas, which were adopted by Pleyel and my brother, as well as my[s]elf, hindered us from employing more direct means for accompli[s]hing our wi[s]hes. Que[s]tions might have been put in [s]uch terms, that no room [s]hould be left for the pretence of mi[s]apprehen[s]ion, and if mode[s]ty merely had been the ob[s]tacle, [s]uch que[s]tions would not have been wanting; but we con[s]idered, that, if the di[s]clo[s]ure were productive of pain or di[s]grace, it was inhuman to extort it. Amid[s]t the various topics that were di[s]cu[s][s]ed in his pre[s]ence, allu[s]ions were, of cour[s]e, made to the inexplicable events that had lately happened. At tho[s]e times, the words and looks of this man were objects of my particular attention. The [s]ubject was extraordinary; and any one who[s]e experience or reflections could throw any light upon it, was entitled to my gratitude. As this man was enlightened by reading and travel, I li[s]tened with eagerne[s]s to the remarks which he [s]hould make. At fir[s]t, I entertained a kind of apprehen[s]ion, that the tale would be heard by him with incredulity and [s]ecret ridicule. I had formerly heard [s]tories that re[s]embled this in [s]ome of their mysterious circum[s]tances, but they were, commonly, heard by me with contempt. I was doubtful, whether the [s]ame impre[s][s]ion would not now be made on the mind of our gue[s]t; but I was mi[s]taken in my fears. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-097.jpg) \- external link  - Page 088. ] He heard them with [s]eriou[s]ne[s]s, and without any marks either of [s]urprize or incredulity. He pur[s]ued, with vi[s]ible plea[s]ure, that kind of di[s]qui[s]ition which was naturally [s]ugge[s]ted by them. His fancy was eminently vigorous and prolific, and if he did not per[s]uade us, that human beings are, [s]ometimes, admitted to a [s]en[s]ible intercour[s]e with the author of nature, he, at lea[s]t, won over our inclination to the cau[s]e. He merely deduced, from his own reasonings, that [s]uch intercour[s]e was probable; but confessed that, though he was acquainted with many in[s]tances [s]omewhat [s]imilar to tho[s]e which had been related by us, none of them were perfectly exempted from the [s]u[s]picion of human agency. On being reque[s]ted to relate the[s]e in[s]tances, he amu[s]ed us with many curious details. His narratives were con[s]tructed with [s]o much [s]kill, and rehearsed with [s]o much energy, that all the effects of a dramatic exhibition were frequently produced by them. Tho[s]e that were mo[s]t coherent and mo[s]t minute, and, of con[s]equence, lea[s]t entitled to credit, were yet rendered probable by the exqui[s]ite art of this rhetorician. For every difficulty that was [s]ugge[s]ted, a ready and plau[s]ible [s]olution was furnished. My[s]terious voices had always a [s]hare in producing the cata[s]trophe, but they were always to be explained on [s]ome known principles, either as reflected into a focus, or communicated through a tube. I could not but remark that his narratives, however complex or marvellous, contained no instance [s]ufficiently parallel to tho[s]e that had befallen our[s]elves, and in which the [s]olution was applicable to our own case. My brother was a much more [s]anguine rea[s]oner than our gue[s]t. Even in [s]ome of the facts which were related by Carwin, he maintained the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-098.jpg) \- external link  - Page 089. ] probability of cele[s]tial interference, when the latter was di[s]po[s]ed to deny it, and had found, as he imagined, foot[s]teps of an human agent. Pleyel was by no means equally credulous. He [s]crupled not to deny faith to any te[s]timony but that of his [s]en[s]es, and allowed the facts which had lately been [s]upported by this te[s]timony, not to mould his belief, but merely to give birth to doubts. It was [s]oon ob[s]erved that Carwin adopted, in [s]ome degree, a [s]imilar di[s]tinction. A tale of this kind, related by others, he would believe, provided it was explicable upon known principles; but that [s]uch notices were actually communicated by beings of an higher order, he would believe only when his own ears were a[s][s]ailed in a manner which could not be otherwi[s]e accounted for. Civility forbad him to contradict my brother or my[s]elf, but his understanding refu[s]ed to acquie[s]ce in our te[s]timony. Besides, he was di[s]po[s]ed to que[s]tion whether the voices heard in the temple, at the foot of the hill, and in my clo[s]et, were not really uttered by human organs. On this [s]upposition he was de[s]ired to explain how the effect was produced. He an[s]wered, that the power of mimickry was very common. Catharine's voice might ea[s]ily be imitated by one at the foot of the hill, who would find no difficulty in eluding, by flight, the [s]earch of Wieland. The tidings of the death of the Saxon lady were uttered by one near at hand, who overheard the conver[s]ation, who conjectured her death, and who[s]e conjecture happened to accord with the truth. That the voice appeared to come from the cieling was to be con[s]idered as an illu[s]ion of the fancy. The cry for help, heard in the hall on the night of my adventure, was to be a[s]cribed to an human creature, who actually [s]tood in the hall [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-099.jpg) \- external link  - Page 090. ] when he uttered it. It was of no moment, he [s]aid, that we could not explain by what motives he that made the [s]ignal was led hither. How imperfectly acquainted were we with the condition and de[s]igns of the beings that [s]urrounded us? The city was near at hand, and thou[s]ands might there exi[s]t who[s]e powers and purpo[s]es might ea[s]ily explain whatever was my[s]terious in this tran[s]action. As to the clo[s]et dialogue, he was obliged to adopt one of two [s]uppo[s]itions, and affirm either that it was fa[s]hioned in my own fancy, or that it actually took place between two per[s]ons in the clo[s]et. Such was Carwin's mode of explaining the[s]e appearances. It is [s]uch, perhaps, as would commend it[s]elf as mo[s]t plau[s]ible to the mo[s]t [s]agacious minds, but it was in[s]ufficient to impart conviction to us. As to the trea[s]on that was meditated again[s]t me, it was doubtle[s]s ju[s]t to conclude that it was either real or imaginary; but that it was real was atte[s]ted by the my[s]terious warning in the summer-house, the [s]ecret of which I had hitherto locked up in my own brea[s]t. A month pa[s][s]ed away in this kind of intercour[s]e. As to Carwin, our ignorance was in no degree enlightened re[s]pecting his genuine character and views. Appearances were uniform. No man po[s][s]e[s][s]ed a larger [s]tore of knowledge, or a greater degree of [s]kill in the communication of it to others; Hence he was regarded as an ine[s]timable addition to our [s]ociety. Con[s]idering the di[s]tance of my brother's hou[s]e from the city, he was frequently prevailed upon to pa[s]s the night where he [s]pent the evening. Two days [s]eldom elap[s]ed without a vi[s]it from him; hence he was regarded as a kind of inmate of the hou[s]e. He entered and departed without ceremony. When he arrived he received an [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-100.jpg) \- external link  - Page 091. ] unaffected welcome, and when he cho[s]e to retire, no importunities were u[s]ed to induce him to remain. The temple was the principal [s]cene of our [s]ocial enjoyments; yet the felicity that we ta[s]ted when assembled in this a[s]ylum, was but the gleam of a former [s]un-[s]hine. Carwin never parted with his gravity. The in[s]crutablene[s]s of his character, and the uncertainty whether his fellow[s]hip tended to good or to evil, were [s]eldom ab[s]ent from our minds. This circum[s]tance powerfully contributed to [s]adden us. My heart was the [s]eat of growing di[s]quietudes. This change in one who had formerly been characterized by all the exuberances of [s]oul, could not fail to be remarked by my friends. My brother was always a pattern of [s]olemnity. My [s]i[s]ter was clay, moulded by the circum[s]tances in which [s]he happened to be placed. There was but one who[s]e deportment remains to be de[s]cribed as being of importance to our happine[s]s. Had Pleyel likewi[s]e di[s]mi[s][s]ed his vivacity? He was as whim[s]ical and je[s]tful as ever, but he was not happy. The truth, in this re[s]pect, was of too much importance to me not to make me a vigilant ob[s]erver. His mirth was ea[s]ily perceived to be the fruit of exertion. When his thoughts wandered from the company, an air of dissatisfaction and impatience [s]tole acro[s]s his features. Even the punctuality and frequency of his vi[s]its were [s]omewhat le[s][s]ened. It may be [s]uppo[s]ed that my own unea[s]ine[s]s was heightened by the[s]e tokens; but, [s]trange as it may [s]eem, I found, in the pre[s]ent [s]tate of my mind, no relief but in the per[s]ua[s]ion that Pleyel was unhappy. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-101.jpg) \- external link  - Page 092. ] That unhappine[s]s, indeed, depended, for its value in my eyes, on the cau[s]e that produced it. It did not ari[s]e from the death of the Saxon lady: it was not a contagious emanation from the countenances of Wieland or Carwin. There was but one other [s]ource whence it could flow. A namele[s]s ec[s]tacy thrilled through my frame when any new proof occurred that the ambiguou[s]ne[s]s of my behaviour was the cau[s]e. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-102.jpg) \- external link  - Page 093. ] My brother had received a new book from Germany. It was a tragedy, and the fir[s]t attempt of a Saxon poet, of whom my brother had been taught to entertain the highe[s]t expectations. The exploits of Zi[s]ca, the Bohemian hero, were woven into a dramatic [s]eries and connection. According to German cu[s]tom, it was minute and diffu[s]e, and dictated by an adventurous and lawle[s]s fancy. It was a chain of audacious acts, and unheard-of disasters. The moated fortre[s]s, and the thicket; the ambu[s]h and the battle; and the conflict of headlong pa[s][s]ions, were pourtrayed in wild numbers, and with terrific energy. An afternoon was [s]et apart to rehear[s]e this performance. The language was familiar to all of us but Carwin, who[s]e company, therefore, was tacitly di[s]pen[s]ed with. The morning previous to this intended rehear[s]al, I [s]pent at home. My mind was occupied with reflections relative to my own [s]ituation. The sentiment which lived with chief energy in my heart, was connected with the image of Pleyel. In the mid[s]t of my angui[s]h, I had not been de[s]titute of con[s]olation. His late deportment had given [s]pring to my hopes. Was not the hour at hand, which [s]hould render me the happie[s]t of human creatures? He [s]u[s]pected that I looked with favorable eyes upon Carwin. Hence aro[s]e di[s]quietudes, which he [s]truggled in vain to conceal. He loved me, but was hopele[s]s that his love would be compensated. Is it not time, [s]aid I, to rectify this error? But by what means is this to be effected? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-103.jpg) \- external link  - Page 094. ] It can only be done by a change of deportment in me; but how mu[s]t I demean my[s]elf for this purpose? I mu[s]t not [s]peak. Neither eyes, nor lips, mu[s]t impart the information. He mu[s]t not be a[s][s]ured that my heart is his, previous to the tender of his own; but he mu[s]t be convinced that it has not been given to another; he mu[s]t be [s]upplied with [s]pace whereon to build a doubt as to the true [s]tate of my affections; he mu[s]t be prompted to avow him[s]elf. The line of delicate propriety; how hard it is, not to fall [s]hort, and not to overleap it! This afternoon we [s]hall meet at the temple. We [s]hall not [s]eparate till late. It will be his province to accompany me home. The airy expan[s]c is without a [s]peck. This breeze is u[s]ually [s]tedfa[s]t, and its promi[s]e of a bland and cloudless evening, may be tru[s]ted. The moon will ri[s]e at eleven, and at that hour, we [s]hall wind along this bank. Po[s][s]ibly that hour may decide my fate. If [s]uitable encouragement be given, Pleyel will reveal his [s]oul to me; and I, ere I reach this thre[s]hold, will be made the happie[s]t of beings. And is this good to be mine? Add wings to thy [s]peed, [s]weet evening; and thou, moon, I charge thee, [s]hroud thy beams at the moment when my Pleyel whi[s]pers love. I would not for the world, that the burning blu[s]hes, and the mounting raptures of that moment, [s]hould be vi[s]ible. But what encouragement is wanting? I mu[s]t be regardful of in[s]urmountable limits. Yet when minds are imbued with a genuine [s]ympathy, are not words and looks [s]uperfluous? Are not motion and touch [s]ufficient to impart feelings [s]uch as mine? Has he not eyed me at moments, when the pre[s][s]ure of his hand has thrown me into tumults, and was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-104.jpg) \- external link  - Page 095. ] it po[s][s]ible that he mi[s]took the impetuo[s]ities of love, for the eloquence of indignation? But the ha[s]tening evening will decide. Would it were come! And yet I [s]hudder at its near approach. An interview that mu[s]t thus terminate, is [s]urely to be wi[s]hed for by me; and yet it is not without its terrors. Would to heaven it were come and gone! I feel no reluctance, my friends to be thus explicit. Time was, when the[s]e emotions would be hidden with immea[s]urable [s]olicitude, from every human eye. Alas! the[s]e airy and fleeting impulses of [s]hame are gone. My [s]cruples were prepo[s]terous and criminal. They are bred in all hearts, by a perver[s]e and vicious education, and they would [s]till have maintained their place in my heart, had not my portion been [s]et in mi[s]ery. My errors have taught me thus much wi[s]dom; that tho[s]e [s]entiments which we ought not to di[s]clo[s]e, it is criminal to harbour. It was propo[s]ed to begin the rehear[s]al at four o'clock; I counted the minutes as they pa[s][s]ed; their flight was at once too rapid and too [s]low; my [s]en[s]ations were of an excruciating kind; I could ta[s]te no food, nor apply to any talk, nor enjoy a moment's repo[s]e: when the hour arrived, I hastened to my brother's. Pleyel was not there. He had not yet come. On ordinary occa[s]ions, he was eminent for punctuality. He had te[s]tified great eagerne[s]s to [s]hare in the plea[s]ures of this rehear[s]al. He was to divide the ta[s]k with my brother, and, in ta[s]ks like the[s]e, he always engaged with peculiar zeal. His elocution was le[s]s [s]weet than [s]onorous; and, therefore, better adapted than the mellifluences of his friend, to the outrageous vehemence of this drama. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-105.jpg) \- external link  - Page 096. ] What could detain him? Perhaps he lingered through forgetfulne[s]s. Yet this was incredible. Never had his memory been known to fail upon even more trivial occa[s]ions. Not le[s]s impo[s][s]ible was it, that the [s]cheme had lo[s]t its attractions, and that he [s]taid, becau[s]e his coming would afford him no gratification. But why [s]hould we expect him to adhere to the minute? An half hour elap[s]ed, but Pleyel was [s]till at a di[s]tance. Perhaps he had mi[s]under[s]tood the hour which had been propo[s]ed. Perhaps he had conceived that to-morrow, and not to-day, had been [s]elected for this purpo[s]e: but no. A review of preceding circum[s]tances demon[s]trated that [s]uch misapprehension was impo[s][s]ible; for he had him[s]elf propo[s]ed this day, and this hour. This day, his attention would not otherwi[s]e be occupied; but to-morrow, an indi[s]pen[s]ible engagement was fore[s]een, by which all his time would be engro[s][s]ed: his detention, therefore, mu[s]t be owing to [s]ome unforeseen and extraordinary event. Our conjectures were vague, tumultuous, and [s]ometimes fearful. His [s]ickne[s]s and his death might po[s][s]ibly have detained him. Tortured with [s]u[s]pen[s]e, we [s]at gazing at each other, and at the path which led from the road. Every hor[s]eman that pa[s][s]ed was, for a moment, imagined to be him. Hour [s]ucceeded hour, and the [s]un, gradually declining, at length, di[s]appeared. Every [s]ignal of his coming proved [s]allacious, and our hopes were at length di[s]mi[s][s]ed. His ab[s]ence affected my friends in no in[s]upportable degree. They [s]hould be obliged, they [s]aid, to defer this undertaking till the morrow; and, perhaps, their impatient curio[s]ity would compel them to di[s]pen[s]e entirely with his pre[s]ence. No doubt, [s]ome harmle[s]s [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-106.jpg) \- external link  - Page 097. ] occurrence had diverted him from his purpo[s]e; and they tru[s]ted that they [s]hould receive a satisfactory account of him in the morning. It may be [s]uppo[s]ed that this di[s]appointment affected me in a very different manner. I turned a[s]ide my head to conceal my tears. I fled into [s]olitude, to give vent to my reproaches, without interruption or re[s]traint. My heart was ready to bur[s]t with indignation and grief. Pleyel was not the only object of my keen but unju[s]t upbraiding. Deeply did I execrate my own folly. Thus fallen into ruins was the gay fabric which I had reared! Thus had my golden vi[s]ion melted into air! How fondly did I dream that Pleyel was a lover! If he were, would he have [s]uffered any ob[s]tacle to hinder his coming? Blind and infatuated man! I exclaimed. Thou [s]porte[s]t with happine[s]s. The good that is offered thee, thou ha[s]t the in[s]olence and folly to refu[s]e. Well, I will henceforth intru[s]t my felicity to no one's keeping but my own. The fir[s]t agonies of this di[s]appointment would not allow me to be rea[s]onable or ju[s]t. Every ground on which I had built the per[s]ua[s]ion that Pleyel was not unimpre[s][s]ed in my favor, appeared to vani[s]h. It seemed as if I had been mi[s]led into this opinion, by the mo[s]t palpable illu[s]ions. I made [s]ome trifling excu[s]e, and returned, much earlier than I expected, to my own hou[s]e. I retired early to my chamber, without de[s]igning to [s]leep. I placed my[s]elf at a window, and gave the reins to reflection. The hateful and degrading impul[s]es which had lately controuled me were, in [s]ome degree, removed. New dejection [s]ucceeded, but was now produced by contemplating my late behaviour. Surely that pa[s][s]ion is worthy to be abhorred which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-107.jpg) \- external link  - Page 098. ] ob[s]cures our under[s]tanding, and urges us to the commi[s][s]ion of inju[s]tice. What right had I to expect his attendance? Had I not demeaned my[s]elf like one indifferent to his happine[s]s, and as having be[s]towed my regards upon another? His ab[s]ence might be prompted by the love which I con[s]idered his ab[s]ence as a proof that he wanted. He came not becau[s]e the [s]ight of me, the [s]pectacle of my coldne[s]s or aver[s]ion, contributed to his de[s]pair. Why [s]hould I prolong, by hyprocri[s]y or [s]ilence, his mi[s]ery as well as my own? Why not deal with him explicity, and a[s][s]ure him of the truth? You will hardly believe that, in obedience to this [s]ugge[s]tion, I ro[s]e for the purpo[s]e of ordering a light, that I might in[s]tantly make this confe[s][s]ion in a letter. A [s]econd thought [s]hewed me the rashness of this [s]cheme, and I wondered by what infirmity of mind I could be betrayed into a momentary approbation of it. I [s]aw with the utmo[s]t clearne[s]s that a confe[s][s]ion like that would be the mo[s]t remedile[s]s and unpardonable outrage upon the dignity of my [s]ex, and utterly unworthy of that pa[s][s]ion which controuled me. I re[s]umed my [s]eat and my mu[s]ing. To account for the ab[s]ence of Pleyel became once more the [s]cope of my conjectures. How many incidents might occur to rai[s]e an in[s]uperable impediment in his way? When I was a child, a [s]cheme of pleasure, in which he and his [s]i[s]ter were parties, had been, in like manner, fru[s]trated by his ab[s]ence; but his ab[s]ence, in that in[s]tance, had been occa[s]ioned by his falling from a boat into the river, in consequence of which he had run the mo[s]t imminent hazard of being drowned. Here was a [s]econd disappointment endured by the [s]ame per[s]ons, and produced by his failure. Might it not originate in the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-108.jpg) \- external link  - Page 099. ] [s]ame cau[s]e? Had he not de[s]igned to cro[s]s the river that morning to make [s]ome nece[s][s]ary purcha[s]es in Jer[s]ey? He had preconcerted to return to his own hou[s]e to dinner; but, perhaps, some di[s]a[s]ter had befallen him. Experience had taught me the insecurity of a canoe, and that was the only kind of boat which Pleyel u[s]ed: I was, likewi[s]e, actuated by an hereditary dread of water. The[s]e circumstances combined to be[s]tow con[s]iderable plau[s]ibility on this conjecture; but the con[s]ternation with which I began to be [s]eized was allayed by reflecting, that if this di[s]a[s]ter had happened my brother would have received the [s]peedie[s]t information of it. The con[s]olation which this idea imparted was ravished from me by a new thought. This di[s]a[s]ter might have happened, and his family not be apprized of it. The fir[s]t intelligence of his fate may be communicated by the livid corp[s]e which the tide may ca[s]t, many days hence, upon the [s]hore. Thus was I di[s]tre[s][s]ed by oppo[s]ite conjectures: thus was I tormented by phantoms of my own creation. It was not always thus. I can a[s]certain the date when my mind became the victim of this imbecility; perhaps it was coeval with the inroad of a fatal pa[s][s]ion; a pa[s][s]ion that will never rank me in the number of its eulogi[s]ts; it was alone [s]ufficient to the extermination of my peace: it was it[s]elf a plenteous [s]ource of calamity, and needed not the concurrence of other evils to take away the attractions of exi[s]tence, and dig for me an untimely grave. The [s]tate of my mind naturally introduced a train of reflections upon the dangers and cares which inevitably be[s]et an human being. By no violent tran[s]ition was I led to ponder on the turbulent life and my[s]terious end of my father. I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-109.jpg) \- external link  - Page 100. ] cheri[s]hed, with the utmo[s]t veneration, the memory of this man, and every relique connected with his fate was pre[s]erved with the mo[s]t [s]crupulous care. Among the[s]e was to be numbered a manu[s]cript, containing memoirs of his own life. The narrative was by no means recommended by its eloquence; but neither did all its value flow from my relationship to the author. Its [s]tile had an unaffected and picture[s]que [s]implicity. The great variety and circumstantial di[s]play of the incidents, together with their intrin[s]ic importance, as de[s]criptive of human manners and pa[s][s]ions, made it the mo[s]t u[s]eful book in my collection. It was late; but being [s]en[s]ible of no inclination to [s]leep, I re[s]olved to betake myself to the perusal of it. To do this it was requi[s]ite to procure a light. The girl had long [s]ince retired to her chamber: it was therefore proper to wait upon my[s]elf. A lamp, and the means of lighting it, were only to be found in the kitchen. Thither I re[s]olved forthwith to repair; but the light was of u[s]e merely to enable me to read the book. I knew the [s]helf and the [s]pot where it [s]tood. Whether I took down the book, or prepared the lamp in the [s]ir[s]t place, appeared to be a matter of no moment. The latter was preferred, and, leaving my [s]eat, I approached the clo[s]et in which, as I mentioned formerly, my books and papers were depo[s]ited. Suddenly the remembrance of what had lately pa[s][s]ed in this clo[s]et occurred. Whether midnight was approaching, or had pa[s][s]ed, I knew not. I was, as then, alone, and defencele[s]s. The wind was in that direction in which, aided by the deathlike repo[s]e of nature, it brought to me the murmur of the water-fall. This was mingled with that [s]olemn and enchanting [s]ound, which a breeze produces [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-110.jpg) \- external link  - Page 101. ] among the leaves of pines. The words of that my[s]terious dialogue, their fearful import, and the wild exce[s]s to which I was tran[s]ported by my terrors, filled my imagination anew. My [s]teps faultered, and I [s]tood a moment to recover my[s]elf. I prevailed on my[s]elf at length to move towards the clo[s]et. I touched the lock, but my fingers were powerle[s]s; I was vi[s]ited afre[s]h by unconquerable apprehen[s]ions. A [s]ort of belief darted into my mind, that [s]ome being was concealed within, who[s]e purpo[s]es were evil. I began to contend with tho[s]e fears, when it occurred to me that I might, without impropriety, go for a lamp previou[s]ly to opening the clo[s]et. I receded a few [s]teps; but before I reached my chamber door my thoughts took a new direction. Motion [s]eemed to produce a mechanical influence upon me. I was a[s]hamed of my weakness. Be[s]ides, what aid could be afforded me by a lamp? My fears had pictured to them[s]elves no preci[s]e object. It would be difficult to depict, in words, the ingredients and hues of that phantom which haunted me. An hand invi[s]ible and of preternatural [s]trength, lifted by human pa[s][s]ions, and selecting my life for its aim, were parts of this terrific image. All places were alike acce[s][s]ible to this foe, or if his empire were re[s]tricted by local bounds, tho[s]e bounds were utterly in[s]crutable by me. But had I not been told by [s]ome one in league with this enemy, that every place but the rece[s]s in the bank was exempt from danger? I returned to the clo[s]et, and once more put my hand upon the lock. O! may my ears lo[s]e their [s]en[s]ibility, ere they be again affailed by a [s]hriek [s]o terrible! Not merely my under[s]tanding was subdued by the [s]ound: it acted on my nerves like an [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-111.jpg) \- external link  - Page 102. ] edge of [s]teel. It appeared to cut a[s]under the fibres of my brain, and rack every joint with agony. The cry, loud and piercing as it was, was nevertheless human. No articulation was ever more di[s]tinct. The breath which accompanied it did note fan my hair, yet did every circum[s]tance combine to per[s]uade me that the lips which uttered it touched my very [s]houlder. "Hold! Hold!" were the words of this tremendous prohibition, in who[s]e tone the whole [s]oul [s]eemed to be rapt up, and every energy converted into eagerne[s]s and terror. Shuddering, I da[s]hed my[s]elf again[s]t the wall, and by the [s]ame involuntary impul[s]e, turned my face backward to examine the my[s]terious monitor. The moon-light [s]treamed into each window, and every corner of the room was con[s]picuous, and yet I beheld nothing! The interval was too brief to be artificially measured, between the utterance of the[s]e words, and my [s]crutiny directed to the quarter whence they came. Yet if a human being had been there, could he fail to have been vi[s]ible? Which of my [s]en[s]es was the prey of a fatal illu[s]ion? The [s]hock which the [s]ound produced was [s]till felt in every part of my frame. The [s]ound, therefore, could not but be a genuine commotion. But that I had heard it, was not more true than that the being who uttered it was [s]tationed at my right ear; yet my attendant was invi[s]ible. I cannot de[s]cribe the [s]tate of my thoughts at that moment. Surprize had ma[s]tered my faculties. My frame [s]hook, and the vital current was congealed. I was con[s]cious only to the vehemence of my sensations. This condition could not be la[s]ting. Like a tide, which [s]uddenly mounts to an overwhelming [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-112.jpg) \- external link  - Page 103. ] height, and then gradually [s]ub[s]ides, my confu[s]ion [s]lowly gave place to order, and my tumults to a calm. I was able to deliberate and move. I resumed my feet, and advanced into the mid[s]t of the room. Upward, and behind, and on each [s]ide, I threw penetrating glances. I was not [s]atisfied with one examination. He that hitherto refu[s]ed to be [s]een, might change his purpo[s]e, and on the next [s]urvey be clearly di[s]tingui[s]hable. Solitude impo[s]es lea[s]t re[s]traint upon the fancy. Dark is le[s]s fertile of images than the feeble lu[s]tre of the moon. I was alone, and the walls were chequered by [s]hadowy forms. As the moon pa[s][s]ed behind a cloud and emerged, the[s]e [s]hadows [s]eemed to be endowed with life, and to move. The apartment was open to the breeze, and the curtain was occa[s]ionally blown from its ordinary po[s]ition. This motion was not unaccompanied with [s]ound. I failed not to [s]natch a look, and to li[s]ten when this motion and this [s]ound occurred. My belief that my monitor was po[s]ted near, was [s]trong, and instantly converted the[s]e appearances to tokens of his pre[s]ence, and yet I could di[s]cern nothing. When my thoughts were at length permitted to revert to the pa[s]t, the fir[s]t idea that occurred was the re[s]emblance between the words of the voice which I had ju[s]t heard, and tho[s]e which had terminated my dream in the [s]ummer-hou[s]e. There are means by which we are able to di[s]tingui[s]h a substance from a [s]hadow, a reality from the phantom of a dream. The pit, my brother beckoning me forward, the [s]eizure of my arm, and the voice behind, were [s]urely imaginary. That the[s]e incidents were fa[s]hioned in my [s]leep, is [s]upported by the fame indubitable evidence that compels me to believe my[s]elf awake at pre[s]ent; yet the words and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-113.jpg) \- external link  - Page 104. ] the voice were the [s]ame. Then, by [s]ome inexplicable contrivance, I was aware of the danger, while my actions and [s]en[s]ations were tho[s]e of one wholly unacquainted with it. Now, was it not equally true that my actions and per[s]ua[s]ions were at war? Had not the belief, that evil lurked in the clo[s]et, gained admittance, and had not my actions betokened an unwarrantable [s]ecurity? To obviate the effects of my infatuation, the [s]ame means had been u[s]ed. In my dream, he that tempted me to my destruction, was my brother. Death was ambu[s]hed in my path. From what evil was I now re[s]cued? What mini[s]ter or implement of ill was [s]hut up in this rece[s]s? Who was it who[s]e [s]uffocating gra[s]p I was to feel, [s]hould I dare to enter it? What monstrous conception is this? my brother! No; protection, and not injury is his province. Strange and terrible chimera! Yet it would not be [s]uddenly di[s]mi[s][s]ed. It was [s]urely no vulgar agency that gave this form to my fears. He to whom all parts of time are equally pre[s]ent, whom no contingency, approaches, was the author of that [s]pell which now [s]eized upon me. Life was dear to me. No con[s]ideration was pre[s]ent that enjoined me to relinqui[s]h it. Sacred duty combined with every [s]pontaneous [s]entiment to endear to me my being. Should I not [s]hudder when my being was endangered? But what emotion [s]hould po[s][s]e[s]e me when the arm lifted again[s]t me was Wieland's? Ideas exi[s]t in our minds that can be accounted for by no e[s]tabli[s]hed laws. Why did I dream that my brother was my foe? Why but becau[s]e an omen of my [s]ate was ordained to be communicated? Yet what [s]alutary end did it [s]erve? Did it arm me with caution to elude, or fortitude to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-114.jpg) \- external link  - Page 105. ] bear the evils to which I was re[s]erved? My present thoughts were, no doubt, indebted for their hue to the [s]imilitude exi[s]ting between the[s]e incidents and tho[s]e of my dream. Surely it was phrenzy that dictated my deed. That a ruffian was hidden in the clo[s]et, was an idea, the genuine tendency of which was to urge me to [s]light. Such had been the effect formerly produced. Had my mind been [s]imply occupied with this thought at pre[s]ent, no doubt, the [s]ame impul[s]e would have been experienced; but now it was my brother whom I was irre[s]i[s]tably per[s]uaded to regard as the contriver of that ill of which I had been forewarned. This per[s]ua[s]ion did not extenuate my fears or my danger. Why then did I again approach the clo[s]et and withdraw the bolt? My re[s]olution was in[s]tantly conceived, and executed without faultering. The door was formed of light materials. The lock, of [s]imple [s]tructure, ea[s]ily forewent its hold. It opened into the room, and commonly moved upon its hinges, after being unfa[s]tened, without any effort of mine. This effort, however, was bestowed upon the pre[s]ent occa[s]ion. It was my purpo[s]e to open it with quickne[s]s, but the exertion which I made was ineffectual. It refu[s]ed to open. At another time, this circum[s]tance would not have looked with a face of my[s]tery. I [s]hould have [s]uppo[s]ed [s]ome ca[s]ual ob[s]truction, and repeated my efforts to [s]urmount it. But now my mind was acce[s][s]ible to no conjecture but one. The door was hindered from opening by human force. Surely, here was new cau[s]e for affright. This was confirmation proper to decide my conduct. Now was all ground of he[s]itation taken away. What could be [s]uppo[s]ed but that I de[s]erted the chamber [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-115.jpg) \- external link  - Page 106. ] and the hou[s]e? that I at lea[s]t endeavoured no longer to withdraw the door? Have I not [s]aid that my actions were dictated by phrenzy? My rea[s]on had forborne, for a time, to [s]ugge[s]t or to [s]way my re[s]olves. I reiterated my endeavours. I exerted all my force to overcome the ob[s]tacle, but in vain. The [s]trength that was exerted to keep it [s]hut, was [s]uperior to mine. A ca[s]ual ob[s]erver might, perhaps, applaud the audaciou[s]ne[s]s of this conduct. Whence, but from an habitual defiance of danger, could my perseverance ari[s]e? I have already a[s][s]igned, as di[s]tinctly as I am able, the cau[s]e of it. The frantic conception that my brother was within, that the resistance made to my de[s]ign was exerted by him, had rooted it[s]elf in my mind. You will comprehend the height of this infatuation, when I tell you, that, finding all my exertions vain, I betook my[s]elf to exclamations. Surely I was utterly bere[s]t of understanding. Now had I arrived at the cri[s]is of my fate. "O! hinder not the door to open," I exclaimed, in a tone that had le[s]s of fear than of grief in it. "I know you well. Come forth, but harm me not. I beseech you come forth." I had taken my hand from the lock, and removed to a [s]mall di[s]tance from the door. I had [s]carcely uttered the[s]e words, when the door [s]wung upon its hinges, and di[s]played to my view the interior of the clo[s]et. Whoever was within, was [s]hrouded in darkne[s]s. A few [s]econds pa[s][s]ed without interruption of the [s]ilence. I knew not what to expect or to fear. My eyes would not [s]tray from the rece[s]s. Pre[s]ently, a deep [s]igh was heard. The quarter from which it came heightened the eagerness of my gaze. Some one approached from the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-116.jpg) \- external link  - Page 107. ] farther end. I quickly perceived the outlines of a human figure. Its [s]teps were irre[s]olute and [s]low. I recoiled as it advanced. By coming at length within the verge of the room, his form was clearly di[s]tingui[s]hable. I had prefigured to my[s]elf a very different per[s]onage. The face that pre[s]ented it[s]elf was the la[s]t that I [s]hould de[s]ire to meet at an hour, and in a place like this. My wonder was [s]tifled by my fears. Assassins had lurked in this rece[s]s. Some divine voice warned me of danger, that at this moment awaited me. I had [s]purned the intimation, and challenged my adver[s]ary. I recalled the my[s]terious countenance and dubious character of Carwin. What motive but atrocious ones could guide his [s]teps hither? I was alone. My habit [s]uited the hour, and the place, and the warmth of the [s]ea[s]on. All [s]uccour was remote. He had placed him[s]elf between me and the door. My frame [s]hook with the vehemence of my apprehen[s]ions. Yet I was not wholly lo[s]t to my[s]elf: I vigilantly marked his demeanour. His looks were grave, but not without perturbation. What [s]pecies of inquietude it betrayed, the light was not [s]trong enough to enable me to di[s]cover. He [s]tood [s]till; but his eyes wandered from one object to another. When the[s]e powerful organs were fixed upon me, I [s]hrunk into my[s]elf. At length, he broke [s]ilence. Earne[s]tne[s]s, and not embarra[s][s]ment, was in his tone. He advanced clo[s]e to me while he [s]poke. "What voice was that which lately addre[s][s]ed you?" He pau[s]ed for an an[s]wer; but ob[s]erving my trepidation, he re[s]umed, with undimini[s]hed [s]olemnity: "Be not terrified. Whoever he was, he ha[s]t done [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-117.jpg) \- external link  - Page 108. ] you an important [s]ervice. I need not a[s]k you it it were the voice of a companion. That [s]ound was beyond the compa[s]s of human organs. The knowledge that enabled him to tell you who was in the clo[s]et, was obtained by incomprehen[s]ible means. "You knew that Carwin was there. Were you not apprized of his intents? The [s]ame power could impart the one as well as the other. Yet, knowing the[s]e, you per[s]i[s]ted. Audacious girl! but, perhaps, you confided in his guardian[s]hip. Your confidence was ju[s]t. With [s]uccour like this at hand you may [s]afely de[s]y me. "He is my eternal foe; the baffler of my be[s]t concerted [s]chemes. Twice have you been [s]aved by his accur[s]ed interpo[s]ition. But for him I [s]hould long ere now have borne away the [s]poils of your honor." He looked at me with greater [s]tedfa[s]tne[s]s than before. I became every moment more anxious for my [s]afety. It was with difficulty I [s]tammered out an entreaty that he would in[s]tantly depart, or [s]uffer me to do [s]o. He paid no regard to my reque[s]t, but proceeded in a more impa[s][s]ioned manner. "What is it you fear? Have I not told you, you are [s]afe? Has not one in whom you more reasonably place tru[s]t a[s][s]ered you of it? Even if I execute my purpo[s]e, what injury is done? Your prejudices will call it by that name, but it merits it not. "I was impelled by a [s]entiment that does you honor; a [s]entiment, that would [s]anctify my deed; but, whatever it be, you are [s]afe. Be this chimera [s]till wor[s]hipped; I will do nothing to pollute it." There he [s]topped. The accents and ge[s]tures of this man left me drained of all courage. Surely, on no other [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-118.jpg) \- external link  - Page 109. ] occasion [s]hould I have been thus pu[s]illanimous. My [s]tate I regarded as a hopele[s]s one. I was wholly at the mercy of this being. Whichever way I turned my eyes, I [s]aw no avenue by which I might e[s]cape. The re[s]ources of my per[s]onal [s]trength, my ingenuity, and my eloquence, I e[s]timated at nothing. The dignity of virtue, and the force of truth, I had been accu[s]tomed to celebrate; and had frequently vaunted of the conque[s]ts which I [s]hould make with their a[s][s]i[s]tance. I u[s]ed to [s]uppo[s]e that certain evils could never be[s]all a being in po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of a [s]ound mind; that true virtue [s]upplies us with energy whcih vice can never re[s]i[s]t; that it was always in our power to ob[s]truct, by his own death, the de[s]igns of an enemy who aimed at le[s]s than our life. How was it that a [s]entiment like de[s]pair had now invaded me, and that I tru[s]ted to the protection of chance, or to the pity of my per[s]ecutor? His words imparted [s]ome notion of the injury which he had meditated. He talked of ob[s]tacles that had ri[s]en in his way. He had relinqui[s]hed his de[s]ign. The[s]e [s]ources [s]upplied me with [s]lender con[s]olation. There was no [s]ecurity but in his absence. When I looked at my[s]elf, when I reflected on the hour and the place, I was overpowered by horror and dejection. He was [s]ilent, mu[s]eful, and inattentive to my [s]ituation, yet made no motion to depart. I was [s]ilent in my turn. What could I [s]ay? I was confident that rea[s]on in this cont[s]t would be impotent. I mu[s]t owe my [s]afety to his own [s]ugge[s]tions. Whatever purpo[s]e brought him hither, he had changed it. Why then did he remain? His resolutions might fluctuate, and the pau[s]e of a few minutes re[s]tore to him his fir[s]t re[s]olutions. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-119.jpg) \- external link  - Page 110. ] Yet was not this the man whom we had treated with unwearied kindne[s]s? Who[s]e [s]ociety was endeared to us by his intellectual elevation and accomplishments? Who had a thou[s]and times expatiated on the u[s]efulne[s]s and beauty of virtue? Why [s]hould [s]uch a one be dreaded? If I could have forgotten the circum[s]tances in which our interview had taken place, I might have treated his words as je[s]ts. Pre[s]ently, he re[s]umed: "Fear me not: the [s]pace that [s]evers us is [s]mall, and all vi[s]ible [s]uccour is di[s]tant. You believe yourself completely in my power; that you [s]tand upon the brink of ruin. Such are your groundle[s]s fears. I cannot lift a finger to hurt you. Ea[s]ier it would be to [s]top the moon in her cour[s]e than to injure you. The power that protects you would crumble my [s]inews, and reduce me to a heap of a[s]hes in a moment, if I were to harbour a thought hostile to your [s]afety. "Thus are appearances at length [s]olved. Little did I expect that they originated hence. What a portion is a[s][s]igned to you? Scanned by the eyes of this intelligence, your path will be without pits to [s]wallow, or [s]nares to entangle you. Environed by the arms of this protection, all artifices will be fru[s]trated, and all malice repelled." Here [s]ucceeded a new pau[s]e. I was [s]till observant of every ge[s]ture and look. The tranquil solemnity that had lately po[s][s]e[s][s]ed his countenance gave way to a new expre[s][s]ion. All now was trepidation and anxiety. "I mu[s]t be gone," [s]aid he in a faltering accent. "Why do I linger here? I will not a[s]k your forgiveness. I [s]ee that your terrors are invincible. Your pardon will be extorted by fear, and not dictated by compa[s][s]ion. I mu[s]t fly from you forever [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-120.jpg) \- external link  - Page 111. ] He that could plot again[s]t your honor, mu[s]t expect from you and your friends per[s]ecution and death. I mu[s]t doom my[s]elf to endle[s]s exile." Saying this, he ha[s]tily left the room. I li[s]tened while he de[s]cended the [s]tairs, and, unbolting the outer door, went forth. I did not follow him with my eyes, as the moon-light would have enabled me to do. Relieved by his ab[s]ence, and exhau[s]ted by the conflict of my fears, I threw my[s]elf on a chair, and re[s]igned my[s]elf to tho[s]e bewildering ideas which incidents like the[s]e could not fail to produce. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-121.jpg) \- external link  - Page 112. ] Order could not readily be introduced into my thoughts. The voice [s]till rung in my ears. Every accent that was uttered by Carwin was fre[s]h in my remembrance. His unwelcome approach, the recognition of his per[s]on, his ha[s]ty departure, pro[s] duced a complex impre[s][s]ion on my mind which no words can delineate. I [s]trove to give a [s]lower motion to my thoughts, and to regulate a confu[s]ion which became painful; but my efforts were nugatory. I covered my eyes with my hand, and [s]at, I know not how long, without power to arrange or utter my conceptions. I had remained for hours, as I believed, in absolute [s]olitude. No thought of per[s]onal danger had mole[s]ted my tranquillity. I had made no preparation for defence. What was it that [s]ugge[s]ted the de[s]ign of peru[s]ing my father's manu[s]cript? If, in[s]tead of this, I had retired to bed, and to [s]leep, to what fate might I not have been re[s]erved? The ruffian, who mu[s]t almo[s]t have [s]uppre[s][s]ed his breathings to [s]creen him[s]elf from di[s]covery, would have noticed this [s]ignal, and I [s]hould have awakened only to peri[s]h with affright, and to abhor my[s]elf. Could I have remained uncon[s]cious of my danger? Could I have tranquilly [s]lept in the mid[s]t of [s]o deadly a [s]nare? And who was he that threatened to de[s]troy me? By what means could he hide him[s]elf in this clo[s]et? Surely he is gifted with [s]upernatural power. Such is the enemy of who[s]e attempts I was forewarned. Daily I had [s]een him and conver[s]ed with him. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-122.jpg) \- external link  - Page 113. ] Nothing could be di[s]cerned through the impenetrable veil of his duplicity. When bu[s]ied in conjectures, as to the author of the evil that was threatened, my mind did not light, for a moment, upon his image. Yet has he not avowed him[s]elf my enemy? Why [s]hould he be here if he had not meditated evil? He confe[s][s]es that this has been his [s]econd attempt. What was the [s]cene of his former conspiracy? Was it not he who[s]e whi[s]pers betrayed him? Am I deceived; or was there not a faint resemblance between the voice of this man and that which talked of gra[s]ping my throat, and extinguishing my life in a moment? Then he had a colleague in his crime; now he is alone. Then death was the [s]cope of his thoughts; now an injury unspeakably more dreadful. How thankful [s]hould I be to the power that has interpo[s]ed to [s]ave me! That power is invi[s]ible. It is [s]ubject to the cognizance of one of my [s]en[s]es. What are the means that will inform me of what nature it is? He has [s]et him[s]elf to counterwork the machinations of this man, who had menaced de[s]truction to all that is dear to me, and who[s]e cunning had [s]urmounted every human impediment. There was none to re[s]cue me from his gra[s]p. My ra[s]hne[s]s even hastened the completion of his [s]cheme, and precluded him from the benefits of deliberation. I had robbed him of the power to repent and forbear. Had I been apprized of the danger, I [s]hould have regarded my conduct as the means of rendering my e[s]cape from it impo[s][s]ible. Such, likewi[s]e, [s]eem to have been the fears of my invi[s]ible protector. El[s]e why that [s]tartling intreaty to refrain from opening the clo[s]et? By what inexplicable in[s]atuation was I compelled to proceed? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-123.jpg) \- external link  - Page 114. ] Yet my conduct was wi[s]e. Carwin, unable to comprehend my folly, a[s]cribed my behaviour to my knowledge. He conceived him[s]elf previou[s]ly detected, and [s]uch detection being po[s][s]ible to flow only from my heavenly friend, and his enemy, his fears acquired additional [s]trength. He is apprized of the nature and intentions of this being. Perhaps he is a human agent. Yet, on that [s]uppo[s]ition his atchievements are incredible. Why [s]hould I be [s]elected as the object of his care; or, if a mere mortal, [s]hould I not recognize [s]ome one, whom, benefits imparted and received had prompted to love me? What were the limits and duration of his guardian[s]hip? Was the genius of my birth entru[s]ted by divine benignity with this province? Are human faculties adequate to receive [s]tronger proofs of the exi[s]tence of un[s]ettered and beneficent intelligences than I have received? But who was this man's coadjutor? The voice that acknowledged an alliance in treachery with Carwin warned me to avoid the [s]ummer-hou[s]e. He a[s][s]ured me that there only my [s]afety was endangered. His a[s][s]urance, as it now appears, was sallacious. Was there not deceit in his admonition? Was his compact really annulled? Some purpo[s]e was, perhaps, to be accompli[s]hed by preventing my future vi[s]its to that [s]pot. Why was I enjoined [s]ilence to others, on the [s]ubject of this admonition, unle[s]s it were for [s]ome unauthorized and guilty purpo[s]e? No one but my[s]elf was accu[s]tomed to vi[s]it it. Backward, it was hidden from di[s]tant view by the rock, and in front, it was [s]creened from all examination, by creeping plants, and the branches of cedars. What rece[s]s could be more propitious to [s]ecrecy? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-124.jpg) \- external link  - Page 115. ] The [s]pirit which haunted it formerly was pure and rapturous. It was a [s]ane [s]acred to the memory of infantile days, and to bli[s]sful imaginations of the future! What a gloomy rever[s]e had [s]ucceeded [s]ince the ominous arrival of this [s]tranger! Now, perhaps, it is the [s]cene of his meditations. Purposes fraught with horror, that [s]hun the light, and contemplate the pollution of innocence, are here engendered, and fo[s]tered, and reared to maturity. Such were the ideas that, during the night, were tumultuou[s]ly revolved by me. I reviewed every conver[s]ation in which Carwin had borne a part. I [s]tudied to di[s]cover the true inferences deducible from his deportment and words with regard to his former adventures and actual views. I pondered on the comments which he made on the relation which I had given of the clo[s]et dialogue. No new ideas [s]ugge[s]ted them[s]elves in the cour[s]e of this review. My expectation had, from the fir[s]t, been di[s]appointed on the [s]mall degree of [s]urprize which this narrative excited in him. He never explicitly declared his opinion as to the nature of tho[s]e voices, or decided whether they were real or vi[s]ionary. He recommended no mea[s]ures of caution or prevention. But what mea[s]ures were now to be taken? Was the danger which threatened me at an end? Had I nothing more to fear? I was lonely, and without means of defence. I could not calculate the motives and regulate the foot[s]teps of this per[s]on. What certainty was there, that he would not re-a[s][s]ume his purpo[s]es, and [s]wiftly return to the execution of them? This idea covered me once more with di[s]may. How deeply did I regret the [s]olitude in which I was placed, and how ardently did I de[s]ire the return of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-125.jpg) \- external link  - Page 116. ] day! But neither of the[s]e inconveniencies were [s]u[s]ceptible of remedy. At fir[s]t, it occurred to me to [s]ummon my [s]ervant, and make her [s]pend the night in my chamber; but the inefficacy of this expedient to enhance my [s]afety was ea[s]ily [s]een. Once I re[s]olved to leave the hou[s]e, and retire to my brother's, but was deterred by reflecting on the unseasonableness of the hour, on the alarm which my arrival, and the account which I [s]hould be obliged to give, might occa[s]ion, and on the danger to which I might expo[s]e my[s]elf in the way thither. I began, likewi[s]e, to con[s]ider Carwin's return to mole[s]t me as exceedingly improbable. He had relinqui[s]hed, of his own accord, his de[s]ign, and departed without compul[s]ion. "Surely," [s]aid I, "there is omnipotence in the cau[s]e that changed the views of a man like Carwin. The divinity that [s]hielded me from his attempts will take [s]uitable care of my future [s]afety. Thus to yield to my fears is to de[s]erve that they [s]hould be real." Scarcely had I uttered the[s]e words, when my attention was [s]tartled by the [s]ound of foot[s]teps. They denoted [s]ome one [s]tepping into the piazza in front of my hou[s]e. My new-born confidence was extingui[s]hed in a moment. Carwin, I thought, had repented his departure, and was ha[s]tily returning. The po[s][s]ibility that his return was prompted by intentions con[s]i[s]tent with my [s]afety, found no place in my mind. Images of violation and murder a[s][s]ailed me anew, and the terrors which succeeded almo[s]t incapacitated me from taking any mea[s]ures for my defence. It was an impul[s]e of which I was [s]carcely con[s]cious, that made me fa[s]ten the lock and draw the bolts of my chamber door. Having done this, I threw my[s]elf on a [s]eat; for I trembled to a degree which di[s]abled me from [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-126.jpg) \- external link  - Page 117. ] standing, and my [s]oul was [s]o perfectly ab[s]orbed in the act of li[s]tening, that almo[s]t the vital motions were [s]topped. The door below creaked on its hinges. It was not again thru[s]t to, but appeared to remain open. Foot[s]teps entered, traver[s]ed the entry, and began to mount the [s]tairs. How I dete[s]ted the folly of not pur[s]uing the man when he withdrew, and bolting after him the outer door! Might he not conceive this omi[s][s]ion to be a proof that my angel had de[s]erted me, and be thereby fortified in guilt? Every [s]tep on the [s]tairs, which brought him nearer to my chamber, added vigor to my desperation. The evil with which I was menaced was to be at any rate eluded. How little did I preconceive the conduct which, in an exigence like this, I [s]hould be prone to adopt. You will [s]uppo[s]e that deliberation and de[s]pair would have [s]ugge[s]ted the [s]ame cour[s]e of action, and that I [s]hould have, unhesitatingly, re[s]orted to the be[s]t means of per[s]onal defence within my power. A penknife lay open upon my table. I remembered that it was there, and [s]eized it. For what purpo[s]e you will [s]carcely inquire. It will be immediately [s]uppo[s]ed that I meant it for my la[s]t refuge, and that if all other means [s]hould fail, I [s]hould plunge it into the heart of my ravi[s]her. I have lo[s]t all faith in the [s]tedfa[s]tne[s]s of human re[s]olves. It was thus that in periods of calm I had determined to act. No cowardice had been held by me in greater abhorrence than that which prompted an injured female to de[s]troy, not her injurer ere the injury was perpetrated, but her[s]elf when it was without remedy. Yet now this penknife appeared to me of no other u[s]e than to baffle my a[s][s]ailant, and prevent the crime by de[s]troying my[s]elf. To [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-127.jpg) \- external link  - Page 118. ] deliberate at [s]uch a time was impo[s][s]ible; but among the tumultuous [s]ugge[s]tions of the moment, I do not recollect that it once occurred to me to u[s]e it as an in[s]trument of direct defence. The [s]teps had now reached the [s]econd floor. Every footfall accelerated the completion, without augmenting, the certainty of evil. The consciousness that the door was fa[s]t, now that nothing but that was interpo[s]ed between me and danger, was a [s]ource of [s]ome con[s]olation. I ca[s]t my eye towards the window. This, likewi[s]e, was a new suggestion. If the door [s]hould give way, it was my [s]udden re[s]olution to throw my[s]elf from the window. Its height from the ground, which was covered beneath by a brick pavement, would in[s]ure my de[s]truction; but I thought not of that. When oppo[s]ite to my door the foot[s]teps cea[s]ed. Was he li[s]tening whether my fears were allayed, and my caution were a[s]leep? Did he hope to take me by [s]urprize? Yet, if [s]o, why did he allow [s]o many noi[s]y [s]ignals to betray his approach? Presently the [s]teps were again heard to approach the door. An hand was laid upon the lock, and the latch pulled back. Did he imagine it po[s][s]ible that I [s]hould fail to [s]ecure the door? A [s]light effort was made to pu[s]h it open, as if all bolts being withdrawn, a [s]light effort only was required. I no [s]ooner perceived this, than I moved [s]wiftly towards the window. Carwin's frame might be [s]aid to be all mu[s]cle. His [s]trength and activity had appeared, in various in[s]tances, to be prodigious. A [s]light exertion of his force would demoli[s]h the door. Would not that exertion be made? Too [s]urely it would; but, at the [s]ame moment that this ob[s]tacle [s]hould yield, and he [s]hould enter the apartment, my determination was formed to leap from [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-128.jpg) \- external link  - Page 119. ] the window. My [s]en[s]es were [s]till bound to this object. I gazed at the door in momentary expectation that the a[s][s]ault would be made. The pau[s]e continued. The per[s]on without was irre[s]olute and motionle[s]s. Suddenly, it occurred to me that Carwin might conceive me to have fled. That I had not betaken my[s]elf to flight was, indeed, the lea[s]t probable of all conclu[s]ions. In this per[s]ua[s]ion he mu[s]t have been confirmed on finding the lower door unfa[s]tened, and the chamber door locked. Was it not wi[s]e to fo[s]ter this per[s]ua[s]ion? Should I maintain deep [s]ilence, this, in addition to other circum[s]tances, might encourage the belief, and he would once more depart. Every new reflection added plausibility to this rea[s]oning. It was pre[s]ently more [s]trongly enforced, when I noticed foot[s]teps withdrawing from the door. The blood once more flowed back to my heart, and a dawn of exultation began to ri[s]e: but my joy was [s]hort lived. Instead of de[s]cending the [s]tairs, he pa[s][s]ed to the door of the oppo[s]ite chamber, opened it, and having entered, [s]hut it after him with a violence that [s]hook the hou[s]e. How was I to interpret this circum[s]tance? For what end could he have entered this chamber? Did the violence with which he clo[s]ed the door te[s]tify the depth of his vexation? This room was u[s]ually occupied by Pleyel. Was Carwin aware of his ab[s]ence on this night? Could he be [s]u[s]pected of a de[s]ign [s]o [s]ordid as pillage? If this were his view there were no means in my power to fru[s]trate it. It behoved me to [s]eize the fir[s]t opportunity to e[s]cape; but if my e[s]cape were [s]uppo[s]ed by my enemy to have been already effected, no a[s]ylum was more [s]ecure than the pre[s]ent. How could my pa[s][s]age [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-129.jpg) \- external link  - Page 120. ] from the hou[s]e be accompli[s]hed without noi[s]es that might incite him to pur[s]ue me? Utterly at a lo[s]s to account for his going into Pleyel's chamber, I waited in in[s]tant expectation of hearing him come forth. All, however, was profoundly [s]till. I li[s]tened in vain for a con[s]iderable period, to catch the [s]ound of the door when it [s]hould again be opened. There was no other avenue by which he could e[s]cape, but a door which led into the girl's chamber. Would any evil from this quarter befall the girl? Hence aro[s]e a new train of apprehen[s]ions. They merely added to the turbulence and agony of my reflections. Whatever evil impended over her, I had no power to avert it. Seclu[s]ion and [s]ilence were the only means of [s]aving my[s]elf from the perils of this fatal night. What [s]olemn vows did I put up, that if I [s]hould once more behold the light of day, I would never tru[s]t my[s]elf again within the thre[s]hold of this dwelling! Minute lingered after minute, but no token was given that Carwin had returned to the pa[s][s]age. What, I again a[s]ked, could detain him in this room? Was it po[s][s]ible that he had returned, and glided, unperceived, away? I was [s]peedily aware of the difficulty that attended an enterprize like this; and yet, as if by that means I were capable of gaining any information on that head, I ca[s]t anxious looks from the window. The object that fir[s]t attracted my attention was an human figure [s]tanding on the edge of the bank. Perhaps my penetration was a[s][s]i[s]ted by my hopes. Be that as it will, the figure of Carwin was clearly di[s]tingui[s]hable. From the ob[s]curity of my [s]tation, it was impo[s][s]ible that I [s]hould be di[s]cerned by him, and yet he [s]carcely [s]uffered me to catch a glimp[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-130.jpg) \- external link  - Page 121. ] of him. He turned and went down the [s]teep, which, in this part, was not difficult to be [s]caled. My conjecture then had been right. Carwin has [s]oftly opened the door, de[s]cended the [s]tairs, and i[s][s]ued forth. That I [s]hould not have overheard his [s]teps, was only le[s]s incredible than that my eyes had deceived me. But what was now to be done? The hou[s]e was at length delivered from this dete[s]ted inmate. By one avenue might he again re-enter. Was it not wife to bar the lower door? Perhaps he had gone out by the kitchen door. For this end, he mu[s]t have pa[s][s]ed through Judith's chamber. The[s]e entrances being clo[s]ed and bolted, as great [s]ecurity was gained as was compatible with my lonely condition. The propriety of the[s]e mea[s]ures was too manifest not to make me [s]truggle [s]ucce[s]sfully with my fears. Yet I opened my own door with the utmo[s]t caution, and de[s]cended as if I were affraid that Carwin had been [s]till immured in Pleyel's chamber. The outer door was a-jar. I [s]hut, with trembling eagerne[s]s, and drew every bolt that appended to it. I then pa[s][s]ed with light and le[s]s cautious [s]teps through the parlour, but was [s]urprized to di[s]cover that the kitchen door was [s]ecure. I was compelled to acquie[s]ce in the fir[s]t conjecture that Carwin had e[s]caped through the entry. My heart was now [s]omewhat ea[s]ed of the load of apprehen[s]ion. I returned once more to my chamber, the door of which I was careful to lock. It was no time to think of repo[s]e. The moon-light began already to fade before the light of the day. The approach of morning was betokened by the u[s]ual [s]ignals. I mu[s]ed upon the events of this night, and determined to take up my abode henceforth at my brother's. Whether I [s]hould [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-131.jpg) \- external link  - Page 122. ] inform him of what had happened was a que[s]tion which [s]eemed to demand [s]ome con[s]ideration. My [s]afety unque[s]tionably required that I [s]hould abandon my pre[s]ent habitation. As my thoughts began to flow with fewer impediments, the image of Pleyel, and the dubiousness of his condition, again recurred to me. I again ran over the po[s][s]ible cau[s]es of his ab[s]ence on the preceding day. My mind was attuned to melancholy. I dwelt, with an ob[s]tinacy for which I could not account, on the idea of his death. I painted to my[s]elf his [s]truggles with the billows, and his la[s]t appearance. I imagined my[s]elf a midnight wanderer on the [s]hore, and to have [s]tumbled on his corp[s]e, which the tide had ca[s]t up. The[s]e dreary images affected me even to tears. I endeavoured not to re[s]train them. They imparted a relief which I had not anticipated. The more copiously they flowed, the more did my general sensations appear to [s]ub[s]ide into calm, and a certain re[s]tle[s][s]ne[s]s give way to repo[s]e. Perhaps, relieved by this effu[s]ion, the [s]lumber [s]o much wanted might have [s]tolen on my [s]en[s]es, had there been no new cau[s]e of alarm. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-132.jpg) \- external link  - Page 123. ] I was arou[s]ed from this [s]tupor by [s]ounds that evidently aro[s]e in the next chamber. Was it possible that I had been mi[s]taken in the figure which I had [s]een on the bank? or had Carwin, by [s]ome in[s]crutable means, penetrated once more into this chamber? The oppo[s]ite door opened; foot[s]teps came forth, and the per[s]on, advancing to mine, knocked. So unexpected an incident robbed me of all presence of mind, and, [s]tarting up, I involuntarily exclaimed, "Who is there?" An an[s]wer was immediately given. The voice, to my inexpre[s][s]ible a[s]toni[s]hment, was Pleyel's. "It is I. Have you ri[s]en? If you have not, make ha[s]te; I want three minutes conver[s]ation with you in the parlour---I will wait for you there." Saying this he retired from the door. Should I confide in the te[s]timony of my ears? If that were true, it was Pleyel that had been hitherto immured in the oppo[s]ite chamber: he whom my rueful fancy had depicted in [s]o many ruinous and gha[s]tly [s]hapes: he who[s]e foot[s]teps had been li[s]tened to with [s]uch inquietude! What is man, that knowledge is [s]o [s]paringly conferred upon him! that his heart [s]hould be wrung with di[s]tre[s]s, and his frame be exanimated with fear, though his [s]afety be encompa[s][s]ed with impregnable walls! What are the bounds of human imbecility! He that warned me of the pre[s]ence of my foe refu[s]ed the intimation by which [s]o many racking fears would have been precluded. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-133.jpg) \- external link  - Page 124. ] Yet who would have imagined the arrival of Pleyel at [s]uch an hour? His tone was de[s]ponding and anxious. Why this un[s]ea[s]onable [s]ummons? and why this ha[s]ty departure? Some tidings he, perhaps, bears of my[s]terious and unwelcome import. My impatience would not allow me to con[s]ume much time in deliberation: I ha[s]tened down. Pleyel I found [s]tanding at a window, with eyes ca[s]t down as in meditation, and arms folded on his brea[s]t. Every line in his countenance was pregnant with [s]orrow. To this was added a certain wanne[s]s and air of fatigue. The la[s]t time I had [s]een him appearances had been the rever[s]e of the[s]e. I was [s]tartled at the change. The fir[s]t impul[s]e was to que[s]tion him as to the cau[s]e. This impul[s]e was supplanted by [s]ome degree of confu[s]ion, flowing from a con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s that love had too large, and, as it might prove, a perceptible [s]hare in creating this impulse. I was [s]ilent. Pre[s]ently he rai[s]ed his eyes and fixed them upon me. I read in them an angui[s]h altogether ineffable. Never had I witne[s][s]ed a like demeanour in Pleyel. Never, indeed, had I ob[s]erved an human countenance in which grief was more legibly inscribed. He [s]eemed [s]truggling for utterance; but his [s]truggles being fruitle[s]s, he [s]hook his head and turned away from me. My impatience would not allow me to be longer [s]ilent: "What," [s]aid I, "for heaven's [s]ake, my friend, what is the matter?" He [s]tarted at the [s]ound of my voice. His looks, for a moment, became convul[s]ed with an emotion very different from grief. His accents were broken with rage. "The matter---O wretch!---thus exqui[s]itely [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-134.jpg) \- external link  - Page 125. ] fa[s]hioned---on whom nature [s]eemed to have exhausted all her graces; with charms [s]o awful and [s]o pure! how art thou fallen! From what height fallen! A ruin [s]o complete---[s]o unheard of!" His words were again choaked by emotion. Grief and pity were again mingled in his features. He re[s]umed, in a tone half [s]uffocated by [s]obs: "But why [s]hould I upbraid thee? Could I restore to thee what thou ha[s]t lo[s]t; efface this cur[s]ed [s]tain; [s]natch thee from the jaws of this fiend; I would do it. Yet what will avail my efforts? I have not arms with which to contend with [s]o consummate, [s]o frightful a depravity. "Evidence le[s]s than this would only have excited re[s]entment and [s]corn. The wretch who [s]hould have breathed a [s]u[s]picion injurious to thy honor, would have been regarded without anger; not hatred or envy could have prompted him; it would merely be an argument of madne[s]s. That my eyes, that my ears, [s]hould bear witne[s]s to thy fall! By no other way could dete[s]tible conviction be imparted. "Why do I [s]ummon thee to this conference? Why expo[s]e my[s]elf to thy deri[s]ion? Here admonition and entreaty are vain. Thou knowe[s]t him already, for a murderer and thief. I had thought to have been the fir[s]t to di[s]clo[s]e to thee his in[s]amy; to have warned thee of the pit to which thou art ha[s]tening; but thy eyes are open in vain. O [s]oul and in[s]upportable di[s]grace! "There is but one path. I know you will disappear together. In thy ruin, how will the [s]elicity and honor of multitudes be involved! But it mu[s]t come. This [s]cene [s]hall not be blotted by his presence. No doubt thou wilt [s]hortly [s]ee thy dete[s]ted paramour. This [s]cene will be again polluted by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-135.jpg) \- external link  - Page 126. ] a midnight a[s][s]ignation. Inform him of his danger; tell him that his crimes are known; let him fly far and in[s]tantly from this [s]pot, if he de[s]ires to avoid the fate which menaced him in Ireland. "And wilt thou not [s]tay behind?---But [s]hame upon my weakne[s]s. I know not what I would [s]ay.---I have done what I purpo[s]ed. To [s]tay longer, to expo[s]tulate, to be[s]eech, to enumerate the con[s]equences of thy act---what end can it [s]erve but to blazon thy infamy and embitter our woes? And yet, O think, think ere it be too late, on the di[s]tre[s][s]es which thy flight will entail upon us; on the ba[s]e, grovelling, and atrocious character of the wretch to whom thou ha[s]t [s]old thy honor. But what is this? Is not thy effrontery impenetrable, and thy heart thoroughly cankered? O mo[s]t [s]pecious, and mo[s]t profligate of women!" Saying this, he ru[s]hed out of the hou[s]e. I [s]aw him in a few moments hurrying along the path which led to my brother's. I had no power to prevent his going, or to recall, or to follow him. The accents I had heard were calculated to confound and bewilder. I looked around me to a[s][s]ure my[s]elf that the [s]cene was real. I moved that I might bani[s]h the doubt that I was awake. Such enormous imputations from the mouth of Pleyel! To be [s]tigmatized with the names of wanton and profligate! To be charged with the [s]acrifice of honor! with midnight meetings with a wretch known to be a murderer and thief! with an intention to fly in his company! What I had heard was [s]urely the dictate of phrenzy, or it was built upon [s]ome fatal, [s]ome incomprehensible mi[s]take. After the horrors of the night; after undergoing perils [s]o imminent from this man, to be [s]ummoned to an interview like this; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-136.jpg) \- external link  - Page 127. ] to find Pleyel fraught with a belief that, in[s]tead of having cho[s]en death as a refuge from the violence of this man, I had hugged his ba[s]ene[s]s to my heart, had [s]acrificed for him my purity, my [s]potle[s]s name, my friend[s]hips, and my fortune! that even madne[s]s could engender accu[s]ations like the[s]e was not to be believed. What evidence could po[s][s]ibly [s]ugge[s]t conceptions [s]o wild? After the unlooked-for interview with Carwin in my chamber, he retired. Could Pleyel have ob[s]erved his exit? It was not long after that Pleyel him[s]elf entered. Did he build on this incident, his odious conclu[s]ions? Could the long [s]eries of my actions and [s]entiments grant me no exemption from [s]u[s]picions [s]o foul? Was it not more rational to infer that Carwin's de[s]igns had been illicit; that my life had been endangered by the fury of one whom, by [s]ome means, he had di[s]covered to be an a[s][s]a[s][s]in and robber; that my honor had been a[s][s]ailed, not by blandi[s]hments, but by violence? He has judged me without hearing. He has drawn from dubious appearances, conclu[s]ions the mo[s]t improbable and unju[s]t. He has loaded me with all outrageous epithets. He has ranked me with pro[s]titutes and thieves. I cannot pardon thee. Pleyel, for this inju[s]tice. Thy under[s]tanding mu[s]t be hurt. If it be not, if thy conduct was [s]ober and deliberate, I can never forgive an outrage [s]o unmanly, and [s]o gro[s]s. The[s]e thoughts gradually gave place to others. Pleyel was po[s][s]e[s][s]ed by [s]ome momentary phrenzy: appearances had led him into palpable errors. Whence could his [s]agacity have contracted this blindne[s]s? Was it not love? Previou[s]ly a[s][s]ured of my affection for Carwin, di[s]tracted with grief and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-137.jpg) \- external link  - Page 128. ] jealou[s]y, and impelled hither at that late hour by [s]ome unknown in[s]tigation, his imagination transformed [s]hadows into mon[s]ters, and plunged him into the[s]e deplorable errors. This idea was not unattended with con[s]olation. My [s]oul was divided between indignation at his injustice, and delight on account of the [s]ource from which I conceived it to [s]pring. For a long time they would allow admi[s][s]ion to no other thoughts. Surprize is an emotion that enfeebles, not invigorates. All my meditations were accompanied with wonder. I rambled with vaguene[s]s, or clung to one image with an ob[s]tinacy which [s]ufficiently testified the maddening influence of late tran[s]actions. Gradually I proceeded to reflect upon the consequences of Pleyel's mi[s]take, and on the mea[s]ures I [s]hould take to guard my[s]elf again[s]t future injury from Carwin. Should I [s]uffer this mi[s]take to be detected by time? When his pa[s][s]ion [s]hould subside, would he not perceive the flagrancy of his injustice, and ha[s]ten to atone for it? Did it not become my character to te[s]tify re[s]entment for language and treatment [s]o opprobrious? Wrapt up in the con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of innocence, and confiding in the influence of time and reflection to con[s]ute [s]o groundle[s]s a charge, it was my province to be passive and [s]ilent. As to the violences meditated by Carwin, and the means of eluding them, the path to be taken by me was obvious. I re[s]olved to tell the tale to my brother, and regulate my[s]elf by his advice. For this end, when the morning was [s]omewhat advanced, I took the way to his hou[s]e. My [s]i[s]ter was engaged in her cu[s]tomary occupations. As [s]oon as I appeared, [s]he remarked a change in my looks. I was not willing to alarm her by the information [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-138.jpg) \- external link  - Page 129. ] which I had to communicate. Her health was in that condition which rendered a di[s]a[s]trous tale particularly un[s]uitable. I forbore a direct an[s]wer to her inquiries, and inquired, in my turn, for Wieland. "Why," [s]aid [s]he, "I [s]u[s]pect [s]omething mysterious and unplea[s]ant has happened this morning. Scarcely had we ri[s]en when Pleyel dropped among us. What could have prompted him to make us [s]o early and [s]o un[s]ea[s]onable a vi[s]it I cannot tell. To judge from the di[s]order of his dre[s]s, and his countenance, [s]omething of an extraordinary nature has occurred. He permitted me merely to know that he had [s]lept none, nor even undre[s][s]ed, during the pa[s]t night. He took your brother to walk with him. Some topic mu[s]t have deeply engaged them, for Wieland did not return till the breakfa[s]t hour was pa[s][s]ed, and returned alone. His di[s]turbance was exce[s][s]ive; but he would not li[s]ten to my importunities, or tell me what had happened. I gathered from hints which he let fall, that your situation was, in [s]ome way, the cau[s]e: yet he a[s][s]ured me that you were at your own hou[s]e, alive, in good health, and in perfect [s]afety. He [s]carcely ate a mor[s]el, and immediately after breakfa[s]t went out again. He would not inform me whither he was going, but mentioned that he probably might not return before night." I was equally a[s]toni[s]hed and alarmed by this information. Pleyel had told his tale to my brother, and had, by a plau[s]ible and exaggerated picture, in[s]tilled into him unfavorable thoughts of me. Yet would not the more correct judgment of Wieland perceive and expo[s]e the fallacy of his conclu[s]ions? Perhaps his unea[s]ine[s]s might ari[s]e from [s]ome insight into the character of Carwin, and from [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-139.jpg) \- external link  - Page 130. ] apprehensions for my [s]afety. The appearances by which Pleyel had been mi[s]led, might induce him likewi[s]e to believe that I entertained an indi[s]creet, though not di[s]honorable affection for Carwin. Such were the conjectures rapidly formed. I was inexpre[s][s]ibly anxious to change them into certainty. For this end an interview with my brother was de[s]irable. He was gone, no one knew whither, and was not expected [s]peedily to return. I had no clue by which to trace his foot[s]teps. My anxieties could not be concealed from my [s]i[s]ter. They heightened her [s]olicitude to be acquainted with the cau[s]e. There were many reasons per[s]uading me to [s]ilence: at lea[s]t, till I had [s]een my brother, it would be an act of inexcu[s]able temerity to unfold what had lately pa[s][s]ed. No other expedient for eluding her importunities occurred to me, but that of returning to my own hou[s]e. I recollected my determination to become a tenant of this roof. I mentioned it to her. She joyfully acceded to this propo[s]al, and [s]uffered me, with le[s]s reluctance, to depart, when I told her that it was with a view to collect and [s]end to my new dwelling what articles would be immediately u[s]eful to me. Once more I returned to the hou[s]e which had been the [s]cene of [s]o much turbulence and danger. I was at no great di[s]tance from it when I ob[s]erved my brother coming out. On [s]eeing me he [s]topped, and after a[s]certaining, as it [s]eemed, which way I was going, he returned into the hou[s]e before me. I [s]incerely rejoiced at this event, and I ha[s]tened to [s]et things, if po[s][s]ible, on their right footing. His brow was by no means expre[s][s]ive of tho[s]e vehement emotions with which Pleyel had been agitated. I drew a favorable omen from this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-140.jpg) \- external link  - Page 131. ] circumstance. Without delay I began the conversation. "I have been to look for you," [s]aid I, "but was told by Catharine that Pleyel had engaged you on [s]ome important and di[s]agreeable affair. Before his interview with you he [s]pent a few minutes with me. The[s]e minutes he employed in upbraiding me for crimes and intentions with which I am by no means chargeable. I believe him to have taken up his opinions on very in[s]ufficient grounds. His behaviour was in the highe[s]t degree precipitate and unju[s]t, and, until I receive [s]ome atonement, I [s]hall treat him, in my turn, with that contempt which he ju[s]tly merits: meanwhile I am fearful that he has prejudiced my brother again[s]t me. That is an evil which I mo[s]t anxiou[s]ly deprecate, and which I [s]hall indeed exert my[s]elf to remove. Has he made me the [s]ubject of this morning's conver[s]ation?" My brother's countenance te[s]tified no [s]urprize at my addre[s]s. The benignity of his looks were no wife dimini[s]hed. "It is true," [s]aid he, "your conduct was the [s]ubject of our di[s]cour[s]e. I am your friend, as well as your brother. There is no human being whom I love with more tenderne[s]s, and who[s]e welfare is nearer my heart. Judge then with what emotions I li[s]tened to Pleyel's [s]tory. I expect and de[s]ire you to vindicate your[s]elf from a[s]per[s]ions [s]o [s]oul, if vindication be po[s][s]ible." The tone with which he uttered the la[s]t words affected me deeply. "If vindication be po[s][s]ible!" repeated I. "From what you know, do you deem a formal vindication nece[s][s]ary? Can you harbour for a moment the belief of my guilt?" He [s]hook his head with an air of acute angui[s]h. "I have [s]truggled," [s]aid he, "to di[s]mi[s]s that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-141.jpg) \- external link  - Page 132. ] belief. You [s]peak before a judge who will profit by any pretence to acquit you: who is ready to question his own [s]en[s]es when they plead again[s]t you." The[s]e words incited a new [s]et of thoughts in my mind. I began to [s]u[s]pect that Pleyel had built his accu[s]ations on [s]ome foundation unknown to me. "I may be a [s]tranger to the grounds of your belief. Pleyel loaded me with indecent and virulent invectives, but he withheld from me the facts that generated his [s]u[s]picions. Events took place la[s]t night of which [s]ome of the circum[s]tances were of an ambiguous nature. I conceived that the[s]e might po[s][s]ibly have fallen under his cognizance, and that, viewed through the mi[s]ts of prejudice and pa[s][s]ion, they [s]upplied a pretence for his conduct, but believed that your more unbia[s][s]ed judgment would e[s]timate them at their ju[s]t value. Perhaps his tale has been different from what I [s]u[s]pect it to be. Li[s]ten then to my narrative. If there be any thing in his [s]tory incon[s]i[s]tent with mine, his [s]tory is fal[s]e." I then proceeded to a circum[s]tantial relation of the incidents of the la[s]t night. Wieland li[s]tened with deep attention. Having fini[s]hed, "This," continued I, "is the truth; you [s]ee in what circumstances an interview took place between Carwin and me. He remained for hours in my clo[s]et, and for [s]ome minutes in my chamber. He departed without ha[s]te or interruption. If Pleyel marked him as he left the hou[s]e, and it is not impossible that he did, inferences injurious to my character might [s]ugge[s]t them[s]elves to him. In admitting them, he gave proofs of le[s]s di[s]cernment and le[s]s candor than I once a[s]cribed to him." "His proofs," [s]aid Wieland, after a considerable pau[s]e, "are different. That he [s]hould be [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-142.jpg) \- external link  - Page 133. ] deceived, is not po[s][s]ible. That he him[s]elf is not the deceiver, could not be believed, if his te[s]timony were not incon[s]i[s]tent with yours; but the doubts which I entertained are now removed. Your tale, [s]ome parts of it, is marvellous; the voice which exclaimed again[s]t your ra[s]hne[s]s in approaching the clo[s]et, your per[s]i[s]ting notwith[s]tanding that prohibition, your belief that I was the ruffian, and your [s]ub[s]equent conduct, are believed by me, becau[s]e I have known you from childhood, becau[s]e a thousand in[s]tances have atte[s]ted your veracity, and because nothing le[s]s than my own hearing and vi[s]ion would convince me, in oppo[s]ition to her own assertions, that my [s]i[s]ter had fallen into wickedne[s]s like this." I threw my arms around him, and bathed his cheek with my tears. "That," [s]aid I, "is [s]poken like my brother. But what are the proofs?" He replied---"Pleyel informed me that, in going to your hou[s]e, his attention was attracted by two voices. The per[s]ons [s]peaking [s]at beneath the bank out of [s]ight. The[s]e per[s]ons, judging by their voices, were Carwin and you. I will not repeat the dialogue. If my [s]i[s]ter was the female, Pleyel was ju[s]tified in concluding you to be, indeed, one of the mo[s]t profligate of women. Hence, his accusations of you, and his efforts to obtain my concurrence to a plan by which an eternal [s]eparation [s]hould be brought about between my [s]i[s]ter and this man." I made Wieland repeat this recital. Here, indeed, was a tale to fill me with terrible foreboding. I had vainly thought that my [s]afety could be sufficiently [s]ecured by doors and bars, but this is a foe from who[s]e gra[s]p no power of divinity can [s]ave me! His artifices will ever lay my fame and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-143.jpg) \- external link  - Page 134. ] happiness at his mercy. How [s]hall I counterwork his plots, or detect his coadjutor? He has taught [s]ome vile and abandoned female to mimic my voice. Pleyel's ears were the witne[s][s]es of my dishonor. This is the midnight a[s][s]ignation to which he alluded. Thus is the [s]ilence he maintained when attempting to open the door of my chamber, accounted for. He [s]uppo[s]ed me ab[s]ent, and meant, perhaps, had my apartment been acce[s][s]ible, to leave in it [s]ome accu[s]ing memorial. Pleyel was no longer equally culpable. The [s]incerity of his angui[s]h, the depth of his de[s]pair, I remembered with [s]ome tendencies to gratitude. Yet was he not precipitate? Was the conjecture that my part was played by [s]ome mimic [s]o utterly untenable? In[s]tances of this faculty are common. The wickedne[s]s of Carwin mu[s]t, in his opinion, have been adequate to [s]uch contrivances, and yet the [s]uppo[s]ition of my guilt was adopted in preference to that. But how was this error to be unveiled? What but my own a[s][s]ertion had I to throw in the balance again[s]t it? Would this be permitted to outweigh the te[s]timony of his [s]en[s]es? I had no witnesses to prove my exi[s]tence in another place. The real events of that night are marvellous. Few, to whom they [s]hould be related, would [s]cruple to di[s]credit them. Pleyel is [s]ceptical in a transcendant degree. I cannot [s]ummon Carwin to my bar, and make him the atte[s]tor of my innocence, and the accu[s]er of him[s]elf. My brother [s]aw and comprehended my di[s]tre[s]s. He was unacquainted, however, with the full extent of it. He knew not by how many motives I was incited to retrieve the good opinion of Pleyel. He endeavored to con[s]ole me. Some new event, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-144.jpg) \- external link  - Page 135. ] he [s]aid, would occur to di[s]entangle the maze. He did not que[s]tion the influence of my eloquence, if I thought proper to exert it. Why not [s]eek an interview with Pleyel, and exact from him a minute relation, in which [s]omething may be met with serving to de[s]troy the probability of the whole? I caught, with eagerne[s]s, at this hope; but my alacrity was damped by new reflections. Should I, perfect in this re[s]pect, and unblemi[s]hed as I was, thru[s]t my[s]elf, uncalled, into his pre[s]ence, and make my felicity depend upon his arbitrary verdict? "If you chu[s]e to [s]eek an interview," continued Wieland, "you mu[s]t make ha[s]te, for Pleyel informed me of his intention to [s]et out this evening or to-morrow on a long journey." No intelligence was le[s]s expected or le[s]s welcome than this. I had thrown my[s]elf in a window [s]eat; but now, [s]tarting on my feet, I exclaimed, "Good heavens! what is it you [s]ay? a journey? whither? when?" "I cannot [s]ay whither. It is a [s]udden re[s]olution I believe. I did not hear of it till this morning. He promi[s]es to write to me as [s]oon as he is [s]ettled." I needed no further information as to the cau[s]e and i[s][s]ue of this journey. The [s]cheme of happiness to which he had devoted his thoughts was bla[s]ted by the di[s]covery of la[s]t night. My preference of another, and my unworthine[s]s to be any longer the object of his adoration, were evinced by the [s]ame act and in the [s]ame moment. The thought of utter de[s]ertion, a de[s]ertion originating in [s]uch a cau[s]e, was the prelude to di[s]traction. That Pleyel [s]hould abandon me forever, becau[s]e I was blind to his excellence, becau[s]e I coveted pollution, and wedded infamy, when, on the contrary, my heart was the [s]hrine of all purity, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-145.jpg) \- external link  - Page 136. ] beat only for his [s]ake, was a de[s]tiny which, as long as my life was in my own hands, I would by no means con[s]ent to endure. I remembered that this evil was [s]till preventable; that this fatal journey it was [s]till in my power to procra[s]tinate, or, perhaps, to occa[s]ion it to be laid a[s]ide. There were no impediments to a vi[s]it: I only dreaded left the interview [s]hould be too long delayed. My brother befriended my impatience, and readily con[s]ented to furni[s]h me with a chai[s]e and [s]ervant to attend me. My purpo[s]e was to go immediately to Pleyel's farm, where his engagements u[s]ually detained him during the day. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-146.jpg) \- external link  - Page 137. ] My way lay through the city. I had [s]carcely entered it when I was [s]eized with a general sensation of [s]ickne[s]s. Every object grew dim and [s]wam before my [s]ight. It was with difficulty I prevented my[s]elf from [s]inking to the bottom of the carriage. I ordered my[s]elf to be carried to Mrs. Baynton's, in hope that an interval of repo[s]e would invigorate and refre[s]h me. My di[s]tracted thoughts would allow me but little re[s]t. Growing [s]omewhat better in the afternoon, I re[s]umed my journey. My contemplations were limited to a few objects. I regarded my [s]ucce[s]s, in the purpo[s]e which I had in view, as con[s]iderably doubtful. I depended, in [s]ome degree, on the [s]ugge[s]tions of the moment, and on the materials which Pleyel him[s]elf [s]hould furni[s]h me. When I reflected on the nature of the accu[s]ation, I burned with di[s]dain. Would not truth, and the con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of innocence, render me triumphant? Should I not ca[s]t from me, with irre[s]i[s]tible force, [s]uch atrocious imputations? What an entire and mournful change has been effected in a few hours! The gulf that [s]eparates man from infects is not wider than that which fevers the polluted from the cha[s]te among women. Ye[s]terday and to-day I am the [s]ame. There is a degree of depravity to which it is impo[s][s]ible for me to [s]ink; yet, in the apprehen[s]ion of another, my ancient and intimate a[s][s]ociate, the perpetual witness of my actions, and partaker of my thoughts, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-147.jpg) \- external link  - Page 138. ] I had cea[s]ed to be the [s]ame. My integrity was tarnished and withered in his eyes. I was the colleague of a murderer, and the paramour of a thief! His opinion was not de[s]titute of evidence: yet what proofs could rea[s]onably avail to e[s]tabli[s]h an opinion like this? If the [s]entiments corre[s]ponded not with the voice that was heard, the evidence was deficient; but this want of corre[s]pondence would have been [s]uppo[s]ed by me if I had been the auditor and Pleyel the criminal. But mimicry might [s]till more plau[s]ibly have been employed to explain the [s]cene. Alas! it is the fate of Clara Wieland to fall into the hands of a precipitate and inexorable judge. But what, O man of mi[s]chief! is the tendency of thy thoughts? Fru[s]trated in thy fir[s]t de[s]ign, thou wilt not forego the immolation of thy victim. To exterminate my reputation was all that remained to thee, and this my guardian has permitted. To di[s]po[s][s]e[s]s Pleyel of this prejudice may be impossible; but if that be effected, it cannot be supposed that thy wiles are exhau[s]ted; thy cunning will di[s]cover innumerable avenues to the accomplishment of thy malignant purpo[s]e. Why [s]hould I enter the li[s]ts again[s]t thee? Would to heaven I could di[s]arm thy vengeance by my deprecations! When I think of all the re[s]ources with which nature and education have [s]upplied thee; that thy form is a combination of [s]teely fibres and organs of exqui[s]ite ductility and boundle[s]s compass, actuated by an intelligence gifted with infinite endowments, and comprehending all knowledge, I perceive that my doom is fixed. What ob[s]tacle will be able to divert thy zeal or repel thy efforts? That being who has hitherto protected me has borne te[s]timony to the formidablene[s]s of thy [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-148.jpg) \- external link  - Page 139. ] attempts, [s]ince nothing le[s]s than [s]upernatural interference could check thy career. Mu[s]ing on the[s]e thoughts, I arrived, towards the clo[s]e of the day, at Pleyel's hou[s]e. A month before, I had traver[s]ed the [s]ame path; but how different were my [s]en[s]ations! Now I was [s]eeking the pre[s]ence of one who regarded me as the mo[s]t degenerate of human kind. I was to plead the cau[s]e of my innocence, again[s]t witne[s][s]es the mo[s]t explicit and unerring, of tho[s]e which [s]upport the fabric of human knowledge. The nearer I approached the cri[s]is, the more did my confidence decay. When the chai[s]e [s]topped at the door, my [s]trength refu[s]ed to [s]upport me, and I threw my[s]elf into the arms of an ancient female dome[s]tic. I had not courage to inquire whether her ma[s]ter was at home. I was tormented with fears that the projected journey was already undertaken. The[s]e fears were removed, by her a[s]king me whether [s]he [s]hould call her young ma[s]ter, who had ju[s]t gone into his own room. I was [s]omewhat revived by this intelligence, and re[s]olved immediately to [s]eek him there. In my confu[s]ion of mind, I neglected to knock at the door, but entered his apartment without previous notice. This abruptne[s]s was altogether involuntary. Ab[s]orbed in reflections of [s]uch unspeakable moment, I had no lei[s]ure to heed the niceties of punctilio. I di[s]covered him [s]tanding with his back towards the entrance. A [s]mall trunk, with its lid rai[s]ed, was before him, in which it [s]eemed as if he had been bu[s]y in packing his clothes. The moment of my entrance, he was employed in gazing at [s]omething which he held in his hand. I imagined that I fully comprehended this [s]cene. The image which he held before him, and by which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-149.jpg) \- external link  - Page 140. ] his attention was [s]o deeply engaged, I doubted not to be my own. The[s]e preparations for his journey, the cau[s]e to which it was to be imputed, the hopele[s][s]ne[s]s of [s]ucce[s]s in the undertaking on which I had entered, ru[s]hed at once upon my feelings, and di[s][s]olved me into a flood of tears. Startled by this [s]ound, he dropped the lid of the trunk and turned. The [s]olemn [s]adne[s]s that previously over[s]pread his countenance, gave [s]udden way to an attitude and look of the mo[s]t vehement a[s]toni[s]hment. Perceiving me unable to uphold myself, he [s]tepped towards me without [s]peaking, and [s]upported me by his arm. The kindne[s]s of this action called forth a new effu[s]ion from my eyes. Weeping was a [s]olace to which, at that time, I had not grown familiar, and which, therefore, was peculiarly delicious. Indignation was no longer to be read in the features of my friend. They were pregnant with a mixture of wonder and pity. Their expre[s][s]ion was ea[s]ily interpreted. This vi[s]it, and the[s]e tears, were tokens of my penitence. The wretch whom he had [s]tigmatized as incurably and obdurately wicked, now [s]hewed her[s]elf [s]u[s]ceptible of remor[s]e, and had come to confe[s]s her guilt. This per[s]ua[s]ion had no tendency to comfort me: It only [s]hewed me, with new evidence, the difficulty of the ta[s]k which I had a[s][s]igned my[s]elf. We were mutually [s]ilent. I had le[s]s power and le[s]s inclination than ever to [s]peak. I extricated my[s]elf from his hold, and threw my[s]elf on a [s]ofa. He placed him[s]elf by my [s]ide, and appeared to wait with impatience and anxiety for [s]ome beginning of the conver[s]ation. What could I [s]ay? It my mind had [s]ugge[s]ted any thing [s]uitable to the occa[s]ion, my utterance was [s]uffocated by tears. Frequently he attempted to [s]peak, but [s]eemed [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-150.jpg) \- external link  - Page 141. ] deterred by [s]ome degree of uncertainty as to the true nature of the [s]cene. At length, in faltering accents he [s]poke: "My friend! would to heaven I were [s]till permitted to call you by that name. The image that I once adored exi[s]ted only in my fancy; but though I cannot hope to [s]ee it realized, you may not be totally in[s]en[s]ible to the horrors of that gulf into which you are about to plunge. What heart is forever exempt from the goadings of compunction and the influx of laudable propen[s]ities? "I thought you accompli[s]hed and wi[s]e beyond the re[s]t of women. Not a [s]entiment you uttered, not a look you a[s][s]umed, that were not, in my apprehension, sraught with the [s]ublimities of rectitude and the illuminations of genius. Deceit has [s]ome bounds. Your education could not be without influence. A vigorous under[s]tanding cannot be utterly devoid of virtue; but you could not counterfeit the powers of invention and rea[s]oning. I was ra[s]h in my invectives. I will not, but with life, relinqui[s]h all hopes of you. I will [s]hut out every proof that would tell me that your heart is incura--- bly di[s]ea[s]ed. "You come to re[s]tore me once more to happiness; to convince me that you have torn her ma[s]k from vice, and feel nothing but abhorrence for the part you have hitherto acted." At the[s]e words my equanimity for[s]ook me. For a moment I forgot the evidence from which Pleyel's opinions were derived, the benevolence of his remonstrances, and the grief which his accents bespoke; I was filled with indignation and horror at charges [s]o black; I [s]hrunk back and darted at him a look of di[s]dain and anger. My pa[s][s]ion [s]upplied me with words. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-151.jpg) \- external link  - Page 142. ] "What dete[s]table infatuation was it that led me hither! Why do I patiently endure the[s]e horrible in[s]ults! My offences exi[s]t only in your own distempered imagination: you are leagued with the traitor who a[s][s]ailed my life: you have vowed the de[s]truction of my peace and honor. I de[s]erve infamy for li[s]tening to calumnies [s]o ba[s]e!" The[s]e words were heard by Pleyel without visible re[s]entment. His countenance relap[s]ed into its former gloom; but he did not even look at me. The ideas which had given place to my angry emotions returned, and once more melted me into tears. "O!" I exclaimed, in a voice broken by [s]obs, "what a ta[s]k is mine! Compelled to hear-ken to charges which I feel to be fal[s]e, but which I know to be believed by him that utters them; believed too not without evidence, which, though fallacious, is not unplau[s]ible. "I came hither not to confe[s]s, but to vindicate. I know the [s]ource of your opinions. Wieland has informed me on what your [s]u[s]picions are built. The[s]e [s]u[s]picions are fo[s]tered by you as certainties; the tenor of my life, of all my conver[s]ations and letters, affords me no [s]ecurity; every [s]entiment that my tongue and my pen have uttered, bear te[s]timony to the rectitude of my mind; but this te[s]timony is rejected. I am condemned as brutally profligate: I am cla[s][s]ed with the [s]tupidly and [s]ordidly wicked. "And where are the proofs that mu[s]t ju[s]tify [s]o foul and [s]o improbable an accu[s]ation? You have overheard a midnight conference. Voices have saluted your ear, in which you imagine your[s]elf to have recognized mine, and that of a detected villain. The [s]entiments expre[s][s]ed were not allowed to outweigh the ca[s]ual or concerted re[s]emblance of voice. Sentiments the rever[s]e of all tho[s]e who[s]e [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-152.jpg) \- external link  - Page 143. ] influence my former life had atte[s]ted, denoting a mind polluted by grovelling vices, and entering into compact with that of a thief and a murderer. The nature of the[s]e [s]entiments did not enable you to detect the cheat, did not [s]ugge[s]t to you the possibility that my voice had been counterfeited by another. "You were precipitate and prone to condemn. In[s]tead of ru[s]hing on the impo[s]tors, and comparing the evidence of [s]ight with that of hearing, you [s]tood aloof, or you fled. My innocence would not now have [s]tood in need of vindication, if this conduct had been pur[s]ued. That you did not pursue it, your pre[s]ent thoughts inconte[s]tibly prove. Yet this conduct might [s]urely have been expected from Pleyel. That he would not ha[s]tily impute the blacke[s]t of crimes, that he would not couple my name with infamy, and cover me with ruin for inadequate or [s]light rea[s]ons, might rea[s]onably have been expected." The [s]obs which convul[s]ed my bo[s]om would not [s]uffer me to proceed. Pleyel was for a moment affected. He looked at me with [s]ome expre[s][s]ion of doubt; but this quickly gave place to a mournful [s]olemnity. He fixed his eyes on the floor as in reverie, and [s]poke: "Two hours hence I am gone. Shall I carry away with me the [s]orrow that is now my gue[s]t? or [s]hall that [s]orrow be accumulated tenfold? What is [s]he that is now before me? Shall every hour [s]upply me with new proofs of a wickedne[s]s beyond example? Already I deem her the mo[s]t abandoned and dete[s]table of human creatures. Her coming and her tears imparted a gleam of hope, but that gleam has vani[s]hed." He now fixed his eyes upon me, and every mu[s]cle in his face trembled. His tone was hollow [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-153.jpg) \- external link  - Page 144. ] and terrible---"Thou knowe[s]t that I was a witne[s]s of your interview, yet thou come[s]t hither to upbraid me for inju[s]tice! Thou can[s]t look me in the face and [s]ay that I am deceived!---An inscrutable providence has fa[s]hioned thee for [s]ome end. Thou wilt live, no doubt, to fulfil the purpo[s]es of thy maker, if he repent not of his workmanship, and [s]end not his vengeance to exterminate thee, ere the mea[s]ure of thy days be full. Surely nothing in the [s]hape of man can vie with thee! "But I thought I had [s]tifled this fury. I am not con[s]tituted thy judge. My office is to pity and amend, and not to puni[s]h and revile. I deemed myself exempt from all tempe[s]tuous pa[s][s]ions. I had almo[s]t per[s]uaded my[s]elf to weep over thy fall; but I am frail as du[s]t, and mutable as water; I am calm, I am compa[s][s]ionate only in thy ab[s]ence.--- Make this hou[s]e, this room, thy abode as long as thou wilt, but forgive me if I prefer [s]olitude for the [s]hort time during which I [s]hall [s]tay." Saying this, he motioned as if to leave the apartment. The [s]tormy pa[s][s]ions of this man affected me by [s]ympathy. I cea[s]ed to weep. I was motionle[s]s and [s]peechle[s]s with agony. I [s]at with my hands cla[s]ped, mutely gazing after him as he withdrew. I de[s]ired to detain him, but was unable to make any effort for that purpo[s]e, till he had pa[s][s]ed out of the room. I then uttered an involuntary and piercing cry---"Pleyel! Art thou gone? Gone forever?" At this [s]ummons he ha[s]tily returned. He beheld me wild, pale, ga[s]ping for breath, and my head already [s]inking on my bo[s]om. A painful dizzine[s]s [s]eized me, and I fainted away. When I recovered, I found my[s]elf [s]tretched on a bed in the outer apartment, and Pleyel, with two [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-154.jpg) \- external link  - Page 145. ] female [s]ervants [s]tanding be[s]ide it. All the fury and [s]corn which the countenance of the former lately expre[s][s]ed, had now di[s]appeared, and was [s]ucceded by the mo[s]t tender anxiety. As [s]oon as he perceived that my [s]en[s]es were returned to me, he cla[s]ped his hands, and exclaimed, "God be thanked! you are once more alive. I had almo[s]t de[s]paired of your recovery. I fear I have been precipitate and unju[s]t. My [s]en[s]es mu[s]t have been the victims of [s]ome inexplicable and momentary phrenzy. Forgive me, I be[s]eech you, forgive my reproaches. I would purcha[s]e conviction of your purity, at the price of my exi[s]tence here and hereafter." He once more, in a tone of the mo[s]t [s]ervent tenderne[s]s, be[s]ought me to be compo[s]ed, and then left me to the care of the women. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-155.jpg) \- external link  - Page 146. ] Here was wrought a [s]urprizing change in my friend. What was it that had [s]haken conviction [s]o firm? Had any thing occurred during my fit, adequate to produce [s]o total an alteration? My attendants informed me that he had not left my apartment; that the unu[s]ual duration of my fit, and the failure, for a time, of all the means u[s]ed for my recovery, had filled him with grief and di[s]may. Did he regard the effect which his reproaches had produced as a proof of my [s]incerity? In this [s]tate of mind, I little regarded my languors of body. I ro[s]e and reque[s]ted an interview with him before my departure, on which I was re[s]olved, notwith[s]tanding his earne[s]t [s]olicitation to [s]pend the night at his hou[s]e. He complied with my reque[s]t. The tenderne[s]s which he had lately betrayed, had now di[s]appeared, and he once more relap[s]ed into a chilling [s]olemnity. I told him that I was preparing to return to my brother's; that I had come hither to vindicate my innocence from the foul a[s]per[s]ions which he had ca[s]t upon it. My pride had not taken refuge in [s]ilence or di[s]tance. I had not relied upon time, or the [s]ugge[s]tions of his cooler thoughts, to consute his charges. Con[s]cious as I was that I was perfectly guiltle[s]s, and entertaining [s]ome value for his good opinion, I could not prevail upon my[s]elf to believe that my efforts to make my innocence manifest, would be fruitle[s]s. Adver[s]e appearances might [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-156.jpg) \- external link  - Page 147. ] be numerous and [s]pecious, but they were unquestionably fal[s]e. I was willing to believe him sincere, that he made no charges which he him[s]elf did not believe; but the[s]e charges were de[s]titute of truth. The grounds of his opinion were fallacious; and I de[s]ired an opportunity of detecting their fallacy. I entreated him to be explicit, and to give me a detail of what he had heard, and what he had [s]een. At the[s]e words, my companion's countenance grew darker. He appeared to be [s]truggling with his rage. He opened his lips to [s]peak, but his accents died away ere they were formed. This conflict la[s]ted for [s]ome minutes, but his fortitude was finally [s]ucce[s]sful. He [s]poke as follows: "I would fain put an end to this hateful [s]cene: what I [s]hall [s]ay, will be breath idly and unprofitably con[s]umed. The cleare[s]t narrative will add nothing to your pre[s]ent knowledge. You are acquainted with the grounds of my opinion, and yet you avow your[s]elf innocent: Why then [s]hould I rehear[s]e the[s]e grounds? You are apprized of the character of Carwin: Why then [s]hould I enumerate the di[s]coveries which I have made re[s]pecting him? Yet, [s]ince it is your reque[s]t; [s]ince, considering the limitedne[s]s of human faculties, [s]ome error may po[s][s]ibly lurk in tho[s]e appearances which I have witne[s][s]ed, I will briefly relate what I know. "Need I dwell upon the impre[s][s]ions which your conver[s]ation and deportment originally made upon me? We parted in childhood; but our intercour[s]e, by letter, was copious and uninterrupted. How fondly did I anticipate a meeting with one whom her letters had previou[s]ly taught me to con[s]ider as the fir[s]t of women, and how fully realized were the expectations that I had formed! [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-157.jpg) \- external link  - Page 148. ] "Here, [s]aid I, is a being, after whom [s]ages may model their tran[s]cendent intelligence, and painters, their ideal beauty. Here is exemplified, that union between intellect and form, which has hitherto exi[s]ted only in the conceptions of the poet. I have watched your eyes; my attention has hung upon your lips. I have que[s]tioned whether the enchantments of your voice were more con[s]picuous in the intricacies of melody, or the empha[s]is of rhetoric. I have marked the tran[s]itions of your di[s]cour[s]e, the felicities of your expre[s][s]ion, your refined argumentation, and glowing imagery; and been forced to acknowledge, that all delights were meagre and contemptible, compared with tho[s]e connected with the audience and [s]ight of you. I have contemplated your principles, and been a[s]toni[s]hed at the [s]olidity of their foundation, and the perfection of their [s]tructure. I have traced you to your home. I have viewed you in relation to your [s]ervants, to your family, to your neighbours, and to the world. I have [s]een by what [s]kilful arrangements you facilitate the performance of the mo[s]t arduous and complicated duties; what daily acce[s][s]ions of [s]trength your judicious di[s]cipline be[s]towed upon your memory; what correctne[s]s and abundance of knowledge was daily experienced by your unwearied application to books, and to writing. If [s]he that po[s][s]e[s][s]es [s]o much in the bloom of youth, will go on accumulating her [s]tores, what, [s]aid I, is the picture [s]he will di[s]play at a mature age? "You know not the accuracy of my ob[s]ervation. I was de[s]irous that others [s]hould profit by an example [s]o rare. I therefore noted down, in writing, every particular of your conduct. I was anxious to benefit by an opportunity [s]o [s]eldom afforded us. I laboured not to omit the [s]lighte[s]t [s]hade, or the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-158.jpg) \- external link  - Page 149. ] mo[s]t petty line in your portrait. Here there was no other ta[s]k incumbent on me but to copy; there was no need to exaggerate or overlook, in order to produce a more unexceptionable pattern. Here was a combination of harmonies and graces, incapable of diminution or acce[s]lion without injury to its completene[s]s. "I found no end and no bounds to my ta[s]k. No di[s]play of a [s]cene like this could be chargeable with redundancy or [s]uperfluity. Even the colour of a [s]hoe, the knot of a ribband, or your attitude in plucking a ro[s]e, were of moment to be recorded. Even the arrangements of your breakfa[s]t-table and your toilet have been amply di[s]played. "I know that mankind are more ea[s]ily enticed to virtue by example than by precept. I know that the ab[s]olutene[s]s of a model, when [s]upplied by invention, dimini[s]hes its [s]alutary influence, [s]ince it is u[s]ele[s]s, we think, to [s]trive after that which we know to be beyond our reach. But the picture which I drew was not a phantom; as a model, it was devoid of imperfection; and to a[s]pire to that height which had been really attained, was by no means unrea[s]onable. I had another and more intere[s]ting object in view. One exi[s]ted who claimed all my tenderne[s]s. Here, in all its parts, was a model worthy of affiduous [s]tudy, and indefatigable imitation. I called upon her, as [s]he wi[s]hed to [s]ecure and enhance my e[s]teem, to mould her thoughts, her words, her countenance, her actions, by this pattern. "The ta[s]k was exuberant of plea[s]ure, and I was deeply engaged in it, when an imp of mi[s]chief was let loo[s]e in the form of Carwin. I admired his powers and accompli[s]hments. I did not wonder that they were admired by you. On the rectitude of your judgment, however, I relied to keep this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-159.jpg) \- external link  - Page 150. ] admiration within di[s]creet and [s]crupulous bounds. I a[s][s]ured my[s]elf, that the [s]trangene[s]s of his deportment, and the ob[s]curity of his life, would teach you caution. Of all errors, my knowledge of your character informed me that this was lea[s]t likely to be[s]all you. "You were powerfully affected by his fir[s]t appearance; you were bewitched by his countenance and his tones; your de[s]cription was ardent and pathetic: I li[s]tened to you with [s]ome emotions of surprize. The portrait you drew in his ab[s]ence, and the inten[s]ity with which you mu[s]ed upon it, were new and unexpected incidents. They be[s]poke a [s]en[s]ibility [s]omewhat too vivid; but from which, while [s]ubjected to the guidance of an understanding like yours, there was nothing to dread. "A more direct intercour[s]e took place between you. I need not apologize for the [s]olicitude which I entertained for your [s]afety. He that gifted me with perception of excellence, compelled me to love it. In the mid[s]t of danger and pain, my contemplations have ever been cheered by your image. Every object in competition with you, was worthless and trivial. No price was too great by which your [s]afety could be purcha[s]ed. For that end, the [s]acrifice of ea[s]e, of health, and even of life, would cheerfully have been made by me. What wonder then, that I [s]crutinized the [s]entiments and deportment of this man with cea[s]ele[s]s vigilance; that I watched your words and your looks when he was pre[s]ent; and that I extracted cau[s]e for the deepe[s]t inquietudes, from every token which you gave of having put your happine[s]s into this man's keeping? "I was cautious in deciding. I recalled the various conver[s]ations in which the topics of love and marriage had been di[s]cu[s][s]ed. As a woman, young, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-160.jpg) \- external link  - Page 151. ] beautiful, and independent, it behoved you to have fortified your mind with ju[s]t principles on this subject. Your principles were eminently ju[s]t. Had not their rectitude and their firmne[s]s been atte[s]ted by your treatment of that [s]pecious [s]educer Dashwood? The[s]e principles, I was prone to believe, exempted you from danger in this new [s]tate of things. I was not the la[s]t to pay my homage to the unrivalled capacity, in[s]inuation, and eloquence of this man. I have di[s]gui[s]ed, but could never [s]tifle the conviction, that his eyes and voice had a witchcraft in them, which rendered him truly formidable: but I reflected on the ambiguous expre[s][s]ion of his countenance---an ambiguity which you were the fir[s]t to remark; on the cloud which ob[s]cured his character; and on the [s]u[s]picious nature of that concealment which he [s]tudied; and concluded you to be [s]afe. I denied the obvious con[s]truction to appearances. I referred your conduct to [s]ome principle which had not been hitherto di[s]clo[s]ed, but which was reconcileable with tho[s]e already known. "I was not [s]uffered to remain long in this suspence. One evening, you may recollect, I came to your hou[s]e, where it was my purpo[s]e, as u[s]ual, to lodge, [s]omewhat earlier than ordinary. I [s]pied a light in your chamber as I approached from the out[s]ide, and on inquiring of Judith, was informed that you were writing. As your kin[s]man and friend, and fellow-lodger, I thought I had a right to be familiar. You were in your chamber, but your employment and the time were [s]uch as to make it no infraction of decorum to follow you thither. The [s]pirit of mi[s]chievous gaiety po[s][s]e[s][s]ed me. I proceeded on tiptoe. You did not perceive my entrance; and I advanced [s]oftly till I was able to overlook your [s]houlder. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-161.jpg) \- external link  - Page 152. ] "I had gone thus far in error, and had no power to recede. How cautiou[s]ly [s]hould we guard again[s]t the fir[s]t inroads of temptation! I knew that to pry into your papers was criminal; but I reflected that no [s]entiment of yours was of a nature which made it your intere[s]t to conceal it. You wrote much more than you permitted your friends to peru[s]e. My curio[s]ity was [s]trong, and I had only to throw a glance upon the paper, to [s]ecure its gratification. I [s]hould never have deliberately committed an act like this. The [s]lighte[s]t ob[s]tacle would have repelled me; but my eye glanced almo[s]t spontaneously upon the paper. I caught only parts of sentences; but my eyes comprehended more at a glance, becau[s]e the characters were [s]hort-hand. I lighted on the words [s]ummer-hou[s]e, midnight, and made out a pa[s][s]age which [s]poke of the propriety and of the effects to be expected from another interview. All this pa[s][s]ed in le[s]s than a moment. I then checked my[s]elf, and made my[s]elf known to you, by a tap upon your [s]houlder. "I could pardon and account for [s]ome trifling alarm; but your trepidation and blu[s]hes were excessive. You hurried the paper out of [s]ight, and [s]eemed too anxious to di[s]cover whether I knew the contents to allow your[s]elf to make any inquiries. I wondered at the[s]e appearances of con[s]ternation, but did not rea[s]on on them until I had retired. When alone, the[s]e incidents [s]ugge[s]ted them[s]elves to my reflections a new. "To what [s]cene, or what interview, I a[s]ked, did you allude? Your di[s]appearance on a former evening, my tracing you to the rece[s]s in the bank, your [s]ilence on my fir[s]t and [s]econd call, your vague an[s]wers and invincible embarra[s][s]ment, when you, at length, a[s]cended the hill, I recollected with new [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-162.jpg) \- external link  - Page 153. ] [s]urprize. Could this be the [s]ummer-hou[s]e alluded to? A certain timidity and con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s had generally attended you, when this incident and this recess had been the [s]ubjects of conver[s]ation. Nay, I imagined that the la[s]t time that adventure was mentioned, which happened in the pre[s]ence of Carwin, the countenance of the latter betrayed [s]ome emotion. Could the interview have been with him? "This was an idea calculated to rou[s]e every faculty to contemplation. An interview at that hour, in this dark[s]ome retreat, with a man of this my[s]terious but formidable character; a clande[s]tine interview, and one which you afterwards endeavoured with [s]o much [s]olicitude to conceal! It was a fearful and portentous occurrence. I could not mea[s]ure his power, or fathom his de[s]igns. Had he rifled from you the [s]ecret of your love, and reconciled you to concealment and nocturnal meetings? I [s]carcely ever [s]pent a night of more inquietude. "I knew not how to act. The a[s]certainment of this man's character and views [s]eemed to be, in the fir[s]t place, nece[s][s]ary. Had he openly preferred his [s]uit to you, we [s]hould have been impowered to make direct inquiries; but [s]ince he had cho[s]en this ob[s]cure path, it [s]eemed rea[s]onable to infer that his character was exceptionable. It, at lea[s]t, [s]ubjected us to the nece[s][s]ity of re[s]orting to other means of information. Yet the improbability that you [s]hould commit a deed of [s]uch rashness, made me reflect anew upon the in[s]ufficiency of tho[s]e grounds on which my [s]u[s]picions had been built, and almo[s]t to condemn my[s]elf for harbouring them. "Though it was mere conjecture that the interview [s]poken of had taken place with Carwin, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-163.jpg) \- external link  - Page 154. ] yet two ideas occurred to involve me in the mo[s]t painful doubts. This man's rea[s]onings might be [s]o [s]pecious, and his artifices [s]o profound, that, aided by the pa[s][s]ion which you had conceived for him, he had finally [s]ucceeded; or his [s]ituation might be [s]uch as to ju[s]tify the [s]ecrecy which you maintained. In neither ca[s]e did my wilde[s]t reveries [s]ugge[s]t to me, that your honor had been forfeited. "I could not talk with you on this [s]ubject. If the imputation was fal[s]e, its atrociou[s]ne[s]s would have ju[s]tly drawn upon me your re[s]entment, and I mu[s]t have explained by what facts it had been suggested. If it were true, no benefit would follow from the mention of it. You had cho[s]en to conceal it for [s]ome rea[s]ons, and whether the[s]e rea[s]ons were true or fal[s]e, it was proper to di[s]cover and remove them in the fir[s]t place. Finally, I acquiesced in the lea[s]t painful [s]uppo[s]ition, trammelled as it was with perplexities, that Carwin was upright, and that, if the rea[s]ons of your [s]ilence were known they would be found to be ju[s]t. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-164.jpg) \- external link  - Page 155. ] " Three days have elap[s]ed [s]ince this occurrence. I have been haunted by perpetual inquietude. To bring my[s]elf to regard Carwin without terror, and to acquie[s]ce in the belief of your [s]afety, was impo[s][s]ible. Yet to put an end to my doubts, [s]eemed to be impracticable. If [s]ome light could be reflected on the actual [s]ituation of this man, a direct path would pre[s]ent it[s]elf. If he were, contrary to the tenor of his conver[s]ation, cunning and malignant, to apprize you of this, would be to place you in [s]ecurity. If he were merely unfortunate and innocent, mo[s]t readily would I e[s]pou[s]e his cau[s]e; and if his intentions were upright with regard to you, mo[s]t eagerly would I [s]anctify your choice by my approbation. "It would be vain to call upon Carwin for an avowal of his deeds. It was better to know nothing, than to be deceived by an artful tale. What he was unwilling to communicate, and this unwillingness had been repeatedly manife[s]ted, could never be extorted from him. Importunity might be appeased, or impo[s]ture effected by fallacious representations. To the re[s]t of the world he was unknown. I had often made him the [s]ubject of discourse; but a glimp[s]e of his figure in the [s]treet was the [s]um of their knowledge who knew mo[s]t. None had ever [s]een him before, and received as new, the information which my intercour[s]e with him in Valencia, and my pre[s]ent intercour[s]e, enabled me to give.

If he had really made you the object of his court[s]hip, was not a brother authorized to interfere and demand from him the confe[s][s]ion of his views? Yet what were the grounds on which I had reared this [s]uppo[s]ition? Would they ju[s]tify a mea[s]ure like this? Surely not. "In the cour[s]e of my re[s]tle[s]s meditations, it occurred to me, at length, that my duty required me to [s]peak to you, to confe[s]s the indecorum of which I had been guilty, and to [s]tate the reflections to which it had led me. I was prompted by no mean or [s]elfi[s]h views. The heart within my brea[s]t was not more precious than your [s]afety: mo[s]t cheerfully would I have interpo[s]ed my life between you and danger. Would you cheri[s]h re[s]entment at my conduct? When acquainted with the motive which produced it, it would not only exempt me from cen[s]ure, but entitle me to gratitude. "Ye[s]terday had been [s]elected for the rehear[s]al of the newly-imported tragedy. I promi[s]ed to be pre[s]ent. The [s]tate of my thoughts but little qualified me for a performer or auditor in [s]uch a [s]cene; but I reflected that, after it was fini[s]hed, I [s]hould return home with you, and [s]hould then enjoy an opportunity of di[s]cour[s]ing with you fully on this topic. My re[s]olution was not formed without a remnant of doubt, as to its propriety. When I left this hou[s]e to perform the vi[s]it I had promi[s]ed, my mind was full of apprehen[s]ion and de[s]pondency. The dubiou[s]ne[s]s of the event of our conver[s]ation, fear that my interference was too late to [s]ecure your peace, and the uncertainty to which hope gave birth, whether I had not erred in believing you devoted to this man, or, at lea[s]t, in imagining that he had obtained your con[s]ent to midnight conferences, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-166.jpg) \- external link  - Page 157. ] distracted me with contradictory opinions, and repugnant emotions. "I can a[s][s]ign no rea[s]on for calling at Mrs. Baynton's. I had [s]een her in the morning, and knew her to be well. The concerted hour had nearly arrived, and yet I turned up the [s]treet which leads to her hou[s]e, and di[s]mounted at her door. I entered the parlour and threw my[s]elf in a chair. I [s]aw and inquired for no one. My whole frame was overpowered by dreary and comfortle[s]s sensations. One idea po[s][s]e[s][s]ed me wholly; the inexpressible importance of unveiling the de[s]igns and character of Carwin, and the utter improbability that this ever would be effected. Some instinct induced me to lay my hand upon a newspaper. I had peru[s]ed all the general intelligence it contained in the morning, and at the [s]ame [s]pot. The act was rather mechanical than voluntary. "I threw a languid glance at the fir[s]t column that pre[s]ented it[s]elf. The fir[s]t words which I read, began with the offer of a reward of three hundred guineas for the apprehen[s]ion of a convict under [s]entence of death, who had e[s]caped from Newgate pri[s]on in Dublin. Good heaven! how every fibre of my frame tingled when I proceeded to read that the name of the criminal was Francis Carwin! "The de[s]criptions of his per[s]on and addre[s]s were minute. His [s]tature, hair, complexion, the extraordinary po[s]ition and arrangement of his features, his aukward and di[s]proportionate form, his ge[s]ture and gait, corre[s]ponded perfectly with tho[s]e of our my[s]terious vi[s]itant. He had been found guilty in two indictments. One for the murder of the Lady Jane Conway, and the other for a robbery committed on the per[s]on of the honorable Mr. Ludloe. "I repeatedly peru[s]ed this pa[s][s]age. The ideas [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-167.jpg) \- external link  - Page 158. ] which flowed in upon my mind, affected me like an in[s]tant tran[s]ition from death to life. The purpose deare[s]t to my heart was thus effected, at a time and by means the lea[s]t of all others within the [s]cope of my fore[s]ight. But what purpo[s]e? Carwin was detected. Acts of the blacke[s]t and mo[s]t [s]ordid guilt had been committed by him. Here was evidence which imparted to my under[s]tanding the mo[s]t luminous certainty. The name, vi[s]age, and deportment, were the [s]ame. Between the time of his e[s]cape, and his appearance among us, there was a [s]ufficient agreement. Such was the man with whom I [s]u[s]pected you to maintain a clandestine corre[s]pondence. Should I not ha[s]te to [s]natch you from the talons of this vulture? Should I [s]ee you ru[s]hing to the verge of a dizzy precipice, and not [s]tretch forth a hand to pull you back? I had no need to deliberate. I thru[s]t the paper in my pocket, and re[s]olved to obtain an immediate conference with you. For a time, no other image made its way to my under[s]tanding. At length, it occurred to me, that though the information I possessed was, in one [s]en[s]e, [s]ufficient, yet if more could be obtained, more was de[s]irable. This passage was copied from a Briti[s]h paper; part of it only, perhaps, was tran[s]cribed. The printer was in po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of the original. "Towards his hou[s]e I immediately turned my hor[s]e's head. He produced the paper, but I found nothing more than had already been [s]een. While bu[s]y in peru[s]ing it, the printer [s]tood by my [s]ide. He noticed the object of which I was in [s]earch. "Aye," [s]aid he, "that is a [s]trange affair. I [s]hould never have met with it, had not Mr. Hallet [s]ent to me the paper, with a particular reque[s]t to republish that adverti[s]ement." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-168.jpg) \- external link  - Page 159. ] "Mr. Hallet! What rea[s]ons could he have for making this reque[s]t? Had the paper [s]ent to him been accompanied by any information re[s]pecting the convict? Had he per[s]onal or extraordinary rea[s]ons for de[s]iring its republication? This was to be known only in one way. I [s]peeded to his hou[s]e. In an[s]wer to my interrogations, he told me that Ludloe had formerly been in America, and that during his re[s]idence in this city, con[s]iderable intercour[s]e had taken place between them. Hence a confidence aro[s]e, which has [s]ince been kept alive by occa[s]ional letters. He had lately received a letter from him, enclo[s]ing the new[s]paper from which this extract had been made. He put in into my hands, and pointed out the pa[s][s]ages which related to Carwin. "Ludloe confirms the facts of his conviction and e[s]cape; and adds, that he had rea[s]on to believe him to have embarked for America. He de[s]cribes him in general terms, as the mo[s]t incomprehensible and formidable among men; as engaged in [s]chemes, rea[s]onably [s]u[s]pected to be, in the highe[s]t degree, criminal, but [s]uch as no human intelligence is able to unravel: that his ends are pur[s]ued by means which leave it in doubt whether he be not in league with [s]ome infernal [s]pirit: that his crimes have hitherto been perpetrated with the aid of [s]ome unknown but de[s]perate accomplices: that he wages a perpetual war again[s]t the happine[s]s of mankind, and [s]ets his engines of de[s]truction at work again[s]t every object that pre[s]ents it[s]elf. "This is the [s]ub[s]tance of the letter. Hallet expre[s][s]ed [s]ome [s]urprize at the curio[s]ity which was manife[s]ted by me on this occa[s]ion. I was too much ab[s]orbed by the ideas [s]ugge[s]ted by this letter, to pay attention to his remarks. I [s]huddered with the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-169.jpg) \- external link  - Page 160. ] apprehen[s]ion of the evil to which our indi[s]creet familiarity with this man had probably expo[s]ed us. I burnt with impatience to [s]ee you, and to do what in me lay to avert the calamity which threatened us. It was already five o'clock. Night was hastening, and there was no time to be lo[s]t. On leaving Mr. Hallet's hou[s]e, who [s]hould meet me in the [s]treet, but Bertrand, the [s]ervant whom I left in Germany. His appearance and accoutrements bespoke him to have ju[s]t alighted from a toil[s]ome and long journey. I was not wholly without expectation of [s]eeing him about this time, but no one was then more di[s]tant from my thoughts. You know what rea[s]ons I have for anxiety re[s]pecting [s]cenes with which this man was conver[s]ant. Carwin was for a moment forgotten. In an[s]wer to my vehement inquiries, Bertrand produced a copious packet. I [s]hall not at pre[s]ent mention its contents, nor the mea[s]ures which they obliged me to adopt. I bestowed a brief peru[s]al on the[s]e papers, and having given [s]ome directions to Bertrand, re[s]umed my purpose with regard to you. My hor[s]e I was obliged to re[s]ign to my [s]ervant, he being charged with a commi[s][s]ion that required [s]peed. The clock had [s]truck ten, and Mettingen was five miles di[s]tant. I was to journey thither on foot. The[s]e circumstances only added to my expedition. "As I pa[s][s]ed [s]wiftly along, I reviewed all the incidents accompanying the appearance and deportment of that man among us. Late events have been inexplicable and my[s]terious beyond any of which I have either read or heard. The[s]e events were coeval with Carwin's introduction. I am unable to explain their origin and mutual dependance; but I do not, on that account, believe them to have a [s]upernatural original. Is not this man [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-170.jpg) \- external link  - Page 161. ] the agent? Some of them [s]eem to be propitious; but what [s]hould I think of tho[s]e threats of assassination with which you were lately alarmed? Bloodshed is the trade, and horror is the element of this man. The proce[s]s by which the [s]ympathies of nature are extingui[s]hed in our hearts, by which evil is made our good, and by which we are made [s]u[s]ceptible of no activity but in the infliction, and no joy but in the [s]pectacle of woes, is an obvious proce[s]s. As to an alliance with evil geniu[s]es, the power and the malice of daemons have been a thousand times exemplified in human beings. There are no devils but tho[s]e which are begotten upon selfishness, and reared by cunning. "Now, indeed, the [s]cene was changed. It was not his [s]ecret poniard that I dreaded. It was only the [s]ucce[s]s of his efforts to make you a confederate in your own de[s]truction, to make your will the in[s]trument by which he might bereave you of liberty and honor. "I took, as u[s]ual, the path through your brother's ground. I ranged with celerity and [s]ilence along the bank. I approached the [s]ence, which divides Wieland's e[s]tate from yours. The rece[s]s in the bank being near this line, it being nece[s][s]ary for me to pa[s]s near it, my mind being tainted with inveterate [s]u[s]picions concerning you; [s]u[s]picions which were indebted for their [s]trength to incidents connected with this [s]pot; what wonder that it [s]eized upon my thoughts! "I leaped on the fence; but before I de[s]cended on the oppo[s]ite [s]ide, I pau[s]ed to [s]urvey the [s]cene. Leaves dropping with dew, and gli[s]tening in the moon's rays, with no moving object to mole[s]t the deep repo[s]e, filled me with [s]ecurity and hope. I left the [s]tation at length, and tended forward. You [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-171.jpg) \- external link  - Page 162. ] were probably at re[s]t. How [s]hould I communicate without alarming you, the intelligence of my arrival? An immediate interview was to be procured. I could not bear to think that a minute [s]hould be lo[s]t by remi[s][s]ne[s]s or he[s]itation. Should I knock at the door? or [s]hould I [s]tand under your chamber windows, which I perceived to be open, and awaken you by my calls? "The[s]e reflections employed me, as I pa[s][s]ed oppo[s]ite to the [s]ummer-hou[s]e. I had [s]carcely gone by, when my ear caught a [s]ound unu[s]ual at this time and place. It was almo[s]t too [s]aint and too tran[s]ient to allow me a di[s]tinct perception of it. I [s]topped to li[s]ten; pre[s]ently it was heard again, and now it was [s]omewhat in a louder key. It was laughter; and unque[s]tionably produced by a female voice. That voice was familiar to my [s]en[s]es. It was yours. "Whence it came, I was at fir[s]t at a lo[s]s to conjecture; but this uncertainty vani[s]hed when it was heard the third time. I threw back my eyes towards the rece[s]s. Every other organ and limb was u[s]ele[s]s to me. I did not rea[s]on on the [s]ubject. I did not, in a direct manner, draw my conclu[s]ions from the hour, the place, the hilarity which this [s]ound betokened, and the circum[s]tance of having a companion, which it no le[s]s inconte[s]tably proved. In an in[s]tant, as it were, my heart was invaded with cold, and the pul[s]es of life at a [s]tand. "Why [s]hould I go further? Why [s]hould I return? Should I not hurry to a di[s]tance from a [s]ound, which, though formerly [s]o [s]weet and delectable, was now more hideous than the [s]hrieks of owls? "I had no time to yield to this impul[s]e. The thought of approaching and li[s]tening occurred to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-172.jpg) \- external link  - Page 163. ] me. I had no doubt of which I was con[s]cious. Yet my certainty was capable of increa[s]e. I was likewi[s]e [s]timulated by a [s]entiment that partook of rage. I was governed by an half-formed and tempestuous re[s]olution to break in upon your interview, and [s]trike you dead with my upbraiding. "I approached with the utmo[s]t caution. When I reached the edge of the bank immediately above the [s]ummer-hou[s]e, I thought I heard voices from below, as bu[s]y in conver[s]ation. The [s]teps in the rock are clear of bu[s]hy impediments. They allowed me to de[s]cend into a cavity be[s]ide the building without being detected. Thus to lie in wait could only be ju[s]tified by the momentou[s]ne[s]s of the occa[s]ion." Here Pleyel pau[s]ed in his narrative, and fixed his eyes upon me. Situated as I was, my horror and a[s]toni[s]hment at this tale gave way to compassion for the angui[s]h which the countenance of my friend betrayed. I reflected on his force of understanding. I reflected on the powers of my enemy. I could ea[s]ily divine the [s]ub[s]tance of the conversation that was overheard. Carwin had con[s]tructed his plot in a manner [s]uited to the characters of tho[s]e whom he had [s]elected for his victims. I [s]aw that the convictions of Pleyel were immutable. I forbore to [s]truggle again[s]t the [s]torm, becau[s]e I [s]aw that all [s]truggles would be fruitle[s]s. I was calm; but my calmne[s]s was the torpor of de[s]pair, and not the tranquillity of fortitude. It was calmne[s]s invincible by any thing that his grief and his fury could [s]ugge[s]t to Pleyel. He re[s]umed--- "Woman! wilt thou hear me further? Shall I go on to repeat the conver[s]ation? Is it [s]hame that makes thee tongue-tied? Shall I go on? or art thou [s]atisfied with what has been already [s]aid?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-173.jpg) \- external link  - Page 164. ] I bowed my head. "Go on," [s]aid I. "I make not this reque[s]t in the hope of undeceiving you. I [s]hall no longer contend with my own weakne[s]s. The [s]torm is let loo[s]e, and I [s]hall peaceably [s]ubmit to be driven by its fury. But go on. This conference will end only with affording me a clearer fore[s]ight of my de[s]tiny; but that will be [s]ome satisfaction, and I will not part without it." Why, on hearing the[s]e words, did Pleyel hesitate? Did [s]ome unlooked-for doubt in[s]inuate it[s]elf into his mind? Was his belief [s]uddenly [s]haken by my looks, or my words, or by [s]ome newly recollected circum[s]tance? Whence[s]oever it aro[s]e, it could not endure the te[s]t of deliberation. In a few minutes the flame of re[s]entment was again lighted up in his bo[s]om. He proceeded with his accustomed vehemence--- "I hate my[s]elf for this folly. I can find no apology for this tale. Yet I am irre[s]i[s]tibly impelled to relate it. She that hears me is apprized of every particular. I have only to repeat to her her own words. She will li[s]ten with a tranquil air, and the [s]pectacle of her obduracy will drive me to [s]ome de[s]perate act. Why then [s]hould I per[s]i[s]t! yet per[s]i[s]t I mu[s]t." Again he pau[s]ed. "No," [s]aid he, "it is impossible to repeat your avowals of love, your appeals to former confe[s][s]ions of your tenderne[s]s, to former deeds of di[s]honor, to the circum[s]tances of the fir[s]t interview that took place between you. It was on that night when I traced you to this recess. Thither had he enticed you, and there had you ratified an unhallowed compact by admitting him--- "Great God! Thou witne[s][s]ed[s]t the agonies that tore my bo[s]om at that moment! Thou [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-174.jpg) \- external link  - Page 165. ] witnessedst my efforts to repel the te[s]timony of my ears! It was in vain that you dwelt upon the confusion which my unlooked-for [s]ummons excited in you; the tardine[s]s with which a [s]uitable excu[s]e occurred to you; your re[s]entment that my impertinent intru[s]ion had put an end to that charming interview: A di[s]appointment for which you endeavoured to compen[s]ate your[s]elf, by the frequency and duration of [s]ub[s]equent meetings. "In vain you dwelt upon incidents of which you only could be con[s]cious; incidents that occurred on occa[s]ions on which none be[s]ide your own family were witne[s][s]es. In vain was your di[s]cour[s]e characterized by peculiarities inimitable of [s]entiment and language. My conviction was effected only by an accumulation of the [s]ame tokens. I yielded not but to evidence which took away the power to withhold my faith. "My [s]ight was of no u[s]e to me. Beneath [s]o thick an umbrage, the darkne[s]s was inten[s]e. Hearing was the only avenue to information, which the circum[s]tances allowed to be open. I was couched within three feet of you. Why [s]hould I approach nearer? I could not contend with your betrayer. What could be the purpo[s]e of a conte[s]t? You [s]tood in no need of a protector. What could I do, but retire from the [s]pot overwhelmed with confusion and di[s]may? I [s]ought my chamber, and endeavoured to regain my compo[s]ure. The door of the hou[s]e, which I found open, your [s]ub[s]equent entrance, clo[s]ing, and [s]a[s]tening it, and going into your chamber, which had been thus long de[s]erted, were only confirmations of the truth. "Why [s]hould I paint the tempe[s]tuous fluctuation of my thoughts between grief and revenge, between rage and de[s]pair? Why [s]hould I repeat my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-175.jpg) \- external link  - Page 166. ] vows of eternal implacability and per[s]ecution, and the [s]peedy recantation of the[s]e vows? "I have [s]aid enough. You have di[s]mi[s][s]ed me from a place in your e[s]teem. What I think, and what I feel, is of no importance in your eyes. May the duty which I owe my[s]elf enable me to forget your exi[s]tence. In a few minutes I go hence. Be the maker of your fortune, and may adver[s]ity in[s]truct you in that wi[s]dom, which education was unable to impart to you." Tho[s]e were the la[s]t words which Pleyel uttered. He left the room, and my new emotions enabled me to witne[s]s his departure without any apparent lo[s]s of compo[s]ure. As I [s]at alone, I ruminated on the[s]e incidents. Nothing was more evident than that I had taken an eternal leave of happine[s]s. Life was a worthle[s]s thing, [s]eparate from that good which had now been wre[s]ted from me; yet the sentimen: that now po[s][s]e[s][s]ed me had no tendency to pal[s]y my exertions, and overbear my [s]trength. I noticed that the light was declining, and perceived the propriety of leaving this hou[s]e. I placed myself again in the chai[s]e, and returned [s]lowly towards the city. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-176.jpg) \- external link  - Page 167. ] Before I reached the city it was du[s]k. It was my purpo[s]e to [s]pend the night at Mettingen. I was not [s]olicitous, as long as I was attended by a faithful [s]ervant, to be there at an early hour. My exhau[s]ted [s]trength required me to take [s]ome refreshment. With this view, and in order to pay re[s]pect to one who[s]e affection for me was truly maternal, I [s]topped at Mrs. Baynton's. She was ab[s]ent from home; but I had [s]carcely entered the hou[s]e when one of her dome[s]tics pre[s]ented me a letter. I opened and read as follows: "To Clara Wieland, "What [s]hall I [s]ay to extenuate the mi[s]conduct of la[s]t night? It is my duty to repair it to the utmo[s]t of my power, but the only way in which it can be repaired, you will not, I fear, be prevailed on to adopt. It is by granting me an interview, at your own hou[s]e, at eleven o'clock this night. I have no means of removing any fears that you may entertain of my de[s]igns, but my [s]imple and [s]olemn declarations. The[s]e, after what has pa[s][s]ed between us, you may deem unworthy of confidence. I cannot help it. My folly and ra[s]hne[s]s has left me no other re[s]ource. I will be at your door by that hour. If you chu[s]e to admit me to a conference, provided that conference has no witne[s][s]es, I will disclose to you particulars, the knowledge of which is of the utmo[s]t importance to your happine[s]s. Farewell. CAR WIN." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-177.jpg) \- external link  - Page 168. ] What a letter was this! A man known to be an a[s][s]a[s][s]in and robber; one capable of plotting again[s]t my life and my fame; detected lurking in my chamber, and avowing de[s]igns the mo[s]t flagitious and dreadful, now [s]olicits me to grant him a midnight interview! To admit him alone into my presence! Could he make this reque[s]t with the expectation of my compliance? What had he [s]een in me, that could ju[s]tify him in admitting [s]o wild a belief? Yet this reque[s]t is preferred with the utmo[s]t gravity. It is not accompanied by an appearance of uncommon earne[s]tne[s]s. Had the mi[s]conduct to which he alludes been a [s]light incivility, and the interview reque[s]ted to take place in the mid[s]t of my friends, there would have been no extravagance in the tenor of this letter; but, as it was, the writer had [s]urely been bere[s]t of his rea[s]on. I peru[s]ed this epi[s]tle frequently. The reque[s]t it contained might be called audacious or [s]tupid, if it had been made by a different per[s]on; but from Carwin, who could not be unaware of the effect which it mu[s]t naturally produce, and of the manner in which it would unavoidably be treated, it was perfectly inexplicable. He mu[s]t have counted on the [s]ucce[s]s of [s]ome plot, in order to extort my a[s][s]ent. None of tho[s]e motives by which I am u[s]ually governed would ever have per[s]uaded me to meet any one of his [s]ex, at the time and place which he had pre[s]cribed. Much le[s]s would I consent to a meeting with a man, tainted with the mo[s]t dete[s]table crimes, and by who[s]e arts my own [s]afety had been [s]o imminently endangered, and my happiness irretrievably de[s]troyed. I [s]huddered at the idea that [s]uch a meeting was po[s][s]ible. I felt [s]ome reluctance to approach a [s]pot which he [s]till vi[s]ited and haunted. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-178.jpg) \- external link  - Page 169. ] Such were the ideas which fir[s]t [s]ugge[s]ted themselves on the peru[s]al of the letter. Meanwhile, I re[s]umed my journey. My thoughts [s]till dwelt upon the [s]ame topic. Gradually from ruminating on this epi[s]tle, I reverted to my interview with Pleyel. I recalled the particulars of the dialogue to which he had been an auditor. My heart [s]unk anew on viewing the inextricable complexity of this deception, and the inau[s]picious concurrence of events, which tended to confirm him in his error. When he approached my chamber door, my terror kept me mute. He put his ear, perhaps, to the crevice, but it caught the [s]ound of nothing human. Had I called, or made any token that denoted [s]ome one to be within, words would have en[s]ued; and as omnipresence was impo[s][s]ible, this di[s]covery, and the artless narrative of what had ju[s]t pa[s][s]ed, would have [s]aved me from his murderous invectives. He went into his chamber, and after [s]ome interval, I [s]tole acro[s]s the entry and down the [s]tairs, with inaudible [s]teps. Having [s]ecured the outer doors, I returned with le[s]s circum[s]pection. He heard me not when I de[s]cended; but my returning [s]teps were ea[s]ily distinguished. Now he thought was the guilty interview at an end. In what other way was it po[s][s]ible for him to con[s]true the[s]e [s]ignals? How fallacious and precipitate was my deci[s]ion! Carwin's plot owed its [s]ucce[s]s to a coincidence of events [s]carcely credible. The balance was [s]wayed from its equipoi[s]e by a hair. Had I even begun the conver[s]ation with an account of what be[s]el me in my chamber, my previous interview with Wieland would have taught him to [s]u[s]pect me of imposture; yet, if I were di[s]cour[s]ing with this ruffian, when Pleyel touched the lock of my chamber door, and when he [s]hut his own door with [s]o much [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-179.jpg) \- external link  - Page 170. ] violence, how, he might a[s]k, [s]hould I be able to relate the[s]e incidents? Perhaps he had withheld the knowledge of the[s]e circum[s]tances from my brother, from whom, therefore, I could not obtain it, [s]o that my innocence would have thus been irre[s]i[s]tibly demonstrated. The fir[s]t impul[s]e which flowed from the[s]e ideas was to return upon my [s]teps, and demand once more an interview; but he was gone: his parting declarations were remembered. Pleyel, I exclaimed, thou art gone for ever! Are thy mi[s]takes beyond the reach of detection? Am I helple[s]s in the mid[s]t of this [s]nare? The plotter is at hand. He even [s]peaks in the [s]tyle of penitence. He [s]olicits an interview which he promi[s]es [s]hall end in the di[s]clo[s]ure of [s]omething momentous to my happine[s]s. What can he [s]ay which will avail to turn a[s]ide this evil? But why [s]hould his remor[s]e be feigned? I have done him no injury. His wickedne[s]s is fertile only of de[s]pair; and the billows of remor[s]e will [s]ome time overbear him. Why may not this event have already taken place? Why [s]hould I refu[s]e to [s]ee him? This idea was pre[s]ent, as it were, for a moment. I [s]uddenly recoiled from it, con[s]ounded at that frenzy which could give even momentary harbour to [s]uch a [s]cheme; yet pre[s]ently it returned. A length I even conceived it to de[s]erve deliberation. I que[s]tioned whether it was not proper to admit, at a lonely [s]pot, in a [s]acred hour, this man of tremendous and in[s]crutable attributes, this performer of horrid deeds, and who[s]e pre[s]ence was predicted to call down unheard-of and unutterable horrors. What was it that [s]wayed me? I [s]elt my[s]elf divested of the power to will contrary to the motives that determined me to [s]eek his pre[s]ence. My mind [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-180.jpg) \- external link  - Page 171. ] [s]eemed to be [s]plit into [s]eparate parts, and the[s]e parts to have entered into [s]urious and implacable contention. The[s]e tumults gradually [s]ub[s]ided. The rea[s]ons why I [s]hould con[s]ide in that interposition which had hitherto defended me; in tho[s]e tokens of compunction which this letter contained; in the efficacy of this interview to re[s]tore its spotlessness to my character, and bani[s]h all illu[s]ions from the mind of my friend, continually acquired new evidence and new [s]trength. What [s]hould I fear in his pre[s]ence? This was unlike an artifice intended to betray me into his hands. If it were an artifice, what purpo[s]e would it [s]erve? The freedom of my mind was untouched, and that freedom would de[s]y the a[s][s]aults of blandi[s]hments or magic. Force was I not able to repel. On the former occa[s]ion my courage, it is true, had failed at the imminent approach of danger; but then I had not enjoyed opportunities of deliberation; I had fore[s]een nothing; I was [s]unk into imbecility by my previous thoughts; I had been the victim of recent di[s]appointments and anticipated ills: Witne[s]s my infatuation in opening the clo[s]et in oppo[s]ition to divine injunctions. Now, perhaps, my courage was the offspring of a no le[s]s erring principle. Pleyel was for ever lo[s]t to me. I [s]trove in vain to a[s][s]ume his per[s]on, and [s]uppre[s]s my re[s]entment; I [s]trove in vain to believe in the a[s][s]uaging influence of time, to look forward to the birth-day of new hopes, and the reexaltation of that luminary, of who[s]e effulgencies I had [s]o long and [s]o liberally partaken. What had I to [s]uffer wor[s]e than was already inflicted? Was not Carwin my [s]oe? I owed my untimely [s]ate to his trea[s]on. In[s]tead of flying from his [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-181.jpg) \- external link  - Page 172. ] presence, ought I not to devote all my faculties to the gaining of an interview, and compel him to repair the ills of which he has been the author? Why [s]hould I [s]uppo[s]e him impregnable to argument? Have I not rea[s]on on my [s]ide, and the power of imparting conviction? Cannot he be made to [s]ee the ju[s]tice of unravelling the maze in which Pleyel is bewildered? He may, at lea[s]t, be acce[s][s]ible to fear. Has he nothing to fear from the rage of an injured woman? But [s]uppo[s]e him inacce[s][s]ible to [s]uch inducements; [s]uppo[s]e him to per[s]i[s]t in all his flagitious purposes; are not the means of defence and re[s]i[s]tance in my power? In the progre[s]s of [s]uch thoughts, was the resolution at la[s]t formed. I hoped that the interview was [s]ought by him for a laudable end; but, be that as it would, I tru[s]ted that, by energy of rea[s]oning or of action, I [s]hould render it au[s]picious, or, at lea[s]t, harmle[s]s. Such a determination mu[s]t unavoidably fluctuate. The poet's chaos was no unapt emblem of the [s]tate of my mind. A torment was awakened in my bo[s]om, which I fore[s]aw would end only when this interview was pa[s]t, and its con[s]equences fully experienced. Hence my impatience for the arrival of the hour which had been pre[s]cribed by Carwin. Meanwhile, my meditations were tumultuou[s]ly active. New impediments to the execution of the [s]cheme were [s]peedily [s]ugge[s]ted. I had apprized Catharine of my intention to [s]pend this and many future nights with her. Her hu[s]band was informed of this arrangement, and had zealou[s]ly approved it. Eleven o'clock exceeded their hour of retiring. What excu[s]e [s]hould I form for changing my plan? Should I [s]hew this letter to Wieland, and [s]ubmit [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-182.jpg) \- external link  - Page 173. ] my[s]elf to his direction? But I knew in what way he would decide. He would [s]ervently di[s][s]uade me from going. Nay, would he not do more? He was apprized of the offences of Carwin, and of the reward offered for his apprehen[s]ion. Would he not [s]eize this opportunity of executing ju[s]tice on a criminal? This idea was new. I was plunged once more into doubt. Did not equity enjoin me thus to facilitate his arre[s]t? No. I di[s]dained the office of betrayer. Carwin was unapprized of his danger, and his intentions were po[s][s]ibly beneficent. Should I [s]tation guards about the hou[s]e, and make an act, intended perhaps for my benefit, in[s]trumental to his own de[s]truction? Wieland might be ju[s]tified in thus employing the knowledge which I [s]hould impart, but I, by imparting it, [s]hould pollute my[s]elf with more hateful crimes than tho[s]e unde[s]ervedly imputed to me. This [s]cheme, therefore, I unhesitatingly rejected. The views with which I [s]hould return to my own hou[s]e, it would therefore be necessary to conceal. Yet [s]ome pretext mu[s]t be invented. I had never been initiated into the trade of lying. Yet what but fal[s]hood was a deliberate [s]uppre[s][s]ion of the truth? To deceive by [s]ilence or by words is the [s]ame. Yet what would a lie avail me? What pretext would ju[s]tify this change in my plan? Would it not tend to confirm the imputations of Pleyel? That I [s]hould voluntarily return to an hou[s]e in which honor and life had [s]o lately been endangered, could be explained in no way favorable to my integrity. The[s]e reflections, if they did not change, at lea[s]t [s]u[s]pended my deci[s]ion. In this [s]tate of uncertainty I alighted at the hut . We gave this name to the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-183.jpg) \- external link  - Page 174. ] hou[s]e tenanted by the farmer and his [s]ervants, and which was [s]ituated on the verge of my brother's ground, and at a con[s]iderable di[s]tance from the mansion. The path to the man[s]ion was planted by a double row of walnuts. Along this path I proceeded alone. I entered the parlour, in which was a light ju[s]t expiring in the [s]ocket. There was no one in the room. I perceived by the clock that [s]tood again[s]t the wall, that it was near eleven. The latene[s]s of the hour [s]tartled me. What had become of the family? They were u[s]ually retired an hour before this; but the unextingui[s]hed taper, and the unbarred door were indications that they had not retired. I again returned to the hall, and pa[s][s]ed from one room to another, but [s]till encountered not a human being. I imagined that, perhaps, the lap[s]e of a few minutes would explain the[s]e appearances. Meanwhile I reflected that the preconcerted hour had arrived. Carwin was perhaps waiting my approach. Should I immediately retire to my own hou[s]e, no one would be apprized of my proceeding. Nay, the interview might pa[s]s, and I be enabled to return in half an hour. Hence no nece[s][s]ity would ari[s]e for di[s][s]imulation. I was [s]o far influenced by the[s]e views that I ro[s]e to execute this de[s]ign; but again the unu[s]ual condition of the hou[s]e occurred to me, and [s]ome vague [s]olicitude as to the condition of the family. I was nearly certain that my brother had not retired; but by what motives he could be induced to de[s]ert his hou[s]e thus un[s]ea[s]onably, I could by no means divine. Loui[s]a Conway, at lea[s]t, was at home, and had, probably, retired to her chamber; perhaps [s]he was able to impart the information I wanted. I went to her chamber, and found her a[s]leep. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-184.jpg) \- external link  - Page 175. ] She was delighted and [s]urprized at my arrival, and told me with how much impatience and anxiety my brother and his wife had waited my coming. They were fearful that [s]ome mi[s]hap had befallen me, and had remained up longer than the u[s]ual period. Notwith[s]tanding the latene[s]s of the hour, Catharine would not re[s]ign the hope of [s]eeing me. Loui[s]a [s]aid [s]he had left them both in the parlour, and [s]he knew of no cau[s]e for their ab[s]ence. As yet I was not without [s]olicitude on account of their per[s]onal [s]afety. I was far from being perfectly at ea[s]e on that head, but entertained no distinct conception of the danger that impended over them. Perhaps to beguile the moments of my long protracted [s]tay, they had gone to walk upon the bank. The atmo[s]phere, though illuminated only by the [s]tar-light, was remarkably [s]erene. Meanwhile the de[s]ireablene[s]s of an interview with Carwin again returned, and I finally re[s]olved to [s]eek it. I pa[s][s]ed with doubting and ha[s]ty [s]teps along the path. My dwelling, [s]een at a di[s]tance, was gloomy and de[s]olate. It had no inhabitant, for my [s]ervant, in con[s]equence of my new arrangement, had gone to Mettingen. The temerity of this attempt began to [s]hew it[s]elf in more vivid colours to my understanding. Whoever has pointed [s]teel is not without arms; yet what mu[s]t have been the [s]tate of my mind when I could meditate, without [s]huddering, on the u[s]e of a murderous weapon, and believe myself [s]ecure merely becau[s]e I was capable of being made [s]o by the death of another? Yet this was not my [s]tate. I felt as if I was ru[s]hing into deadly toils, without the power of pau[s]ing or receding. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-185.jpg) \- external link  - Page 176. ] As [s]oon as I arrived in [s]ight of the front of the hou[s]e, my attention was excited by a light from the window of my own chamber. No appearance could be le[s]s explicable. A meeting was expected with Carwin, but that he pre-occupied my chamber, and had [s]upplied him[s]elf with light, was not to be believed. What motive could influence him to adopt this conduct? Could I proceed until this was explained? Perhaps, if I [s]hould proceed to a di[s]tance in front, [s]ome one would be vi[s]ible. A [s]idelong but seeble beam from the window, fell upon the piny cop[s]e which [s]kirted the bank. As I eyed it, it [s]uddenly became mutable, and after flitting to and fro, for a [s]hort time, it vani[s]hed. I turned my eye again toward the window, and perceived that the light was [s]till there; but the change which I had noticed was occa[s]ioned by a change in the po[s]ition of the lamp or candle within. Hence, that [s]ome per[s]on was there was an unavoidable inference. I pau[s]ed to deliberate on the propriety of advancing. Might I not advance cautiou[s]ly, and, therefore, without danger? Might I not knock at the door, or call, and be apprized of the nature of my vi[s]itant before I entered? I approached and li[s]tened at the door, but could hear nothing. I knocked at fir[s]t timidly, but afterwards with loudness. My [s]ignals were unnoticed. I [s]tepped back and looked, but the light was no longer di[s]cernible. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-186.jpg) \- external link  - Page 177. ] Was it [s]uddenly extingui[s]hed by a human agent? What purpo[s]e but concealment was intended? Why was the illumination produced, to be thus [s]uddenly brought to an end? And why, [s]ince [s]ome one was there, had [s]ilence been ob[s]erved? The[s]e were que[s]tions, the [s]olution of which may be readily [s]uppo[s]ed to be entangled with danger. Would not this danger, when mea[s]ured by a woman's fears, expand into gigantic dimen[s]ions? Menaces of death; the [s]tunning exertions of a warning voice; the known and unknown attributes of Carwin; our recent interview in this chamber; the pre-appointment of a meeting at this place and hour, all thronged into my memory. What was to be done? Courage is no definite or [s]tedfa[s]t principle. Let that man who [s]hall purpo[s]e to a[s][s]ign motives to the actions of another, blu[s]h at his folly and forbear. Not more pre[s]umptuous would it be to attempt the cla[s][s]ification of all nature, and the [s]canning of supreme intelligence. I gazed for a minute at the window, and fixed my eyes, for a [s]econd minute, on the ground. I drew forth from my pocket, and opened, a penknife. This, [s]aid I, be my [s]afe-guard and avenger. The a[s][s]ailant [s]hall peri[s]h, or my[s]elf [s]hall fall. I had locked up the hou[s]e in the morning, but had the key of the kitchen door in my pocket. I, therefore, determined to gain acce[s]s behind. Thither I ha[s]tened, unlocked and entered. All was lonely, dark[s]ome, and wa[s]te. Familiar as I was with every part of my dwelling, I ea[s]ily found my way to a clo[s]et, drew forth a taper, a flint, tinder, and [s]teel, and, in a moment as it were, gave my[s]elf the guidance and protection of light. What purpo[s]e did I meditate? Should I explore [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-187.jpg) \- external link  - Page 178. ] my way to my chamber, and confront the being who had dared to intrude into this rece[s]s, and had laboured for concealment? By putting out the light did he [s]eek to hide him[s]elf, or mean only to circumvent my incautious [s]teps? Yet was it not more probable that he de[s]ired my ab[s]ence by thus encouraging the [s]uppo[s]ition that the hou[s]e was unoccupied? I would [s]ee this man in [s]pite of all impediments; ere I died, I would [s]ee his face, and [s]ummon him to penitence and retribution; no matter at what co[s]t an interview was purcha[s]ed. Reputation and life might be wre[s]ted from me by another, but my rectitude and honor were in my own keeping, and were [s]afe. I proceeded to the foot of the [s]tairs. At [s]uch a cri[s]is my thoughts may be [s]uppo[s]ed at no liberty to range; yet vague images ru[s]hed into my mind, of the my[s]terious interpo[s]ition which had been experienced on the la[s]t night. My ca[s]e, at pre[s]ent, was not di[s][s]imilar; and, if my angel were not weary of fruitle[s]s exertions to [s]ave, might not a new warning be expected? Who could [s]ay whether his [s]ilence were a[s]cribable to the ab[s]ence of danger, or to his own ab[s]ence? In this [s]tate of mind, no wonder that a [s]hivering cold crept through my veins; that my pau[s]e was prolonged; and, that a fearful glance was thrown backward. Alas! my heart droops, and my fingers are enervated; my ideas are vivid, but my language is faint; now know I what it is to entertain incommunicable [s]entiments. The chain of [s]ub[s]equent incidents is drawn through my mind, and being linked with tho[s]e which forewent, by turns rou[s]e up agonies and [s]ink me into hopele[s][s]ne[s]s. Yet I will per[s]i[s]t to the end. My narrative may [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-188.jpg) \- external link  - Page 179. ] be invaded by inaccuracy and confu[s]ion; but if I live no longer, I will, at lea[s]t, live to complete it. What but ambiguities, abruptne[s][s]es, and dark transitions, can be expected from the hi[s]torian who is, at the [s]ame time, the [s]ufferer of the[s]e di[s]a[s]ters? I have [s]aid that I ca[s]t a look behind. Some object was expected to be [s]een, or why [s]hould I have gazed in that direction? Two [s]en[s]es were at once a[s][s]ailed. The [s]ame piercing exclamation of hold! hold!  was uttered within the [s]ame di[s]tance of my ear. This it was that I heard. The airy undulation, and the [s]hock given to my nerves, were real. Whether the [s]pectacle which I beheld exi[s]ted in my fancy or without, might be doubted. I had not clo[s]ed the door of the apartment I had ju[s]t left. The [s]tair-ca[s]e, at the foot of which I [s]tood, was eight or ten feet from the door, and attached to the wall through which the door led. My view, therefore, was [s]idelong, and took in no part of the room. Through this aperture was an head thru[s]t and drawn back with [s]o much [s]wiftne[s]s, that the immediate conviction was, that thus much of a form, ordinarily invi[s]ible, had been un[s]hrowded. The face was turned towards me. Every mu[s]cle was ten[s]e; the forehead and brows were drawn into vehement expre[s][s]ion; the lips were [s]tretched as in the act of [s]hrieking, and the eyes emitted [s]parks, which, no doubt, if I had been unattended by a light, would have illuminated like the corru[s]cations of a meteor. The [s]ound and the vi[s]ion were present, and departed together at the [s]ame in[s]tant; but the cry was blown into my ear, while the face was many paces di[s]tant. This face was well [s]uited to a being who[s]e performances exceeded the [s]tandard of humanity, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-189.jpg) \- external link  - Page 180. ] yet its features were akin to tho[s]e I had before [s]een. The image of Carwin was blended in a thou[s]and ways with the [s]tream of my thoughts. This vi[s]age was, perhaps, pourtrayed by my fancy. If [s]o, it will excite no [s]urprize that [s]ome of his lineaments were now di[s]covered. Yet affinities were few and uncon[s]picuous, and were lo[s]t amid[s]t the blaze of oppo[s]ite qualities. What conclu[s]ion could I form? Be the face human or not, the intimation was imparted from above. Experience had evinced the benignity of that being who gave it. Once he had interpo[s]ed to [s]hield me from harm, and [s]ub[s]equent events demonstrated the u[s]efulne[s]s of that interpo[s]ition. Now was I again warned to forbear. I was hurrying to the verge of the [s]ame gulf, and the [s]ame power was exerted to recall my [s]teps. Was it possible for me not to obey? Was I capable of holding on in the [s]ame perilous career? Yes. Even of this I was capable! The intimation was imperfect: it gave no form to my danger, and pre[s]cribed no limits to my caution. I had formerly neglected it, and yet e[s]caped. Might I not tru[s]t to the [s]ame i[s][s]ue? This idea might po[s][s]e[s]s, though imperceptibly, [s]ome influence. I per[s]i[s]ted; but it was not merely on this account. I cannot delineate the motives that led me on. I now [s]peak as if no remnant of doubt exi[s]ted in my mind as to the [s]upernal origin of the[s]e sounds; but this is owing to the imperfection of my language, for I only mean that the belief was more permanent, and vi[s]ited more frequently my [s]ober meditations than its oppo[s]ite. The immediate effects [s]erved only to undermine the foundations of my judgment and precipitate my re[s]olutions. I mu[s]t either advance or return. I cho[s]e the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-190.jpg) \- external link  - Page 181. ] former, and began to a[s]cend the [s]tairs. The [s]ilence underwent no [s]econd interruption. My chamber door was clo[s]ed, but unlocked, and, aided by vehement efforts of my courage, I opened and looked in. No hideous or uncommon object was di[s]cernible. The danger, indeed, might ea[s]ily have lurked out of [s]ight, have [s]prung upon me as I entered, and have rent me with his iron talons; but I was blind to this fate, and advanced, though cautiou[s]ly, into the room. Still every thing wore its accu[s]tomed a[s]pect. Neither lamp nor candle was to be found. Now, for the fir[s]t time, [s]u[s]picions were [s]ugge[s]ted as to the nature of the light which I had [s]een. Was it po[s][s]ible to have been the companion of that supernatural vi[s]age; a meteorous re[s]ulgence producible at the will of him to whom that vi[s]age belonged, and partaking of the nature of that which accompanied my father's death? The clo[s]et was near, and I remembered the complicated horrors of which it had been productive. Here, perhaps, was inclo[s]ed the [s]ource of my peril, and the gratification of my curio[s]ity. Should I adventure once more to explore its rece[s][s]es? This was a re[s]olution not ea[s]ily formed. I was suspended in thought: when glancing my eye on a table, I perceived a written paper. Carwin's hand was in[s]tantly recognized, and [s]natching up the paper, I read as follows:--- "There was folly in expecting your compliance with my invitation. Judge how I was disappointed in finding another in your place. I have waited, but to wait any longer would be perilous. I [s]hall [s]till [s]eek an interview, but it mu[s]t be at a different time and place: meanwhile, I will write this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-191.jpg) \- external link  - Page 182. ] \---How will you bear---How inexplicable will be this tran[s]action!---An event [s]o unexpected---a [s]ight [s]o horrible!" Such was this abrupt and un[s]atisfactory [s]cript. The ink was yet moi[s]t, the hand was that of Carwin. Hence it was to be inferred that he had this moment left the apartment, or was [s]till in it. I looked back, on the [s]udden expectation of [s]eeing him behind me. What other did he mean? What tran[s]action had taken place adver[s]e to my expectations? What [s]ight was about to be exhibited? I looked around me once more, but [s]aw nothing which indicated [s]trangene[s]s. Again I remembered the clo[s]et, and was re[s]olved to [s]eek in that the [s]olution of the[s]e my[s]teries. Here, perhaps, was inclo[s]ed the [s]cene de[s]tined to awaken my horrors and baffle my fore[s]ight. I have already [s]aid, that the entrance into this clo[s]et was be[s]ide my bed, which, on two [s]ides, was clo[s]ely [s]hrowded by curtains. On that [s]ide neare[s]t the clo[s]et, the curtain was rai[s]ed. As I pa[s][s]ed along I ca[s]t my eye thither. I [s]tarted, and looked again. I bore a light in my hand, and brought it nearer my eyes, in order to di[s]pel any illu[s]ive mi[s]ts that might have hovered before them. Once more I fixed my eyes upon the bed, in hope that this more [s]tedfa[s]t [s]crutiny would annihilate the object which before [s]eemed to be there. This then was the [s]ight which Carwin had predicted! This was the event which my understanding was to find inexplicable! This was the fate which had been re[s]erved for me, but which, by [s]ome untoward chance, had befallen on another! I had not been terrified by empty menaces. Violation and death awaited my entrance into this [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-192.jpg) \- external link  - Page 183. ] chamber. Some in[s]crutable chance had led her hither before me, and the mercile[s]s fangs of which I was de[s]igned to be the prey, had mi[s]taken their victim, and had fixed them[s]elves in her heart. But where was my [s]afety? Was the mi[s]chief exhau[s]ted or flown? The [s]teps of the a[s][s]a[s][s]in had ju[s]t been here; they could not be far off; in a moment he would ru[s]h into my pre[s]ence, and I [s]hould peri[s]h under the [s]ame polluting and [s]uffocating gra[s]p! My frame [s]hook, and my knees were unable to [s]upport me. I gazed alternately at the clo[s]et door and at the door of my room. At one of the[s]e avenues would enter the exterminator of my honor and my life. I was prepared for defence; but now that danger was imminent, my means of defence, and my power to u[s]e them were gone. I was not qualified, by education and experience, to encounter perils like the[s]e: or, perhaps, I was powerle[s]s becau[s]e I was again a[s][s]aulted by [s]urprize, and had not fortified my mind by fore[s]ight and previous reflection again[s]t a [s]cene like this. Fears for my own [s]afety again yielded place to reflections on the [s]cene before me. I fixed my eyes upon her countenance. My [s]i[s]ter's well-known and beloved features could not be concealed by convul[s]ion or lividne[s]s. What direful illu[s]ion led thee hither? Berest of thee, what hold on happiness remains to thy offspring and thy [s]pou[s]e? To lo[s]e thee by a common fate would have been sufficiently hard; but thus [s]uddenly to peri[s]h---to become the prey of this gha[s]tly death! How will a [s]pectacle like this be endured by Wieland? To die beneath his gra[s]p would not [s]atisfy thy enemy. This was mercy to the evils which he previou[s]ly made thee [s]uffer! After the[s]e evils death was a boon which thou be[s]oughte[s]t him to grant. He [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-193.jpg) \- external link  - Page 184. ] entertained no enmity again[s]t thee: I was the object of his trea[s]on; but by [s]ome tremendous mistake his fury was mi[s]placed. But how come[s]t thou hither? and where was Wieland in thy hour of di[s]tress? I approached the corp[s]e: I lifted the [s]till flexible hand, and ki[s][s]ed the lips which were breathle[s]s. Her flowing drapery was di[s]compo[s]ed. I re[s]tored it to order, and [s]eating my[s]elf on the bed, again fixed [s]tedfa[s]t eyes upon her countenance. I cannot distinctly recollect the ruminations of that moment. I saw confu[s]edly, but forcibly, that every hope was extingui[s]hed with the life of Catharine . All happine[s]s and dignity mu[s]t henceforth be banished from the hou[s]e and name of Wieland: all that remained was to linger out in agonies a [s]hort exi[s]tence; and leave to the world a monument of bla[s]ted hopes and changeable fortune. Pleyel was already lo[s]t to me; yet, while Catharine lived life was not a dete[s]table po[s][s]e[s][s]ion: but now, [s]evered from the companion of my infancy, the partaker of all my thoughts, my cares, and my wi[s]hes, I was like one [s]et afloat upon a [s]tormy [s]ea, and hanging his [s]afety upon a plank; night was closing upon him, and an unexpected [s]urge had torn him from his hold and overwhelmed him forever. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-194.jpg) \- external link  - Page 185. ] I had no inclination nor power to move from this [s]pot. For more than an hour, my faculties and limbs [s]eemed to be deprived of all activity. The door below creaked on its hinges, and [s]teps a[s]cended the [s]tairs. My wandering and confu[s]ed thoughts were in[s]tantly recalled by the[s]e sounds, and dropping the curtain of the bed, I moved to a part of the room where any one who entered [s]hould be vi[s]ible; [s]uch are the vibrations of sentiment, that notwith[s]tanding the [s]eeming fulfilment of my fears, and increa[s]e of my danger, I was con[s]cious, on this occa[s]ion, to no turbulence but that of curio[s]ity. At length he entered the apartment, and I recognized my brother. It was the [s]ame Wieland whom I had ever [s]een. Yet his features were pervaded by a new expre[s][s]ion. I [s]uppo[s]ed him unacquainted with the fate of his wife, and his appearance confirmed this per[s]ua[s]ion. A brow expanding into exultation I had hitherto never [s]een in him, yet [s]uch a brow did he now wear. Not only was he unapprized of the di[s]a[s]ter that had happened, but [s]ome joyous occurrence had betided. What a rever[s]e was preparing to annihilate his transitory bli[s]s! No hu[s]band ever doated more fondly, for no wife ever claimed [s]o boundle[s]s a devotion. I was not uncertain as to the effects to flow from the di[s]covery of her fate. I confided not at all in the efforts of his rea[s]on or his piety. There were few [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-195.jpg) \- external link  - Page 186. ] evils which his modes of thinking would not di[s]arm of their [s]ting; but here, all opiates to grief, and all compellers of patience were vain. This [s]pectacle would be unavoidably followed by the outrages of de[s]peration, and a ru[s]hing to death. For the pre[s]ent, I neglected to a[s]k my[s]elf what motive brought him hither. I was only fearful of the effects to flow from the sight of the dead. Yet could it be long concealed from him? Some time and [s]peedily he would obtain this knowledge. No [s]tratagems could con[s]iderably or u[s]efully prolong his ignorance. All that could be [s]ought was to take away the abruptne[s]s of the change, and [s]hut out the confu[s]ion of'de[s]pair, and the inroads of madne[s]s: but I knew my brother, and knew that all exertions to con[s]ole him would be fruitle[s]s. What could I [s]ay? I was mute, and poured forth tho[s]e tears on his account, which my own unhappine[s]s had been unable to extort. In the mid[s]t of my tears, I was not unob[s]ervant of his motions. The[s]e were of a nature to rou[s]e [s]ome other [s]entiment than grief, or, at lea[s]t, to mix with it a portion of a[s]toni[s]hment. His countenance [s]uddenly became troubled. His hands were cla[s]ped with a force that left the print of his nails in his fle[s]h. His eyes were fixed on my feet. His brain [s]eemed to [s]well beyond its continent. He did not cea[s]e to breathe, but his breath was [s]tifled into groans. I had never witne[s][s]ed the hurricane of human pa[s][s]ions. My element had, till lately, been all [s]un[s]hine and calm. I was unconversant with the altitudes and energies of sentiment, and was transfixed with inexplicable horror by the [s]ymptoms which I now beheld. After a [s]ilence and a conflict which I could not interpret, be lifted his eyes to heaven, and in broken [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-196.jpg) \- external link  - Page 187. ] accents exclaimed, "This is too much! Any victim but this, and thy will be done. Have I not sufficiently atte[s]ted my faith and my obedience? She that is gone, they that have peri[s]hed, were linked with my [s]oul by ties which only thy command would have broken; but here is [s]anctity and excellence [s]urpa[s][s]ing human. This workman[s]hip is thine, and it cannot be thy will to heap it into ruins." Here [s]uddenly uncla[s]ping his hands, he [s]truck one of them again[s]t his forehead, and continued--- "Wretch! who made thee quick [s]ighted in the councils of thy Maker? Deliverance from mortal setters is awarded to this being, and thou art the mini[s]ter of this decree." So [s]aying, Wieland advanced towards me. His words and his motions were without meaning, except on one [s]uppo[s]ition. The death of Catharine was already known to him, and that knowledge, as might have been [s]u[s]pected, had de[s]troyed his rea[s]on. I had feared nothing le[s]s; but now that I beheld the extinction of a mind the mo[s]t luminous and penetrating that ever dignified the human form, my [s]en[s]ations were fraught with new and in[s]upportable angui[s]h. I had not time to reflect in what way my own [s]afety would be effected by this revolution, or what I had to dread from the wild conceptions of a madman. He advanced towards me. Some hollow noi[s]es were wa[s]ted by the breeze. Confu[s]ed clamours were [s]ucceeded by many feet traver[s]ing the gra[s]s, and then crowding into the piazza. The[s]e [s]ounds [s]u[s]pended my brother's purpo[s]e, and he [s]tood to li[s]ten. The [s]ignals multiplied and grew louder; perceiving this, he turned from me, and hurried out of my [s]ight. All about me was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-197.jpg) \- external link  - Page 188. ] pregnant with motives to a[s]toni[s]hment. My sister's corp[s]e, Wieland's frantic demeanour, and, at length, this crowd of vi[s]itants [s]o little accorded with my fore[s]ight, that my mental progre[s]s was [s]topped. The impul[s]e had cea[s]ed which was accu[s]tomed to give motion and order to my thoughts. Foot[s]teps thronged upon the [s]tairs, and pre[s]ently many faces [s]hewed them[s]elves within the door of my apartment. The[s]e looks were full of alarm and watchfulne[s]s. They pryed into corners as if in [s]earch of [s]ome fugitive; next their gaze was fixed upon me, and betokened all the vehemence of terror and pity. For a time I que[s]tioned whether the[s]e were not [s]hapes and faces like that which I had [s]een at the bottom of the [s]tairs, creatures of my fancy or airy exi[s]tences. My eye wandered from one to another, till at length it fell on a countenance which I well knew. It was that of Mr. Hallet. This man was a distant kin[s]man of my mother, venerable for his age, his uprightne[s]s, and [s]agacity. He had long discharged the functions of a magi[s]trate and good citizen. If any terrors remained, his pre[s]ence was [s]ufficient to di[s]pel them. He approached, took my hand with a compassionate air, and [s]aid in a low voice. "Where, my dear Clara, are your brother and [s]i[s]ter?" I made no an[s]wer, but pointed to the bed. His attendants drew a[s]ide the curtain, and while their eyes glared with horror at the [s]pectacle which they beheld, tho[s]e of Mr. Hallet overflowed with tears. After con[s]iderable pau[s]e, he once more turned to me. "My dear girl, this [s]ight is not for you. Can you confide in my care, and that of Mrs. Baynton's? We will [s]ee performed all that circumstances require." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-198.jpg) \- external link  - Page 189. ] I made [s]trenuous oppo[s]ition to this reque[s]t. I in[s]i[s]ted on remaining near her till [s]he were interred. His remon[s]trances, however, and my own feelings, [s]hewed me the propriety of a temporary dereliction. Loui[s]a [s]tood in need of a comforter, and my brother's children of a nur[s]e. My unhappy brother was him[s]elf an object of [s]olicitude and care. At length, I con[s]ented to relinqui[s]h the corp[s]e, and go to my brother's, who[s]e hou[s]e, I [s]aid, would need mi[s]tre[s]s, and his children a parent. During this di[s]cour[s]e, my venerable friend struggled with his tears, but my la[s]t intimation called them forth with fre[s]h violence. Meanwhile, his attendants [s]tood round in mournful [s]ilence, gazing on me and at each other. I repeated my resolution, and ro[s]e to execute it; but he took my hand to detain me. His countenance betrayed irresolution and reluctance. I reque[s]ted him to [s]tate the rea[s]on of his oppo[s]ition to this mea[s]ure. I entreated him to be explicit. I told him that my brother had ju[s]t been there, and that I knew his condition. This misfortune had driven him to madne[s]s, and his offspring mu[s]t not want a protector. If he cho[s]e, I would re[s]ign Wieland to his care; but his innocent and helple[s]s babes [s]tood in in[s]tant need of nur[s]e and mother, and the[s]e offices I would by no means allow another to perform while I had life. Every word that I uttered [s]eemed to augment his perplexity and di[s]tre[s]s. At la[s]t he [s]aid, "I think, Clara, I have entitled my[s]elf to [s]ome regard from you. You have profe[s][s]ed your willingne[s]s to oblige me. Now I call upon you to confer upon me the highe[s]t obligation in your power. Permit Mrs. Baynton to have the management of your brother's hou[s]e for two or three days; then it [s]hall be yours to act in it as you plea[s]e. No matter what are my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-199.jpg) \- external link  - Page 190. ] motives in making this reque[s]t: perhaps I think your age, your [s]ex, or the di[s]tre[s]s which this disaster mu[s]t occa[s]ion, incapacitates you for the office. Surely you have no doubt of Mrs. Baynton's tenderness or di[s]cretion." New ideas now ru[s]hed into my mind. I fixed my eyes [s]tedfa[s]tly on Mr. Hallet. "Are they well?" [s]aid I. "Is Loui[s]a well? Are Benjamin, and William, and Con[s]tantine, and Little Clara, are they [s]afe? Tell me truly, I be[s]eech you!" "They are well," he replied; "they are perfectly [s]afe." "Fear no effeminate weekne[s]s in me: I can bear to hear the truth. Tell me truly, are they well?" He again a[s][s]ured me that they were well. "What then," re[s]umed I, "do you fear? Is it po[s][s]ible for any calamity to di[s]qualify me for performing my duty to the[s]e helple[s]s innocents? I am willing to divide the care of them with Mrs. Baynton; I [s]hall be grateful for her [s]ympathy and aid; but what [s]hould I be to de[s]ert them at an hour like this!" I will cut [s]hort this di[s]tre[s]sful dialogue. I [s]till per[s]i[s]ted in my purpo[s]e, and he [s]till per[s]i[s]ted in his oppo[s]ition. This excited my [s]u[s]picions anew; but the[s]e were removed by [s]olemn declarations of their [s]afety. I could not explain this conduct in my friend; but at length con[s]ented to go to the city, provided I [s]hould [s]ee them for a few minutes at pre[s]ent, and [s]hould return on the morrow. Even this arrangement was objected to. At length he told me they were removed to the city. Why were they removed, I a[s]ked, and whither? My importunities would not now be eluded. My [s]u[s]picions were rou[s]ed, and no eva[s]ion or artifice was [s]ufficient to allay them. Many of the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-200.jpg) \- external link  - Page 191. ] audience began to give vent to their emotions in tears. Mr. Hallet him[s]elf [s]eemed as if the conflict were too hard to be longer [s]u[s]tained. Something whispered to my heart that havoc had been wider than I now witne[s][s]ed. I [s]u[s]pected this concealment to ari[s]e from apprehen[s]ions of the effects which a knowledge of the truth would produce in me. I once more entreated him to inform me truly of their [s]tate. To enforce my entreaties, I put on an air of in[s]en[s]ibility. "I can gue[s]s," [s]aid I, "what has happened---They are indeed beyond the reach of injury, for they are dead! Is it not [s]o?" My voice faltered in [s]pite of my courageous efforts. "Yes," [s]aid he, "they are dead! Dead by the [s]ame fate, and by the [s]ame hand, with their mother!" "Dead!" replied I; "what, all?" "All!" replied he: "he [s]pared not one! " Allow me, my friends, to clo[s]e my eyes upon the after-[s]cene. Why [s]hould I protract a tale which I already begin to feel is too long? Over this [s]cene at lea[s]t let me pa[s]s lightly. Here, indeed, my narrative would be imperfect. All was tempe[s]tuous commotion in my heart and in my brain. I have no memory for ought but uncon[s]cious tran[s]itions and rueful [s]ights. I was ingenious and indefatigable in the invention of torments. I would not dispense with any [s]pectacle adapted to exa[s]perate my grief. Each pale and mangled form I cru[s]hed to my bo[s]om. Loui[s]a, whom I loved with [s]o ineffable a pa[s][s]ion, was denied to me at fir[s]t, but my obstinacy conquered their reluctance. They led the way into a darkened hall. A lamp pendant from the ceiling was uncovered, and they pointed to a table. The a[s][s]a[s][s]in had defrauded me of my la[s]t and mi[s]erable con[s]olation. I [s]ought not [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-201.jpg) \- external link  - Page 192. ] not in her vi[s]age, for the tinge of the morning, and the lu[s]tre of heaven. The[s]e had vani[s]hed with life; but I hoped for liberty to print a la[s]t ki[s]s upon her lips. This was denied me; for [s]uch had been the mercile[s]s blow that de[s]troyed her, that not a lineament remained! I was carried hence to the city. Mrs. Hallet was my companion and my nur[s]e. Why [s]hould I dwell upon the rage of fever, and the effu[s]ions of delirium? Carwin was the phantom that pur[s]ued my dreams, the giant oppre[s][s]or under who[s]e arm I was for ever on the point of being cru[s]hed. Strenuous mu[s]cles were required to hinder my flight, and hearts of [s]teel to with [s]tand the eloquence of my fears. In vain I called upon them to look upward, to mark his [s]parkling rage and [s]cowling contempt. All I [s]ought was to fly from the [s]troke that was lifted. Then I heaped upon my guards the mo[s]t vehement reproaches, or betook my[s]elf to wailings on the haple[s][s]ne[s]s of my condition. This malady, at length, declined, and my weeping friends began to look for my re[s]toration. Slowly, and with intermitted beams, memory revi[s]ited me. The [s]cenes that I had witne[s][s]ed were revived, became the theme of deliberation and deduction, and called forth the effu[s]ions of more rational sorrow. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-202.jpg) \- external link  - Page 193. ] I had imperfectly recovered my [s]trength, when I was informed of the arrival of my mother's brother, Thomas Cambridge. Ten years [s]ince, he went to Europe, and was a [s]urgeon in the Briti[s]h forces in Germany, during the whole of the late war. After its conclu[s]ion, [s]ome connection that he had formed with an Iri[s]h officer, made him retire into Ireland. Intercour[s]e had been punctually maintained by letters with his [s]i[s]ter's children, and hopes were given that he would [s]hortly return to his native country, and pa[s]s his old age in our society. He was now in an evil hour arrived. I de[s]ired an interview with him for numerous and urgent rea[s]ons. With the fir[s]t returns of my under[s]tanding I had anxiou[s]ly [s]ought information of the fate of my brother. During the cour[s]e of my di[s]ea[s]e I had never [s]een him; and vague and un[s]atisfactory an[s]wers were returned to all my inquiries. I had vehemently interrogated Mrs. Hallet and her hu[s]band, and [s]olicited an interview with this unfortunate man; but they my[s]teriou[s]ly insinuated that his rea[s]on was [s]till un[s]ettled, and that his circum[s]tances rendered an interview impo[s][s]ible. Their re[s]erve on the particulars of this de[s]truction, and the author of it, was equally invincible. For [s]ome time, finding all my efforts fruitle[s]s, I had de[s]i[s]ted from direct inquiries and [s]olicitations, determined, as [s]oon as my [s]trength was [s]ufficiently renewed, to pur[s]ue other means of di[s]pelling my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-203.jpg) \- external link  - Page 194. ] uncertainty. In this [s]tate of things my uncle's arrival and intention to vi[s]it me were announced. I almo[s]t [s]huddered to behold the face of this man. When I reflected on the di[s]a[s]ters that had befallen us, I was half unwilling to witne[s]s that dejection and grief which would be di[s]clo[s]ed in his countenance. But I believed that all tran[s]actions had been thoroughly di[s]clo[s]ed to him, and confided in my importunity to extort from him the knowledge that I [s]ought. I had no doubt as to the per[s]on of our enemy; but the motives that urged him to perpetrate the[s]e horrors, the means that he u[s]ed, and his pre[s]ent condition, were totally unknown. It was reasonable to expect [s]ome information on this head, from my uncle. I therefore waited his coming with impatience. At length, in the du[s]k of the evening, and in my [s]olitary chamber, this meeting took place. This man was our neare[s]t relation, and had ever treated us with the affection of a parent. Our meeting, therefore, could not be without overflowing tenderne[s]s and gloomy joy. He rather encouraged than re[s]trained the tears that I poured out in his arms, and took upon him[s]elf the ta[s]k of comforter. Allu[s]ions to recent di[s]a[s]ters could not be long omitted. One topic facilitated the admission of another. At length, I mentioned and deplored the ignorance in which I had been kept respecting my brother's de[s]tiny, and the circumstances of our misfortunes. I entreated him to tell me what was Wieland's condition, and what progress had been made in detecting or puni[s]hing the author of this unheard-of deva[s]tation. "The author!" [s]aid he; "Do you know the author?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-204.jpg) \- external link  - Page 195. ] "Alas!" I an[s]wered, "I am too well acquainted with him. The [s]tory of the grounds of my suspicions would be painful and too long. I am not apprized of the extent of your pre[s]ent knowledge. There are none but Wieland, Pleyel, and my[s]elf, who are able to relate certain facts." "Spare your[s]elf the pain," [s]aid he. "All that Wieland and Pleyel can communicate, I know already. If any thing of moment has fallen within your own exclu[s]ive knowledge, and the relation be not too arduous for your pre[s]ent [s]trength, I confe[s]s I am de[s]irous of hearing it. Perhaps you allude to one by the name of Carwin. I will anticipate your curio[s]ity by [s]aying, that [s]ince the[s]e di[s]a[s]ters, no one has [s]een or heard of him. His agency is, therefore, a my[s]tery [s]till un[s]olved." I readily complied with his reque[s]t, and related as di[s]tinctly as I could, though in general terms, the events tran[s]acted in the [s]ummer-hou[s]e and my chamber. He li[s]tened without apparent [s]urprize to the tale of Pleyel's errors and [s]u[s]p cions, and with augmented [s]eriou[s]ne[s]s, to my narrative of the warnings and inexplicable vi[s]ion, and the letter found up on the table. I waited for his comments. "You gather from this," [s]aid he, "that Carwin is the author of all this mi[s]ery." "Is it not," an[s]wered I, "an unavoidable inference? But what know you re[s]pecting it? Was it po[s][s]ible to execute this mi[s]chief without witne[s]s or coadjutor? I be[s]eech you to relate to me, when and why Mr. Hallet was [s]ummoned to the [s]cene, and by whom this di[s]a[s]ter was fir[s]t [s]u[s]pected or di[s]covered. Surely, [s]u[s]picion mu[s]t have fallen upon [s]ome one, and pur[s]uit was made." My uncle ro[s]e from his [s]eat, and traver[s]ed the floor with ha[s]ty [s]teps. His eyes were fixed upon [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-205.jpg) \- external link  - Page 196. ] the ground, and he [s]eemed buried in perplexity. At length he pau[s]ed, and [s]aid with an emphatic tone, "It is true; the in[s]trument is known. Carwin may have plotted, but the execution was another's. That other is found, and his deed is ascertained." "Good heaven!" I exclaimed, "what [s]ay you? Was not Carwin the a[s][s]a[s][s]in? Could any hand but his have carried into act this dreadful purpo[s]e?" "Have I not [s]aid," returned he, "that the performance was another's? Carwin, perhaps, or heaven, or in[s]anity, prompted the murderer; but Carwin is unknown. The actual performer has, long [s]ince, been called to judgment and convicted, and is, at this moment, at the bottom of a dungeon loaded with chains." I lifted my hands and eyes. "Who then is this a[s][s]a[s][s]in? By what means, and whither was he traced? What is the te[s]timony of his guilt?" "His own, corroborated with that of a servantmaid who [s]pied the murder of the children from a clo[s]et where [s]he was concealed. The magi[s]trate returned from your dwelling to your brother's. He was employed in hearing and recording the testimony of the only witne[s]s, when the criminal himself, unexpected, un[s]olicited, un[s]ought, entered the hall, acknowledged his guilt, and rendered him[s]elf up to ju[s]tice. "He has [s]ince been [s]ummoned to the bar. The audience was compo[s]ed of thou[s]ands whom rumours of this wonderful event had attracted from the greate[s]t di[s]tance. A long and impartial examination was made, and the pri[s]oner was called upon for his defence. In compliance with this call he delivered an ample relation of his motives and actions." There he [s]topped. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-206.jpg) \- external link  - Page 197. ] I be[s]ought him to [s]ay who this criminal was, and what the in[s]tigations that compelled him. My uncle was [s]ilent. I urged this inquiry with new force. I reverted to my own knowledge, and [s]ought in this [s]ome ba[s]is to conjecture. I ran over the [s]canty catalogue of the men whom I knew; I lighted on no one who was qualified for ministering to malice like this. Again I re[s]orted to importunity. Had I ever [s]een the criminal? Was it [s]heer cruelty, or diabolical revenge that produced this overthrow? He [s]urveyed me, for a con[s]iderable time, and li[s]tened to my interrogations in [s]ilence. At length he [s]poke: "Clara, I have known thee by report, and in [s]ome degree by ob[s]ervation. Thou art a being of no vulgar [s]ort. Thy friends have hitherto treated thee as a child. They meant well, but, perhaps, they were unacquainted with thy [s]trength. I a[s][s]ure my[s]elf that nothing will [s]urpa[s]s thy fortitude. "Thou art anxious to know the de[s]troyer of thy family, his actions, and his motives. Shall I call him to thy pre[s]ence, and permit him to confe[s]s before thee? Shall I make him the narrator of his own tale?" I [s]tarted on my feet, and looked round me with fearful glances, as if the murderer was clo[s]e at hand. "What do you mean?" [s]aid I; "put an end, I be[s]eech you, to this [s]u[s]pence." "Be not alarmed; you will never more behold the face of this criminal, unle[s]s he be gifted with [s]upernatural [s]trength, and [s]ever like threads the con[s]traint of links and bolts. I have [s]aid that the a[s][s]a[s][s]in was arraigned at the bar, and that the trial ended with a [s]ummons from the judge to confe[s]s or to vindicate his actions. A reply was immediately [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-207.jpg) \- external link  - Page 198. ] made with [s]ignificance of ge[s]ture, and a tranquil maje[s]ty, which denoted le[s]s of humanity than godhead. Judges, advocates and auditors were panicstruck and breathle[s]s with attention. One of the hearers faithfully recorded the [s]peech. There it is," continued he, putting a roll of papers in my hand, "you may read it at your lei[s]ure." With the[s]e words my uncle left me alone. My curio[s]ity refu[s]ed me a moment's delay. I opened the papers, and read as follows. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-208.jpg) \- external link  - Page 199. ] " Theodore wieland, the pri[s]oner at the bar, was now called upon for his defence. He looked around him for [s]ome time in [s]ilence, and with a mild countenance. At length he [s]poke: "It is [s]trange; I am known to my judges and my auditors. Who is there pre[s]ent a [s]tranger to the character of Wieland? who knows him not as an hu[s]band---as a father---as a friend? yet here am I arraigned as criminal. I am charged with diabolical malice; I am accu[s]ed of the murder of my wife and my children! "It is true, they were [s]lain by me; they all perished by my hand. The ta[s]k of vindication is ignoble. What is it that I am called to vindicate? and before whom? "You know that they are dead, and that they were killed by me. What more would you have? Would you extort from me a [s]tatement of my motives? Have you failed to di[s]cover them already? You charge me with malice; but your eyes are not [s]hut; your rea[s]on is [s]till vigorous; your memory has not for[s]aken you. You know whom it is that you thus charge. The habits of his life are known to you; his treatment of his wife and his offspring is known to you; the [s]oundne[s]s of his integrity, and the unchangeablene[s]s of his principles, are familiar to your apprehen[s]ion; yet you per[s]i[s]t in this charge! You lead me hither manacled as a felon; you deem me worthy of a vile and tormenting death! [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-209.jpg) \- external link  - Page 200. ] "Who are they whom I have devoted to death? My wife---the little ones, that drew their being from me---that creature who, as [s]he [s]urpa[s][s]ed them in excellence, claimed a larger affection than tho[s]e whom natural affinities bound to my heart. Think ye that malice could have urged me to this deed? Hide your audacious fronts from the [s]crutiny of heaven. Take refuge in [s]ome cavern unvi[s]ited by human eyes. Ye may deplore your wickedne[s]s or folly, but ye cannot expiate it. "Think not that I [s]peak for your [s]akes. Hug to your hearts this dete[s]table infatuation. Deem me [s]till a murderer, and drag me to untimely death. I make not an effort to di[s]pel your illu[s]ion: I utter not a word to cure you of your [s]anguinary folly: but there are probably [s]ome in this a[s][s]embly who have come from far: for their [s]akes, who[s]e di[s]tance has di[s]abled them from knowing me, I will tell what I have done, and why. "It is needle[s]s to [s]ay that God is the object of my [s]upreme pa[s][s]ion. I have cheri[s]hed, in his presence, a [s]ingle and upright heart. I have thir[s]ted for the knowledge of his will. I have burnt with ardour to approve my faith and my obedience. "My days have been [s]pent in [s]earching for the revelation of that will; but my days have been mournful, becau[s]e my [s]earch failed. I [s]olicited direction: I turned on every [s]ide where glimmerings of light could be di[s]covered. I have not been wholly uninformed; but my knowledge has always [s]topped [s]hort of certainty. Di[s][s]atisfaction has insinuated it[s]elf into all my thoughts. My purpo[s]es have been pure; my wi[s]hes indefatigable; but not till lately were the[s]e purpo[s]es thoroughly accomplished, and the[s]e wi[s]hes fully gratified. "I thank thee, my father, for thy bounty; that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-210.jpg) \- external link  - Page 201. ] thou did[s]t not a[s]k a le[s]s [s]acrifice than this; that thou placed[s]t me in a condition to te[s]tify my submission to thy will! What have I withheld which it was thy plea[s]ure to exact? Now may I, with dauntle[s]s and erect eye, claim my reward, [s]ince I have given thee the trea[s]ure of my [s]oul. "I was at my own hou[s]e: it was late in the evening: my [s]i[s]ter had gone to the city, but proposed to return. It was in expectation of her return that my wife and I delayed going to bed beyond the u[s]ual hour; the re[s]t of the family, however, were retired. "My mind was contemplative and calm; not wholly devoid of apprehen[s]ion on account of my [s]i[s]ter's [s]afety. Recent events, not ea[s]ily explained, had [s]ugge[s]ted the exi[s]tence of [s]ome danger; but this danger was without a di[s]tinct form in our imagination, and [s]carcely ruffled our tranquillity. "Time pa[s][s]ed, and my [s]i[s]ter did not arrive; her hou[s]e is at [s]ome di[s]tance from mine, and though her arrangements had been made with a view to re[s]iding with us, it was po[s][s]ible that, through forgetfulness, or the occurrence of unfore[s]een emergencies, [s]he had returned to her own dwelling. "Hence it was conceived proper that I [s]hould a[s]certain the truth by going thither. I went. On my way my mind was full of the[s]e ideas which related to my intellectual condition. In the torrent of fervid conceptions, I lo[s]t [s]ight of my purpo[s]e. Some times I [s]tood [s]till; [s]ome times I wandered from my path, and experienced [s]ome difficulty, on recovering from my fit of mu[s]ing, to regain it. "The [s]eries of my thoughts is ea[s]ily traced. At fir[s]t every vein beat with raptures known only to the man who[s]e parental and conjugal love is [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-211.jpg) \- external link  - Page 202. ] without limits, and the cup of who[s]e de[s]ires, immen[s]e as it is, overflows with gratification. I know not why emotions that were perpetual vi[s]itants [s]hould now have recurred with unu[s]ual energy. The tran[s]ition was not new from [s]en[s]ations of joy to a con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of gratitude. The author of my being was likewi[s]e the di[s]pen[s]er of every gift with which that being was embelli[s]hed. The [s]ervice to which a benefactor like this was entitled, could not be circum[s]cribed. My [s]ocial [s]entiments were indebted to their alliance with devotion for all their value. All pa[s][s]ions are ba[s]e, all joys feeble, all energies malignant, which are not drawn from this [s]ource. "For a time, my contemplations [s]oared above earth and its inhabitants. I [s]tretched forth my hands; I li[s]ted my eyes, and exclaimed, O! that I might be admitted to thy pre[s]ence; that mine were the [s]upreme delight of knowing thy will, and of performing it! The bli[s]sful privilege of direct communication with thee, and of li[s]tening to the audible enunciation of thy plea[s]ure! "What ta[s]k would I not undertake, what privation would I not cheerfully endure, to te[s]tify my love of thee? Alas! thou hide[s]t thy[s]elf from my view: glimp[s]es only of thy excellence and beauty are afforded me. Would that a momentary emanation from thy glory would vi[s]it me! that [s]ome unambiguous token of thy pre[s]ence would [s]alute my [s]en[s]es! "In this mood, I entered the hou[s]e of my [s]i[s]ter. It was vacant. Scarcely had I regained recollection of the purpo[s]e that brought me hither. Thoughts of a different tendency had [s]uch ab[s]olute po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of my mind, that the relations of time and [s]pace [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-212.jpg) \- external link  - Page 203. ] were almo[s]t obliterated from my under[s]tanding. The[s]e wanderings, however, were re[s]trained, and I a[s]cended to her chamber. "I had no light, and might have known by external ob[s]ervation, that the hou[s]e was without any inhabitant. With this, however, I was not [s]atisfied. I entered the room, and the object of my [s]earch not appearing, I prepared to return. "The darkne[s]s required [s]ome caution in descending the [s]tair. I [s]tretched my hand to [s]eize the balu[s]trade by which I might regulate my [s]teps. How [s]hall I de[s]cribe the lu[s]tre, which, at that moment, bur[s]t upon my vi[s]ion! "I was dazzled. My organs were bereaved of their activity. My eye-lids were half-clo[s]ed, and my hands withdrawn from the balu[s]trade. A nameless fear chilled my veins, and I [s]tood motionle[s]s. This irradiation did not retire or le[s][s]en. It [s]eemed as if [s]ome powerful effulgence covered me like a mantle. "I opened my eyes and found all about me luminous and glowing. It was the element of heaven that flowed around. Nothing but a fiery [s]tream was at fir[s]t vi[s]ible; but, anon, a [s]hrill voice from behind called upon me to attend. "I turned: It is forbidden to de[s]cribe what I [s]aw: Words, indeed, would be wanting to the ta[s]k. The lineaments of that being, who[s]e veil was now lifted, and who[s]e vi[s]age beamed upon my [s]ight, no hues of pencil or of language can pourtray. "As it [s]poke, the accents thrilled to my heart. "Thy prayers are heard. In proof of thy faith, render me thy wife. This is the victim I chu[s]e. Call her hither, and here let her fall."---The [s]ound, and vi[s]age, and light vani[s]hed at once. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-213.jpg) \- external link  - Page 204. ] "What demand was this? The blood of Catharine was to be [s]hed! My wife was to peri[s]h by my hand! I [s]ought opportunity to atte[s]t my virtue. Little did I expect that a proof like this would have been demanded. "My wife! I exclaimed: O God! [s]ub[s]titute [s]ome other victim. Make me not the butcher of my wife. My own blood is cheap. This will I pour out before thee with a willing heart; but [s]pare, I be[s]eech thee, this precious life, or commission [s]ome other than her hu[s]band to perform the bloody deed. "In vain. The conditions were pre[s]cribed; the decree had gone forth, and nothing remained but to execute it. I ru[s]hed out of the hou[s]e and acro[s]s the intermediate fields, and [s]topped not till I entered my own parlour. "My wife had remained here during my absence, in anxious expectation of my return with [s]ome tidings of her [s]i[s]ter. I had none to communicate. For a time, I was breathle[s]s with my [s]peed: This, and the tremors that [s]hook my frame, and the wildne[s]s of my looks, alarmed her. She immediately [s]u[s]pected [s]ome di[s]a[s]ter to have happened to her friend, and her own [s]peech was as much overpowered by emotion as mine. "She was [s]ilent, but her looks mani[s]e[s]ted her impatience to hear what I had to communicate. I [s]poke, but with [s]o much precipitation as [s]carcely to be under[s]tood; catching her, at the [s]ame time, by the arm, and forcibly pulling her from her [s]eat. "Come along with me: fly: wa[s]te not a moment: time will be lo[s]t, and the deed will be omitted. Tarry not; que[s]tion not; but fly with me! "This deportment added afre[s]h to her alarms. Her eyes pur[s]ued mine, and [s]he [s]aid, "What is the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-214.jpg) \- external link  - Page 205. ] matter? For God's [s]ake what is the matter? Where would you have me go?" "My eyes were fixed upon her countenance while [s]he [s]poke. I thought upon her virtues; I viewed her as the mother of my babes; as my wife: I recalled the purpo[s]e for which I thus urged her attendance. My heart faltered, and I [s]aw that I mu[s]t rou[s]e to this work all my faculties. The danger of the lea[s]t delay was imminent. "I looked away from her, and again exerting my force, drew her towards the door---`You mu[s]t go with me---indeed you mu[s]t.' "In her fright [s]he half-re[s]i[s]ted my efforts, and again exclaimed, `Good heaven! what is it you mean? Where go? What has happened? Have you found Clara?' "Follow me, and you will [s]ee," I an[s]wered, [s]till urging her reluctant [s]teps forward. "What phrenzy has [s]eized you? Something mu[s]t needs have happened. Is [s]he [s]ick? Have you foundh er?" "Come and [s]ee. Follow me, and know for your[s]elf." "Still [s]he expo[s]tulated and be[s]ought me to explain this my[s]terious behaviour. I could not tru[s]t my[s]elf to an[s]wer her; to look at her; but gra[s]ping her arm, I drew her after me. She he[s]itated, rather through confu[s]ion of mind than from unwillingness to accompany me. This confu[s]ion gradually abated, and [s]he moved forward, but with irre[s]olute foot[s]teps, and continual exclamations of wonder and terror. Her interrogations of "what was the matter?" and "whither was I going?" were ceaseless and vehement. "It was the [s]cope of my efforts not to think; to keep up a conflict and uproar in my mind in [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-215.jpg) \- external link  - Page 206. ] which all order and di[s]tinctne[s]s [s]hould be lo[s]t; to e[s]cape from the [s]en[s]ations produced by her voice. I was, therefore, [s]ilent. I [s]trove to abridge this interval by my ha[s]te, and to wa[s]te all my attention in furious ge[s]ticulations. "In this [s]tate of mind we reached my [s]i[s]ter's door. She looked at the windows and [s]aw that all was de[s]olate---"Why come we here? There is no body here. I will not go in." "Still I was dumb; but opening the door, I drew her into the entry. This was the allotted [s]cene; here [s]he was to fall. I let to go her hand, and pre[s][s]ing my palms again[s]t my forehead, made one mighty effort to work up my [s]oul to the deed. "In vain; it would not be; my courage was appalled; my arms nervele[s]s: I muttered prayers that my [s]trength might be aided from above. They availed nothing. "Horror diffu[s]ed it[s]elf over me. This conviction of my cowardice, my rebellion, fa[s]tened upon me, and I [s]tood rigid and cold as marble. From this [s]tate I was [s]omewhat relieved by my wife's voice, who renewed her [s]upplications to be told why we came hither, and what was the fate of my [s]i[s]ter. "What could I an[s]wer? My words were broken and inarticulate. Her fears naturally acquired force from the ob[s]ervation of the[s]e [s]ymptoms; but the[s]e fears were mi[s]placed. The only inference [s]he deduced from my conduct was, that [s]ome terrible mi[s]hap had befallen Clara. "She wrung her hands, and exclaimed in an agony, "O tell me, where is [s]he? What has become of her? Is [s]he [s]ick? Dead? Is [s]he in her chamber? O let me go thither and know the wor[s]t!" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-216.jpg) \- external link  - Page 207. ] "This propo[s]al [s]et my thoughts once more in motion. Perhaps what my rebellious heart refu[s]ed to perform here, I might obtain [s]trength enough to execute el[s]ewhere. "Come then," [s]aid I, "let us go." "I will, but not in the dark. We mu[s]t fir[s]t procure a light." "Fly then and procure it; but I charge you, linger not. I will await for your return. "While [s]he was gone, I [s]trode along the entry. The fellne[s]s of a gloomy hurricane but [s]aintly resembled the di[s]cord that reigned in my mind. To omit this [s]acrifice mu[s]t not be; yet my [s]inews had refu[s]ed to perform it. No alternative was offered. To rebel again[s]t the mandate was impo[s][s]ible; but obedience would render me the executioner of my wife. My will was [s]trong, but my limbs refu[s]ed their office. "She returned with a light; I led the way to the chamber; [s]he looked round her; [s]he lifted the curtain of the bed; [s]he [s]aw nothing. "At length, [s]he fixed inquiring eyes upon me. The light now enabled her to di[s]cover in my vi[s]age what darkne[s]s had hitherto concealed. Her cares were now transferred from my [s]i[s]ter to my[s]elf, and [s]he [s]aid in a tremulous voice, "Wieland! you are not well: What ails you? Can I do nothing for you?" "That accents and looks [s]o winning [s]hould di[s]arm me of my re[s]olution, was to be expected. My thoughts were thrown anew into anarchy. I [s]pread my hand before my eyes that I might not [s]ee her, and an[s]wered only by groans. She took my other hand between her's, and pre[s][s]ing it to her heart, [s]poke with that voice which had ever [s]wayed my will, and wa[s]ted away [s]orrow. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-217.jpg) \- external link  - Page 208. ] "My friend! my [s]oul's friend! tell me thy cau[s]e of grief. Do I not merit to partake with thee in thy cares? Am I not thy wife?" "This was too much. I broke from her embrace, and retired to a corner of the room. In this pau[s]e, courage was once more infu[s]ed into me. I re[s]olved to execute my duty. She followed me, and renewed her pa[s][s]ionate entreaties to know the cau[s]e of my di[s]tre[s]s. "I rai[s]ed my head and regarded her with [s]tedfa[s]t looks. I muttered [s]omething about death, and the injunctions of my duty. At the[s]e words [s]he [s]hrunk back, and looked at me with a new expre[s][s]ion of angui[s]h. After a pau[s]e, [s]he cla[s]ped her hands, and exclaimed--- "O Wieland! Wieland! God grant that I am mi[s]taken; but [s]urely [s]omething is wrong. I [s]ee it: it is too plain: thou art undone---lo[s]t to me and to thy[s]elf." At the [s]ame time [s]he gazed on my features with inten[s]e[s]t anxiety, in hope that different [s]ymptoms would take place. I replied to her with vehemence--- "Undone! No; my duty is known, and I thank my God that my cowardice is now vanqui[s]hed, and I have power to fulfil it. Catharine! I pity the weakne[s]s of thy nature: I pity thee, but mu[s]t not [s]pare. Thy life is claimed from my hands: thou mu[s]t die!" "Fear was now, added to her grief. `What mean you? Why talk you of death? Bethink your[s]elf, Wieland: bethink your[s]elf, and this fit will pa[s]s. O why came I hither! Why did you drag me hither?' "I brought thee hither to fulfil a divine command. I am appointed thy de[s]troyer, and de[s]troy thee I mu[s]t." Saying this I [s]eized her wri[s]ts. She [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-218.jpg) \- external link  - Page 209. ] [s]hrieked aloud, and endeavoured to free her[s]elf from my gra[s]p; but her efforts were vain. "Surely, [s]urely Wieland, thou do[s]t not mean it. Am I not thy wife? and would[s]t thou kill me? Thou wilt not; and yet---I [s]ee---thou art Wieland no longer! A fury re[s]i[s]tle[s]s and horrible po[s][s]e[s][s]es thee---Spare me---[s]pare---help---help---" "Till her breath was [s]topped [s]he [s]hrieked for help---for mercy. When [s]he could [s]peak no longer, her ge[s]tures, her looks appealed to my compa[s][s]ion. My accur[s]ed hand was irre[s]olute and tremulous. I meant thy death to be [s]udden, thy [s]truggles to be brief. Alas! my heart was infirm; my re[s]olves mutable. Thrice I [s]lackened my gra[s]p, and life kept its hold, though in the mid[s]t of pangs. Her eye-balls [s]tarted from their [s]ockets. Grimne[s]s and di[s]tortion took place of all that u[s]ed to bewitch me into tran[s]port, and [s]ubdue me into reverence. "I was commi[s][s]ioned to kill thee, but not to torment thee with the fore[s]ight of thy death; not to multiply thy fears, and prolong thy agonies. Haggard, and pale, and lifele[s]s, at length thou cea[s]ed[s]t to contend with thy de[s]tiny. "This was a moment of triumph. Thus had I [s]ucce[s]sfully [s]ubdued the [s]tubbornne[s]s of human pa[s][s]ions: the victim which had been demanded was given: the deed was done pa[s]t recal. "I lifted the corp[s]e in my arms and laid it on the bed. I gazed upon it with delight. Such was the elation of my thoughts, that I even broke into laughter. I clapped my hands and exclaimed, `It is done! My [s]acred duty is fulfilled! To that I have [s]acrificed, O my God! thy la[s]t and be[s]t gift, my wife!' "For a while I thus [s]oared above frailty. I imagined I had [s]et my[s]elf forever beyond the reach of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-219.jpg) \- external link  - Page 210. ] [s]elfi[s]hne[s]s; but my imaginations were fal[s]e. This rapture quickly [s]ub[s]ided. I looked again at my wife. My joyous ebullitions vani[s]hed, and I asked my[s]elf who it was whom I [s]aw? Methought it could not be Catharine. It could not be the woman who had lodged for years in my heart; who had [s]lept, nightly, in my bo[s]om; who had borne in her womb, who had fo[s]tered at her brea[s]t, the beings who called me father; whom I had watched with delight, and cheri[s]hed with a fondne[s]s ever new and perpetually growing: it could not be the [s]ame. "Where was her bloom! The[s]e deadly and blood-[s]uffu[s]ed orbs but ill re[s]emble the azure and ex[s]tatic tenderne[s]s of her eyes. The lucid [s]tream that meandered over that bo[s]om, the glow of love that was wont to [s]it upon that cheek, are much unlike the[s]e livid [s]tains and this hideous deformity. Alas! the[s]e were the traces of agony; the gripe of the a[s][s]a[s][s]in had been here! "I will not dwell upon my lap[s]e into de[s]perate and outrageous [s]orrow. The breath of heaven that [s]u[s]tained me was withdrawn, and I [s]unk into mere man  . I leaped from the floor: I da[s]hed my head again[s]t the wall: I uttered [s]creams of horror: I panted after torment and pain. Eternal fire, and the bickerings of hell, compared with what I felt, were mu[s]ic and a bed of ro[s]es. "I thank my God that this degeneracy was transient, that he deigned once more to rai[s]e me alo[s]t. I thought upon what I had done as a [s]acrifice to duty, and was calm . My wife was dead; but I reflected, that though this [s]ource of human consolation was clo[s]ed, yet others were [s]till open. If the tran[s]ports of an hu[s]band were no more, the feelings of a father had [s]till [s]cope for exerci[s]e. When remembrance of their mother [s]hould excite [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-220.jpg) \- external link  - Page 211. ] too keen a pang, I would look upon them, and be comforted . "While I revolved the[s]e ideas, new warmth flowed in upon my heart---I was wrong. The[s]e feelings were the growth of [s]elfi[s]hne[s]s. Of this I was not aware, and to di[s]pel the mi[s]t that ob[s]cured my perceptions, a new effulgence and a new mandate were nece[s][s]ary. "From the[s]e thoughts I was recalled by a ray that was [s]hot into the room. A voice [s]pake like that which I had before heard---`Thou ha[s]t done well; but all is not done---the [s]acrifice is incomplete--- thy children mu[s]t be offered---they mu[s]t perish with their mother!---' [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-221.jpg) \- external link  - Page 212. ] Will you wonder that I read no farther? Will you not rather be a[s]toni[s]hed that I read thus far? What power [s]upported me through [s]uch a ta[s]k I know not. Perhaps the doubt from which I could not di[s]engage my mind, that the [s]cene here depicted was a dream, contributed to my perseverance. In vain the [s]olemn introduction of my uncle, his appeals to my fortitude, and allu[s]ions to [s]omething mon[s]trous in the events he was about to di[s]clo[s]e; in vain the di[s]tre[s]sful perplexity, the mysterious [s]ilence and ambiguous an[s]wers of my attendants, e[s]pecially when the condition of my brother was the theme of my inquiries, were remembered. I recalled the interview with Wieland in my chamber, his preternatural tranquillity [s]ucceeded by bur[s]ts of pa[s][s]ion and menacing actions. All the[s]e coincided with the tenor of this paper. Catharine and her children, and Loui[s]a were dead. The act that de[s]troyed them was, in the highe[s]t degree, inhuman. It was worthy of savages trained to murder, and exulting in agonies. Who was the performer of the deed? Wieland! My brother! The hu[s]band and the father! That man of gentle virtues and invincible benignity! placable and mild---an idolator of peace! Surely, [s]aid I, it is a dream. For many days have I been vexed with frenzy. Its dominion is [s]till felt; but new forms are called up to diver[s]ify and augment my torments. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-222.jpg) \- external link  - Page 213. ] The paper dropped from my hand, and my eyes followed it. I [s]hrunk back, as if to avoid [s]ome petrifying influence that approached me. My tongue was mute; all the functions of nature were at a [s]tand, and I [s]unk upon the floor lifele[s]s. The noi[s]e of my fall, as I afterwards heard, alarmed my uncle, who was in a lower apartment, and who[s]e apprehen[s]ions had detained him. He ha[s]tened to my chamber, and admini[s]tered the assistance which my condition required. When I opened my eyes I beheld him before me. His [s]kill as a rea[s]oner as well as a phy[s]ician, was exerted to obviate the injurious effects of this di[s]clo[s]ure; but he had wrongly e[s]timated the [s]trength of my body or of my mind. This new [s]hock brought me once more to the brink of the grave, and my malady was much more difficult to [s]ubdue than at fir[s]t. I will not dwell upon the long train of dreary [s]en[s]ations, and the hideous confu[s]ion of my understanding. Time [s]lowly re[s]tored its cu[s]tomary firmness to my frame, and order to my thoughts. The images impre[s][s]ed upon my mind by this fatal paper were [s]omewhat effaced by my malady. They were ob[s]cure and disjointed like the parts of a dream. I was de[s]irous of freeing my imagination from this chaos. For this end I que[s]tioned my uncle, who was my con[s]tant companion. He was intimidated by the i[s][s]ue of his fir[s]t experiment, and took pains to elude or di[s]courage my inquiry. My impetuosity [s]ome times compelled him to have re[s]ort to mi[s]repre[s]entations and untruths. Time effected that end, perhaps, in a more beneficial manner. In the cour[s]e of my meditations the recollections of the pa[s]t gradually became more di[s]tinct. I revolved them, however, in [s]ilence, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-223.jpg) \- external link  - Page 214. ] and being no longer accompanied with [s]urprize, they did not exerci[s]e a death-dealing power. I had di[s]continued the peru[s]al of the paper in the mid[s]t of the narrative; but what I read, combined with information el[s]ewhere obtained, threw, perhaps, a [s]ufficient light upon the[s]e dete[s]table tran[s]actions; yet my curio[s]ity was not inactive. I de[s]ired to peru[s]e the remainder. My eagerne[s]s to know the particulars of this tale was mingled and abated by my antipathy to the [s]cene which would be di[s]clo[s]ed. Hence I employed no means to effect my purpo[s]e. I de[s]ired knowledge, and, at the [s]ame time, [s]hrunk back from receiving the boon. One morning, being left alone, I ro[s]e from my bed, and went to a drawer where my finer clothing u[s]ed to be kept. I opened it, and this fatal paper [s]aluted my [s]ight. I [s]natched it involuntarily, and withdrew to a chair. I debated, for a few minutes, whether I [s]hould open and read. Now that my fortitude was put to trial, it failed. I felt myself incapable of deliberately [s]urveying a [s]cene of [s]o much horror. I was prompted to return it to its place, but this re[s]olution gave way, and I determined to peru[s]e [s]ome part of it. I turned over the leaves till I came near the conclu[s]ion. The narrative of the criminal was fini[s]hed. The verdict of guilty reluctantly pronounced by the jury, and the accu[s]ed interrogated why [s]entence of death [s]hould not pa[s]s. The an[s]wer was brief, [s]olemn, and emphatical. "No. I have nothing to [s]ay. My tale has been told. My motives have been truly [s]tated. If my judges are unable to di[s]cern the purity of my intentions, or to credit the [s]tatement of them, which I have ju[s]t made; if they [s]ee not that my deed was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-224.jpg) \- external link  - Page 215. ] enjoined by heaven; that obedience was the te[s]t of perfect virtue, and the extinction of [s]elfi[s]hne[s]s and error, they mu[s]t pronounce me a murderer. "They refu[s]e to credit my tale; they impute my acts to the influence of daemons; they account me an example of the highe[s]t wickedne[s]s of which human nature is capable; they doom me to death and in[s]amy. Have I power to e[s]cape this evil? If I have, be [s]ure I will exert it. I will not accept evil at their hand, when I am entitled to good; I will [s]uffer only when I cannot elude [s]uffering. "You [s]ay that I am guilty. Impious and ra[s]h! thus to u[s]urp the prerogatives of your Maker! to [s]et up your bounded views and halting rea[s]on, as the mea[s]ure of truth! "Thou, Omnipotent and Holy! Thou knowe[s]t that my actions were conformable to thy will. I know not what is crime; what actions are evil in their ultimate and comprehen[s]ive tendency or what are good. Thy knowledge, as thy power, is unlimited. I have taken thee for my guide, and cannot err. To the arms of thy protection, I entrust my [s]afety. In the awards of thy ju[s]tice, I confide for my recompen[s]e. "Come death when it will, I am [s]afe. Let calumuy and abhorrence pur[s]ue me among men; I [s]hall not be defrauded of my dues. The peace of virtue, and the glory of obedience, will be my portion hereafter." Here ended the [s]peaker. I withdrew my eyes from the page; but before I had time to reflect on what I had read, Mr. Cambridge entered the room. He quickly perceived how I had been employed, and betrayed [s]ome [s]olicitude re[s]pecting the condition of my mind. His fears, however, were [s]uperfluous. What I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-225.jpg) \- external link  - Page 216. ] had read, threw me into a [s]tate not ea[s]ily de[s]cribed. Angui[s]h and fury, however, had no part in it. My faculties were chained up in wonder and awe. Ju[s]t then, I was unable to [s]peak. I looked at my friend with an air of inqui[s]itivene[s]s, and pointed at the roll. He comprehended my inquiry, and an[s]wered me with looks of gloomy acquie[s]cence. After [s]ome time, my thoughts found their way to my lips. Such then were the acts of my brother. Such were his words. For this he was condemned to die: To die upon the gallows! A fate, cruel and unmerited! And is it [s]o? continued I, [s]truggling for utterance, which this new idea made difficult; is he---dead! "No. He is alive. There could be no doubt as to the cau[s]e of the[s]e exce[s][s]es. They originated in [s]udden madne[s]s; but that madne[s]s continues, and he is condemned to perpetual impri[s]onment." "Madne[s]s, [s]ay you? Are you [s]ure? Were not the[s]e [s]ights, and the[s]e [s]ounds, really [s]een and heard?" My uncle was [s]urprized at my que[s]tion. He looked at me with apparent inquietude. "Can you doubt," [s]aid he, "that the[s]e were illu[s]ions? Does heaven, think you, interfere for [s]uch ends?" "O no; I think it not. Heaven cannot stimulate to [s]uch unheard-of outrage. The agent was not good, but evil." "Nay, my dear girl," [s]aid my friend, "lay a[s]ide the[s]e fancies. Neither angel nor devil had any part in this affair." "You mi[s]under[s]tand me," I an[s]wered; "I believe the agency to be external and real, but not [s]upernatural." "Indeed!" [s]aid he, in an accent of [s]urprize. "Whom do you then [s]uppo[s]e to be the agent?" [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-226.jpg) \- external link  - Page 217. ] "I know not. All is wildering conjecture. I cannot forget Carwin. I cannot bani[s]h the suspicion that he was the [s]etter of the[s]e [s]nares. But how can we [s]uppo[s]e it to be madne[s]s? Did in[s]anity ever before a[s][s]ume this form?" "Frequently. The illu[s]ion, in this ca[s]e, was more dreadful in its con[s]equences, than any that has come to my knowledge; but, I repeat that [s]imilar illu[s]ions are not rare. Did you never hear of an in[s]tance which occurred in your mother's family?" "No. I be[s]eech you relate it. My grandfather's death I have under[s]tood to have been extraordinary, but I know not in what re[s]pect. A brother, to whom he was much attached, died in his youth, and this, as I have heard, influenced, in [s]ome remarkable way, the fate of my grandfather; but I am unacquainted with particulars." "On the death of that brother," re[s]umed my friend, "my father was [s]eized with dejection, which was found to flow from two [s]ources. He not only grieved for the lo[s]s of a friend, but entertained the belief that his own death would be inevitably con[s]equent on that of his brother. He waited from day to day in expectation of the [s]troke which he predicted was [s]peedily to fall upon him. Gradually, however, he recovered his cheerfulne[s]s and confidence. He married, and performed his part in the world with [s]pirit and activity. At the end of twenty-one years it happened that he [s]pent the [s]ummer with his family at an hou[s]e which he po[s][s]e[s][s]ed on the [s]ea coa[s]t in Cornwall. It was at no great di[s]tance from a cliff which overhung the ocean, and ro[s]e into the air to a great height. The [s]ummit was level and [s]ecure, and ea[s]ily ascended on the land [s]ide. The company frequently [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-227.jpg) \- external link  - Page 218. ] repaired hither in clear weather, invited by its pure airs and exten[s]ive pro[s]pects. One evening in June my father, with his wife and [s]ome friends, chanced to be on this [s]pot. Every one was happy, and my father's imagination [s]eemed particularly alive to the grandeur of the [s]cenery. "Suddenly, however, his limbs trembled and his features betrayed alarm. He threw him[s]elf into the attitude of one li[s]tening. He gazed earne[s]tly in a direction in which nothing was vi[s]ible to his friends. This la[s]ted for a minute; then turning to his companions, he told them that his brother had ju[s]t delivered to him a [s]ummons, which mu[s]t be in[s]tantly obeyed. He then took an ha[s]ty and [s]olemn leave of each per[s]on, and, before their surprize would allow them to under[s]tand the [s]cene, he ru[s]hed to the edge of the cliff, threw him[s]elf headlong, and was [s]een no more. "In the cour[s]e of my practice in the German army, many ca[s]es, equally remarkable, have occurred, Unque[s]tionably the illu[s]ions were maniacal, though the vulgar thought otherwi[s]e. They are all reducible to one cla[s]s,  and are not more difficult of explication and cure than mo[s]t affections of our frame." This opinion my uncle endeavoured, by various means, to impre[s]s upon me. I li[s]tened to his reasonings and illu[s]trations with [s]ilent re[s]pect. My astonishment was great on finding proofs of an influence of which I had [s]uppo[s]ed there were no examples; but I was far from accounting for appearances in my uncle's manner. Ideas thronged into my mind which I was unable to disjoin or to regulate. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-228.jpg) \- external link  - Page 219. ] I reflected that this madne[s]s, if madne[s]s it were, had affected Pleyel and my[s]elf as well as Wieland, Pleyel had heard a my[s]terious voice. I had [s]een and heard. A form had [s]howed it[s]elf to me as well as to Wieland. The di[s]clo[s]ure had been made in the [s]ame [s]pot. The appearance was equally complete and equally prodigious in both in[s]tances. Whatever [s]uppo[s]ition I [s]hould adopt, had I not equal rea[s]on to tremble? What was my [s]ecurity again[s]t influences equally terrific and equally irresistable? It would be vain to attempt to de[s]cribe the [s]tate of mind which this idea produced. I wondered at the change which a moment had affected in my brother's condition. Now was I [s]tupified with tenfold wonder in contemplating my[s]elf. Was I not likewi[s]e transformed from rational and human into a creature of namele[s]s and fearful attributes? Was I not tran[s]ported to the brink of the [s]ame aby[s]s? Ere a new day [s]hould come, my hands might be embrued in blood, and my remaining life be consigned to a dungeon and chains. With moral [s]en[s]ibility like mine, no wonder that this new dread was more in[s]upportable than the angui[s]h I had lately endured. Grief carries its own antidote along with it. When thought becomes merely a vehicle of pain, its progre[s]s mu[s]t be stopped. Death is a cure which nature or our[s]elves mu[s]t admini[s]ter: To this cure I now looked forward with gloomy [s]atisfaction. My [s]ilence could not conceal from my uncle the [s]tate of my thoughts. He made unwearied efforts to divert my attention from views [s]o pregnant with danger. His efforts, aided by time, were in [s]ome mea[s]ure [s]ucce[s]sful. Confidence in the [s]trength of my re[s]olution, and in the healthful [s]tate of my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-229.jpg) \- external link  - Page 220. ] faculties, was once more revived. I was able to devote my thoughts to my brother's [s]tate, and the cau[s]es of this di[s]a[s]terous proceeding. My opinions were the [s]port of eternal change. Some times I conceived the apparition to be more than human. I had no grounds on which to build a di[s]belief. I could not deny faith to the evidence of my religion; the te[s]timony of men was loud and unanimous: both the[s]e concurred to per[s]uade me that evil [s]pirits exi[s]ted, and that their energy was frequently exerted in the [s]y[s]tem of the world. The[s]e ideas connected them[s]elves with the image of Carwin. Where is the proof, [s]aid I, that daemons may not be [s]ubjected to the controul of men? This truth may be di[s]torted and deba[s]ed in the minds of the ignorant. The dogmas of the vulgar, with regard to this [s]ubject, are glaringly ab[s]urd; but though the[s]e may ju[s]tly be neglected by the wife, we are [s]carcely ju[s]tified in totally rejecting the po[s][s]ibility that men may obtain supernatural aid. The dreams of [s]uper[s]tition are worthy of contempt. Witchcraft, its in[s]truments and miracles, the compact ratified by a bloody [s]ignature, the apparatus of [s]ulpherous [s]mells and thundering explosions, are mon[s]trous and chimerical. The[s]e have no part in the [s]cene over which the genius of Carwin pre[s]ides. That con[s]cious beings, di[s][s]imilar from human, but moral and voluntary agents as we are, [s]ome where exi[s]t, can [s]carcely be denied. That their aid may be employed to benign or malignant purpo[s]es, cannot be di[s]proved. Darkne[s]s re[s]ts upon the de[s]igns of this man. The extent of his power is unknown; but is there not evidence that it has been now exerted? I recurred to my own experience. Here [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-230.jpg) \- external link  - Page 221. ] Carwin had actually appeared upon the [s]tage; but this was in a human character. A voice and a form were di[s]covered; but one was apparently exerted, and the other di[s]clo[s]ed, not to befriend, but to counteract Carwin's de[s]igns. There were tokens of ho[s]tility, and not of alliance, between them. Carwin was the mi[s]creant who[s]e projects were re[s]i[s]ted by a mini[s]ter of heaven. How can this be reconciled to the [s]tratagem which ruined my brother? There the agency was at once preternatural and malignant. The recollection of this fact led my thoughts into a new channel. The malignity of that influence which governed my brother had hitherto been no [s]ubject of doubt. His wife and children were destroyed; they had expired in agony and fear; yet was it indi[s]putably certain that their murderer was criminal? He was acquitted at the tribunal of his own con[s]cience; his behaviour at his trial and [s]ince, was faithfully reported to me; appearances were uniform; not for a moment did he lay a[s]ide the maje[s]ty of virtue; he repelled all invectives by appealing to the deity, and to the tenor of his pa[s]t life; [s]urely there was truth in this appeal: none but a command from heaven could have [s]wayed his will; and nothing but unerring proof of divine approbation could [s]u[s]tain his mind in its pre[s]ent elevation. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-231.jpg) \- external link  - Page 222. ] Such, for [s]ome time, was the cour[s]e of my meditations. My weakne[s]s, and my aver[s]ion to be pointed at as an object of [s]urprize or compa[s][s]ion, prevented me from going into public. I [s]tudiou[s]ly avoided the vi[s]its of tho[s]e who came to expre[s]s their [s]ympathy, or gratify their curio[s]ity. My uncle was my principal companion. Nothing more powerfully tended to con[s]ole me than his conver[s]ation. With regard to Pleyel, my feelings [s]eemed to have undergone a total revolution. It often happens that one pa[s][s]ion [s]upplants another. Late disasters had rent my heart, and now that the wound was in [s]ome degree clo[s]ed, the love which I had cheri[s]hed for this man [s]eemed likewi[s]e to have vanished. Hitherto, indeed, I had had no cau[s]e for de[s]pair. I was innocent of that offence which had e[s]tranged him from my pre[s]ence. I might rea[s]onably expect that my innocence would at [s]ome time be irre[s]i[s]tably demon[s]trated, and his affection for me be revived with his e[s]teem. Now my aver[s]ion to be thought culpable by him continued, but was unattended with the [s]ame impatience. I de[s]ired the removal of his [s]u[s]picions, not for the [s]ake of regaining his love, but becau[s]e I delighted in the veneration of [s]o excellent a man, and becau[s]e he him[s]elf would derive plea[s]ure from conviction of my integrity. My uncle had early informed me that Pleyel and he had [s]een each other, [s]ince the return of the latter [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-232.jpg) \- external link  - Page 223. ] from Europe. Amid[s]t the topics of their conversation, I di[s]covered that Pleyel had carefully omitted the mention of tho[s]e events which had drawn upon me [s]o much abhorrence. I could not account for his [s]ilence on this [s]ubject. Perhaps time or [s]ome new di[s]covery had altered or [s]haken his opinion. Perhaps he was unwilling, though I were guilty, to injure me in the opinion of my venerable kin[s]man. I under[s]tood that he had frequently vi[s]ited me during my di[s]ea[s]e, had watched many [s]ucce[s][s]ive nights by my bed[s]ide, and manife[s]ted the utmo[s]t anxiety on my account. The journey which he was preparing to take, at the termination of our la[s]t interview, the cata[s]trophe of the en[s]uing night induced him to delay. The motives of this journey I had, till now, totally mistaken. They were explained to me by my uncle, who[s]e tale excited my a[s]toni[s]hment without awakening my regret. In a different [s]tate of mind, it would have added un[s]peakably to my di[s]tre[s]s, but now it was more a [s]ource of plea[s]ure than pain. This, perhaps, is not the lea[s]t extraordinary of the facts contained in this narrative. It will excite le[s]s wonder when I add, that my indifference was temporary, and that the lap[s]e of a few days [s]hewod me that my feelings were deadened for a time, rather than finally extingui[s]hed. There[s]a de Stolberg was alive. She had conceived the re[s]olution of [s]eeking her lover in America. To conceal her flight, [s]he had cau[s]ed the report of her death to be propagated. She put herself under the conduct of Bertrand, the faithful servant of Pleyel. The pacquet which the latter received from the hands of his [s]ervant, contained the tidings of her [s]afe arrival at Bo[s]ton, and to meet her there was the purpo[s]e of his journey. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-233.jpg) \- external link  - Page 224. ] This di[s]covery had [s]et this man's character in a new light. I had mi[s]taken the heroi[s]m of friendship for the phrenzy of love. He who had gained my affections, may be [s]uppo[s]ed to have previou[s]ly entitled him[s]elf to my reverence; but the levity which had formerly characterized the behaviour of this man, tended to ob[s]cure the greatne[s]s of his [s]entiments. I did not fail to remark, that [s]ince this lady was [s]till alive, the voice in the temple which a[s][s]erted her death, mu[s]t either have been intended to deceive, or have been it[s]elf deceived. The latter [s]uppo[s]ition was incon[s]i[s]tent with the notion of a [s]piritual, and the former with that of a benevolent being. When my di[s]ea[s]e abated, Pleyel had forborne his vi[s]its, and had lately [s]et out upon this journey. This amounted to a proof that my guilt was [s]till believed by him. I was grieved for his errors, but tru[s]ted that my vindication would, [s]ooner or later, be made. Meanwhile, tumultuous thoughts were again [s]et afloat by a propo[s]al made to me by my uncle. He imagined that new airs would re[s]tore my languishing con[s]titution, and a varied [s]ucce[s][s]ion of objects tend to repair the [s]hock which my mind had received. For this end, he propo[s]ed to me to take up my abode with him in France or Italy. At a more pro[s]perous period, this [s]cheme would have plea[s]ed for its own [s]ake. Now my heart [s]ickened at the pro[s]pect of nature. The world of man was [s]hrowded in mi[s]ery and blood, and constituted a loath[s]ome [s]pectacle. I willingly clo[s]ed my eyes in [s]leep, and regretted that the re[s]pite it afforded me was [s]o [s]hort. I marked with satisfaction the progre[s]s of decay in my frame, and consented to live, merely in the hope that the cour[s]e of nature would [s]peedily relieve me from the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-234.jpg) \- external link  - Page 225. ] burthen. Neverthele[s]s, as he per[s]i[s]ted in his [s]cheme, I concurred in it merely becau[s]e he was entitled to my gratitude, and becau[s]e my refu[s]al gave him pain. No [s]ooner was he informed of my con[s]ent, than he told me I mu[s]t make immediate preparation to embark, as the [s]hip in which he had engaged a pa[s][s]age would be ready to depart in three days. This expedition was unexpected. There was an impatience in his manner when he urged the necessity of di[s]patch that excited my [s]urprize. When I que[s]tioned him as to the cau[s]e of this ha[s]te, he generally [s]tated rea[s]ons which, at that time, I could not deny to be plau[s]ible; but which, on the review, appeared in[s]ufficient. I [s]u[s]pected that the true motives were concealed, and believed that the[s]e motives had [s]ome connection with my brother's de[s]tiny. I now recollected that the information re[s]pecting Wieland which had, from time to time, been imparted to me, was always accompanied with airs of re[s]erve and my[s]teriou[s]ne[s]s. What had appeared [s]ufficiently explicit at the time it was uttered, I now remembered to have been faltering and ambiguous. I was re[s]olved to remove my doubts, by vi[s]iting the unfortunate man in his dungeon. Heretofore the idea of this vi[s]it had occurred to me; but the horrors of his dwelling-place, his wild yet placid phy[s]iognomy, his neglected locks, the fetters which con[s]trained his limbs, terrible as they were in de[s]cription, how could I endure to behold! Now, however, that I was preparing to take an everla[s]ting farewell of my country, now that an ocean was henceforth to [s]eparate me from him, how could I part without an interview? I would examine his [s]ituation with my own eyes. I would know whether the repre[s]entations which had [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-235.jpg) \- external link  - Page 226. ] been made to me were true. Perhaps the [s]ight of the [s]i[s]ter whom he was wont to love with a pa[s][s]ion more than fraternal, might have an au[s]picious influence on his malady. Having formed this re[s]olution, I waited to communicate it to Mr. Cambridge. I was aware that, without his concurrence, I could not hope to carry it into execution, and could di[s]cover no objection to which it was liable. If I had not been deceived as to his condition, no inconvenience could ari[s]e from this proceeding. His con[s]ent, therefore, would be the te[s]t of his [s]incerity. I [s]eized this opportunity to [s]tate my wi[s]hes on this head. My [s]u[s]picions were confirmed by the manner in which my reque[s]t affected him. After [s]ome pau[s]e, in which his countenance betrayed every mark of perplexity, he [s]aid to me, "Why would you pay this vi[s]it? What u[s]eful purpo[s]e can it [s]erve?" "We are preparing," [s]aid I, "to leave the country forever: What kind of being [s]hould I be to leave behind me a brother in calamity without even a parting interview? Indulge me for three minutes in the [s]ight of him. My heart will be much ea[s]ier after I have looked at him, and [s]hed a few tears in his pre[s]ence." "I believe otherwi[s]e. The [s]ight of him would only augment your di[s]tre[s]s, without contributing, in any degree, to his benefit." "I know not that," returned I. "Surely the [s]ympathy of his [s]i[s]ter, proofs that her tenderne[s]s is as lively as ever, mu[s]t be a [s]ource of [s]atisfaction to him. At pre[s]ent he mu[s]t regard all mankind as his enemies and calumnjators. His [s]i[s]ter he, probably, conceives to partake in the general infatuation, and to join in the cry of abhorrence that is [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-236.jpg) \- external link  - Page 227. ] rai[s]ed again[s]t him. To be undeceived in this respect, to be a[s][s]ured that, however I may impute his conduct to delu[s]ion, I [s]till retain all my former affection for his per[s]on, and veneration for the purity of his motives, cannot but afford him plea[s]ure. When he hears that I have left the country, without even the ceremonious attention of a vi[s]it, what will he think of me? His magnanimity may hinder him from repining, but he will [s]urely con[s]ider my behaviour as [s]avage and unfeeling. Indeed, dear Sir, I mu[s]t pay this vi[s]it. To embark with you without paying it, will be impo[s][s]ible. It may be of no [s]ervice to him, but will enable me to acquit my[s]elf of what I cannot but e[s]teem a duty. Besides," continued I, "if it be a mere fit of infanity that has [s]eized him, may not my pre[s]ence chance to have a [s]alutary influence? The mere [s]ight of me, it is not impo[s][s]ible, may rectify his perceptions." "Ay," [s]aid my uncle, with [s]ome eagerne[s]s; "it is by no means impo[s][s]ible that your interview may have that effect; and for that rea[s]on, beyond all others, would I di[s][s]uade you from it." I expre[s][s]ed my [s]urprize at this declaration. "Is it not to be de[s]ired that an error [s]o fatal as this [s]hould be rectified?" "I wonder at your que[s]tion. Reflect on the con[s]equences of this error. Has he not de[s]troyed the wife whom he loved, the children whom he idolized? What is it that enables him to bear the remembrance, but the belief that he acted as his duty enjoined? Would you ra[s]hly bereave him of this belief? Would you re[s]tore him to him[s]elf, and convince him that he was in[s]tigated to this dreadful outrage by a perver[s]ion of his organs, or a delu[s]ion from hell? "Now his vi[s]ions are joyous and elate. He [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-237.jpg) \- external link  - Page 228. ] conceives him[s]elf to have reached a loftier degree of virtue, than any other human being. The merit of his [s]acrifice is only enhanced in the eyes of superior beings, by the dete[s]tation that pur[s]ues him here, and the [s]ufferings to which he is condemned. The belief that even his [s]i[s]ter has de[s]erted him, and gone over to his enemies, adds to his [s]ublimity of feelings, and his confidence in divine approbation and future recompen[s]e. "Let him be undeceived in this re[s]pect, and what floods of de[s]pair and of horror will overwhelm him! In[s]tead of glowing approbation and [s]erene hope, will he not hate and torture him[s]elf? Self-violence, or a phrenzy far more [s]avage and de[s]tructive than this, may be expected to [s]ucceed. I be[s]eech you, therefore, to relinqui[s]h this [s]cheme. If you calmly reflect upon it, you will di[s]cover that your duty lies in carefully [s]hunning him." Mr. Cambridge's rea[s]onings [s]ugge[s]ted views to my under[s]tanding, that had not hitherto occurred. I could not but admit their validity, but they shewed, in a new light, the depth of that misfortune in which my brother was plunged. I was [s]ilent and irre[s]olute. Pre[s]ently, I con[s]idered, that whether Wieland was a maniac, a faithful [s]ervant of his God, the victim of helli[s]h illu[s]ions, or the dupe of human impo[s]ture, was by no means certain. In this [s]tate of my mind it became me to be [s]ilent during the vi[s]it that I projected. This vi[s]it [s]hould be brief; I [s]hould be [s]atisfied merely to [s]natch a look at him. Admitting that a change in his opinions were not to be de[s]ired, there was no danger from the conduct which I [s]hould pur[s]ue, that this change [s]hould be wrought. But I could not conquer my uncle's aver[s]ion to [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-238.jpg) \- external link  - Page 229. ] this [s]cheme. Yet I per[s]i[s]ted, and he found that to make me voluntarily relinqui[s]h it, it was nece[s][s]ary to be more explicit than he had hitherto been. He took both my hands, and anxiou[s]ly examining my countenance as he [s]poke, "Clara," [s]aid he, "this vi[s]it mu[s]t not be paid. We mu[s]t ha[s]ten with the utmo[s]t expedition from this [s]hore. It is folly to conceal the truth from you, and [s]ince it is only by di[s]clo[s]ing the truth that you can be prevailed upon to lay a[s]ide this project, the truth [s]hall be told. "O my dear girl!" continued he with increa[s]ing energy in his accent, "your brother's phrenzy is, indeed, [s]tupendous and frightful. The [s]oul that formerly actuated his frame has di[s]appeared. The [s]ame form remains; but the wi[s]e and benevolent Wieland is no more. A fury that is rapacious of blood, that lifts his [s]trength almo[s]t above that of mortals, that bends all his energies to the destruction of whatever was once dear to him, po[s][s]e[s][s]es him wholly. "You mu[s]t not enter his dungeon; his eyes will no [s]ooner be fixed upon you, than an exertion of his force will be made. He will [s]hake off his fetters in a moment, and ru[s]h upon you. No interpo[s]ition will then be [s]trong or quick enough to [s]ave you. "The phantom that has urged him to the murder of Catharine and her children is not yet appeased. Your life, and that of Pleyel, are exacted from him by this imaginary being. He is eager to comply with this demand. Twice he has e[s]caped from his pri[s]on. The fir[s]t time, he no [s]ooner found him[s]elf at liberty, than he ha[s]ted to Pleyel's hou[s]e. It being midnight, the latter was in bed. Wieland penetrated unob[s]erved to his chamber, and opened [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-239.jpg) \- external link  - Page 230. ] his curtain. Happily, Pleyel awoke at the critical moment, and e[s]caped the fury of his kin[s]man, by leaping from his chamber-window into the court. Happily, he reached the ground without injury. Alarms were given, and after diligent [s]earch, your brother was found in a chamber of your hou[s]e, whither, no doubt, he had [s]ought you. "His chains, and the watchfulne[s]s of his guards, were redoubled; but again, by [s]ome miracle, he restored him[s]elf to liberty. He was now incautiou[s]ly apprized of the place of your abode: and had not information of his e[s]cape been in[s]tantly given, your death would have been added to the number of his atrocious acts. "You now [s]ee the danger of your project. You mu[s]t not only forbear to vi[s]it him, but if you would [s]ave him from the crime of embruing his hands in your blood, you mu[s]t leave the country. There is no hope that his malady will end but with his life, and no precaution will en[s]ure your [s]afety, but that of placing the ocean between you. "I confe[s]s I came over with an intention to reside among you, but the[s]e di[s]a[s]ters have changed my views. Your own [s]afety and my happine[s]s require that you [s]hould accompany me in my return, and I entreat you to give your cheerful concurrence to this mea[s]ure." After the[s]e repre[s]entations from my uncle, it was impo[s][s]ible to retain my purpo[s]e. I readily con[s]ented to [s]eclude my[s]elf from Wieland's pre[s]ence. I likewise acquie[s]ced in the propo[s]al to go to Europe; not that I ever expected to arrive there, but because, [s]ince my principles forbad me to a[s][s]ail my own life, change had [s]ome tendency to make supportable the few days which di[s]ea[s]e [s]hould [s]pare to me. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-240.jpg) \- external link  - Page 231. ] What a tale had thus been unfolded! I was hunted to death, not by one whom my mi[s]conduct had exa[s]perated, who was con[s]cious of illicit motives, and who [s]ought his end by circumvention and [s]urprize; but by one who deemed him[s]elf commissioned for this act by heaven; who regarded this career of horror as the la[s]t refinement of virtue; who[s]e implacability was proportioned to the reverence and love which he felt for me, and who was inacce[s][s]ible to the fear of puni[s]hment and ignominy! In vain [s]hould I endeavour to [s]tay his hand by urging the claims of a [s]i[s]ter or friend: the[s]e were his only rea[s]ons for pur[s]uing my de[s]truction. Had I been a [s]tranger to his blood; had I been the mo[s]t worthle[s]s of human kind; my [s]afety had not been endangered. Surely, [s]aid I, my fate is without example. The phrenzy which is charged upon my brother, mu[s]t belong to my[s]elf. My foe is manacled and guarded; but I derive no [s]ecurity from the[s]e re[s]traints. I live not in a community of [s]avages; yet, whether I [s]it or walk, go into crouds, or hide my[s]elf in [s]olitude, my life is marked for a prey to inhuman violence; I am in perpetual danger of peri[s]hing; of peri[s]hing under the gra[s]p of a brother! I recollected the omens of this de[s]tiny; I remembered the gulf to which my brother's invitation had conducted me; I remembered that, when on the brink of danger, the author of my peril was depicted by my fears in his form: Thus realized, were the creatures of prophetic [s]leep, and of wakeful terror! The[s]e images were unavoidably connected with that of Carwin. In this paroxy[s]m of di[s]tre[s]s, my attention fa[s]tened on him as the grand deceiver; the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-241.jpg) \- external link  - Page 232. ] author of this black con[s]piracy; the intelligence that governed in this [s]torm. Some relief is afforded in the mid[s]t of [s]uffering, when its author is di[s]covered or imagined; and an object found on which we may pour out our indignation and our vengeance. I ran over the events that had taken place [s]ince the origin of our intercour[s]e with him, and reflected on the tenor of that description which was received from Ludloe. Mixed up with notions of [s]upernatural agency, were the vehement [s]u[s]picions which I entertained, that Carwin was the enemy who[s]e machinations had de[s]troyed us. I thir[s]ted for knowledge and for vengeance. I regarded my ha[s]ty departure with reluctance, [s]ince it would remove me from the means by which this knowledge might be obtained, and this vengeance gratified. This departure was to take place in two days. At the end of two days I was to bid an eternal adieu to my native country. Should I not pay a parting vi[s]it to the [s]cene of the[s]e di[s]a[s]ters? Should I not bedew with my tears the graves of my [s]i[s]ter and her children? Should I not explore their de[s]olate habitation, and gather from the [s]ight of its walls and furniture food for my eternal melancholy? This [s]ugge[s]tion was [s]ucceeded by a [s]ecret shuddering. Some di[s]a[s]trous influence appeared to overhang the [s]cene. How many memorials [s]hould I meet with [s]erving to recall the images of tho[s]e I had lo[s]t! I was tempted to relinqui[s]h my de[s]ign, when it occurred to me that I had left among my papers a journal of tran[s]actions in [s]hort-hand. I was employed in this manu[s]cript on that night when Pleyel's incautious curio[s]ity tempted him to look over my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-242.jpg) \- external link  - Page 233. ] [s]houlder. I was then recording my adventure in the rece[s]s, an imperfect [s]ight of which led him into [s]uch fatal errors. I had regulated the di[s]po[s]ition of all my property. This manu[s]cript, however, which contained the mo[s]t [s]ecret tran[s]actions of my life, I was desirous of de[s]troying. For this end I mu[s]t return to my hou[s]e, and this I immediately determined to do. I was not willing to expo[s]e my[s]elf to oppo[s]ition from my friends, by mentioning my de[s]ign; I therefore be[s]poke the u[s]e of Mr. Hallet's chai[s]e, under pretence of enjoying an airing, as the day was remarkably bright. This reque[s]t was gladly complied with, and I directed the [s]ervant to conduct me to Mettingen. I di[s]ini[s][s]ed him at the gate, intending to u[s]e, in returning, a carriage belonging to my brother. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-243.jpg) \- external link  - Page 234. ] The inhabitants of the HUT received me with a mixture of joy and [s]urprize. Their homely welcome, and their artle[s]s [s]ympathy, were grateful to my feelings. In the mid[s]t of their inquiries, as to my health, they avoided all allu[s]ions to the [s]ource of my malady. They were hone[s]t creatures, and I loved them well. I participated in the tears which they [s]hed when I mentioned to them my [s]peedy departure for Europe, and promi[s]ed to acquaint them with my welfare during my long ab[s]ence. They expre[s][s]ed great [s]urprize when I informed them of my intention to vi[s]it my cottage. Alarm and foreboding over[s]pread their features, and they attempted to di[s][s]uade me from vi[s]iting an hou[s]e which they firmly believed to be haunted by a thousand gha[s]tly apparitions. The[s]e apprehen[s]ions, however, had no power over my conduct. I took an irregular path which led me to my own hou[s]e. All was vacant and forlorn. A [s]mall enclo[s]ure, near which the path led, was the burying-ground belonging to the family. This I was obliged to pa[s]s. Once I had intended to enter it, and ponder on the emblems and inscriptions which my uncle had cau[s]ed to be made on the tombs of Catharine and her children; but now my heart faltered as I approached, and I ha[s]tened forward, that di[s]tance might conceal it from my view. When I approached the rece[s]s, my heart again [s]unk. I averted my eyes, and left it behind me as [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-244.jpg) \- external link  - Page 235. ] quickly as po[s][s]ible. Silence reigned through my habitation, and a darkne[s]s which clo[s]ed doors and [s]hutters produced. Every object was connected with mine or my brother's hi[s]tory. I pa[s][s]ed the entry, mounted the [s]tair, and unlocked the door of my chamber. It was with difficulty that I curbed my fancy and [s]mothered my fears. Slight movements and ca[s]ual [s]ounds were transformed into beckoning [s]hadows and calling [s]hapes. I proceeded to the clo[s]et. I opened and looked round it with fearfulne[s]s. All things were in their accu[s]tomed order. I [s]ought and found the manuscript where I was u[s]ed to depo[s]it it. This being [s]ecured, there was nothing to detain me; yet I [s]tood and contemplated awhile the furniture and walls of my chamber. I remembered how long this apartment had been a [s]weet and tranquil a[s]ylum; I compared its former [s]tate with its pre[s]ent drearine[s]s, and reflected that I now beheld it for the la[s]t time. Here it was that the incomprehen[s]ible behaviour of Carwin was witne[s][s]ed: this the [s]tage on which that enemy of man [s]hewed him[s]elf for a moment unma[s]ked. Here the menaces of murder were wa[s]ted to my ear; and here the[s]e menaces were executed. The[s]e thoughts had a tendency to take from me my [s]elf-command. My feeble limbs refu[s]ed to support me, and I [s]unk upon a chair. Incoherent and half-articulate exclamations e[s]caped my lips. The name of Carwin was uttered, and eternal woes, woes like that which his malice had entailed upon us, were heaped upon him. I invoked all-[s]eeing heaven to drag to light and to puni[s]h this betrayer, and accu[s]ed its providence for having thus long delayed the retribution that was due to [s]o enormous a guilt. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-245.jpg) \- external link  - Page 236. ] I have [s]aid that the window [s]hutters were clo[s]ed. A feeble light, however, found entrance through the crevices. A [s]mall window illuminated the clo[s]et, and the door being clo[s]ed, a dim ray [s]treamed through the key-hole. A kind of twilight was thus created, [s]ufficient for the purpo[s]es of vi[s]ion; but, at the [s]ame time, involving all minuter objects in ob[s]curity. This darkne[s]s [s]uited the colour of my thoughts. I [s]ickened at the remembrance of the pa[s]t. The pro[s]pect of the future excited my loathing. I muttered in a low voice, Why [s]hould I live longer? Why [s]hould I drag a mi[s]erable being? All, for whom I ought to live, have peri[s]hed. Am I not my[s]elf hunted to death? At that moment, my de[s]pair [s]uddenly became vigorous. My nerves were no longer un[s]trung. My powers, that had long been deadened, were revived. My bo[s]om [s]welled with a [s]udden energy, and the conviction darted through my mind, that to end my torments was, at once, practicable and wi[s]e. I knew how to find way to the rece[s][s]es of life. I could u[s]e a laneet with [s]ome [s]kill, and could distinguish between vein and artery. By piercing deep into the latter, I [s]hould [s]hun the evils which the future had in [s]tore for me, and take refuge from my woes in quiet death. I [s]tarted on my feet, for my feeblene[s]s was gone, and ha[s]ted to the clo[s]et. A lancet and other [s]mall in[s]truments were pre[s]erved in a ca[s]e which I had depo[s]ited here. Inattentive as I was to foreign considerations, my ears were [s]till open to any [s]ound of my[s]terious import that [s]hould occur. I thought I heard a [s]tep in the entry. My purpo[s]e was suspended, and I ca[s]t an eager glance at my chamber [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-246.jpg) \- external link  - Page 237. ] door, which was open. No one appeared, unle[s]s the [s]hadow which I di[s]cerned upon the floor, was the outline of a man. If it were, I was authorized to [s]u[s]pect that [s]ome one was po[s]ted clo[s]e to the entrance, who po[s][s]ibly had overheard my exclamations. My teeth chattered, and a wild confu[s]ion took place of my momentary calm. Thus it was when a terrific vi[s]age had di[s]clo[s]ed it[s]elf on a former night. Thus it was when the evil de[s]tiny of Wieland assumed the lineaments of [s]omething human. What horrid apparition was preparing to bla[s]t my [s]ight? Still I li[s]tened and gazed. Not long, for the [s]hadow moved; a foot, un[s]hapely and huge, was thru[s]t forward; a form advanced from its concealment, and [s]talked into the room. It was Carwin! While I had breath I [s]hrieked. While I had power over my mu[s]cles, I motioned with my hand that he [s]hould vani[s]h. My exertions could not la[s]t long; I [s]unk into a fit. O that this grateful oblivion had la[s]ted for ever! Too quickly I recovered my [s]en[s]es. The power of di[s]tinct vi[s]ion was no [s]ooner re[s]tored to me, than this hateful form again pre[s]ented it[s]elf, and I once more relap[s]ed. A [s]econd time, untoward nature recalled me from the [s]leep of death. I found my[s]elf [s]tretched upon the bed. When I had power to look up, I remembered only that I had cau[s]e to fear. My distempered fancy fa[s]hioned to it[s]elf no di[s]tingui[s]hable image. I threw a languid glance round me; once more my eyes lighted upon Carwin. He was [s]eated on the floor, his back re[s]ted again[s]t the wall, his knees were drawn up, and his face was buried in his hands. That his [s]tation was at [s]ome di[s]tance, that his attitude was not menacing, that [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-247.jpg) \- external link  - Page 238. ] his ominous vi[s]age was concealed, may account for my now e[s]caping a [s]hock, violent as tho[s]e which were pa[s]t. I withdrew my eyes, but was not again de[s]erted by my [s]en[s]es. On perceiving that I had recovered my [s]en[s]ibility, he lifted his head. This motion attracted my attention. His countenance was mild, but [s]orrow and a[s]toni[s]hment [s]at upon his features. I averted my eyes and feebly exclaimed---"O! fly---fly far and for ever!---I cannot behold you and live!" He did not ri[s]e upon his feet, but cla[s]ped his hands, and faid in a tone of deprecation---"I will fly. I am become a fiend, the [s]ight of whom destroys. Yet tell me my offence! You have linked cur[s]es with my name; you a[s]cribe to me a malice mon[s]trous and infernal. I look around; all is loneline[s]s and de[s]ert! This hou[s]e and your brother's are [s]olitary and di[s]mantled! You die away at the [s]ight of me! My fear whi[s]pers that [s]ome deed of horror has been perpetrated; that I am the unde[s]igning cau[s]e." What language was this? Had he not avowed him[s]elf a ravi[s]her? Had not this chamber witne[s][s]ed his atrocious purpo[s]es? I be[s]ought him with new vehemence to go. He lifted his eyes---"Great heaven! what have I done? I think I know the extent of my offences. I have acted, but my actions have po[s][s]ibly effected more than I de[s]igned. This fear has brought me back from my retreat. I come to repair the evil of which my ra[s]hne[s]s was the cau[s]e, and to prevent more evil. I come to confe[s]s my errors." "Wretch!" I cried when my [s]uffocating emotions would permit me to [s]peak, "the gho[s]ts of my [s]i[s]ter and her children, do they not ri[s]e to accu[s]e thee? Who was it that bla[s]ted the intellects of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-248.jpg) \- external link  - Page 239. ] Wieland? Who was it that urged him to fury, and guided him to murder? Who, but thou and the devil, with whom thou art confederated?" At the[s]e words a new [s]pirit pervaded his countenance. His eyes once more appealed to heaven. "If I have memory, if I have being, I am innocent. I intended no ill; but my folly, indirectly and remotely, may have cau[s]ed it; but what words are the[s]e! Your brother lunatic! His children dead!" What [s]hould I infer from this deportment? Was the ignorance which the[s]e words implied real or pretended?---Yet how could I imagine a mere human agency in the[s]e events? But if the influence was preternatural or maniacal in my brother's ca[s]e, they mu[s]t be equally [s]o in my own. Then I remembered that the voice exerted, was to [s]ave me from Carwin's attempts. The[s]e ideas tended to abate my abhorrence of this man, and to detect the ab[s]urdity of my accu[s]ations. "Alas!" [s]aid I, "I have no one to accu[s]e. Leave me to my fate. Fly from a [s]cene [s]tained with cruelty; devoted to de[s]pair." Carwin [s]tood for a time mu[s]ing and mournful. At length he faid, "What has happened? I came to expiate my crimes: let me know them in their full extent. I have horrible forebodings! What has happened?" I was [s]ilent; but recollecting the intimation given by this man when he was detected in my closet, which implied [s]ome knowledge of that power which interfered in my favor, I eagerly inquired, "What was that voice which called upon me to hold when I attempted to open the clo[s]et? What face was that which I [s]aw at the bottom of the [s]tairs? An[s]wer me truly." [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-249.jpg) \- external link  - Page 240. ] "I came to confe[s]s the truth. Your allu[s]ions are horrible and [s]trange. Perhaps I have but [s]aint conceptions of the evils which my infatuation has produced; but what remains I will perform. It was my voice that you heard! It was my face that you [s]aw!" For a moment I doubted whether my remembrance of events were not confu[s]ed. How could he be at once [s]tationed at my [s]houlder and [s]hut up in my clo[s]et? How could he [s]tand near me and yet be invi[s]ible? But if Carwin's were the thrilling voice and the fiery vi[s]age which I had heard and [s]een, then was he the prompter of my brother, and the author of the[s]e di[s]mal outrages. Once more I averted my eyes and [s]truggled for [s]peech. "Begone! thou man of mi[s]chief! Remorseless and implacable mi[s]creant! begone!" "I will obey," [s]aid he in a di[s]con[s]olate voice; "yet, wretch as I am, am I unworthy to repair the evils that I have committed? I came as a repentant criminal. It is you whom I have injured, and at your bar am I willing to appear, and confe[s]s and expiate my crimes. I have deceived you: I have [s]ported with your terrors: I have plotted to de[s]troy your reputation. I come now to remove your errors; to [s]et you beyond the reach of [s]imilar fears; to rebuild your [s]ame as far as I am able. "This is the amount of my guilt, and this the fruit of my remor[s]e. Will you not hear me? Listen to my con[s]e[s][s]ion, and then denounce punishment. All I a[s]k is a patient audience." "What!" I replied, "was not thine the voice that commanded my brother to imbrue his hands in the blood of his children---to [s]trangle that angel of [s]weetne[s]s his wife? Has he not vowed my death, and the death of Pleyel, at thy bidding? Ha[s]t thou [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-250.jpg) \- external link  - Page 241. ] not made him the butcher of his family; changed him who was the glory of his [s]pecies into wor[s]e than brute; robbed him of rea[s]on, and con[s]igned the re[s]t of his days to fetters and [s]tripes?" Carwin's eyes glared, and his limbs were petrified at this intelligence. No words were requi[s]ite to prove him guiltle[s]s of the[s]e enormities: at the time, however, I was nearly in[s]en[s]ible to the[s]e exculpatory tokens. He walked to the farther end of the room, and having recovered fome degree of compo[s]ure, he [s]poke--- "I am not this villain; I have [s]lain no one; I have prompted none to [s]lay; I have handled a tool of wonderful efficacy without malignant intentions, but without caution; ample will be the puni[s]hment of my temerity, if my conduct has contributed to this evil." He pau[s]ed.--- I likewi[s]e was [s]ilent. I [s]truggled to command my[s]elf [s]o far as to li[s]ten to the tale which he [s]hould tell. Ob[s]erving this, he continued--- "You are not apprized of the exi[s]tence of a power which I po[s][s]e[s]s. I know not by what name to call it. It enables me to mimic exactly the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-251.jpg) \- external link  - Page 242. ] voice of another, and to modify the [s]ound [s]o that it [s]hall appear to come from what quarter, and be uttered at what di[s]tance I plea[s]e. "I know not that every one po[s][s]e[s][s]es this power. Perhaps, though a ca[s]ual po[s]ition of my organs in my youth [s]hewed me that I po[s][s]e[s][s]ed it, it is an art which may be taught to all. Would to God I had died unknowing of the [s]ecret! It has produced nothing but degradation and calamity. "For a time the po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of [s]o potent and stupendous an endowment elated me with pride. Unfortified by principle, [s]ubjected to poverty, stimulated by headlong pa[s][s]ions, I made this powerful engine [s]ub[s]ervient to the [s]upply of my wants, and the gratification of my vanity. I [s]hall not mention how diligently I cultivated this gift, which [s]eemed capable of unlimited improvement; nor detail the various occa[s]ions on which it was [s]ucce[s]sfully exerted to lead [s]uper[s]tition, conquer avarice, or excite awe. "I left America, which is my native [s]oil, in my youth. I have been engaged in various [s]cenes of life, in which my peculiar talent has been exercised with more or le[s]s [s]ucce[s]s. I was finally betrayed by one who called him[s]elf my friend, into acts which cannot be ju[s]tified, though they are susceptible of apology. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-252.jpg) \- external link  - Page 243. ] "The perfidy of this man compelled me to withdraw from Europe. I returned to my native country, uncertain whether [s]ilence and ob[s]curity would [s]ave me from his malice. I re[s]ided in the purlieus of the city. I put on the garb and a[s][s]umed the manners of a clown. "My chief recreation was walking. My principal haunts were the lawns and gardens of Mettingen. In this delightful region the luxuriances of nature had been cha[s]tened by judicious art, and each [s]ucce[s][s]ive contemplation unfolded new enchantments. "I was [s]tudious of [s]eclu[s]ion: I was [s]atiated with the intercour[s]e of mankind, and di[s]cretion required me to [s]hun their intercour[s]e. For the[s]e reasons I long avoided the ob[s]ervation of your family, and chiefly vi[s]ited the[s]e precincts at night. "I was never weary of admiring the po[s]ition and ornaments of the temple . Many a night have I pa[s][s]ed under its roof, revolving no plea[s]ing meditations. When, in my frequent rambles, I perceived this apartment was occupied, I gave a different direction to my [s]teps. One evening, when a [s]hower had ju[s]t pa[s][s]ed, judging by the [s]ilence that no one was within, I a[s]cended to this building. Glancing carele[s][s]ly round, I perceived an open letter on the pede[s]tal. To read it was doubtle[s]s an offence again[s]t politene[s]s. Of this offence, however, I was guilty. "Scarcely had I gone half through when I was alarmed by the approach of your brother. To [s]cramble down the cliff on the oppo[s]ite [s]ide was impracticable. I was unprepared to meet a stranger. Be[s]ides the aukwardne[s]s attending [s]uch an interview in the[s]e circum[s]tances, concealment was nece[s][s]ary to my [s]afety. A thou[s]and times had I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-253.jpg) \- external link  - Page 244. ] vowed never again to employ the dangerous talent which I po[s][s]e[s][s]ed; but [s]uch was the force of habit and the influence of pre[s]ent convenience, that I u[s]ed this method of arre[s]ting his progre[s]s and leading him back to the hou[s]e, with his errand, whatever it was, unperformed. I had often caught parts, from my [s]tation below, of your conver[s]ation in this place, and was well acquainted with the voice of your [s]i[s]ter. "Some weeks after this I was again quietly seated in this rece[s]s. The latene[s]s of the hour [s]ecured me, as I thought, from all interruption. In this, however, I was mi[s]taken, for Wieland and Pleyel, as I judged by their voices, earne[s]t in di[s]pute, ascended the hill. "I was not [s]en[s]ible that any inconvenience could po[s][s]ibly have flowed from my former exertion; yet it was followed with compunction, becau[s]e it was a deviation from a path which I had a[s][s]igned to my[s]elf. Now my aver[s]ion to this means of e[s]cape was enforced by an unauthorized curio[s]ity, and by the knowledge of a bu[s]hy hollow on the edge of the hill, where I [s]hould be [s]afe from di[s]covery. Into this hollow I thru[s]t my[s]elf. "The propriety of removal to Europe was the que[s]tion eagerly di[s]cu[s][s]ed. Pleyel intimated that his anxiety to go was augmented by the [s]ilence of There[s]a de Stolberg. The temptation to interfere in this di[s]pute was irre[s]i[s]tible. In vain I contended with inveterate habits. I di[s]gui[s]ed to my[s]elf the impropriety of my conduct, by recollecting the benefits which it might produce. Pleyel's propo[s]al was unwi[s]e, yet it was enforced with plau[s]ible arguments and indefatigable zeal. Your brother might be puzzled and wearied, but could not be convinced. I conceived that to terminate the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-254.jpg) \- external link  - Page 245. ] controversy in favor of the latter was conferring a benefit on all parties. For this end I profited by an opening in the conver[s]ation, and a[s][s]ured them of Catharine's irreconcilable aver[s]ion to the [s]cheme, and of the death of the Saxon barone[s]s. The latter event was merely a conjecture, but rendered extremely probable by Pleyel's repre[s]entations. My purpo[s]e, you need not be told, was effected. "My pa[s][s]ion for my[s]tery, and a [s]pecies of imposture, which I deemed harmle[s]s, was thus awakened afre[s]h. This [s]econd lap[s]e into error made my recovery more difficult. I cannot convey to you an adequate idea of the kind of gratification which I derived from the[s]e exploits; yet I meditated nothing. My views were bounded to the pa[s][s]ing moment, and commonly [s]ugge[s]ted by the momentary exigence. "I mu[s]t not conceal any thing. Your principles teach you to abhor a voluptuous temper; but, with whatever reluctance, I acknowledge this temper to be mine. You imagine your [s]ervant Judith to be innocent as well as beautiful; but you took her from a family where hypocri[s]y, as well as licentiousness, was wrought into a [s]y[s]tem. My attention was captivated by her charms, and her principles were ea[s]ily [s]een to be flexible. "Deem me not capable of the iniquity of seduction. Your [s]ervant is not de[s]titute of feminine and virtuous qualities; but [s]he was taught that the be[s]t u[s]e of her charms con[s]i[s]ts in the [s]ale of them. My nocturnal vi[s]its to Mettingen were now prompted by a double view, and my corre[s]pondence with your [s]ervant gave me, at all times, acce[s]s to your hou[s]e. "The [s]econd night after our interview, [s]o brief and [s]o little fore[s]een by either of us, [s]ome daemon [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-255.jpg) \- external link  - Page 246. ] of mi[s]chief [s]eized me. According to my companion's report, your perfections were little le[s]s than divine. Her uncouth but copious narratives converted you into an object of wor[s]hip. She chiefly dwelt upon your courage, becau[s]e [s]he her[s]elf was deficient in that quality. You held apparitions and goblins in contempt. You took no precautions again[s]t robbers. You were ju[s]t as tranquil and [s]ecure in this lonely dwelling, as if you were in the mid[s]t of a crowd. "Hence a vague project occurred to me, to put this courage to the te[s]t. A woman capable of recollection in danger, of warding off groundle[s]s panics, of di[s]cerning the true mode of proceeding, and profiting by her be[s]t re[s]ources, is a prodigy. I was de[s]irous of a[s]certaining whether you were [s]uch an one. "My expedient was obvious and [s]imple: I was to counterfeit a murderous dialogue; but this was to be [s]o conducted that another, and not your[s]elf, [s]hould appear to be the object. I was not aware of the po[s][s]ibility that you [s]hould appropriate the[s]e menaces to your[s]elf. Had you been [s]till and listened, you would have heard the [s]truggles and prayers of the victim, who would likewi[s]e have appeared to be [s]hut up in the clo[s]et, and who[s]e voice would have been Judith's. This [s]cene would have been an appeal to your compa[s][s]ion; and the proof of cowardice or courage which I expected from you, would have been your remaining inactive in your bed, or your entering the clo[s]et with a view to a[s][s]i[s]t the [s]ufferer. Some in[s]tances which Judith related of your fearle[s]ne[s]s and promptitude made me adopt the latter [s]uppo[s]ition with [s]ome degree of confidence. "By the girl's direction I found a ladder, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-256.jpg) \- external link  - Page 247. ] mounted to your clo[s]et window. This is [s]carcely large enough to admit the head, but it an[s]wered my purpo[s]e too well. "I cannot expre[s]s my confu[s]ion and [s]urprize at your abrupt and precipitate flight. I ha[s]tily removed the ladder; and, after [s]ome pau[s]e, curio[s]ity and doubts of your [s]afety induced me to follow you. I found you [s]tretched on the turf before your brother's door, without [s]en[s]e or motion. I felt the deepe[s]t regret at this unlooked-for con[s]equence of my [s]cheme. I knew not what to do to procure you relief. The idea of awakening the family naturally pre[s]ented it[s]elf. This emergency was critical, and there was no time to deliberate. It was a [s]udden thought that occurred. I put my lips to the key-hole, and founded an alarm which effectually rou[s]ed the [s]leepers. My organs were naturally forcible, and had been improved by long and affiduous exerci[s]e. "Long and bitterly did I repent of my [s]cheme. I was [s]omewhat con[s]oled by reflecting that my purpose had not been evil, and renewed my fruitle[s]s vows never to attempt [s]uch dangerous experiments. For [s]ome time I adhered, with laudable forbearance, to this re[s]olution. "My life has been a life of hard[s]hip and exposure. In the [s]ummer I prefer to make my bed of the [s]mooth turf, or, at mo[s]t, the [s]helter of a summer-house [s]uffices. In all my rambles I never found a [s]pot in which [s]o many picture[s]que beauties and rural delights were a[s][s]embled as at Mettingen. No corner of your little domain unites fragrance and [s]ecrecy in [s]o perfect a degree as the rece[s]s in the bank. The odour of its leaves, the coolne[s]s of its [s]hade, and the mu[s]ic of its water-fall, had early attracted my attention. Here my [s]adne[s]s was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-257.jpg) \- external link  - Page 248. ] converted into peaceful melancholy---here my [s]lumbers were [s]ound, and my plea[s]ures enhanced. "As mo[s]t free from interruption, I cho[s]e this as the [s]cene of my midnight interviews with Judith. One evening, as the [s]un declined, I was [s]eated here, when I was alarmed by your approach. It was with difficulty that I effected my e[s]cape unnoticed by you. "At the cu[s]tomary hour, I returned to your habitation, and was made acquainted by Judith, with your unu[s]ual ab[s]ence. I half [s]u[s]pected the true cau[s]e, and felt unea[s]ine[s]s at the danger there was that I [s]hould be deprived of my retreat; or, at lea[s]t, interrupted in the po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of it. The girl, likewi[s]e, informed me, that among your other singularities, it was not uncommon for you to leave your bed, and walk forth for the [s]ake of night-airs and [s]tarlight contemplations. "I de[s]ired to prevent this inconvenience. I found you ea[s]ily [s]wayed by fear. I was influenced, in my choice of means, by the facility and certainty of that to which I had been accu[s]tomed. All that I for[s]aw was, that, in future, this [s]pot would be cautiou[s]ly [s]hunned by you. "I entered the rece[s]s with the utmo[s]t caution, and di[s]covered, by your breathings, in what condition you were. The unexpected interpretation which you placed upon my former proceeding, suggested my conduct on the pre[s]ent occa[s]ion. The mode in which heaven is [s]aid by the poet, to interfere for the prevention of crimes, was [s]omewhat analogous to my province, and never failed to occur to me at [s]ea[s]ons like this. It was requi[s]ite to break [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-258.jpg) \- external link  - Page 249. ] your [s]lumbers, and for this end I uttered the powerful mono[s]yllable, "hold! hold!" My purpo[s]e was not pre[s]cribed by duty, yet [s]urely it was far from being atrocious and inexpiable. To effect it, I uttered what was fal[s]e, but it was well [s]uited to my purpo[s]e. Nothing le[s]s was intended than to injure you. Nay, the evil re[s]ulting from my former act, was partly removed by a[s][s]uring you that in all places but this you were [s]afe. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-259.jpg) \- external link  - Page 250. ] " My morals will appear to you far from rigid, yet my conduct will fall [s]hort of your [s]u[s]picions. I am now to confe[s]s actions le[s]s excu[s]able, and yet [s]urely they will not entitle me to the name of a de[s]perate or [s]ordid criminal. "Your hou[s]e was rendered, by your frequent and long ab[s]ences, ea[s]ily acce[s][s]ible to my curio[s]ity. My meeting with Pleyel was the prelude to direct intercour[s]e with you. I had [s]een much of the world, but your character exhibited a [s]pecimen of human powers that was wholly new to me. My intercour[s]e with your [s]ervant furni[s]hed me with curious details of your dome[s]tic management. I was of a different [s]ex: I was not your hu[s]band; I was not even your friend; yet my knowledge of you was of that kind, which conjugal intimacies can give, and, in [s]ome re[s]pects, more accurate. The ob[s]ervation of your dome[s]tic was guided by me. "You will not be [s]urprized that I [s]hould sometimes profit by your ab[s]ence, and adventure to examine with my own eyes, the interior of your chamber. Upright and [s]incere, you u[s]ed no watchfulne[s]s, and practifed no precautions. I [s]crutinized every thing, and pried every where. Your clo[s]et was u[s]ually locked, but it was once my fortune to find the key on a bureau. I opened and found new [s]cope for my curio[s]ity in your books. One of the[s]e was manu[s]cript, and written in characters which [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-260.jpg) \- external link  - Page 251. ] essentially agreed with a [s]hort-hand [s]y[s]tem which I had learned from a Je[s]uit mi[s][s]ionary. "I cannot ju[s]tify my conduct, yet my only crime was curio[s]ity. I peru[s]ed this volume with eagerne[s]s. The intellect which it unveiled, was brighter than my limited and feeble organs could bear. I was naturally inqui[s]itive as to your ideas re[s]pecting my deportment, and the my[s]teries that had lately occurred. "You know what you have written. You know that in this volume the key to your inmo[s]t [s]oul was contained. If I had been a profound and malignant impo[s]tor, what plenteous materials were thus furni[s]hed me of [s]tratagems and plots! "The coincidence of your dream in the summer-house with my exclamation, was truly wonderful. The voice which warned you to forbear was, doubtle[s]s, mine; but mixed by a common proce[s]s of the fancy, with the train of vi[s]ionary incidents. "I [s]aw in a [s]tronger light than ever, the dangerousness of that in[s]trument which I employed, and renewed my re[s]olutions to ab[s]tain from the u[s]e of it in future; but I was de[s]tined perpetually to violate my re[s]olutions. By [s]ome perver[s]e fate, I was led into circum[s]tances in which the exertion of my powers was the [s]ole or the be[s]t means of e[s]cape. "On that memorable night on which our la[s]t interview took place, I came as u[s]ual to Mettingen. I was apprized of your engagement at your brother's, from which you did not expect to return till late. Some incident [s]ugge[s]ted the de[s]ign of visiting your chamber. Among your books which I had not examined, might be [s]omething tending to illu[s]trate your character, or the hi[s]tory of your [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-261.jpg) \- external link  - Page 252. ] family. Some intimation had been dropped by you in di[s]cour[s]e, re[s]pecting a performance of your father, in which [s]ome important tran[s]action in his life was recorded. "I was de[s]irous of [s]eeing this book; and [s]uch was my habitual attachment to my[s]tery, that I preferred the clande[s]tine peru[s]al of it. Such were the motives that induced me to make this attempt. Judith had di[s]appeared, and finding the hou[s]e unoccupied, I [s]upplied my[s]elf with a light, and proceeded to your chamber. "I found it ea[s]y, on experiment, to lock and unlock your clo[s]et door without the aid of a key. I [s]hut my[s]elf in this rece[s]s, and was bu[s]ily exploring your [s]helves, when I heard [s]ome one enter the room below. I was at a lo[s]s who it could be, whether you or your [s]ervant. Doubtful, however, as I was, I conceived it prudent to extingui[s]h the light. Scarcely was this done, when [s]ome one entered the chamber. The foot[s]teps were ea[s]ily di[s]tingui[s]hed to be yours. "My [s]ituation was now full of danger and perplexity. For [s]ome time, I cheri[s]hed the hope that you would leave the room [s]o long as to afford me an opportunity of e[s]caping. As the hours pa[s][s]ed, this hope gradually de[s]erted me. It was plain that you had retired for the night. "I knew not how [s]oon you might find occa[s]ion to enter the clo[s]et. I was alive to all the horrors of detection, and ruminated without cea[s]ing, on the behaviour which it would be proper, in ca[s]e of detection, to adopt. I was unable to di[s]cover any con[s]i[s]tent method of accounting for my being thus immured. "It occurred to me that I might withdraw you from your chamber for a few minutes, by [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-262.jpg) \- external link  - Page 253. ] counterfeiting a voice from without. Some me[s][s]age from your brother might be delivered, requiring your prefence at his hou[s]e. I was deterred from this [s]cheme by reflecting on the re[s]olution I had formed, and on the po[s][s]ible evils that might re[s]ult from it. Be[s]ides, it was not improbable that you would [s]peedily retire to bed, and then, by the exerci[s]e of [s]ufficient caution, I might hope to e[s]cape unob[s]erved. "Meanwhile I li[s]tened with the deepe[s]t anxiety to every motion from without. I di[s]covered nothing which betokened preparation for [s]leep. Instead of this I heard deep-drawn [s]ighs, and occasionally an half-expre[s][s]ed and mournful ejaculation. Hence I inferred that you were unhappy. The true [s]tate of your mind with regard to Pleyel your own pen had di[s]clo[s]ed; but I [s]uppo[s]ed you to be framed of [s]uch materials, that, though a momentary [s]adne[s]s might affect you, you were impregnable to any permanent and heartfelt grief. Inquietude for my own [s]afety was, for a moment, [s]u[s]pended by [s]ympathy with your di[s]tre[s]s. "To the former con[s]ideration I was quickly recalled by a motion of yours which indicated I knew not what. I fo[s]tered the per[s]ua[s]ion that you would now retire to bed; but pre[s]ently you approached the clo[s]et, and detection [s]eemed to be inevitable. You put your hand upon the lock. I had formed no plan to extricate my[s]elf from the dilemma in which the opening of the door would involve me. I felt an irreconcilable aver[s]ion to detection. Thus [s]ituated, I involuntarily [s]eized the door with a re[s]olution to re[s]i[s]t your efforts to open it. "Suddenly you receded from the door. This deportment was inexplicable, but the relief it afforded me was quickly gone. You returned, and I once [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-263.jpg) \- external link  - Page 254. ] more was thrown into perplexity. The expedient that [s]ugge[s]ted it[s]elf was precipitate and inartificial. I exerted my organs and called upon you to hold . "That you [s]hould per[s]i[s]t in [s]pite of this admonition, was a [s]ubject of a[s]toni[s]hment. I again resisted your efforts; for the fir[s]t expedient having failed, I knew not what other to refort to. In this [s]tate, how was my a[s]toni[s]hment increa[s]ed when I heard your exclamations! "It was now plain that you knew me to be within. Further re[s]i[s]tance was unavailing and useless. The door opened, and I [s]hrunk backward. Seldom have I felt deeper mortification, and more painful perplexity. I did not con[s]ider that the truth would be le[s]s injurious than any lie which I could ha[s]tily frame. Con[s]cious as I was of a certain degree of guilt, I conceived that you would form the mo[s]t odious [s]u[s]picions. The truth would be imperfect, unle[s]s I were likewi[s]e to explain the mysterious admonition which had been given; but that explanation was of too great moment, and involved too exten[s]ive con[s]equences to make me [s]uddenly re[s]olve to give it. "I was aware that this di[s]covery would a[s][s]ociate it[s]elf in your mind, with the dialogue formerly heard in this clo[s]et. Thence would your [s]u[s]picions be aggravated, and to e[s]cape from the[s]e [s]u[s]picions would be impo[s][s]ible. But the mere truth would be [s]ufficiently opprobrious, and deprive me for ever of your good opinion. "Thus was I rendered de[s]perate, and my mind rapidly pa[s][s]ed to the contemplation of the u[s]e that might be made of previous events. Some good genius would appear to you to have interpo[s]ed to [s]ave you from injury intended by me. Why, I [s]aid, [s]ince I mu[s]t [s]ink in her opinion, [s]hould I not cheri[s]h [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-264.jpg) \- external link  - Page 255. ] this belief? Why not per[s]onate an enemy, and pretend that cele[s]tial interference has fru[s]trated my [s]chemes? I mu[s]t fly, but let me leave wonder and fear behind me. Elucidation of the my[s]tery will always be practicable. I [s]hall do no injury, but merely talk of evil that was de[s]igned, but is now pa[s]t. "Thus I extenuated my conduct to my[s]elf, but I [s]carcely expect that this will be to you a [s]ufficient explication of the [s]cene that followed. Tho[s]e habits which I have imbibed, the rooted pa[s][s]ion which po[s][s]e[s][s]es me for [s]cattering around me amazement and fear, you enjoy no opportunities of knowing. That a man [s]hould wantonly impute to him[s]elf the mo[s]t flagitious de[s]igns, will hardly be credited, even though you reflect that my reputation was already, by my own folly, irretrievably ruined; and that it was always in my power to communicate the truth, and rectify the mi[s]take. "I left you to ponder on this [s]cene. My mind was full of rapid and incongruous ideas. Compunction, [s]elf-upbraiding, hopele[s]ne[s]s, [s]atisfaction at the view of tho[s]e effects likely to flow from my new [s]cheme, mi[s]givings as to the beneficial re[s]ult of this [s]cheme took po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of my mind, and [s]eemed to [s]truggle for the ma[s]tery. "I had gone too far to recede. I had painted my[s]elf to you as an a[s][s]a[s][s]in and ravi[s]her, withheld from guilt only by a voice from heaven. I had thus reverted into the path of error, and now, having gone thus far, my progre[s]s [s]eemed to be irrevocable. I [s]aid to my[s]elf, I mu[s]t leave the[s]e precincts for ever. My acts have bla[s]ted my fame in the eyes of the Wiclands. For the [s]ake of creating a my[s]terious dread, I have made my[s]elf a villain. I may complete this my[s]terious plan by [s]ome new [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-265.jpg) \- external link  - Page 256. ] impo[s]ture, but I cannot aggravate my [s]uppo[s]ed guilt. "My re[s]olution was formed, and I was [s]wiftly ruminating on the means for executing it, when Pleyel appeared in [s]ight. This incident decided my conduct. It was plain that Pleyel was a devoted lover, but he was, at the [s]ame time, a man of cold re[s]olves and exqui[s]ite [s]agacity. To deceive him would be the [s]weete[s]t triumph I had ever enjoyed. The deception would be momentary, but it would likewi[s]e be complete. That his delu[s]ion would [s]o [s]oon be rectified, was a recommendation to my [s]cheme, for I e[s]teemed him too much to de[s]ire to entail upon him la[s]ting agonies. "I had no time to reflect further, for he proceeded, with a quick [s]tep, towards the hou[s]e. I was hurried onward involuntarily and by a mechanical impul[s]e. I followed him as he pa[s][s]ed the recess in the bank, and [s]hrowding my[s]elf in that [s]pot, I counterfeited [s]ounds which I knew would arre[s]t his [s]teps. "He [s]topped, turned, li[s]tened, approached, and overheard a dialogue who[s]e purpo[s]e was to vanquish his belief in a point where his belief was mo[s]t difficult to vanqui[s]h. I exerted all my powers to imitate your voice, your general [s]entiments, and your language. Being ma[s]ter, by means of your journal, of your per[s]onal hi[s]tory and mo[s]t [s]ecret thoughts, my efforts were the more [s]ucce[s]sful. When I reviewed the tenor of this dialogue, I cannot believe but that Pleyel was deluded. When I think of your character, and of the inferences which this dialogue was intended to [s]ugge[s]t, it [s]eems incredible that this delu[s]ion [s]hould be produced. "I [s]pared not my[s]elf. I called my[s]elf murderer, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-266.jpg) \- external link  - Page 257. ] thief, guilty of innumerable prejuries and mi[s]deeds: that you had deba[s]ed your[s]elf to the level of [s]uch an one, no evidence, methought, would [s]uffice to convince him who knew you [s]o thoroughly as Pleyel; and yet the impo[s]ture amounted to proof which the mo[s]t jealous [s]crutiny would find to be unexceptionable. "He left his [s]tation precipitately and re[s]umed his way to the hou[s]e. I [s]aw that the detection of his error would be in[s]tantaneous, [s]ince, not having gone to bed, an immediate interview would take place between you. At fir[s]t this circum[s]tance was con[s]idered with regret; but as time opened my eyes to the po[s][s]ible con[s]equences of this [s]cene, I regarded it with plea[s]ure. "In a [s]hort time the infatuation which had led me thus far began to [s]ub[s]ide. The remembrance of former rea[s]onings and tran[s]actions was renewed. How often I had repented this kind of exertion; how many evils were produced by it which I had not fore[s]een; what occa[s]ions for the bittere[s]t remorse it had admini[s]tered, now pa[s][s]ed through my mind. The black catalogue of [s]tratagems was now increa[s]ed. I had in[s]pired you with the mo[s]t vehement terrors: I had filled your mind with faith in [s]hadows and confidence in dreams: I had depraved the imagination of Pleyel: I had exhibited you to his under[s]tanding as devoted to brutal gratifications and con[s]ummate in hypocri[s]y. The evidence which accompanied this delu[s]ion would be irre[s]i[s]tible to one who[s]e pa[s][s]ion had perverted his judgment, who[s]e jealou[s]y with regard to me had already been excited, and who, therefore, would not fail to overrate the force of this evidence. What fatal act of de[s]pair or of vengeance might not this error produce? [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-267.jpg) \- external link  - Page 258. ] "With regard to my[s]elf, I had acted with a phrenzy that [s]urpa[s][s]ed belief. I had warred again[s]t my peace and my fame: I had bani[s]hed my[s]elf from the fellow[s]hip of vigorous and pure minds: I was [s]elf-expelled from a [s]cene which the munificence of nature had adorned with unrivalled beauties, and from haunts in which all the mu[s]es and humanities had taken refuge. "I was thus torn by conflicting fears and tumultuous regrets. The night pa[s][s]ed away in this [s]tate of confu[s]ion; and next morning in the gazette left at my ob[s]cure lodging, I read a de[s]cription and an offer of reward for the apprehen[s]ion of my person. I was [s]aid to have e[s]caped from an Iri[s]h prison, in which I was confined as an offender convicted of enormous and complicated crimes. "This was the work of an enemy, who, by fal[s]ehood and [s]tratagem, had procured my condemnation. I was, indeed, a pri[s]oner, but e[s]caped, by the exertion of my powers, the fate to which I was doomed, but which I did not de[s]erve. I had hoped that the malice of my foe was exhau[s]ted; but I now perceived that my precautions had been wi[s]e, for that the intervention of an ocean was insufficient for my [s]ecurity. "Let me not dwell on the [s]en[s]ations which this di[s]covery produced. I need not tell by what [s]teps I was induced to [s]eek an interview with you, for the purpo[s]e of di[s]clo[s]ing the truth, and repairing, as far as po[s][s]ible, the effects of my mi[s]conduct. It was unavoidable that this gazette would fall into your hands, and that it would tend to confirm every erroneous impre[s][s]ion. "Having gained this interview, I purpo[s]ed to [s]eek [s]ome retreat in the wilderne[s]s, inacce[s][s]ible to your inquiry and to the malice of my foe, where [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-268.jpg) \- external link  - Page 259. ] I might henceforth employ my[s]elf in compo[s]ing a faithful narrative of my actions. I de[s]igned it as my vindication from the a[s]per[s]ions that had re[s]ted on my character, and as a le[s][s]on to mankind on the evils of credulity on the one hand, and of imposture on the other. "I wrote you a billet, which was left at the hou[s]e of your friend, and which I knew would, by [s]ome means, [s]peedily come to your hands. I entertained a [s]aint hope that my invitation would be complied with. I knew not what u[s]e you would make of the opportunity which this propo[s]al afforded you of procuring the [s]eizure of my per[s]on; but this fate I was determined to avoid, and I had no doubt but due circum[s]pection, and the exerci[s]e of the faculty which I po[s][s]e[s][s]ed, would enable me to avoid it. "I lurked, through the day, in the neighbourhood of Mettingen: I approached your habitation at the appointed hour: I entered it in [s]ilence, by a trap-door which led into the cellar. This had formerly been bolted on the in[s]ide, but Judith had, at an early period in our intercour[s]e, removed this impediment. I a[s]cended to the fir[s]t floor, but met with no one, nor any thing that indicated the presence of an human being. "I crept [s]oftly up [s]tairs, and at length perceived your chamber door to be opened, and a light to be within. It was of moment to di[s]cover by whom this light was accompanied. I was [s]en[s]ible of the inconveniencies to which my being di[s]covered at your chamber door by any one within would subject me; I therefore called out in my own voice, but [s]o modified that it [s]hould appear to a[s]cend from the court below, `Who is in the chamber? Is it Mi[s]s Wieland?' [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-269.jpg) \- external link  - Page 260. ] "No an[s]wer was returned to this [s]ummons. I li[s]tened, but no motion could be heard. After a pau[s]e I repeated my call, but no le[s]s ineffectually. "I now approached nearer the door, and adventured to look in. A light [s]tood on the table, but nothing human was di[s]cernible. I entered cautiously, but all was [s]olitude and [s]tillne[s]s. "I knew not what to conclude. If the hou[s]e were inhabited, my call would have been noticed; yet [s]ome [s]u[s]picion in[s]inuated it[s]elf that [s]ilence was [s]tudiou[s]ly kept by per[s]ons who intended to [s]urprize me. My approach had been wary, and the [s]ilence that en[s]ued my call had likewi[s]e preceded it; a circumstance that tended to di[s][s]ipate my fears. "At length it occurred to me that Judith might po[s][s]ibly be in her own room. I turned my [s]teps thither; but [s]he was not to be found. I pa[s][s]ed into other rooms, and was [s]oon convinced that the hou[s]e was totally de[s]erted. I returned to your chamber, agitated by vain [s]urmi[s]es and oppo[s]ite conjectures. The appointed hour had pa[s][s]ed, and I di[s]mi[s][s]ed the hope of an interview. "In this [s]tate of things I determined to leave a few lines on your toilet, and pro[s]ecute my journey to the mountains. Scarcely had I taken the pen when I laid it a[s]ide, uncertain in what manner to addre[s]s you. I ro[s]e from the table and walked acro[s]s the floor. A glance thrown upon the bed acquainted me with a [s]pectacle to which my conceptions of horror had not yet reached. "In the mid[s]t of [s]huddering and trepidation, the [s]ignal of your pre[s]ence in the court below recalled me to my[s]elf. The deed was newly done: I only was in the hou[s]e: what had lately happened justified any [s]u[s]picions, however enormous. It was plain that this cata[s]trophe was unknown to you: I [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-270.jpg) \- external link  - Page 261. ] thought upon the wild commotion which the discovery would awaken in your brea[s]t: I found the confu[s]ion of my own thoughts unconquerable, and perceived that the end for which I [s]ought an interview was not now to be accompli[s]hed. "In this [s]tate of things it was likewi[s]e expedient to conceal my being within. I put out the light and hurried down [s]tairs. To my un[s]peakable surprize, notwith[s]tanding every motive to fear, you lighted a candle and proceeded to your chamber. "I retired to that room below from which a door leads into the cellar. This door concealed me from your view as you pa[s][s]ed. I thought upon the spectacle which was about to pre[s]ent it[s]elf. In an exigence [s]o abrupt and [s]o little fore[s]een, I was again [s]ubjected to the empire of mechanical and habitual impul[s]es. I dreaded the effects which this shocking exhibition, bur[s]ting on your unprepared [s]en[s]es, might produce. "Thus actuated, I [s]tept [s]wi[s]tly to the door, and thru[s]ting my head forward, once more pronounced the my[s]terious interdiction. At that moment, by [s]ome untoward fate, your eyes were ca[s]t back, and you [s]aw me in the very act of utterance. I fled through the dark [s]ome avenue at which I entered, covered with the [s]hame of this detection. "With diligence, [s]timulated by a thou[s]and ineffable emotions, I pur[s]ued my intended journey. I have a brother who[s]e farm is [s]ituated in the bosom of a [s]ertile de[s]ert, near the [s]ources of the Leheigh, and thither I now repaired. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-271.jpg) \- external link  - Page 262. ] " Deeply did I ruminate on the occurrences that had ju[s]t pa[s][s]ed. Nothing excited my wonder [s]o much as the means by which you di[s]covered my being in the clo[s]et. This di[s]covery appeared to be made at the moment when you attempted to open it. How could you have otherwi[s]e remained [s]o long in the chamber apparently fearle[s]s and tranquil? And yet, having made this di[s]covery, how could you per[s]i[s]t in dragging me forth: per[s]i[s]t in defiance of an interdiction to emphatical and solemn? "But your [s]i[s]ter's death was an event dete[s]table and ominous. She had been the victim of the mo[s]t dreadful [s]pecies of a[s][s]a[s][s]ination. How, in a [s]tate like yours, the murderous intention could be generated, was wholly inconceivable. "I did not relinqui[s]h my de[s]ign of confe[s][s]ing to you the part which I had [s]u[s]tained in your family, but I was willing to defer it till the ta[s]k which I had [s]et my[s]elf was fini[s]hed. That being done, I re[s]umed the re[s]olution. The motives to incite me to this continually acquired force. The more I revolved the events happening at Mettingen, the more in[s]upportable and ominous my terrors became. My waking hours and my [s]leep were vexed by di[s]mal pre[s]ages and frightful intimations. "Catharine was dead by violence. Surely my malignant [s]tars had nor made me the cau[s]e of her death; yet had I not ra[s]hly [s]et in motion a machine, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-272.jpg) \- external link  - Page 263. ] ever who[s]e progre[s]s I had no controul, and which experience had [s]hewn me was infinite in power? Every day might add to the catalogue of horrors of which this was the [s]ource, and a [s]ea[s]onable disclosure of the truth might prevent numberle[s]s ills. "Fraught with this conception, I have turned my [s]teps hither. I find your brother's hou[s]e desolate: the furniture removed, and the walls [s]tained with damps. Your own is in the [s]ame [s]ituation. Your chamber is di[s]mantled and dark, and you exhibit an image of incurable grief, and of rapid decay. "I have uttered the truth. This is the extent of my offences. You tell me an horrid tale of Wieland being led to the de[s]truction of his wife and children, by [s]ome my[s]terious agent. You charge me with the guilt of this agency; but I repeat that the amount of my guilt has been truly [s]tated. The perpetrator of Catharine's death was unknown to me till now; nay, it is [s]till unknown to me." At that moment, the clo[s]ing of a door in the kitchen was di[s]tinctly heard by us. Carwin [s]tarted and pau[s]ed. "There is [s]ome one coming. I mu[s]t not be found here by my enemies, and need not, [s]ince my purpo[s]e is an[s]wered." I had drunk in, with the mo[s]t vehement attention, every word that he had uttered. I had no breath to interrupt his tale by interrogations or comments. The power that he [s]poke of was hitherto unknown to me: its exi[s]tence was incredible; it was susceptible of no direct proof. He owns that his were the voice and face which I heard and [s]aw. He attempts to give an human explanation of the[s]e phanta[s]ms; but it is enough that he owns him[s]elf to be the agent; his tale is a lie, and his nature devili[s]h. As he deceived me, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-273.jpg) \- external link  - Page 264. ] he likewi[s]e deceived my brother, and now do I behold the author of all our calamities! Such were my thoughts when his pau[s]e allowed me to think. I [s]hould have bad him begone if the [s]ilence had not been interrupted; but now I feared no more for my[s]elf; and the milkine[s]s of my nature was curdled into hatred and rancour. Some one was near, and this enemy of God and man might po[s][s]ibly be brought to ju[s]tice. I reflected not that the preternatural power which he had hitherto exerted, would avail to re[s]cue him from any toils in which his feet might be entangled. Meanwhile, looks, and not words of menace and abhorrence, were all that I could be[s]tow. He did not depart. He [s]eemed dubious, whether, by pa[s][s]ing out of the hou[s]e, or by remaining somewhat longer where he was, he [s]hould mo[s]t endanger his [s]afety. His confu[s]ion increa[s]ed when [s]teps of one barefoot were heard upon the [s]tairs. He threw anxious glances [s]ometimes at the clo[s]et, sometimes at the window, and [s]ometimes at the chamber door, yet he was detained by [s]ome inexplicable fascination. He [s]tood as if rooted to the [s]pot. As to me, my [s]oul was bur[s]ting with dete[s]tation and revenge. I had no room for [s]urmi[s]es and fears re[s]pecting him that approached. It was doubtle[s]s a human being, and would befriend me [s]o far as to aid me in arre[s]ting this offender. The [s]tranger quickly entered the room. My eyes and the eyes of Carwin were, at the [s]ame moment, darted upon him. A [s]econd glance was not needed to inform us who he was. His locks were tangled, and [s]ell confu[s]edly over his forehead and ears. His [s]hirt was of coar[s]e [s]tuff, and open at the neck and brea[s]t. His coat was once of bright and fine texture, but now torn and tarni[s]ed [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-274.jpg) \- external link  - Page 265. ] with du[s]t. His feet, his legs, and his arms were bare. His features were the [s]eat of a wild and tranquil [s]olemnity, but his eyes be[s]poke inquietude and curio[s]ity. He advanced with firm [s]tep, and looking as in [s]earch of [s]ome one. He [s]aw me and [s]topped. He bent his [s]ight on the floor, and clenching his hands, appeared [s]uddenly ab[s]orbed in meditation. Such were the figure and deportment of Wieland! Such, in his fallen [s]tate, were the a[s]pect and gui[s]e of my brother! Carwin did not fail to recognize the vi[s]itant. Care for his own [s]afety was apparently [s]wallowed up in the amazement which this [s]pectacle produced. His [s]tation was con[s]picuous, and he could not have e[s]caped the roving glances of Wieland; yet the latter [s]eemed totally uncon[s]cious of his presence. Grief at this [s]cene of ruin and bla[s]t was at fir[s]t the only [s]entiment of which I was con[s]cious. A fearful [s]tillne[s]s en[s]ued. At length Wieland, lifting his hands, which were locked in each other, to his brea[s]t, exclaimed, "Father! I thank thee. This is thy guidance. Hither thou ha[s]t led me, that I might perform thy will: yet let me not err: let me hear again thy me[s][s]enger!" He [s]tood for a minute as if li[s]tening; but recovering from his attitude, he continued---"It is not needed. Da[s]tardly wretch! thus eternally questioning the behe[s]ts of thy Maker! weak in resolution! wayward in faith!" He advanced to me, and, after another pau[s]e, resumed: "Poor girl! a di[s]mal fate has [s]et its mark upon thee. Thy life is demanded as a [s]acrifice. Prepare thee to die. Make not my office difficult by fruitle[s]s oppo[s]ition. Thy prayers might [s]ubdue [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-275.jpg) \- external link  - Page 266. ] [s]tones; but none but he who enjoined my purpo[s]e can [s]hake it." The[s]e words were a [s]ufficient explication of the [s]cene. The nature of his phrenzy, as de[s]cribed by my uncle, was remembered. I who had [s]ought death, was now thrilled with horror becau[s]e it was near. Death in this form, death from the hand of a brother, was thought upon with unde[s]cribable repugnance. In a [s]tate thus verging upon madne[s]s, my eye glanced upon Carwin. His a[s]toni[s]hment appeared to have [s]truck him motionle[s]s and dumb. My life was in danger, and my brother's hand was about to be embrued in my blood. I firmly believed that Carwin's was the in[s]tigation. I could re[s]cue me from this abhorred fate; I could di[s][s]ipate this tremendous illu[s]ion; I could [s]ave my brother from the perpetration of new horrors, by pointing out the devil who [s]educed him; to he[s]itate a moment was to peri[s]h. The[s]e thoughts gave [s]trength to my limbs, and energy to my accents: I [s]tarted on my feet. "O brother! [s]pare me, [s]pare thy[s]elf: There is thy betrayer. He counterfeited the voice and face of an angel, for the purpo[s]e of de[s]troying thee and me. He has this moment confe[s][s]ed it. He is able to [s]peak where he is not. He is leagued with hell, but will not avow it; yet he confe[s][s]es that the agency was his." My brother turned [s]lowly his eyes, and fixed them upon Carwin. Every joint in the frame of the latter trembled. His complexion was paler than a gho[s]t's. His eye dared not meet that of Wieland, but wandered with an air of di[s]traction from one [s]pace to another. "Man," [s]aid my brother, in a voice totally unlike that which he had u[s]ed to me, "what art [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-276.jpg) \- external link  - Page 267. ] thou? The charge has been made. An[s]wer it. The vi[s]age---the voice---at the bottom of the[s]e [s]tairs---at the hour of eleven---To whom did they belong? To thee?" Twice did Carwin attempt to [s]peak, but his words died away upon his lips. My brother resumed in a tone of greater vehemence--- "Thou faltere[s]t; faltering is ominous; [s]ay yes or no: one word will [s]uffice; but beware of falsehood. Was it a [s]tratagem of hell to overthrow my family? Wa[s]t thou the agent?" I now [s]aw that the wrath which had been prepared for me was to be heaped upon another. The tale that I heard from him, and his pre[s]ent trepidations, were abundant te[s]timonies of his guilt. But what if Wieland [s]hould be undeceived! What if he [s]hall find his acts to have proceeded not from an heavenly prompter, but from human treachery! Will not his rage mount into whirlwind? Will not he rare limb this devoted wretch? In[s]tinctively I recoiled from this image, but it gave place to another. Carwin may be innocent, but the impetuo[s]ity of his judge may mi[s]con[s]true his an[s]wers into a con[s]e[s][s]ion of guilt. Wieland knows not that my[s]terious voices and appearances were likewi[s]e witne[s][s]ed by me. Carwin may be ignorant of tho[s]e which mi[s]led my brother. Thus may his an[s]wers unwarily betray him[s]elf to ruin. Such might be the con[s]equences of my frantic precipitation, and the[s]e, it was nece[s][s]ary, if po[s][s]ible, to prevent. I attempted to [s]peak, but Wieland, turning [s]uddenly upon me, commanded [s]ilence, in a tone furious and terrible. My lips clo[s]ed, and my tongue refu[s]ed its office. "What art thou?" he re[s]umed, addre[s][s]ing him[s]elf to Carwin. "An[s]wer me; who[s]e form--- [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-277.jpg) \- external link  - Page 268. ] who[s]e voice---was it thy contrivance? An[s]wer me." The an[s]wer was now given, but confu[s]edly and [s]carcely articulated. "I meant nothing---I intended no ill---if I under[s]tand---if I do not mi[s]take you---it is too true---I did appear---in the entry---did [s]peak. The contrivance was mine, but---" The[s]e words were no [s]ooner uttered, than my brother cea[s]ed to wear the [s]ame a[s]pect. His eyes were downca[s]t: he was motionle[s]s: his re[s]piration became hoar[s]e, like that of a man in the agonies of death. Carwin [s]eemed unable to [s]ay more. He might have ea[s]ily e[s]caped, but the thought which occupied him related to what was horrid and unintelligible in this [s]cene, and not to his own danger. Pre[s]ently the faculties of Wieland, which, for a time, were chained up, were [s]eized with re[s]tle[s][s]ne[s]s and trembling. He broke [s]ilence. The [s]toute[s]t heart would have been appalled by the tone in which he [s]poke. He addre[s][s]ed him[s]elf to Carwin. "Why art thou here? Who detains thee? Go and learn better. I will meet thee, but it mu[s]t he at the bar of thy Maker. There [s]hall I bear witness again[s]t thee." Perceiving that Carwin did not obey, he continued; "Do[s]t thou wi[s]h me to complete the catalogue by thy death? Thy life is a worthle[s]e thing. Tempt me no more. I am but a man, and thy pre[s]ence may awaken a [s]ury which may [s]purn my controul. Begone!" Carwin, irre[s]olute, [s]triving in vain for utterance, his complexion pallid as death, his knees beating one again[s]t another, [s]lowly obeyed the mandate and withdrew. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-278.jpg) \- external link  - Page 269. ] A Few words more and I lay a[s]ide the pen for ever. Yet why [s]hould I not relinqui[s]h it now? All that I have [s]aid is preparatory to this [s]cene, and my fingers, tremulous and cold as my heart, refu[s]e any further exertion. This mu[s]t not be. Let my la[s]t energies [s]upport me in the fini[s]hing of this ta[s]k. Then will I lay down my head in the lap of death. Hu[s]hed will be all my murmurs in the [s]leep of the grave. Every [s]entiment has peri[s]hed in my bo[s]om. Even friend[s]hip is extinct. Your love for me has prompted me to this ta[s]k; but I would not have complied if it had not been a luxury thus to fea[s]t upon my woes. I have ju[s]tly calculated upon my remnant of [s]trength. When I lay down the pen the taper of life will expire: my exi[s]tence will terminate with my tale. Now that I was left alone with Wieland, the perils of my [s]ituation pre[s]ented them[s]elves to my mind. That this paroxy[s]m [s]hould terminate in havock and rage it was rea[s]onable to predict. The fir[s]t [s]ugge[s]tion of my fears had been di[s]proved by my experience. Carwin had acknowledged his offences, and yet had e[s]caped. The vengeance which I had harboured had not been admitted by Wieland, and yet the evils which I had endured, compared with tho[s]e inflicted on my brother, were as nothing. I thir[s]ted for his blood, and was tormented with an in[s]atiable appetite for his de[s]truction; yet my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-279.jpg) \- external link  - Page 270. ] brother was unmoved, and had di[s]mi[s][s]ed him in [s]afety. Surely thou wa[s]t more than man, while I am [s]unk below the bea[s]ts. Did I place a right con[s]truction on the conduct of Wieland? Was the error that mi[s]led him [s]o ea[s]ily rectified? Were views [s]o vivid and faith [s]o [s]trenuous thus liable to fading and to change? Was there not rea[s]on to doubt the accuracy of my perceptions? With images like the[s]e was my mind thronged, till the deportment of my brother called away my attention. I [s]aw his lips move and his eyes ca[s]t up to heaven. Then would he li[s]ten and look back, as if in expectation of [s]ome one's appearance. Thrice he repeated the[s]e ge[s]ticulations and this inaudible prayer. Each time the mi[s]t of confu[s]ion and doubt [s]eemed to grow darker and to [s]ettle on his understanding. I gue[s][s]ed at the meaning of the[s]e tokens. The words of Carwin had [s]haken his belief, and he was employed in [s]ummoning the me[s][s]enger who had formerly communed with him, to atte[s]t the value of tho[s]e new doubts. In vain the [s]ummons was repeated, for his eye met nothing but vacancy, and not a [s]ound [s]aluted his ear. He walked to the bed, gazed with eagerne[s]s at the pillow which had [s]u[s]tained the head of the breathle[s]s Catharine, and then returned to the place where I [s]at. I had no power to li[s]t my eyes to his face: I was dubious of his purpo[s]e: this purpo[s]e might aim at my life. Alas! nothing but [s]ubjection to danger, and exposure to temptation, can [s]how us what we are. By this te[s]t was I now tried, and found to be cowardly and ra[s]h. Men can deliberately untie the thread of life, and of this I had deemed my[s]elf capable; yet now that I [s]tood upon the brink of fate, [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-280.jpg) \- external link  - Page 271. ] that the knife of the [s]acrificer was aimed at my heart, I [s]huddered and betook my[s]elf to any means of e[s]cape, however mon[s]trous. Can I bear to think---can I endure to relate the outrage which my heart meditated? Where were my means of [s]afety? Re[s]i[s]tance was vain. Not even the energy of de[s]pair could [s]et me on a level with that [s]trength which his terrific prompter had be[s]towed upon Wieland. Terror enables us to perform incredible [s]eats; but terror was not then the [s]tate of my mind; where then were my hopes of re[s]cue? Methinks it is too much. I [s]tand a[s]ide, as it were, from my[s]elf; I e[s]timate my own de[s]ervings; a hatred, immortal and inexorable, is my due. I li[s]ten to my own pleas, and find them empty and fal[s]e: yes, I acknowledge that my guilt [s]urpa[s][s]es that of all mankind: I confe[s]s that the cur[s]es of a world, and the frowns of a deity, are inadequate to my demerits. Is there a thing in the world worthy of infinite abhorrence? It is I. What [s]hall I [s]ay! I was menaced, as I thought, with death, and, to elude this evil, my hand was ready to inflict death upon the menacer. In visiting my hou[s]e, I had made provi[s]ion again[s]t the machinations of Carwin. In a fold of my dre[s]s an open penknife was concealed. This I now [s]eized and drew forth. It lurked out of view; but I now [s]ee that my [s]tate of mind would have rendered the deed inevitable if my brother had lifted his hand. This in[s]trument of my pre[s]ervation would have been plunged into his heart. O, in[s]upportable remembrance! hide thee from my view for a time; hide it from me that my heart was black enough to meditate the [s]tabbing of a [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-281.jpg) \- external link  - Page 272. ] brother! a brother thus [s]upreme in mi[s]ery; thus towering in virtue! He was probably uncon[s]cious of my de[s]ign, but pre[s]ently drew back. This interval was [s]ufficient to re[s]tore me to my[s]elf. The madne[s]s, the iniquity of that act which I had purpo[s]ed ru[s]hed upon my apprehen[s]ion. For a moment I was breathle[s]s with agony. At the next moment I recovered my [s]trength, and threw the knife with violence on the floor. The [s]ound awoke my brother from his reverie. He gazed alternately at me and at the weapon. With a movement equally [s]olemn he [s]tooped and took it up. He placed the blade in different positions, [s]crutinizing it accurately, and maintaining, at the [s]ame time, a profound [s]ilence. Again he looked at me, but all that vehemence and loftine[s]s of [s]pirit which had [s]o lately characterized his features, were flown. Fallen mu[s]cles, a forehead contracted into folds, eyes dim with unbidden drops, and a ruefulne[s]s of a[s]pect which no words can de[s]cribe, were now vi[s]ible. His looks touched into energy the [s]ame sympathies in me, and I poured forth a flood of tears. This pa[s][s]ion was quickly checked by fear, which had now, no longer, my own, but his [s]afety for their object. I watched his deportment in [s]ilence. At length he [s]poke: "Si[s]ter," [s]aid he, in an accent mournful and mild, "I have acted poorly my part in this world. What thinke[s]t thou? Shall I not do better in the next?" I could make no an[s]wer. The mildne[s]s of his tone a[s]toni[s]hed and encouraged me. I continued to regard him with wi[s]tful and anxious looks. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-282.jpg) \- external link  - Page 273. ] "I think," re[s]umed he, "I will try. My wife and my babes have gone before. Happy wretches! I have [s]ent you to repo[s]e, and ought not to linger behind." The[s]e words had a meaning [s]ufficiently intelligible. I looked at the open knife in his hand and [s]huddered, but knew not how to prevent the deed which I dreaded. He quickly noticed my fears, and comprehended them. Stretching towards me his hand, with an air of increa[s]ing mildne[s]s: "Take it," [s]aid he: "Fear not for thy own [s]ake, nor for mine. The cup is gone by, and its tran[s]ient inebriation is [s]ucceeded by the [s]oberne[s]s of truth. "Thou angel whom I was wont to wor[s]hip! feare[s]t thou, my [s]i[s]ter, for thy life? Once it was the [s]cope of my labours to de[s]troy thee, but I was prompted to the deed by heaven; [s]uch, at lea[s]t, was my belief. Thinke[s]t thou that thy death was [s]ought to gratify malevolence? No. I am pure from all [s]tain. I believed that my God was my mover! "Neither thee nor my[s]elf have I cau[s]e to injure. I have done my duty, and [s]urely there is merit in having [s]acrificed to that, all that is dear to the heart of man. If a devil has deceived me, he came in the habit of an angel. If I erred, it was not my judgment that deceived me, but my [s]en[s]es. In thy [s]ight, being of beings! I am [s]till pure. Still will I look for my reward in thy ju[s]tice!" Did my ears truly report the[s]e [s]ounds? If I did not err, my brother was re[s]tored to ju[s]t perceptions. He knew him[s]elf to have been betrayed to the murder of his wife and children, to have been the victim of infernal artifice; yet he found con[s]olation in the rectitude of his motives. He was not devoid of [s]orrow, for this was written on his countenance; but his [s]oul was tranquil and [s]ublime. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-283.jpg) \- external link  - Page 274. ] Perhaps this was merely a tran[s]ition of his former madne[s]s into a new [s]hape. Perhaps he had not yet awakened to the memory of the horrors which he had perpetrated. Infatuated wretch that I was! To [s]et my[s]elf up as a model by which to judge of my heroic brother! My rea[s]on taught me that his conclu[s]ions were right; but con[s]cious of the impotence of rea[s]on over my own conduct; con[s]cious of my cowardly ra[s]hne[s]s and my criminal de[s]pair, I doubted whether any one could be [s]tedfa[s]t and wi[s]e. Such was my weakne[s]s, that even in the mid[s]t of the[s]e thoughts, my mind glided into abhorrence of Carwin, and I uttered in a low voice, O! Carwin! Carwin! What ha[s]t thou to an[s]wer for? My brother immediately noticed the involuntary exclamation: "Clara!" [s]aid he, "be thy[s]elf. Equity u[s]ed to be a theme for thy eloquence. Reduce its le[s][s]ons to practice, and be ju[s]t to that unfortunate man. The in[s]trument has done its work, and I am [s]atisfied. "I thank thee, my God, for this la[s]t illumination! My enemy is thine al[s]o. I deemed him to be man, the man with whom I have often communed; but now thy goodne[s]s has unveiled to me his true nature. As the performer of thy behe[s]ts, he is my friend." My heart began now to mi[s]give me. His mournful a[s]pect had gradually yielded place to a [s]erene brow. A new [s]oul appeared to actuate his frame, and his eyes to beam with preternatural lu[s]tre. The[s]e [s]ymptoms did not abate, and he continued: "Clara! I mu[s]t not leave thee in doubt. I know not what brought about thy interview with the being whom thou calle[s]t Carwin. For a time, I was guilty of thy error, and deduced from his incoherent confe[s][s]ions that I had been made the victim [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-284.jpg) \- external link  - Page 275. ] of human malice. He left us at my bidding, and I put up a prayer that my doubts [s]hould be removed. Thy eyes were [s]hut, and thy ears [s]ealed to the vi[s]ion that an[s]wered my prayer. "I was indeed deceived. The form thou ha[s]t [s]een was the incarnation of a daemon. The vi[s]age and voice which urged me to the [s]acrifice of my family, were his. Now he per[s]onates a human form: then he was invironed with the lu[s]tre of heaven.--- "Clara," he continued, advancing clo[s]er to me, "thy death mu[s]t come. This mini[s]ter is evil, but he from whom his commi[s][s]ion was received is God. Submit then with all thy wonted re[s]ignation to a decree that cannot be rever[s]ed or re[s]i[s]ted. Mark the clock. Three minutes are allowed to thee, in which to call up thy fortitude, and prepare thee for thy doom." There he [s]topped. Even now, when this [s]cene exi[s]ts only in memory, when life and all its functions have [s]unk into torpor, my pul[s]e throbs, and my hairs upri[s]e: my brows are knit, as then; and I gaze around me in di[s]traction. I was unconquerably aver[s]e to death; but death, imminent and full of agony as that which was threatened, was nothing. This was not the only or chief in[s]pirer of my fears. For him, not for my[s]elf, was my [s]oul tormented. I might die, and no crime, [s]urpa[s][s]ing the reach of mercy, would pur[s]ue me to the pre[s]ence of my Judge; but my a[s][s]a[s][s]in would [s]urvive to contemplate his deed, and that a[s][s]a[s][s]in was Wieland! Wings to bear me beyond his reach I had not. I could not vani[s]h with a thought. The door was open, but my murderer was interpo[s]ed between that and me. Of [s]elf-defence I was incapable. The [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-285.jpg) \- external link  - Page 276. ] phrenzy that lately prompted me to blood was gone; my [s]tate was de[s]perate; my re[s]cue was impo[s][s]ible. The weight of the[s]e accumulated thoughts could not be borne. My [s]ight became confu[s]ed; my limbs were [s]eized with convul[s]ion; I [s]poke, but my words were half-formed:--- "Spare me, my brother! Look down, righteous Judge! [s]natch me from this fate! take away this fury from him, or turn it el[s]ewhere!" Such was the agony of my thoughts, that I noticed not [s]teps entering my apartment. Supplicating eyes were ca[s]t upward, but when my prayer was breathed, I once more wildly gazed at the door. A form met my [s]ight: I [s]huddered as if the God whom I invoked were pre[s]ent. It was Carwin that again intruded, and who [s]tood before me, erect in attitude, and [s]tedfa[s]t in look! The [s]ight of him awakened new and rapid thoughts. His recent tale was remembered: his magical tran[s]itions and my[s]terious energy of voice: Whether he were infernal or miraculous, or human, there was no power and no need to decide. Whether the contriver or not of this [s]pell, he was able to unbind it, and to check the fury of my brother. He had a[s]cribed to him[s]elf intentions not malignant. Here now was afforded a te[s]t of his truth. Let him interpo[s]e, as from above; revoke the [s]avage decree which the madne[s]s of Wieland has a[s][s]igned to heaven, and extingui[s]h for ever this pa[s][s]ion for blood! My mind detected at a glance this avenue to [s]afety. The recommendations it po[s][s]e[s][s]ed thronged as it were together, and made but one impression on my intellect. Remoter effects and collateral dangers I [s]aw not. Perhaps the pau[s]e of an [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-286.jpg) \- external link  - Page 277. ] in[s]tant had [s]ufficed to call them up. The improbability that the influence which governed Wieland was external or human; the tendency of this stratagem to [s]anction [s]o fatal an error, or [s]ub[s]titute a more de[s]tructive rage in place of this; the sufficiency of Carwin's mere mu[s]cular forces to counteract the efforts, and re[s]train the fury of Wieland, might, at a [s]econd glance, have been di[s]covered; but no [s]econd glance was allowed. My fir[s]t thought hurried me to action, and, fixing my eyes upon Carwin I exclaimed--- "O wretch! once more ha[s]t thou come? Let it be to abjure thy malice; to counterwork this helli[s]h [s]tratagem; to turn from me and from my brother, this de[s]olating rage! "Te[s]tify thy innocence or thy remor[s]e: exert the powers which pertain to thee, whatever they be, to turn a[s]ide this ruin. Thou art the author of the[s]e horrors! What have I done to de[s]erve thus to die? How have I merited this unrelenting persecution? I adjure thee, by that God who[s]e voice thou ha[s]t dared to counterfeit, to [s]ave my life! "Wilt thou then go? leave me! Succourle[s]s!" Carwin li[s]tened to my intreaties unmoved, and turned from me. He [s]eemed to he[s]itate a moment: then glided through the door. Rage and de[s]pair [s]tifled my utterance. The interval of re[s]pite was pa[s][s]ed; the pangs re[s]erved for me by Wieland, were not to be endured; my thoughts ru[s]hed again into anarchy. Having received the knife from his hand, I held it loo[s]ely and without regard; but now it [s]eized again my attention; and I gra[s]ped it with force. He [s]eemed to notice not the entrance or exit of Carwin. My ge[s]ture and the murderous weapon appeared to have e[s]caped his notice. His [s]ilence [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-287.jpg) \- external link  - Page 278. ] was unbroken; his eye, fixed upon the clock for a time, was now withdrawn; fury kindled in every feature; all that was human in his face gave way to an expre[s][s]ion [s]upernatural and tremendous. I felt my left arm within his gra[s]p.--- Even now I he[s]itated to [s]trike. I [s]hrunk from his a[s][s]ault, but in vain.--- Here let me de[s]i[s]t. Why [s]hould I re[s]cue this event from oblivion? Why [s]hould I paint this detestable conflict? Why not terminate at once this [s]eries of horrors?---Hurry to the verge of the precipice, and ca[s]t my[s]elf for ever beyond remembrance and beyond hope? Still I live: with this load upon my brea[s]t; with this phantom to pur[s]ue my [s]teps; with adders lodged in my bo[s]om, and [s]tinging me to madne[s]s: [s]till I con[s]ent to live! Yes, I will ri[s]e above the [s]phere of mortal passions: I will [s]purn at the cowardly remor[s]e that bids me [s]eek impunity in [s]ilence, or comfort in forgetfulness. My nerves [s]hall be new [s]trung to the ta[s]k. Have I not re[s]olved? I will die. The gulph before me is inevitable and near. I will die, but then only when my tale is at an end. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-288.jpg) \- external link  - Page 279. ] My right hand, gra[s]ping the un[s]een knife, was [s]till di[s]engaged. It was lifted to [s]trike. All my [s]trength was exhau[s]ted, but what was [s]ufficient to the performance of this deed. Already was the energy awakened, and the impul[s]e given, that [s]hould bear the fatal [s]teel to his heart, when--- Wieland [s]hrunk back: his hand was withdrawn. Breathle[s]s with affright and de[s]peration, I [s]tood, freed from his gra[s]p; una[s][s]ailed; untouched. Thus long had the power which controuled the [s]cene forborne to interfere; but now his might was irre[s]i[s]tible, and Wieland in a moment was disarmed of all his purpo[s]es. A voice, louder than human organs could produce, [s]hriller than language can depict, bur[s]t from the ceilling, and commanded him--- to hold! Trouble and di[s]may [s]ucceeded to the [s]tedfa[s]tne[s]s that had lately been di[s]played in the looks of Wieland. His eyes roved from one quarter to another, with an expre[s][s]ion of doubt. He [s]eemed to wait for a further intimation. Carwin's agency was here ea[s]ily recognized. I had be[s]ought him to interpo[s]e in my defence. He had flown. I had imagined him deaf to my prayer, and re[s]olute to [s]ee me peri[s]h: yet he di[s]appeared merely to devi[s]e and execute the means of my relief. Why did he not forbear when this end was accomplished? Why did his misjudging zeal and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-289.jpg) \- external link  - Page 280. ] accursed precipitation overpa[s]s that limit? Or meant he thus to crown the [s]cene, and conduct his inscrutable plots to this con[s]ummation? Such ideas were the fruit of [s]ub[s]equent contemplation. This moment was pregnant with fate. I had no power to rea[s]on. In the career of my tempestuous thoughts, rent into pieces, as my mind was, by accumulating horrors, Carwin was un[s]een and un[s]u[s]pected. I partook of Wieland's credulity, [s]hook with his amazement, and panted with his awe. Silence took place for a moment; [s]o much as allowed the attention to recover its po[s]t. Then new [s]ounds were uttered from above. "Man of errors! cea[s]e to cheri[s]h thy delu[s]ion: not heaven or hell, but thy [s]en[s]es have mi[s]led thee to commit the[s]e acts. Shake off thy phrenzy, and a[s]cend into rational and human. Be lunatic no longer." My brother opened his lips to [s]peak. His tone was terrific and faint. He muttered an appeal to heaven. It was difficult to comprehend the theme of his inquiries. They implied doubt as to the nature of the impul[s]e that hitherto had guided him, and que[s]tioned whether he had acted in con[s]equence of in[s]ane perceptions. To the[s]e interrogatories the voice, which now [s]eemed to hover at his [s]houlder, loudly an[s]wered in the affirmative. Then uninterrupted [s]ilence ensued. Fallen from his lofty and heroic [s]tation; now finally re[s]tored to the perception of truth; weighed to earth by the recollection of his own deeds; consoled no longer by a con[s]ciou[s]ne[s]s of rectitude, for the le[s]s of offspring and wife---a lo[s]s for which he was indebted to his own mi[s]guided hand; [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-290.jpg) \- external link  - Page 281. ] Wieland was transformed at once into the man of sorrows! He reflected not that credit [s]hould be as reasonably denied to the la[s]t, as to any former intimation; that one might as ju[s]tly be a[s]cribed to erring or di[s]ea[s]ed [s]en[s]es as the other. He [s]aw not that this di[s]covery in no degree affected the integrity of his conduct; that his motives had lo[s]t none of their claims to the homage of mankind; that the preference of [s]upreme good, and the boundle[s]s energy of duty, were undimini[s]hed in his bo[s]om. It is not for me to pur[s]ue him through the gha[s]tly changes of his countenance. Words he had none. Now he [s]at upon the floor, motionle[s]s in all his limbs, with his eyes glazed and fixed; a monument of woe. Anon a [s]pirit of tempe[s]tuous but unde[s]igning activity [s]eized him. He ro[s]e from his place and [s]trode acro[s]s the floor, tottering and at random. His eyes were without moi[s]ture, and gleamed with the fire that con[s]umed his vitals. The mu[s]cles of his face were agitated by convul[s]ion. His lips moved, but no [s]ound e[s]caped him. That nature [s]hould long [s]u[s]tain this conflict was not to be believed. My [s]tate was little different from that of my brother. I entered, as it were, into his thought. My heart was vi[s]ited and rent by his pangs---Oh that thy phrenzy had never been cured! that thy madne[s]s, with its bli[s]sful vi[s]ions, would return! or, if that mu[s]t not be, that thy [s]cene would ha[s]ten to a clo[s]e! that death would cover thee with his oblivion! What can I wi[s]h for thee? Thou who ha[s]t vied with the great preacher of thy faith in [s]anctity of motives, and in elevation above [s]en[s]ual and selfish! Thou whom thy fate has changed into [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-291.jpg) \- external link  - Page 282. ] paricide and [s]avage! Can I wi[s]h for the continuance of thy being? No. For a time his movements [s]eemed de[s]titute of purpo[s]e. If he walked; if he turned; if his fingers were entwined with each other; if his hands were pre[s][s]ed again[s]t oppo[s]ite [s]ides of his head with a force [s]ufficient to cru[s]h it into pieces; it was to tear his mind from [s]elf-contemplation; to wa[s]te his thoughts on external objects. Speedily this train was broken. A beam appeared to be darted into his mind, which gave a purpo[s]e to his efforts. An avenue to e[s]cape presented it[s]elf; and now he eagerly gazed about him: when my thoughts became engaged by his demeanour, my fingers were [s]tretched as by a mechanical force, and the knife, no longer heeded or of u[s]e, e[s]caped from my gra[s]p, and fell unperceived on the floor. His eye now lighted upon it; he [s]eized it with the quickne[s]s of thought. I [s]hrieked aloud, but it was too late. He plunged it to the hilt in his neck; and his life in[s]tantly e[s]caped with the [s]tream that gu[s]hed from the wound. He was [s]tretched at my feet; and my hands were [s]prinkled with his blood as he fell. Such was thy la[s]t deed, my brother! For a spectacle like this was it my fate to be re[s]erved! Thy eyes were clo[s]ed---thy face gha[s]tly with death--- thy arms, and the [s]pot where thou liede[s]t, floated in thy life's blood! The[s]e images have not, for a moment, for[s]aken me. Till I am breathle[s]s and cold, they mu[s]t continue to hover in my [s]ight. Carwin, as I [s]aid, had left the room, but he [s]till lingered in the hou[s]e. My voice [s]ummoned him to my aid; but I [s]carcely noticed his re-entrance, and now faintly recollect his terrified looks, his broken exclamations, his vehement avowals of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-292.jpg) \- external link  - Page 283. ] innocence, the effu[s]ions of his pity for me, and his offers of a[s][s]i[s]tance. I did not li[s]ten---I an[s]wered him not---I cea[s]ed to upbraid or accu[s]e. His guilt was a point to which I was indifferent. Ruffian or devil, black as hell or bright as angels, thenceforth he was nothing to me. I was incapable of [s]paring a look or a thought from the ruin that was [s]pread at my feet. When he left me, I was [s]carcely con[s]cious of any variation in the [s]cene. He informed the inhabitants of the hut of what had pa[s][s]ed, and they flew to the [s]pot. Carele[s]s of his own [s]afety, he ha[s]ted to the city to inform my friends of my condition. My uncle [s]peedily arrived at the hou[s]e. The body of Wieland was removed from my pre[s]ence, and they [s]uppo[s]ed that I would follow it; but no, my home is a[s]certained; here I have taken up my re[s]t, and never will I go hence, till, like Wieland, I am borne to my grave. Importunity was tried in vain: they threatened to remove me by violence---nay, violence was u[s]ed; but my [s]oul prizes too dearly this little roof to endure to be bereaved of it. Force [s]hould not prevail when the hoary locks and [s]upplicating tears of my uncle were ineffectual. My repugnance to move gave birth to ferociou[s]ne[s]s and phrenzy when force was employed, and they were obliged to consent to my return. They be[s]ought me---they remon[s]trated---they appealed to every duty that connected me with him that made me, and with my fellow-men---in vain. While I live I will not go hence. Have I not fulfilled my de[s]tiny? Why will ye torment me with your rea[s]onings and reproofs? Can ye re[s]tore to me the hope of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-293.jpg) \- external link  - Page 284. ] my better days? Can ye give me back Catharine and her babes? Can ye recall to life him who died at my feet? I will eat---I will drink---I will lie down and ri[s]e up at your bidding---all I a[s]k is the choice of my abode. What is there unrea[s]onable in this demand? Shortly will I be at peace. This is the [s]pot which I have cho[s]en in which to breathe my la[s]t [s]igh. Deny me not, I be[s]eech you, [s]o [s]light a boon. Talk not to me, O my revered friend! of Carwin. He has told thee his tale, and thou exculpatest him from all direct concern in the fate of Wieland. This [s]cene of havock was produced by an illu[s]ion of the [s]en[s]es. Be it [s]o: I care not from what [s]ource the[s]e di[s]a[s]ters have flowed; it [s]uffices that they have [s]wallowed up our hopes and our exi[s]tence. What his agency began, his agency conducted to a clo[s]e. He intended, by the final effort of his power, to re[s]cue me and to bani[s]h his illu[s]ions from my brother. Such is his tale, concerning the truth of which I care not. Henceforth I fo[s]ter but one wi[s]h---I a[s]k only quick deliverance from life and all the ills that attend it.--- Go wretch! torment me not with thy pre[s]ence and thy prayers.---Forgive thee? Will that avail thee when thy fateful hour [s]hall arrive? Be thou acquitted at thy own tribunal, and thou neede[s]t not fear the verdict of others. If thy guilt be capable of blacker hues, if hitherto thy con[s]cience be without [s]tain, thy crime will be made more flagrant by thus violating my retreat. Take thy[s]elf away from my [s]ight if thou woulde[s]t not behold my death! Thou art gone! murmuring and reluctant! And now my repo[s]e is coming---my work is done! [Written three years after the foregoing, and dated at Montpellier.] [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-294.jpg) \- external link  - Page 285. ] I Imagined that I had forever laid a[s]ide the pen; and that I [s]hould take up my abode in this part of the world, was of all events the lea[s]t probable. My de[s]tiny I believed to be accompli[s]hed, and I looked forward to a [s]peedy termination of my life with the fulle[s]t confidence. Surely I had rea[s]on to be weary of exi[s]tence, to be impatient of every tie which held me from the grave. I experienced this impatience in its fulle[s]t extent. I was not only enamoured of death, but conceived, from the condition of my frame, that to [s]hun it was impo[s][s]ible, even though I had ardently de[s]ired it; yet here am I, a thou[s]and leagues from my native [s]oil, in full po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of life and of health, and not de[s]titute of happine[s]s. Such is man. Time will obliterate the deepe[s]t impre[s][s]ions. Grief the mo[s]t vehement and hopeless, will gradually decay and wear it[s]elf out. Arguments may be employed in vain: every moral pre[s]cription may be ineffectually tried: remonstrances, however cogent or pathetic, [s]hall have no power over the attention, or [s]hall be repelled with di[s]dain; yet, as day follows day, the turbulence of our emotions [s]hall [s]ub[s]ide, and our fluctuations be finally [s]ucceeded by a calm. Perhaps, however, the conque[s]t of de[s]pair was chiefly owing to an accident which rendered my [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-295.jpg) \- external link  - Page 286. ] continuance in my own hou[s]e impo[s][s]ible. At the conclu[s]ion of my long, and as I then [s]uppo[s]ed, my la[s]t letter to you, I mentioned my re[s]olution to wait for death in the very [s]pot which had been the principal [s]cene of my misfortunes. From this re[s]olution my friends exerted them[s]elves with the utmo[s]t zeal and per[s]everance to make me depart. They ju[s]tly imagined that to be thus [s]urrounded by memorials of the fate of my family, would tend to fo[s]ter my di[s]ea[s]e. A [s]wift [s]ucce[s][s]ion of new objects, and the exclu[s]ion of every thing calculated to remind me of my lo[s]s, was the only method of cure. I refu[s]ed to li[s]ten to their exhortations. Great as my calamity was, to be torn from this a[s]ylum was regarded by me as an aggravation of it. By a perverse con[s]titution of mind, he was con[s]idered as my greate[s]t enemy who [s]ought to withdraw me from a [s]cene which [s]upplied eternal food to my melancholy, and kept my de[s]pair from langui[s]hing. In relating the hi[s]tory of the[s]e di[s]a[s]ters I derived a [s]imilar [s]pecies of gratification. My uncle earnestly di[s][s]uaded me from this ta[s]k; but his remonstrances were as fruitle[s]s on this head as they had been on others. They would have withheld from me the implements of writing; but they quickly perceived that to with[s]tand would be more injurious than to comply with my wi[s]hes. Having fini[s]hed my tale, it [s]eemed as if the [s]cene were clo[s]ing. A fever lurked in my veins, and my [s]trength was gone. Any exertion, however [s]light, was attended with difficulty, and, at length, I refu[s]ed to ri[s]e from my bed. I now [s]ee the infatuation and inju[s]tice of my conduct in its true colours. I reflect upon the [s]en[s]ations and rea[s]onings of that period with [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-296.jpg) \- external link  - Page 287. ] wonder and humiliation. That I [s]hould be in[s]en[s]ible to the claims and tears of my friends; that I [s]hould overlook the [s]ugge[s]tions of duty, and fly from that po[s]t in which only I could be in[s]trumental to the benefit of others; that the exerci[s]e of the [s]ocial and beneficent affections, the contemplation of nature and the acqui[s]ition of wi[s]dom [s]hould not be [s]een to be means of happine[s]s [s]till within my reach, is, at this time, [s]carcely credible. It is true that I am now changed; but I have not the con[s]olation to reflect that my change was owing to my fortitude or to my capacity for instruction. Better thoughts grew up in my mind imperceptibly. I cannot but congratulate my[s]elf on the change, though, perhaps, it merely argues a ficklene[s]s of temper, and a defect of [s]en[s]ibility. After my narrative was ended I betook my [s]elf to my bed, in the full belief that my career in this world was on the point of fini[s]hing. My uncle took up his abode with me, and performed for me every office of nur[s]e, phy[s]ician and friend. One night, after [s]ome hours of re[s]tle[s][s]ne[s]s and pain, I [s]unk into deep [s]leep. Its tranquillity, however, was of no long duration. My fancy became [s]uddenly distempered, and my brain was turned into a theatre of uproar and confu[s]ion. It would not be ea[s]y to de[s]cribe the wild and phanta[s]tical incongruities that pe[s]tered me. My uncle, Wieland, Pleyel and Carwin were [s]ucce[s][s]ively and momently di[s]cerned amid[s]t the [s]torm. Sometimes I was [s]wallowed up by whirlpools, or caught up in the air by half-[s]een and gigantic forms, and thrown upon pointed rocks, or ca[s]t among the billows. Sometimes gleams of light were [s]hot into a dark aby[s]s, on the verge of which I was [s]tanding, and enabled me to di[s]cover, for a moment, its enormous depth and hideous [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-297.jpg) \- external link  - Page 288. ] precipices. Anon, I was tran[s]ported to [s]ome ridge of Ætna, and made a terrified [s]pectator of its fiery torrents and its pillars of [s]moke. However [s]trange it may [s]eem, I was con[s]cious, even during my dream, of my real [s]ituation. I knew my[s]elf to be a[s]leep, and [s]truggled to break the [s]pell, by mu[s]cular exertions. The[s]e did not avail, and I continued to [s]uffer the[s]e abortive creations till a loud voice, at my bed [s]ide, and [s]ome one [s]haking me with violence, put an end to my reverie. My eyes were un[s]ealed, and I [s]tarted from my pillow. My chamber was filled with [s]moke, which, though in [s]ome degree luminous, would permit me to [s]ee nothing, and by which I was nearly suffocated. The crackling of flames, and the deafening clamour of voices without, bur[s]t upon my ears. Stunned as I was by this hubbub, [s]corched with heat, and nearly choaked by the accumulating vapours, I was unable to think or act for my own pre[s]ervation; I was incapable, indeed, of comprehending my danger. I was caught up, in an in[s]tant, by a pair of [s]inewy arms, borne to the window, and carried down a ladder which had been placed there. My uncle [s]tood at the bottom and received me. I was not fully aware of my [s]ituation till I found my[s]elf [s]heltered in the Hut, and [s]urrounded by its inhabitants. By neglect of the [s]ervant, [s]ome unextingui[s]hed embers had been placed in a barrel in the cellar of the building. The barrel had caught fire; this was communicated to the beams of the lower floor, and thence to the upper part of the [s]tructure. It was fir[s]t di[s]covered by [s]ome per[s]ons at a di[s]tance, who ha[s]tened to the [s]pot and alarmed my uncle and the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-298.jpg) \- external link  - Page 289. ] [s]ervants. The flames had already made considerable progre[s]s, and my condition was overlooked till my e[s]cape was rendered nearly impo[s][s]ible. My danger being known, and a ladder quickly procured, one of the [s]pectators a[s]cended to my chamber, and effected my deliverance in the manner before related. This incident, di[s]a[s]trous as it may at fir[s]t [s]eem, had, in reality, a beneficial effect upon my feelings. I was, in [s]ome degree, rou[s]ed from the [s]tupor which had [s]eized my faculties. The monotonous and gloomy [s]eries of my thoughts was broken. My habitation was levelled with the ground, and I was obliged to [s]eek a new one. A new train of images, di[s]connected with the fate of my family, forced it[s]elf on my attention, and a belief insensibly [s]prung up, that tranquillity, if not happine[s]s, was [s]till within my reach. Notwith[s]tanding the [s]hocks which my frame had endured, the angui[s]h of my thoughts no [s]ooner abated than I recovered my health. I now willingly li[s]tened to my uncle's solicitations to be the companion of his voyage. Preparations were ea[s]ily made, and after a tedious passage, we [s]et our feet on the [s]hore of the ancient world. The memory of the pa[s]t did not for[s]ake me; but the melancholy which it generated, and the tears with which it filled my eyes, were not unprofitable. My curio[s]ity was revived, and I contemplated, with ardour, the [s]pectacle of living manners and the monuments of pa[s]t ages. In proportion as my heart was rein[s]tated in the po[s][s]e[s][s]ion of its ancient tranquillity, the [s]entiment which I had cheri[s]hed with regard to Pleyel returned. In a [s]hort time he was united to the Saxon woman, and made his re[s]idence in the [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-301.jpg) \- external link  - Page 290. ] neighbourhood of Bo[s]ton. I was glad that circum[s]tances would not permit an interview to take place between us. I could not de[s]ire their mi[s]ery; but I reaped no plea[s]ure from reflecting on their happiness. Time, and the exertions of my fortitude, cured me, in [s]ome degree, of this folly. I continued to love him, but my pa[s][s]ion was digui[s]ed to my[s]elf; I con[s]idered it merely as a more tender [s]pecies of friend[s]hip, and cheri[s]hed it without compunction. Through my uncle's exertions a meeting was brought about between Carwin and Pleyel, and explanations took place which re[s]tored me at once to the good opinion of the latter. Though [s]eparated [s]o widely our corre[s]pondence was punctual and frequent, and paved the way for that union which can only end with the death of one of us. In my letters to him I made no [s]ecret of my former [s]entiments. This was a theme on which I could talk without painful, though not without delicate emotions. That knowledge which I [s]hould never have imparted to a lover, I [s]elt little [s]cruple to communicate to a friend. A year and an half elap[s]ed when There[s]a was [s]natched from him by death, in the hour in which [s]he gave him the fir[s]t pledge of their mutual affection. This event was borne by him with his customary fortitude. It induced him, however, to make a change in his plans. He di[s]po[s]ed of his property in America, and joined my uncle and me, who had terminated the wanderings of two years at Montpellier, which will henceforth, I believe, be our permanent abode. If you reflect upon that entire confidence which had [s]ub[s]i[s]ted from our infancy between Pleyel and my[s]elf; on the pa[s][s]ion that I had contracted, and [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-300.jpg) \- external link  - Page 291. ] which was merely [s]mothered for a time; and on the e[s]teem which was mutual, you will not, perhaps, be [s]urprized that the renovation of our intercourse [s]hould give birth to that union which at pre[s]ent [s]ub[s]i[s]ts. When the period had elap[s]ed necessary to weaken the remembrance of There[s]a, to whom he had been bound by ties more of honor than of love, he tendered his affections to me. I need not add that the tender was eagerly accepted. Perhaps you are [s]omewhat intere[s]ted in the fate of Carwin. He [s]aw, when too late, the danger of impo[s]ture. So much affected was he by the cata[s]trophe to which he was a witne[s]s, that he laid a[s]ide all regard to his own [s]afety. He fought my uncle, and confided to him the tale which he had ju[s]t related to me. He found a more impartial and indulgent auditor in Mr. Cambridge, who imputed to maniacal illu[s]ion the conduct of Wieland, though he conceived the previous and un[s]een agency of Carwin, to have indirectly but powerfully predisposed to this deplorable perver[s]ion of mind. It was ea[s]y for Carwin to elude the per[s]ecutions of Ludloe. It was merely requi[s]ite to hide himself in a remote di[s]trict of Penn[s]ylvania. This, when he parted from us, he determined to do. He is now probably engaged in the harmle[s]s pur[s]uits of agriculture, and may come to think, without insupportable remor[s]e, on the evils to which his fatal talents have given birth. The innocence and usefulness of his future life may, in [s]ome degree, atone for the mi[s]eries [s]o ra[s]hly or [s]o thoughtle[s][s]ly inflicted. More urgent con[s]iderations hindered me from mentioning, in the cour[s]e of my former mournful recital, any particulars re[s]pecting the unfortunate father of Loui[s]a Conway. That man [s]urely was [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-303.jpg) \- external link  - Page 292. ] re[s]erved to be a monument of capricious fortune. His [s]outhern journies being fini[s]hed, he returned to Philadelphia. Before he reached the city he left the highway, and alighted at my brother's door. Contrary to his expectation, no one came forth to welcome him, or hail his approach. He attempted to enter the hou[s]e, but bolted doors, barred windows, and a [s]ilence broken only by unan[s]wered calls, [s]hewed him that the man[s]ion was de[s]erted. He proceeded thence to my habitation, which he found, in like manner, gloomy and tenantle[s]s. His [s]urprize may be ea[s]ily conceived. The ru[s]tics who occupied the hut told him an imperfect and incredible tale. He ha[s]ted to the city, and extorted from Mrs. Baynton a full di[s]clo[s]ure of late disasters. He was inured to adver[s]ity, and recovered, after no long time, from the [s]hocks produced by this di[s]appointment of his darling [s]cheme. Our intercourse did not terminate with his departure from America. We have [s]ince met with him in France, and light has at length been thrown upon the mo[s] tives which occa[s]ioned the di[s]appearance of his wife, in the manner which I formerly related to you. I have dwelt upon the ardour of their conjugal attachment, and mentioned that no [s]u[s]picion had ever glanced upon her purity. This, though the belief was long cheri[s]hed, recent di[s]coveries have [s]hewn to be que[s]tionable. No doubt her integrity would have [s]urvived to the pre[s]ent moment, if an extraordinary fate had not befallen her. Major Stuart had been engaged, while in Germany, in a conte[s]t of honor with an Aid de Camp of the Marquis of Granby. His adver[s]ary had propagated a rumour injurious to his character. A challenge was [s]ent; a meeting en[s]ued; and Stuart [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-302.jpg) \- external link  - Page 293. ] wounded and di[s]armed the calumniator. The offence was atoned for, and his life [s]ecured by suitable conce[s][s]ions. Maxwell, that was his name, [s]hortly after, in con[s]equence of [s]ucceeding to a rich inheritance, [s]old his commi[s][s]ion and returned to London. His fortune was [s]peedily augmented by an opulent marriage. Intere[s]t was his [s]ole inducement to this marriage, though the lady had been [s]wayed by a credulous affection. The true [s]tate of his heart was quickly di[s]covered, and a [s]eparation, by mutual con[s]ent, took place. The lady withdrew to an e[s]tate in a di[s]tant county, and Maxwell continued to con[s]ume his time and fortune in the dissipation of the capital. Maxwell, though deceitful and [s]en[s]ual, po[s][s]e[s][s]ed great force of mind and [s]pecious accompli[s]hments. He contrived to mi[s]lead the generous mind of Stuart, and to regain the e[s]teem which his mi[s]conduct, for a time, had forfeited. He was recommended by her hu[s]band to the confidence of Mrs. Stuart. Maxwell was [s]timulated by revenge, and by a lawless pa[s][s]ion, to convert this confidence into a [s]ource of guilt. The education and capacity of this woman, the worth of her hu[s]band, the pledge of their alliance which time had produced, her maturity in age and knowledge of the world---all combined to render this attempt hopele[s]s. Maxwell, however, was not ea[s]ily di[s]couraged. The mo[s]t perfect being, he believed, mu[s]t owe his exemption from vice to the ab[s]ence of temptation. The impul[s]es of love are [s]o [s]ubtile, and the influence of fal[s]e rea[s]oning, when enforced by eloquence and pa[s][s]ion, [s]o unbounded, that no human virtue is [s]ecure from degeneracy. [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-305.jpg) \- external link  - Page 294. ] All arts being tried, every temptation being summoned to his aid, di[s][s]imulation being carried to its utmo[s]t bound, Maxwell, at length, nearly accomplished his purpo[s]e. The lady's affections were withdrawn from her hu[s]band and transferred to him. She could not, as yet, be reconciled to di[s]honor. All efforts to induce her to elope with him were ineffectual. She permitted her[s]elf to love, and to avow her love; but at this limit the [s]topped, and was immoveable. Hence this revolution in her [s]entiments was productive only of de[s]pair. Her rectitude of principle pre[s]erved her from actual guilt, but could not restore to her her ancient affection, or [s]ave her from being the prey of remor[s]eful and impracticable wi[s]hes. Her hu[s]band's ab[s]ence produced a [s]tate of [s]u[s]pen[s]e. This, however, approached to a period, and [s]he received tidings of his intended return. Maxwell, being likewi[s]e apprized of this event, and having made a la[s]t and un[s]ucce[s]sful effort to conquer her reluctance to accompany him in a journey to Italy, whither he pretended an invincible nece[s][s]ity of going, left her to pur[s]ue the mea[s]ures which de[s]pair might [s]ugge[s]t. At the [s]ame time [s]he received a letter from the wife of Maxwell, unveiling the true character of this man, and revealing facts which the artifices of her [s]educer had hitherto concealed from her. Mrs. Maxwell had been prompted to this di[s]clo[s]ure by a knowledge of her hu[s]band's practices, with which his own impetuo[s]ity had made her acquainted. This di[s]covery, joined to the delicacy of her scruples and the angui[s]h of remor[s]e, induced her to ab[s]cond. This [s]cheme was adopted in ha[s]te, but effected with con[s]ummate prudence. She fled, on [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-304.jpg) \- external link  - Page 295. ] the eve of her hu[s]band's arrival, in the di[s]gui[s]e of a boy, and embarked at Falmouth in a packet bound for America. The hi[s]tory of her di[s]a[s]trous intercour[s]e with Maxwell, the motives inducing her to for[s]ake her country, and the mea[s]ures [s]he had taken to effect her de[s]ign, were related to Mrs. Maxwell, in reply to her communication. Between the[s]e women an ancient intimacy and con[s]iderable [s]imilitude of character [s]ub[s]i[s]ted. This di[s]clo[s]ure was accompanied with [s]olemn injunctions of [s]ecrecy, and the[s]e injunctions were, for a long time, faithfully ob[s]erved. Mrs. Maxwell's abode was [s]ituated on the banks of the Wey. Stuart was her kin[s]man; their youth had been [s]pent together; and Maxwell was in [s]ome degree indebted to the man whom he betrayed, for his alliance with this unfortunate lady. Her e[s]teem for the character of Stuart had never been dimini[s]hed. A meeting between them was occa[s]ioned by a tour which the latter had undertaken, in the year after his return from America, to Wales and the we[s]tern countries. This interview produced plea[s]ure and regret in each. Their own tran[s]actions naturally became the topics of their conver[s]ation; and the untimely fate of his wife and daughter were related by the gue[s]t. Mrs. Maxwell's regard for her friend, as well as for the [s]afety of her hu[s]band, per[s]uaded her to concealment; but the former being dead, and the latter being out of the kingdom, [s]he ventured to produce Mrs. Stuart's letter, and to communicate her own knowledge of the treachery of Maxwell. She had previou[s]ly extorted from her gue[s]t a promi[s]e not to pur[s]ue any [s]cheme of vengeance; but this promi[s]e was made while ignorant of the full extent of [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-307.jpg) \- external link  - Page 296. ] Maxwell's depravity, and his pa[s][s]ion refu[s]ed to adhere to it. At this time my uncle and I re[s]ided at Avignon. Among the Engli[s]h re[s]ident there, and with whom we maintained a [s]ocial intercour[s]e, was Maxwell. This man's talents and addre[s]s rendered him a favorite both with my uncle and my[s]elf. He had even tendered me his hand in marriage; but this being refu[s]ed, he had [s]ought and obtained permi[s][s]ion to continue with us the intercour[s]e of friend[s]hip. Since a legal marriage was impo[s][s]ible, no doubt, his views were flagitious. Whether he had relinquished the[s]e views I was unable to judge. He was one in a large circle at a villa in the environs, to which I had likewi[s]e been invited, when Stuart abruptly entered the apartment. He was recognized with genuine [s]atisfaction by me, and with [s]eeming plea[s]ure by Maxwell. In a [s]hort time, [s]ome affair of moment being pleaded, which required an immediate and exclu[s]ive interview, Maxwell and he withdrew together. Stuart and my uncle had been known to each other in the German army; and the purpo[s]e contemplated by the former in this long and ha[s]ty journey, was confided to his old friend. A defiance was given and received, and the banks of a rivulet, about a league from the city, was selected as the [s]cene of this conte[s]t. My uncle, having exerted him[s]elf in vain to prevent an ho[s]tile meeting, con[s]ented to attend them as a [s]urgeon.--- Next morning, at [s]un-ri[s]e, was the time cho[s]en. I returned early in the evening to my lodgings. Preliminaries being [s]ettled between the combatants, Stuart had con[s]ented to [s]pend the evening with us, and did not retire till late. On the way to his hotel [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-306.jpg) \- external link  - Page 297. ] he was expo[s]ed to no mole[s]tation, but ju[s]t as he [s]tepped within the portico, a [s]warthy and malignant figure [s]tarted from behind a column, and plunged a [s]tiletto into his body. The author of this trea[s]on could not certainly be di[s]covered; but the details communicated by Stuart, re[s]pecting the hi[s]tory of Maxwell, naturally pointed him out as an object of [s]u[s]picion. No one expressed more concern, on account of this di[s]a[s]ter, than he; and he pretended an ardent zeal to vindicate his character from the a[s]per[s]ions that were ca[s]t upon it. Thenceforth, however, I denied my[s]elf to his vi[s]its; and [s]hortly after he di[s]appeared from this [s]cene. Few po[s][s]e[s][s]ed more e[s]timable qualities, and a better title to happine[s]s and the tranquil honors of long life; than the mother and father of Loui[s]a Conway: yet they were cut off in the bloom of their days; and their de[s]tiny was thus accompli[s]hed by the [s]ame hand. Maxwell was the in[s]trument of their de[s]truction, though the in[s]trument was applied to this end in [s]o different a manner. I leave you to moralize on this tale. That virtue [s]hould become the victim of treachery is, no doubt, a mournful con[s]ideration; but it will not e[s]cape your notice, that the evils of which Carwin and Maxwell were the authors, owed their exi[s]tence to the errors of the [s]ufferers. All efforts would have been ineffectual to [s]ubvert the happine[s]s or [s]horten the exi[s]tence of the Stuarts, if their own frailty had not [s]econded the[s]e efforts. If the lady had cru[s]hed her di[s]a[s]trous pa[s][s]ion in the bud, and driven the [s]educer from her pre[s]ence, when the tendency of his artifices was [s]een; if Stuart had not admitted the [s]pirit of ab[s]urd revenge, we [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-308.jpg) \- external link  - Blank Leaf. ] [ [Page image](http://etext.virginia.edu/cgi-local/chad- pt/pageturner.pl?id=eaf027&image=027-309.jpg) \- external link  - Page 298. ] [s]hould not have had to deplore this cata[s]trophe. If Wieland had framed ju[s]ter notions of moral duty, and of the divine attributes; or if I had been gifted with ordinary equanimity or fore[s]ight, the double-tongued deceiver would have been baffled and repelled.
