 Lord Major of LONDON . The saying is not so old as true, He that refuseth to buy counsell cheape, shall buy Repentance deare , neither let any mock a man in his misery, but rather beware by him, how to avoid the like misfortune. If thou intend to doe any good, deferr it not till the next day; for thou knowest not what may happen over night to prevent thee: Behold thy selfe in a Looking-glasse, if thou appearest beautifull, doe such things as may become thy beauty; but if thou seem foule, or deformed, let the actions of thy life make good that splendor which thy face lacketh. Tell not thy minde to every man, make thy selfe indebted to no man; bee friend to few men, be courteous to all men: let thy Wit be thy friend, thy Minde thy companion, thy Tongue thy servant: Let Uertue be thy Life, Valour thy Love, Honour thy Fame, and Heaven thy Felicity: These ( Reader ) be good decuments for thee to follow, and I am now to present thee with a worthy President to imitate: observe his beginning, forget not the middle passage of his life, and thou wilt, no question, crowne his end. Hee that made all things of nothing, can of a little make much, and multiply a Mite unto a Magazin, as will easily appeare by the succeeding History. This Richard Whitington was so obscurely bred, that hee could scarcely give account of his Parents, or kindred; and being almost starved in the Countrey, necessity compelled him up to London , hoping to finde more charity in the City than Country: To begge he was ashamed, to steale he did abhorre: two dayes he spent in gaping upon the shops, and gazing upon the buildings; feeding his eyes, but starving his stomack. At length meere faintnesse compell'd him to rest himselfe upon a bench before a Merchants gate, where he not long sate, but the owner of the house having occasion of businesse into the Towne, finding him a poore simple fellow, and thinking that he had no more within than appeared without, he demanded of him why he loytred there, and being able to worke for his living, did not apply himselfe unto some lawfull calling, threatning him at the first with the Stocks, and Whipping-post: but the poore man after the making of some plaine leggs, and courtesie, desired him to pardon him, and told him, that he was a dejected man, who desired any imployment, and that no paines, how meane or course soever, could seeme tedious or burthensome unto him, so he might but finde some good Master, by whose charity hee might releeve his present necessity: for his greatest ambition was, but to keepe his body from nakednesse, and his stomack from hunger; and told him withall how long it was since hee had tasted meate or drinke. The worthy Merchant seeing him of a personable body, and an ingenions aspect, howsoever both were clouded under a rustick habit, began somewhat to commiserate his estate, and knocking for a servant, bade him take in that fellow, and give him such virtuals as the house for the present affordeth, and at his returne hee would have further conference with him. The servant did as hee was commanded, and tooke him in. The Merchant went to the Exchange , which was then in Lumberstreet , about his affaires: In which interim poore Whittington was had into the Kitchin to warme himselfe; for faintnesse, by reason of hunger and cold, (for it was then in the winter time) had quite rob'd him of his colour Meate was set before him in plenty, and being bred in the Country, as the Proverbe goeth, hee fed like a Farmer ; and having sated himselfe sufficiently, and warmed him to the ful, a fresh colour began to come into his cheekes: At which time the Merchants Daughter, (hearing of a new-come guest, came into the kitchin, and began to question him of divers things concerning the Countrey, to all which hee gave her such modest and sensible answers, that she tooke a greatliking unto him, and so left him. Dinner time came, and Master Fitzwarren (for so was the Merchant called) came home with a good stomacke, and brought a friend or two with him from the Exchange ; downe they sate to meate, and had speech of many things at the Table, meane time the servants were set also to Dinner, who would needs have Whittington , though hee had so lately broke his fast to keep them company; some of them delighting in his Countrey speech, others deriding his supposed simplicity. But to come to the purpose, the Table being with-drawn in the Parlour, and the guests departed,  & Master Fitzwarren and his Daughter left alone, shee being of a good and gentle disposition, began to commend his charity concerning the poore man whom he had relieved that morning; to whom he answered, Godamercy Daughter, thou hast done well to remember me; such an one I sent indeed but have my servants done as I commanded them? and where is he now? who answered him, that she had given order he should stay Dinner, and not depart the house till he himselfe had further spoken wtith him. At which they both went into the Hall, and called the Fellow before them; who appeared unto them with such a bashfull humility, that it seemed to them both to begge a charity: Some language past betwixt them concerning him which gave them content: at length they bid him retire himselfe. When the Father  & the Daughter had some private conference concerning him, she urged him to entertaine him into his house, and that there would be some employment for him either to runne, or goe of Errands, or else to doe some drudgery in the Kitchin, as in making of fires, scouring ketles, turning the spit, and the like: To whom the Father replyed, that indeed his worke might be worth his meat, but hee had no lodging to spare: She againe answered, there were Garrets in the house, that were put to no use at all, and in one of them he might be conveniently lodged, and put the house to no trouble at all. Well, at length he was admitted, and made a member of the Family, in which he demeaned himselfe so well by his willingnesse, to runne, or goe, or to doe any service, how meane soever, that hee had got the goodwill of all the whole houshold, onely the Kitchin-maide being a curst queane, and knowing him to be an under-servant to her, domineered over him and used him very coursely and roughly, of which he would never complain, though he had cause enough. The Garret in which he lay, by reason it had been long unfrequented, was troubled with Rats and Mice, in so much that he could not sleep in the night, but they ran over his face, and much disturbed him in his rest: To prevent which, having got a penny, either for going of an Errand, or for making clean boots, or shooes, or the like; with that he bought a yong Cat which he kept in his Garret; and whatsoever he had from the reversion of the servants Table, he would be sure to reserve part for her, because he had found by experience, that she had rid him of the former inconveniences. The History tells us, that his Merchant, Master Hugh Fitzwarren was so generous, that he never adventured any Ship to Sea, but he would have his Daughter, his Cashier, and every one of his servants, what, or whosoever, to put in something, and to adventure with him; and according to that proportion which they could spare, every one received to a token at the return of the Ship. His Daughter, she began, the rest followed, and the servants borrowed out of their wages, every one to doe according to their abilities. And when they all had done, Whittington was remembered, and called for: and his Master telling him the custome of his house, asked him what he had to hazard in this adventure: who replyed again, he was a poor man, and had nothing in the world, saving the cloaths upon his back; but for mony, he had none at all: then his Daughter drew to her purse, and told her Father, that for her servant Whittington , she would lay down whatsoever he would desire: who answered again, that what she had spoke was nothing to the purposes for whatsoever was ventured in that kinde, must be out of ones proper goods and chattells: and again demanded of him, if he had any thing which he could call his own to put to hazard, and charged him deeply concerning that point; who making some unnecessary leggs, told him, that he had nothing which he could call his, saving a Cat, which he had bought with his penny, which he could not spare, because she had done him so many good offices, and told them every circumstance before related: Which when the Merchant heard, he told him, that he should venture that commodity, and none else; and charged him to fetch her instantly: for the Ship (which was called the Unicorn ) was fallen down as low as Blackwall , and all their lading was already had aboard. Whittington , although unwilling to part from so good a companion, yet being forced upon his Masters command, by whom he had his subsistance, he brought her, and (not without tears) delivered her to his Factor, who wss partly glad of her, by reason they were troubled with Mice and Rats in the Ship, which not only spoyled their victualls, but dammaged their wares, and commodities. I must leave the Cat upon her voyage at Sea, and honest Whittington a land, who by that curst quean, the Kitchin-maid, was so beaten and abused, that he was as weary of his life, as of his service: for she, (usurping upon his plainnesse and modesty) would be quarrelling with him upon every small, or no occasion at all: sometimes beating him with the Broom sometimes laying him over the shoulders with the Ladle, the Spit, or what came next to her hands, being of so dogged a disposition, that she still continued her cruelty towards him, and therefore he resolved with himselfe to run away; and for that purpose, he had bundell'd up those few clothes which he had, and before day broke, was as far as Bun-hill , and there he sat him down, to consider with himselfe what course he were best to take; where, by chance (it being Alhallows day ) a merry peal from Bow Church began to ring, and as he apprehended they were tun'd to this Ditty. Turne againe Whittington , Lord Major of London . Turne againe Whittington , Lord Major of London . This tooke such a great impression in him, that finding how early it was, and that hee might yet come backe to his Masters house before any of the Family were stirring, hee resolved to goe back, and found every thing according to his owne wishes, and desires; insomuch, that when the houshold were up, none could challenge him to have beene missing. And thus hee continued as before in his first plainnesse and honesty, well beloved of all, save the Kitching- drudge: I come now now to tell you what became of his adventure. It so hapned, that this good Ship the Unicorne , was by contrary gusts and bad weather driven upon the utmost coast of Barbary , where never any English man, (or scarse any Christian) had ever traded before: Where they shewed some of their commodities, and offered them to be vended. The Moores came down in multitudes, much taken with the beauty of their ship for they had never seen any of that building, or burden before: But when they had taken a serious view of their commodities, as Hatchets, Knives, Looking-glasses, Fish-hookes, &c. but especially their Cloth and Kersies of severall sizes and colours, they brought them Gold in abundance; for it was more plentifull with them then Leade, or Copper is with us. Presently newes was carried to the King, who sent some of his chiefe Nobility to bring him some sorts of every commodity that was aboard: whch when he saw, they pleased him highly, sending for the Master, and Merchants Factor to Court: He at their own rate bargained with them for their whole lading, nor would he suffer them to depart, till he had feasted them royally. Now the fashion of the Moores , is not to sit at the Table, as the custom is amongst us, but to have a rich Carpet spred upon the ground, and when the meat or banquet is served in, as well the King himselfe, as the rest, sit round about crosse legg'd, as Taylers commonly use to doe upon their Shop-boords, and in that manner our English were set at the Kings banquet: but the meat was no sooner served in, but swarms of Rats and Mice seized upon the dishes, and snatched away the meat even from the King and Qeens trenchers: At which the Factor being amazed, asked one of the Nobili y (by an Interpreter) if they preserved those vermine for their sport, or if they were noysome and troublesome unto them? who answered him again, that they were the greatest vexation unto them that could be profitable, and by reason of their multitudes they could not be destroyed: but the King would willingly give half the revenew of his Crown, if he could but onely clear the Court of them; for not only his Table, but his very Chamber swarmed with them, in so much, that he durst not lay him downe to rest without a watch about him, to keepe them off from his pillow: To whom the Factor replyed, that they had a strange beast aboord, which he made no doubt, would rid them of those vermine: Which being told the King, he rose from his place, and imbracing the Factor, told him, if he could shew him such a creature, he would ballast his vessell with Silver, and lade her with Gold and Pearl. Who apprehending the occasion, made very coy of the businesse, telling him, it was a creature of great value, and not common: besides, they could not spare her from their Sip, in regard, that when they were asleep, yet she was still waking in the night, not only to preserve their Merchandise, but their Diet from the like spoyle. The more dainty that he made of the matter, the more earnest was the King for this Beast; in so much, that shee was presently sent for. And a second Feast being prepared, and the Rats and Mice appearing as they did before, the young Merchant having the Cat under his cloake, the King desired discovered her, and cast her among them; she no sooner saw these vermine, but fell upon them with such a fury, that here lay one panting, there another quite dead; nor left them till she had frighted and disperst the whole number; but such as she seized, their carkasses lay there as witnesses of their unexpected slaughter. Great pleasure took the King and the Nobility in the sport, vowing that the hunting of the Lyon (of which there are plenty in that Country) was not answerable unto it, In the Interim one began to praise her for her colour, another commended her for her valour; one said she had the countenance of Lyon, and every one gave his sentence. When the poor Cat finding no more work for her to do went round to the King and Queen, purling and curling, (as their manner is) which they apprehended to be, as if she inquired of them what shee had deserved for that late service. To cut off circumstance, no price could part them, and the rather, when the Factor had told the King that she was with kittens, and that her brood would in some few years, being carefully lookt unto, furnish the whole Kingdome: so that Whittingtons Cats adventure only surmounted all the Ships lading besides; with which fortunate and unexpected gain we bring them safe into England : the Sip lying at Anchop neere Blackwall , and the Pilot and Cape-merchant , with some other Officers in the Ship, at Master Fitzwarrens house, which was by Leaden-Hall , to give accompt of their voyage. But these Caskets of Jewells and Pearls, with other unvalued Riches which were given for the Cat, they caused to be brought along, not daring by reason of their inestimable value, to trust them in the Sip. The Bills of lading, and the benefit of the return of the commodities being viewed, and considered of by the owner, hee praised God for so prosperous a voyage and called all his servants, and gave order that according to their adventures, every one should receive his portion. At length casting his eye upon those rich Caskets and Cabinets, asked to whose share they belonged? Who whispered him in the ear, and told him, to his poor Whitington , relating every particular as is before discoursed. To whom Master Fitzwarren replyed, If they then be his, God forbid I should keep from him the least farthing that is his right, and presently commanded Whittington to be sent for by the name of Mr. Whittington . The servants not knowing any thing of the businesse, went unto him into the kitchen, where he was then rubbing the spits, scouring the kettles and making clean the dressers, and told him, he must come to his Master presently into the Parlour: The poor man excused himself, that his shooes were durty, and the room was rubb'd, and if he should but touch any thing there, he should spoyle and deface those things in the room: But still the Master of the house called for Master Whittington , sending one servant after another, till he was brought before him; and having scraped some few legges, instantly his Master took him by the hand, and called for a chair for Master Whittington: his Daughter, the Pilot, and the Factor, every one of them saluted him by the name of Mr. Whittington , and forced him to sit down: He wondring what this should mean, desired them not to mock a poor simple man, who meant none any harm, &c. and wept (the tears dropping from his eyes) desiring them not to deride his poverty; for his ambition was never to come so high, as from the Kitchen to the Hall, much more from the Hall into the Parlour. Then came his Master to him seriously, and said, Indeed Mr. Whittington we are all in good earnest, for you are at this time a better man than my self in estate; and then shewed him all those Cabinets and Caskets, and how richly they were lined. When hee perceived by all their earnest asseverations that all was true, he first fell down upon his knees, and gave God most hearty thanks, who out of his great bounty would vouchsafe to cast an eye upon so poor and wretched a creature as himself: Then turning to his Master, he presented all his Riches before him, and told him, that all he had was at his disposing and service: who answered him again, that for his own part, God had lent him sufficient of his own; neither would he take from him the value of one Barbary Ducket. He came next, and with a low legge saluted his Mistriss, and told her, that when shee pleased to make choice of an husband, he would make her the richest Marriage in London , because she was so willing, out of her own purse, (when he was altogether pennilesse) to lay out for his adventure. To the Pilot, and Master, and every officer or common Sayler, he gave liberally according to their degrees even to the ship-boy; and then to every servant of the house, nay, to the very kitchen wench, who was so churlish unto him, and had so often basted him in the stead of her roast meat, having caused her to be called unto him, he gave her an hundred pound towards her marriage. This being done, Taylers were sent for, Sempsters and the like, to put him into Clothes, and linnen of the best; who were to accommodate him with all speed possible: and his lodging in the Garret was chang'd into the best Chamber of the house. And when the Barber had been with him, and the rest, to make him compleat in his habite, there was a strange and suddain Metamorphosis ; for out of a smoaky and dirty Kitchin-drudge, there appeared a proper and well proportioned man, and a gentile Merchant: in so much, that his young Mistrisse began to cast a more amorous eye upon him than before, which not a little pleased Master Fitzwarren , her Father, who intended a match betwixt them. The brute of this great adventure was presently noysed through the whole City, in so much that his Master intreated his late servant to walk with him into the Exchange , to see the fashion of the Merchants, which he did; where all of them came about him, and saluted him; some bid God give him joy of his fortune, others desired of him better and further acquaintance, and every one as his severall fancy led him: Some commended him for his person, others for his modest answers, and discreet carriage: Indeed, Wealth is able to make all these good where they are most wanting, which was not in him, as appeares by the sequell. Within few weekes the match was propounded betwixt Master Whittington and Mistrisse Alice , and willingly entertained on both parties, and not without great cost; with Maior, and the Aldermen, very nobly celebrated, and the Bridegroome by this means had got acquaintance with the best. After this, the Father in law demanded of his Son what course hee purposed to take? (his freedom being offered him, and accepted of) who made answer again, that since God had so blest him in his small adventure, he would not leave it off so, but prove his goodnesse in a greater, and that his purpose was to turne Merchant: which reply gave him no small content, in regard he knew the best amongst them would be glad to have the society of so hopefull a Citizen: which he continued, adventuring in divers bottoms with his Father, and had very happy and prosperous, returnes, The time when he was prickt for Sheriffe, which he modestly refused, as unable to undertake so great a charge, and would willingly have pay'd his Fine, which his Father in law would not suffer: at whose perswtasion hee took the place upon him, in which he so well behaved himselfe in the management of all affairs belonging to his Office, that hee not only left it without the least taxation, but with a generall love and approbation, in so much that the universall eye of the whole City was firt on him, in an hopefully expectation what a profitable member of that united body he might futurely prove. And this happened in the year of our Lord 1393. Sir Iohn Hardley Grocer being Maior, and Drewry Barentine his fellow Sherffe; of the truth of which, Master Fabian in his Chronicle, and Master Iohn Stow in his Survey of London can fully sarisfie you. An the year 1397, and the one and twentieth of the same Kings reigne, Woodcock and William Askam being Sheriffes; and hee held the place with great reputation and honour. In which time of his Majoralty there was much discontent in the Kingdom, by reason of many differences betwixt the King and the Commons; the circumstances whereof were here too long to relate; onely one thing is worthy of observation, that whether by his adventures, or no, may it be questioned, bringing in yearly such store of Gold, Silkes, Sattens, Uelvets, Damasks, Stones, and Iewells, &c. into the kingdom, might be the cause of that great pride and rioting in apparell which was used in those daies? But as Harding Fabian , and others have left to memory, in that year of his Majorality, and after, there resorted to the Kings Court at their pleasures dayly, at the least ten thousand persons: In his Kitchin were three hundred servitors, and in every office according to that rate. Moreover, of Ladies Chambers and Lawndresses above three hundred, and they all exceeded in gorgeous and costly apparell farre above their degrees: for even the Yeomen and Grooms were clothed in Silks and Uelvets, Damasks and the like; with Imbroydery, rich Furrs, and Goldsmiths work, devising every day strange and new fashions. And in this year also, about the Feast of St. Bartholmew , grew a great discord betwixt the Duke of Hereford , and Mowbrey Duke of Norfolk , the beginning thereof being as followeth. The two Dukes riding from the Parliament towards their lodgings, the Duke of Norfolk said to the other, Sir, you see how variable the King is in his words, and (reflecting upon what had past) how without mercy he putteth his Lords and Kinsfolks to death, imprisoning some, and exiling others: There it hehooveth us not too much to trust to his fair and smooth language, for doubtlesse in time he will bring even to us the like death and destruction. Of which words he accused him to the King, which the other denying, it was to be tryed by combate: the Lists were appointed, and the day of meeting, the eleventh day of September ; to which place, and on the day assigned came hoth the Dukes, and bravely accoutred, appeared before the King, ready to enter into battail; where the King threw down his Warder, and staying the combate, banished the Duke of Hereford for ten years, but the Duke of Norfolk for ever; who travelling many Countries, at the last came to Venice , and there ended his life. Again, in the year 1406. and in the eighth of Henry the fourth, Sir Richard Whittington was the second time Lord Maior, Nicholas Worton and Geffrey Brook being Sheriffs. Again, in the year 1409. being the seven h year of Henry 5\. he supplyed the Pretorship, Robert Whittington (his neere Kinsman) Iohn Butler being Sheriffs: and which is more remarkable of him than of any other, that either precded him in that place of Honour, he was once Sheriffe, and three times Lord Maior of this famous and honourable City in three severall Kngs reigns. Now, to cut off all circumstances, and come close to the matter, we may easily find what this man was, by the pious and religious acts done in his life to the Cities present grace, use, and benefit, and to his own blessed memory for ever. In the Vintry Ward he built a Church, and dedicated it to Saint Michael , Royal , and added to it a Colledge, founded to Saint Mary ; and placed therein a Prestdent and four Fellows which ought to he Masters of Arts; besides other yearly allowance to Clerks and young Shollers: neare which he erected an Hospitall, which he called Gods House , for thirteene poor men; and these, according to the devout superstition of those daies, were to pray for the soules of his Father in law Hugh Fitzwarren , and Dame Molde his wife, for whom he erected a fair Tombe in the Church he before built, leaving also a place for himself, and Dame Alice his Lady, when it should please God to call them: In which place they were afterwards both of them, according to their degree very honourably interred, great mourning and much lamentation being made for him by the commons of the City, in regard he was a man so remarkable for his charity. Whittington Colledge , with a perpetuall allowance for Divinity Lectures to be made there forever; leaving good land for the maintenance thereof. And on the west side of the City he built that famous gate and prison, to this day call'd Newgate , and thereupon caused the Merchants arms to be graven in stone. He added to St. Bartholmews Hospitall in Smithfield , and was at the charge of repairing thereof. Further, at the Gray-Fryars in London he erected a Library, as a testimony of the great love he had to learning, which he began in the year of our Lord 1421. and finished it in the year following. Moreover, that place which is call'd the Stocks to this day, betwixt Cheapside and Cornhill , a gooly house of stone, which serbeth for a flesh-market, and a fish market, greatly beneficiall to the City. Besides, he enlarged Guildhall , and glazed most, or all of the windows at his own cost and charges, paving the Hall, and contributing largely to the Library, adding to these Basses Conduit, which yeeldeth store of sweet and wholsom water, to the generall good and benefi of the City. In the year 1397. when Sir Richard Whittington was first elected Lord Maior, that Rebell Sir John Oldcastle was taken, in the Territories of the Lord Powesse , not without danger and hurt of some that took him: At which time all the States of the Realm were assembled in Parliament at London , therein to provide the king of a Subsidy, and other aid of money and munition, who took great pains beyond the Seas, in France : these Lords and others, when they heard that the publick enemy was taken, they agreed all not to dissolve the Parliament, untill he were examined, and heard to answer in the same: whereupon the Lord Powesse was sent for, to fetch him up with power and great aid, who brought him to London in a Litter, wounded very much, having received seventeen wounds; and also a Clerk which he called his Secretary, with him, that was of his counsell in all his secrets. As soon as the aforesaid Sir John Oldcastle was brought into the Parliament before the Earl of Bedford , who then was left Regent, and governour of the Realm in the time of the Kings absence, being in France , and other Lords and States: His Inditement was read before him, of his forcible insurrection against the King and State in Saint Gyles Fields , and other treasons and outrages by him committed, the question was asked, how he would excuse himself, and shew why he should not be judged to dye according to the Law: But he seeking other talk, began to talk & discourse of the mercies of God, & that all mortall men, that would be followers of God, ought to preferre mercy above Iudgement, and that vengeance pertained only to the Lord, and ought not to be practised by them that worship, but to be left to God alone: with many other words to detract the time, untill the Lord chief Iustice admonished the Regent, not to suffer him to spend the time so vainly, in molesting of the Nobles of the Realm: whereupon the Duke of Bedford , Regent, commanded him to answer formally and punctually to the matter laid to his charge. The said Sr. Iohn being thus urged, at last after deliberation taken, hee said, it is the least thing that I account of, to be iudged by you, as of mans judgement; and again, he began to talk, but nothing to the purpose, untill the chiefe Justice commanded him again to answer finally and to answer them if he could, why he should not suffer death according to his desert: To which he stoutly answered, that he had no Iudge amongst them, so long as his Leige, Lord King Richard was alive, and in his Realm of Scotland ; which answer when he had made, because there needed no further witnesse, hee he was there presently censured to be drawn, and hanged upon a Gallows, and there to be burnt hanging upon the same: Which Iudgement was executed upon him the thirteenth day of December in Saint Gyles fields, where many honourable persons were present; and the last words that he spake, was to Sir Thomas Eupingham , adjuring him, that if hee saw him rise from death to life again the third day, he would procure that his Sect which he had raised, might be in peace and quiet. Hee was hanged by the neck in a chain of Iron, and after consumed by fire. Moreover it is recorded, that in time of this worthy Pretor Sir Richard Whittington , the glorious City of Constantinople was taken by Mahomet , the second Prince of the Turkes , whose Souldiers sacked it with all extremity, and omitted no manner of cruelty or violence either to virgins, aged women, nor sucking babes. This Sir Richard Whittington had traffick from thence by his Factors which there abode, and were then taken prisoners; so that he lost neare upon fifteen thousand pounds: which when he heard of, never was so much as cast down, or dismayed, but said, God will send more: yea, such was the incessant practice of the Turkish tyranny upon this imperiall City, as it exceeded the damage, rapes, and spoyles of other Cities. They also beheaded at the same time Constantine the Christian Emperour thereof, and put his head upon the top of a Launce, and with derision caused it to be carryed thorow the Turkish Campe. In the space of a week after, there hapned a horrible tempest of Thunder and Lightning, which burned almost eight hundred houses, and spoiled three thousand people at the sacking of the aforesaid City by the said Mahomet . The Turkes found therein so much treasure, that they wondred that the Citizens would not spend it upon souldiers for their owe defence, but so dotingly to spare th true spending thereof, to become an enticing prey for their unreconcileable enemies: for indeed it was thought, that if the State would have hired souldiers, and given them good pay, they might have raised the siege of the Turkes . It is an old and a true saying, Covetousnesse is the mother of ruine and mischief . This strange thing hapned in the second time that he was elected Lord Maior, and that was upon the twenty seventh of Aprill , being Tuesday in Easter-week: William Foxley , Pot-maker for the Mint in the Tower of London , fell asleep, and so continued sleeping and snoring, and could not be wakened with pricking, cramping, or otherwise burning whatsoever, till the first day of the Terme, which was full 14. daies, and 15. nights: The cause of this his sleeping could not be known, though the same were diligently searched for by the Kings command of his Physitians, and other learned men; yea, the King himself examined the said William Foxley , who was in all points found at his waking, to be as if he had slept but one night, and yet lived 41 years after: But in length of time he did call to minde, how he did wish to God that he might sleep a Fortnight together, if it was not so and so; concerning a bargain between a neighbour of his and himself On thursday in Whisun week following, the Duke of Somerset, with Anthony Rivers , and four other, kept Justs and Turnaments before the King and Queen, and other of the Nobility in the Tower of London , against three Esquires of the Queens Bed-chamber, which were performed before some of the French Nobility, that then were prisoners to the King, which he took in France ; to the great admiration of those strangers who never saw the like action before, being so earnestly performed. There was also Sir Richard Whittington , and the two Sheriffes, and that night the King and Queen did suppe with the Lord Maior. Those strangers which beheld the Iusts, were prisoners in the Tower at that time; namely, the Duke of Orleance and Burbon , brother to the Duke of Brittain ; the Earls of Vandosme , of Ewe , and Richmond , and the High Marshall of France , and many other Knights and Esquires. to the number of seven hundred; all all which were at one time prisoners to the King, but nobly used and attended, every one according to their rank and quality: who, when they were ransomed, made it known to their King, how honourably they were attended in England . and what respect the King and our English Nation shewed them being prisoners, who might have taken their lives away, as well as their persons prisoners. The second thing that was remarkable in Sir Richard Whittingtons yeare, was that the King kept his Christmas at Lambeth ; and at the feast of Purification , seven Dolphins of the Sea came up to the River of Thames , and played there up and down, while four of them were kill'd. On Saturday, the Eve of Saint Michael the Arch-angell the yeare following, in the morning before day, betwixt the hour of one and two of the clock, began a terrible Earthquake, with Lightning and Thunder, which continued the space of six hours, and that universally through the whole World; so that men had thought the world as then should have ended. The unreasonable beasts roared, and drew to the Town with ahideous noise: also the Fowles of the Air cryed out; such was the work of God at that time, to call his people to repentance. The four and twentieth day of January following, a battail, or combate was fought in Smithfield within the lists, before the King, between two men of Feversham in Kent, Iohn Upton Notary, Appellant; and Iohn Downe , Gentleman, Defendant: John Upton accused John Downe , that hee and his Compiers should imagine the Kings death on the day of his Coronation following. When they had fought somewhat long, and had received each of them some wounds, and still persisting in their violent action, and no hopes to finde out the truth, the King took up the matter, and forgave both parties. On Candlemas Eve following, in divers places of England was great weathering of wind, hail, snow, rain, with thunder and lightning, whereby the Church of Baldock in Hertfordshire , and the Church and part of the Town of Walden in Essex , with other neighbouring Uillages, were sore shaken; and the Steeple of Saint Pauls in London , about two of the clock, in the afternoon, was set on fire in the midst of the shaft, first on the West side, and then on the South; and divers people espying the fire, came to quench it in the steeple, which they did with Uinegar, so far as they could find; so that when the Lord Maior with much people came to Pauls to have holpen if need had been, returned again every man to his own home, trusting to God all had been well: But anon after, between eight and nine of the clock, the fire burst out again afresh out of the steeple by reason of the wind, more hot and fervent than before, and did much hurt to the Lead and Timber thereof. Then the Lord Maior and many people came thither again: and with vinegar quenched the fire which was so violent, so that no man received any hurt. Moreover, in Sir Richard Whittingtons time lived one Richard Fleming , Bishop of Lincoln in the year 1430, who founded Lincoln Colledge in Oxford , which was afterwards in Richard the thirds time, in the year of our Lord 1479. by Tho. Rotheram Bishop of the same Sea, much augmented and enlarged, with great revenews. Likewise Magdalen College in Oxford was built; and also a great part of Eaton Colledge in Oxford was built, and also a great part of Eaton Colledge by William Wainfleet , Bishop of Winchester , who was a loving and a constant friend to Sir Richard Whittington , and did much good in many parts of this Kingdom; and the said Sir Richard did largely contribute to these and the like pious uses by the intreaty of this Bishop. In the yeare of our Lord 1419. in which Sir Richard Whittington was the third time inaugurated into the Majorality, as is before mentioned, King Henry the fift, who having conquered the greatest part of France , and espoused Katherine sole Daughter to the King, and Heir to the Crown, taking leave of his Father in law, embarked with his royall Bride, landed at Dover upon Candlemas day, leaving in France for his Deputy his brother, the Duke of Clarence : from thence arrived at London the fourteenth day of February , and the Queen came thither the one and twentieth day of the same month, being met upon Black-heath by the Lord Mayor, and three hundred Aldermen, and prime Citizens, in Gold chains, and rich and costly habits, with other sumptuous and brave devices, as Pageancs, Speeches, and shows, to the great delight and content of both their Majesties. The four and twentieth day of February following, being Saint Matthews day, her Coronation was solemnized in Saint Peters Church in Westminster : which being ended, she was afeerwards royally conveyed in the great Hall, and there under a rich Canopy of State sate to Dinner: upon whose right hand sate at the end of the same Table, the Lord Archbishops Grace of of Canterbury , and Henry called the rich Cardinall, Bishop of Winchester : upon the left hand of the Queen sate the King of Scots , in a chair of estate, and was served with covered Dishes as the Bishops were. But after them, and upon the same side next to the boords end were seated the Dutchesse of York , and Countesse of Huntington: the Earl of March holding a Scepter in his hand, kneeled upon the right side, the Earl Marshal in the like manner kneeled upon the left hand of the Queen: The Countesse of Kent sate under the Table at the right foot, and the Countesse Marshall at the left foot of her Majesty. Humphrey Duke of Glocester , was that day Overseer, and stood before the Queen bare-headed: Sir Richard Newell was Carver, and the Earles brother of Suffolk Cup-bearer; Sir Iohn Steward Sewer the Lord Clifford (instead of the Earle of Warwick ) Pantler, the Lord Wllowby (instead of the Earle of Arundell ) chief Butler, the Lord Gray Kater, Naperer, the Lord Audley (in the stead of the Earle of Cambridge ) Almner: the Earle of Worcester was Lord High Marshall, who rode about the Hall on a great Courser with many tipestave about him, to make room in the Hall. In the which Hall next after the Queen, the Barons of the Cinqueports began the Table; upon the right hand towards Saint Stevens Chappell; and beneath them at the tables ate the Uouchers of the Chancery, and upon the left hand next to the Cupboord sate Sir Richard Whittington (now the third time Lord Maior) and his brethren, the Aldermen of London . The rest of the Bishops began the table over against the Barons of the Cinqueports, & the Ladies and chief noble women the table against the Lord Maior and the Aldermen: At which two tables of the Bishops, the Bishop of London , and the Bishop of Durham sate highest at the one, and the Countesse of Stafford , and the Countesse of March on the other. And for ordering of the service, divers chiefe Lords were appointed Officers; as Steward, Controwler, Surveyer, and the like; which places were supplyed by the Earles of Northumberland, Westmerland , the Lord Fizhue , the Lord Furnevall , the Lord Gray of Wilton , the Lord Feres of Groby , the Lord Poynings , the Lord Harington , the Lord Darcy , the Lord Daker , the Lord Delaware , &c. I have shewed you only the ordering of this rich Feast, but the cost and sumptuousnesse of the fare, would ask too large and long a circumstance to discourse: what I have hitherto done, was onely to shew to the World, that at those high Solemnities, Inaugurations and Coronations, the Lord Maior of the City of London , and the Aldermen have place, and their presence is still required: the City being the Kings Chamber, and in an Interregnum hee the first and prime Officer in the Kingdom. But I fear I have dwelt too long upon the premises, which I hope, none will hold for an unnecessary deviation: I come now to deliver unto you of Sir Richard Whittingtons invitation of the King and Queen into the City, where he bounteoussy feasted them in his own house, and at his own proper charge. How great and magnificent the Londoners feasts be even amongst themselves, especially at that high and pompuous festivall at Guild-Hall the day after Simon and Iude , at the solemn Inauguration of his Lordship, who but knowes? as also the ordinary Tables of the Lord Maior and the Sheriffes, where there is free and generous entertainment for all men of fashion, and quality; the like both for plenty of dishes, and order of service is not else where to be seen, or found through Europe . If then their dayly provision be so curious and costly, what may we think their variety and rarity was at the invitation and entertainment of two such great Majesties. I must therefore leave it to the Readers imagination, being so far transcending my expression: Let it therefore give satisfaction to any one that shall doubt thereof, that it was performed to the everlasting reputation of the Inviter, the honour of the City, and great content of these Royall Personages invited: The bounty of his Table not to be question'd, I come to the fire that hee made in the Presence-chamber, where the King and Queen then Dined, which was only of sweet and odoriferous Wood, far exceeding the smell of Iuniper; for it was mixed with Mace, Cinamon, and other rare and costly spices, which did cast such a pleasant and delightfull savour through the room, that it pleased his Maiesty to call him unto him, and say, my good Lord Maior, though your fare be both choice, costly, and abundant, yet above all things I have observed in your noble entertainment, this Fire, which you have provided for me, gives me most content: To whom Sir Richard Whittington making a low obeysance, made answer, it much reioyceth me Dread Soveraign, that any thing which remaineth in my power, can give your Highnesse the least cause to be pleased: but since you praise this fiire already made, I purpose ere your sacred Majesty depart the house, to entertain you with one (I hope) that shall content you much better: the King not thing it could be possible desired him to make a proof thereof: when he (having before provided himself for the purpose) brought a great bundle of Bonds, Indentures, and Covenants under his arm said said thus to the King; Royall Soveraign, to whom I owe both my fortunes, and my life, I have here a faggot of purpose left for this Fire, which I hope, will smell much more sweetly than the rest in your nostrills; for saith he, here is first your Highnesse security for tenne thousand Markes, lent you for the maintenance of your Royall Warrs in France , by the Right Worshipfull Company of the Mercers, which I here cancel, and cast into the Fire: Fifteen hundred lent by the City to your Majesty, I send after the former; two thousand Markes borrowed of the Grocers Company, three thousand of the Merchant taylers, one thousand of the Drapers, one thousand of the Skinners, one thousand of che Skinners, one thousand of the Ironmongers, five thousand of the Merchant-Staplers; of the Goldsmiths three thousand, of the Haberdashers as much; of the Uintners, Brewers, and Brownbakers three thousand Markes: All these you see are cancell'd, and burnt saith he; with divers other Bonds for money lent by my Father in law, Alderman Fitzwarren , for the payment of your Souldiers in France , which coming unto me by Exetutorship, I have taken in, and diseharged. Others there are likewise due to me of no small summes; by divers of your Nobility here present, all which with the former I have sacrificed, to the love and honour of my Dread Soveraign, amounting to the sum of threescore thousand pounds sterling, and can your Majesty (saith he) desire to sit by a fire of a more sweet sent and sovour? At this the King was much extasi'd, and the rather, because it came so unexpectedly, and from softer a spirit, and imbracing him in his Arms, said unto him, That he thought never King had such a subiect: and at his departure, did him all the grace and honour that could descend from a King to a Subject, promising him moreover, that he should ever stand in the first rank of those whom he favoured. And so the Lord Maior bearing the sword before their two most sacred Majesties as far as Temple-bar , the King for his former service, and his most kind and loving entertainment at that time, and the Noble men, for that extraordinary courtesie offered them, all unitedly and unanimously commended his goodnesse, applauded his bounty, and wished that he might live to perpetuall memory, and so bid both him and the City for that time adieu. To omit all other circumstances, having acquainted you with the poore and mean estate of this Sir Richard Whittington when hee came first into the City of London , and by what means he was relieved in his miserable poverty; as also the fortunate successe of his small advenventure, whereby he was raised unto so Cities Governour, and how discreetly and wisely he behaved himself in his Authority and Office, gaining thereby the love and approbation of all men: And further, having plainly shewed you what goodly buildings have been raised by his great cost and charge, as one Church, two Colledges: and certain Almshouses, with yearly means left for the maintenance of all such as shall be admitted into them; and many other charitable acts performed by him, which are before related, to the great good and benefit of the City; and what things of note hapned in his time, I will now conclude with Master Stow , O that London had a park near adjoyning unto it, stored with such Deere, (as doubtlesse it hath, though not easily known) for some build Almshouses, Freeschools, Cawsies, and Bridges in needfull and necessary places; others repair ruinated and decayed Churches, relieving Hospitalls in a bountifull manner, and are weekly Benefactors to Prisons, and those performed by such agent faitfully, that the true bestowers are not publickly noed, howsoever they may be easily suspected: But the glory they seek to evade here, will (no doubt) for ever shine on them elsewhere. And that great God who hath created us, and plentifully distributed in his great bounty all things to men, and yet not given all things to any one man, lest it might take away that necessary commerse, and mutuall consociety which ought to be amongst us, stir up the minds of more of them, to imitate at least, though not to exceed them in their bounty and liberality.
