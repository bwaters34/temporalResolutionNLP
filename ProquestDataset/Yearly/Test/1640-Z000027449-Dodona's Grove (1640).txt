OR, THE VOCALL FORREST. meet one another; Their ayrie whistlings, and soft hollowe whispers became Articulate sounds, mutually intelligible, as if to the soule of vegetation , the sensitive faculties and powers of the intellect also, had been co-infus'd into them: They traveld to strange Countries, crossd Seas, made peace and warre, alliances and leagues, assumed names and Characters of distinction, and discharged all the functions of Rationall creatures. In the sacred Oracles wee read of one that discernd men to walke like Trees , but here cleane contrary, you shall see Trees walke like men . We read also there of a mighty Monarck , that was meant by a Tree ; And it is no new Character of man, that, He is a Tree revers'd . The great Sicilian Antiquary leaveth upon record, that in the nonage of the world, mens voyces were indistinct and confus'd; And sojourning chiefly in Woods , by a kind of assimilation and frequent impressions in the eare, they resembled those soft susurrations of the Trees wherewith they conversd; untill Time , (which ripeneth ) and Art which perfecteth all things, & hath a greater interest in speech then Nature her selfe, did distinguish these mishapen sounds into syllables, and so by degrees into language. At that time, when this parley of Trees begun, I my selfe was but a little, little Plant newly sprung up above ground; And passing through the terrible Birch to Boetia , where I tooke in my best Sap , and came by degrees to a consistent growth (which was not very high, in so much that some thinke I was set in the wane of the Moone) I was transplanted from Boetia to Tamisond , And thence as my Genius strongly led me, I often crossed the Seas, and rangd up and down through most of the Forrests of the lower world; And as I passed along, I observed the motions, and studied the properties of sundry sorts of Trees , as well forren, as home sprung , and of them I intend to relate some passages; In the narration whereof I will endeavour to goe between the Bark and the Tree , as neere as possibly I can with safety, to sift out, and set down the truth of things, for the prime vertue of story is verity . Wherefore I hope to obtaine a candid construction of this rough hewen, ill timberd discourse, and that the Reader will be pleased as he shall passe along through these woods , to affoord mee somtimes his second thoughts, and observe also the constant veine of impartiality, which runnes through the whole worke, which he shall find to be such, that it will infranchise his judgment every where: And such, I know will dispense with my errors and slips, for it is very hard but one passing through so many Forrests as I intend, may meet with some stumbling blocks in his way. ![](/images/inline/Dgk.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ngr.gif) ![](/images/inline/dgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/rgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ggr.gif) ![](/images/inline/iacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/agr.gif)  . \---Sacra Jovi Quercus. A Character of DRUINA . Forrest, wherein the royall Oke rules in chiefe, and with such a latitude of power, that Hee stretcheth forth his branches to the Sea, and his boughes unto the great Rivers . It was ordained by Heaven, that She should be principally protected by Neptune, who with a flying gard of brave winged Coursers doth engarrison her so strongly, that, lying safe in his bosome, she may be said to be  \---Media insuperabilis Unda. She being endowed with those two properties which that great Register of natures secrets requires in an invincible Country, viz.   [  1 ] A secure and easie going out for the Native,   [  2 ] and a doubtfull hard comming in for the stranger; which made the C aerulean God so indulgent of his Druina, and to repose in her such a rare confidence, that besides the clustre of Diadems which begirt her high fronded fore-head by land, he transmitted to her long since his very Trident, making her Impresse, yea, Empresse of the Sea, and that in so high a degree of Soveraignty, that in her owne waves, hee gave her an Exclusive propriety; in so much that the utmost extent of her desmenes royall, are adjudged, by some great Clarkes, to bee the shoares of the neighbouring Forrests . Whereby she is growne so famous through all the inhabited earth, and formidable to the next adjacent regions, that maugre all their menaces, pretensions, and practises, she gives them the law upon salt water; which makes her a terror to her foes, a shelter to her friends, and security to her neighbours; But above all, she hath thereby a constant strength to defend her selfe: And selfe defence hath beene alwaies held the first maxime of policy . Much more might be spoken in honour of Druina, which I suspend, untill I have made you acquainted with some of her neighbouring Forrests, because I am to make often transcursions into them as I passe along; And first of her next opposite neighbour Anspelona, where the Majesticke Vine doth monarchize in the highest degree of Soveraignty.  Rode Caper vitem ; tamen hic, cum stabis ad aras, In tua quod fundi cornua possit, erit.  one of her chiefest Granaries and Winecellars; a square of 550. miles travers, take the diameter where you will, thronging with such multitudes of sappy and spritefull plants, that the generall calcule which was made in the last perambulation exceeded eight millions; a rare soyle that in no larger a circumference, can give radicall moisture to such a number without borrowing of any; Corne, Wine, and Salt, her three rich staples doe so abound in her, that shee seasoneth, and keepes from starving very many of her neighbours, but specially the Forrest of the South, which otherwise would perish for the staffe of life. There is no Region on Earth so daintily watered, with such great navigable Rivers, whereof some are said to bee pav'd with Troutes, borderd with crevices, and imbroderd with Swannes; And upon these multitudes of brave Cities stand, and all her great ones stand so; but amongst them the midland townes are most flourishing and abounding in wealth, which shewes that her riches are interne and domesticke; For as it is the marke of a good housewife to be more Vendax, then Emax, rather a seller then Buyer, so is it of a good Countrey; And such a one is Ampelona, which sends forth far more, then she fetcheth in. The War-like Vine swayeth here in the most absolute forme of supremacy that may bee, for Hee not onely makes Peace and Warre, summons and dissolves generall meetings, pardoneth, naturallizeth, ennobleth, stamps, and layeth value upon coynes, but also enacts lawes, executes justice, and layeth impositions at pleasure; and He may thanke Druina for this boundlesse power, for when she by the strength of her horned Yew had feld downe a great number of the strongest Trees that were in Ampelona, and made such firme invasions into her very bowels, that there could be no universall assembly, the necessity of the times cast the power of the three estates upon the Vine himselfe, that his mandats should stand for lawes, whereby he layd what taxes, and made what leavies he pleased; His successors made vertue of this necessity, which though temporary at first, continueth ever since; For soveraignty where she gets an inch, stickes not sometimes to stretch it to an ell. But that which made it more passable was, that the burden lighted chiefly upon the poore coppices and Underwoods; so that ever since, the Vine himselfe with the taller sorts of Trees, specially the holy Yews (who ingrosse more than all the rest, and are thought by computation to have the third part of the Forrest,) sucke all the sappe, and leave the poore shrubs to dry up, fade away, and wither; and when they have got any moysture, they serve but as spunges for others: Out of which disproportion ariseth this inconvenience, that they become pusillanimous, and almost uselesse for military services, being so often peeld, that they never come to be perfect and firme timber . It is alwaies a mixd government twixt Peace and Warre, which finds perpetuall employment for many of her stirring spirits, having the advantage thereby to bee furnished upon all occasions with experienc'd martiall instruments; for Ampelona having open frontires contiguous every where with some Alien, She cannot joyne Peace and security together, nor fetch a sound sleepe, but Hercules -like with clubbe in hand. She is the greatest one knot of strength in the Western world, and for the situation fittest to disjoyne or unite her neighbours forces, and consequently to be Arbitratrix and compoundresse of any quarrell that may intervene: And never, since she woare the Imperiall diademe, was Ampelona so potent, nor then, so well knit and compacted as now she is; so that it is held a maxime, If Ampelona combat not her selfe, she is invincible; And this shee hath too often done, turning the sword of civill broyles into her own bowels, so farre that the bell hath often told, but never yet rung quite out for her liberty, which was thought not long since to be upon point of expiring; and no wonder, shea-bounds so with quicke sets and wildings, and a world of boyling volatil spirits, impatient of peace any longer then they are recovering the ruines of warre; present danger magnanimats them, and inflames their courage, but expectation makes it languish; so that the Forrest of the South (which is ever emulous of Ampelona ) compareth their valour to a squib, or fier of flame, which burnes and crackles for the time, but suddenly extinguisheth; Indeed fury when the first blast is spent turnes commonly to feare, and they that are possessed therewith may be said to be like the moneth of March, which entreth like a Lion, but goeth out like a Lamb . Ampelona is one of the chiefest climes of complement and courtship under heaven, which puts so large a distance twixt the tongue and the heart, that they are seldome relatists. Most of her Plants have the Heliotropian quality of the Marigold and Tulip, who follow the motion of the Sunne opening and shutting with him; The fancy predominates more than the judgement, but they in whom both these concurre are admirable, as there is amongst them at present a notable example, which serves for a mighty proppe to the Vine, and 'tis well knowne no Tree needs props more. For friendship, love commonly flames there, before it burnes, and so cannot be long lasting, for though first affection maketh deepest impression, yet that love is held most permanent, which dives into the soule by soft degrees of mutuall society, and is matur'd by time; very acute they are, and cautelous in treating,  & therin have prov'd (more than once) too hard, for plain down right dealing Druina; finally some say, one shall best discerne an Ampelonian, and most to his advantage, if one looke upon him, as we use to doe upon scarlet (his prime colour) the dye whereof is better discernd by quicke glances, and a passing eye, then by a fixd. I write not this to derogat from noble Ampelona, for I honour her in a most high degree, having practically found her better sort of Trees though allowed their fancies, (and that they participate somewhat with the Corke, and are subject to be shaken with incertaine winds ) to be the most generous, daring and ventrous spirits, and fullest of resolution and mettall for their Country and honour, of any upon the surface of the earth, and what was said before must be understood, as the Philosophers use to restraine many propositions in their Schooles, Non de singulis generum, sed de generibus singulorum: No where are there more quicke inventive and penetrating capacities, fraught with all kind of scientifiall knowledge; Not any are more generally imitated for fashion, comportment and garb, which many of her neighbours doe follow to a forc'd kind of affectation, thinking they are not refin'd till then; not any have more of the Cavalier then they, the Levant parts ring more of them, and their martiall atchievements then of any other Nation. But I have sojourn'd too long in Ampelona, I will now crosse the Hils to Elaiana, whence if a meridian wind bloweth, I am sure to know when I am neere her, by those sweet fragrant odours she casts from her very shrubbes, for the bruite animals there make themselves beds of Rose-mary and Thyme. But strange it is, and indeed very strange to me, that there being but a hill, yea a small bridge of partition twixt Ampelona, and Elaiana, there should bee such an antipatheticall and quite differing genius in their plants; I know, Nature delights, and triumphs in dissimilitudes, but here she seemes to have industriously studied it: The nature of the one is debonnaire and aco'stable; of the other retird and supercilious: The one quicke and spritefull; The other slow and saturnine; The one bushy and tufted on the top; The other lop'd short: The one delights in a close thicke rind; The other goes thin and scarified; The one gay underneath, the other without, which makes some of them to bee compared to the Cinnamon Tree, whose Rind is more worth than the body; The one takes the ball before the bound; The other stayeth for it, and commonly fetcheth a surer stroake; The one in the cariage of his designes is like the Wind, the other like the Sunne in the fable, when they went to try their strength upon a passengers cloake: The one knowes how to shuffle the Cards better; the other playeth his game more cunningly; The one disgests all he swallowes; The other is subject to cast it up againe; The one contracts and enchaines his words speaking pressingly and short; The other delights in long breathd accents, which he prolates with such pauses, that before he be at a period of his sentence, one may reach a second thought. In fine Saturne swayeth o're the one, and Mercury o're the other, with whom the Moone also hath a great stroake, so that some thinke the bush which the man in the Moone carrieth on his backe, did grow first in Ampelona, and that the wheele of fortune was made of a peece of her timber; Out of these various premisses you may inferre that there is a politicall, morall and naturall opposition and difference twixt these so neere neighbours; both in their comportment, garb, fancy and humour, so farre, that one may say, what the one is not, the other is: insomuch that if you would fetch one from the remotest parts the Sunne displayes his beames upon, yea from the very Antipodes; he will agree with either, better then they one with another; yet they both symbolize in this, that they love to look upon themselves through multiplying glasses, and the bigger end of the prospectise. But I must hasten to Elaiana . prodigall of his beames here, which makes the soyle lesse fruitfull, and to be a kind of wildernesse in comparison of Ampelona, being like a Libbards skinne, here a spot, and there a spot inhabited; she swels so every where with huge hils; And some would make a question whether the minds of the Inhabitants or her mountaines be highest; the tops whereof by reason of the tenuity and clearenesse of aire, (for sometimes you shall not see in the whole hemisphere from morning to night as much cloud as would line a Monmoth Cappe) you may discerne above two hundred Miles off, and some of them periwigd with snowes all the yeare long, And on some, one shall find more difference in point of temper of ayre, twixt bottome and top, then twixt Sommer and Winter in other places; But where Elaiana hath valleys, there she is deliciously fertile, such blessings humility carieth alwaies with her; Her rivers having for the most part high bankes, and shallow bottomes, serve not for Navigation, but are wheeld up into small Cataracts, and so divided into sluces, to humectat the bordering soyle, and make it wonderfully productive: A cheap Country to travell in, for one will hardly find meat for money, (but sawce good store) the conveyance of provision being so difficult, yet this scarcity carieth with it a notable advantage for Military uses, wherewith nature seemes to recompence her, for her Plants are the tougher thereby, and can endure more then they that sprout forth of wanton soft soyles; Moreover her abruptnesse, barrenes and heat, carry with them another mighty benefit, for she cannot be so easily overrunne by forren force, in regard that besides the difficulty of passage, an army would either starve for want, or miscarry, for the unusuall heat of the clime, which I beleeve was the reason, that the Roman Eagles could hardly fly over her in nine score yeares, whereas they flew through and through Ampelona in lesse then nine . For the quality every thing she beares is passing good, only she failes in the quantity, And did she abound in plenty, as she excels in perfection of all things (by reason of the full concoction the Sunne makes) specially had she Corne proportionable to her greatnesse, she would prove terrible to all her neighbours. The mighty Olive who now swayeth, thrives well, and fructifieth by ingrafting upon the lovely Ampelonian Vine . Hee keepes his Court neere the very centre of Elaiana, like the Sunne in the Heavens, which being in the midst, equally communicats his beames to all. And a spacious kingdome is like a great Indian hide, plant your foot on one side or corner, the other will bound up against you, tread on the middle, all parts will lye flat; so some hold it a maxime in policy, for the Prince to reside in the very navill of his kingdome, to encounter all insurrections with the more celerity, that may arise in any other part. But now me thinkes I spie a satyre with a huge bushy head rushing out of Ampelona, and breaking out into this critical discourse of Elaiana; That the time was when Elaiana did containe and content her selfe within the circumference of her own boundaries, without any further encroachments, but of late yeares she hath shot up, and spread her branches farre and neare into all parts of the habitable earth, whereby shee is growne up to so monstrous and giant- like a proportion, that she is become formidable to all her neighbours, in such sort, as she puts every one to stand upon his gard, and have a continuall larum-bell in his eares; they stand gazing at her vast bulke, and wonder when she will leave growing; for in her politicall designes she differs from all her Neighbours, in regard that whereas they do only labour and cast about how to conserve and secure what they have already, and keep the scales even, her counsels tend still to enlarge and augment her territories. The discovery of Columbina, I confesse, together with the conquest, was a worke of hers; yet it is observ'd those vast treasures she transports thence thrive little, in regard of the Ocean of humane, though savage bloud, she spilt there; so that some affirme the bloud would overpoise all the gold shee had ever thence, if they were counter-balanc'd; And as that treasure was first got by such effusions of bloud, so the greatest part of it, hath beene spent ever since in bloud, for most of the broyles of the Westerne world have beene fed and fomented by it. But that immense tract of earth she holds under that clime, is preserv'd rather by the conceipt and report of her greatnesse, then by any intrinsicke strength: yet I cannot deny but her dominions are very spacious, that the Sun never forsakes her quite, perpetually shining in some part or other above her hemisphere: a grandeza, I confesse, that none of all the foure Monarchies could vaunt of, no not the Roman, whose greatnesse was said to have no horison, though falsly, for he could never crosse Ganges, or clime over Caucasus, Insomuch that Elaiana glorieth, Apollo only with his chariot can measure the extent of her territories: And they speake of certaine Ambassadours that came not long since to the now regnant Olive from a Pagan Emperour, upon whose credentiall letters was endors'd this superscription; To the King who hath the Sunne for his helmet . Publike fame hath long given out that Elaiana aimeth at the fift Monarchy, but that is a fond conceipt of hers and buildings of Castles in the ayre; for she hath beene told long since by the Oracle, that she shall never attaine it, because all other soyles reject her plants, and fly from under their shadow as the Serpent from the Ash, who will leap sooner into a fire: in so much that from those places to which she gives protection, she seldome hath any affection; for the Elaianians are observed to partake of the nature of Oile in divers qualities, therefore most properly are they governd by the Olive . First, Oyle is observed to swimme still on the top, and the reason the Naturalists give, is, because aire doth most predominant in it, so are they lifted up with an ayrie conceipt (for ambition is nought but ayre) that they are only design'd to be Lords Paramount of the world. Oyle will hardly or never (unlesse it be well beaten) mingle and incorporat with any other liquid thing: so they, wheresoever they come, doe very hardly agree, and sympathize with any other Nation. Oyle hath a dilating quality, that by soft insensible degrees it spreads and still gaines upon the body where it fals, so they by politicke close wayes use to eat into, and incroach upon their neighbours, or more properly for this subject they are like the Tartarian plant Boraneth, which growing up to the visible forme of a LAMBE, insensibly eates up all the grasse round about it. Lastly, Oyle is slow, smooth and solid, so are they observed to be in their motion, though it be a question yet unresolved, whether their affected gravity and slownes in their negotiations have tended more to their prejudice or advantage: And they would bring all others, that have to doe with them, to follow their pace, it being one of their maximes, that policy must move after the motion of Saturne, the highest of the Planets: yet although they are long in consulting, they are quicke and sudden in executing their designes, and therein are rather of the nature of the Mulberry, which the Arbolists observe, to be long in begetting keeping his buds, but the cold seasons being pass'd, hee shootes them all out in a night. Another obstacle to Elaiana's, pretended Monarchy may be, that it is observ'd, the Soveraigne Ministers she employeth abroad in the highest kind of trust, are so intentive for the improvement of their owne fortunes, that it is growne to a proverbe, some of them gnaw, others eate, and some devoure in those places, wherein they are deputed to beare Soveraigne sway; Adde hereunto that her forme of government is none of the pleasingst, for shee chooseth to rule rather by feare than love, And where shee gets any love, it is drawne as threed through a needles eye, out of the apprehensions of feare, it being one of her principles, That obedience derived from such a love is surest, in regard that feare as the carefullest and greatest house-wife of our passions, swayeth more powerfully o're all the rest, and keeps them still in centinell, And so makes good subjects, as it did Gods at first, Primus in orbe Deos fecit Timor------  Besides all this, as one hath lately observed, Elaiana hath beene a good while troubled with a fastidious issue, wch she caused to be made at first for a dizzines in the head that proceeded no doubt from that huge height she is mounted unto; It was cauterizd at first by Itelia, who fetch'd her iron from Druina and Ampelona; at the beginning it purg'd only the grosse humours, but afterwards it exhausted her very radicall moysture, (which she suckd chiefly from Columbina, ) and her naturall heat (the two columnes of life) began to decay. She was often with Apollo to have this issue stop'd, but there after a long debate, she was positively advis'd, by the unanimous vote of the most exquisit Doctors assembled of purpose to know the nature of her disease, for to continue the issue still open, for if she stop'd it, she was like to fall into a worse malady, viz. a dangerous dropsie, whereof there appear'd in her some symptomes, by the unquenchable thirst shee hath of domination and rule. Moreover it is lately given out that she intends a speedy pilgrimage to Delphus, for a cordial against the weaknesse of her stomacke, in regard the concocting heat seems to be somwhat impair'd; for whereas before she never used to disgorge, what she had once swallowed, she hath lately cast up some good bits, yea the most precious and sweetest she had, when she cast up the last, all her Saints were a while taken away from her, so that she had not one left to pray unto; whereby it appeares though her appetite be as good as ever it was to like all she seeth, yet the retentive vertue of her stomacke is not so strong as formerly. Lastly, the Regions o're which the broad spreading Olive signorizeth, are squared up and downe, and dispers'd by such an unsociable distance (which makes him receive baffles sometimes from petty companions) that except Elaiana her selfe, and not all she neither, but that part which gives the Castle for its crest, together with Columbina, and some trienniall donatives she hath from Hiparcha, the in-come doth no where countervaile the charge of garrisons and governors. Yet I must confesse, the two benefits that accrue to him by this diversity of territories are very considerable, First the opportunity to propagat piety; Secondly, to have choice of imployments for his subjects, and meanes thereby to breed up wise, undertaking and heroicke spirits; For great commands elevate the minde to great thoughts, which being conversant with weighty, and high passages, the soule is inlargd thereby; whereas inferiour states by their pettie employments and slender rewards impoverish and abase the fancy, rendring it too narrow for high undertakings. Countries of conquest cannot bee conserv'd without continuall expence, nor their service usd with like assurance, specially by Elaiana, which can relye no where upon meere love and fiduciary obedience, unlesse it be at her owne home, where I cannot deny but she is exemplarily loyall to her selfe in a high exact obedience. Touching other places she may be said to hold them, as one should do a Wolfe by the eares; nor will I speake now of the crazines of her title to many of them: So, that she is never in perfect tranquillity abroad; and she esteemes her selfe to be in a manner in perfect peace, if shee hath onely to doe with that huge Bramble of Alclarona; so that it may be hence infer'd, that the Olive is of late yeares much degenerated from his Primitive nature, for whereas he was used to be the Embleme of peace, he now ruffleth in a continuall course of armes; And this is the reason I beleeve, that the branch of Olive, which at the beginning was the ancient cognisance of Elaiana, is turn'd of late yeares to the Ragged staffe . The Ampelonian Satyre, having thus disgorg'd his stomacke suddenly ranne in, and re-imboschd himselfe. For my owne particular, let Ampelona tattle what she will against Elaiana, I professe to honour her for sundry reasons, I very much honour her for the solidnesse and secrecy of her Counsels; For her loyalty to her Prince, her patience and admirable phlegme, her painfull and long moulded consultations ( proles tarde erescentis Oliv ae ) her deepe prudence and circumspection, and indeed the Olive being sacred to Pallas is an Embleme of prudence as well as of peace; she deserves honour for her constancy, though with infinite expence and numberlesse inconveniences, for the recovery of her own; And without doubt it was a singular blessing from heaven, that the discovery of Columbina, with the conquest thereof was reserv'd for her; I respect her for her perpetuall professed feud against the common enemy, That her plants never rove abroad to beare armes for any strange Prince, whereas others receive pay, and serve under the banners of Infidels, and oftentimes against their owne naturall Princes; And as for Warres, so for Wares they goe not abroad any where to trafficke but into the dominions of their owne Prince, which makes the Olive to have no small advantage of his neighbours upon any sudden breach. Amongst other places where the Martiall Oliv ae shoots forth his imperious boughs, Leoncia is one, and thither I am bound next, but the worst is, that I must passe through the very heart of Ampelona; a mighty incommodity. For she being in perpetuall diffidence, or actuall enmity with her, but alwaies emulous and suspectfull of her, I am afraid to be stop'd or searchd, if not strip'd in the way; And if I passe by Sea, I may chance fall from the frying pan into the fire, I meane into the hands of the Italians, who of all other are mots skilfull in rummaging and pillaging; Besides I use to have a squeazie stomacke on salt Water, for I doe nothing but tell what Tree the Shippe is made of.  \---Noli irritare Leonem.  Academy of armes for many yeares. The moderne (though meanest) kind of Militia is here altogether in practise, which consists in blockments and batteries, not pitch'd fields. Never was there such a small circumference of ground, so turnd up, and unboweled by the Pioner, so watred with bloud, and calcin'd as it were by the flames and fury of Warre: which hath made it a fatall peece of inheritance to Elaiana, who hath tuggd here so long for her title, with such a vast profusion of treasure and effusion of bloud, that if she had not bin draind this way, she might have tiled her palaces with occidentall gold and silver, and by this time happily have made her selfe Mistris of Timaurania her next transmarin neighbour, and regaind the Mount of Olives and achiev'd other high feates against Alcharona: The vast expences she hath beene at, to reduce Leoncia to her old obedience, and entire subjection, exceed the value of the thing it selfe forty times over at least, if all Leoncia were to be sold in the market by out-cry; And questionlesse envie her selfe must needs acknowledge this so costly a constancy in Elaiana never to abandon her owne, to bee a brave magnanimous vertue. Leoncia hath many Groves of different plantations, but in the stemme of Elaiana they all met as lines in one center, and came to be ingrafted all upon one stocke, some by conquest, others by donation, and cession, but most of them by inoculations; There was a designe more than once to reduce them all to a kingdome; But the multiplicity of customes, and miscellany of municipall rights, that sundry places clayme by inheritance, were not compatible with a Monarchy: and the invading of this freedome of customes with that of the conscience, was the first fatall cause of Leoncias revolt from her alleageance to Elaiana . The royall Olive was solemnly sworne at his Inauguration to observe these things inviolable; then to come to visit her once every seventh yeare, himselfe; as also to ridde her quite of all forren force, and to performe other obligatory conditions; But hee being once gone, and being dispensed withall for his septenniall visit by a holy instrument from Petropolis, he resolvd to governe them by subalterne Ministers, who it seemes scrud up the pinnes of power too high, they layed on new taxes, fell'd down some of the ancientst tall Trees (as the Roman did the heads of the poppies ) so that they might bee compard to the Axe in the Fable, who having got a handle of the Woods with much entreaty, fell afterwards to cut downe and destroy them at pleasure: A Counsell of bloud was erected, and a harder yoake layed upon the conscience in holy rites. One reason the Olive gave, was, that Leoncia her selfe began to infringe her old priviledges by introducing new formes into divine service, and abolishing the old, in which by vertue of his primitive oath he was indispensably sworne to continue them; And thus the argument was retorted. Druina and Ampelona intervend to compose these differences, but they had a short answer of the Olive, that hee needed not the helpe of any, to reduce his own subjects to conformity, but the oddes that were, he would referre to the Cedar his Cozen, who as it seemes proving no indifferent Arbiter, Leoncia sheltred her selfe (though Druina had the first tender made her both of protection and Soveraignty) under the branches of the Royall Vine, who sending the very next of his owne stemme to governe her, he attempted, by the pr aecipitat Counsell of some greene springals about him, to ravish her, and render himselfe absolute. But hee had a foule repulse; yet she profferd againe her protection to the Vine, who having a most pernicious fire kindled (as it was thought after by the Factors of Elaiana ) within the very bowels of his owne Forrest, hee had worke enough cut him out to extinguish that. Hereupon shee made her humble recours to DRUINA, who as well for her owne securitie (as the state of things then stood) as movd with much Princely compassion to succour the afflicted, gave her shelter. In so much that ever since Druina hath servd her as a backe of steele, and her forces have beene the very sinewes of her strength against the stroakes of the ragged staffe, and the iron rodde of Elaiana; who in those Groves shee reserves yet under her protection and obedience, continueth to cut and loppe her so close, that one shall heare up and down a repining rather against the harshness of government, then a desire of revenge against the Enemy.  \------Et jam nos inter opacas Musa vocat salices.  Elaiana, Itelia was the chiefe, who by erecting her GROVE of WILLOWES to a republicke, and drawing after her five and more of the neighbouring Groves into one body politicke, in lieu of the Olive, tooke the Orenge to governe her, yet farre from the degree of Soveraigne power, but rather to serve her in a high martiall way: And to beare up against the Orenge, the Olive did luckily light upon a notable Ligurian Thorne who made the willowes to feele his Prickles in many places, and twixt the Orenge and Thorne sundry brave encounters, and cunning traverses of warre happened. By these meanes Itelia brought one of her Fisher townes to bee the prime Mart of all Leoncia, and to a stupendious height of commerce and riches, and other strange feates she hath done since, to the astonishment and admiration of all that know her. And it seemes all things conspird to raise Itelia to this passe; First, the distance of her great Master; the humor of her plants being of a nature patient and industrious and more inclinable to a democraticall government; Adde hereunto the quality of the Country every where indented with water, and therby fortifi'd, and made inaccessible, nature her selfe undertaking that way her protection, so that she can overwhelme and turn her selfe into one pond when she list. Hereunto concurd a further advantage of situation, having behind her Elatena, and her great king the Fir, for her friend, and those places which affoord all kind of materials for shipping, and for all kind of nutriment and military supplies hard before her Druina and Ampelona, both swarming with superfluous Graffes, and suspectfull of Elaiana's greatnesse, and thereby not unwilling to contribute strength for community of danger, and consequently of reciprocall conservation, which must needs be the strongest tie of Politicall love . But now mee thinkes I spie againe a Sunne burnt wainscot fac'd Satyre rush out of Elaiana, swelling with spleene and revenge and bursting out into these vociferations; That Itelia is the nearest neighbour to Hell of any place upon earth, because seated lowest, and so is thought to conferre sometimes with infernall spirits: That she is a double-Vsurpresse, in detaining not only Elaiana from her right, but the very fish of the Sea also from their habitation; That she lives upon on others idlenesse; That her state is patch'd up of depredations; That she is the rendevous of all schismatickes; that if one wanted a religion, he might have his choice there; That God and nature never intended her for a mansion to rationall creatures, she being destitut of the most necessary things that conduce to maintaine them; That she burnes up her earth before the day of judgment; That whereas her willowes were usd to bee of a pliable and humble nature, they are degenerated lately to Trees of a tougher bulke, yea into stubborne poplars; so that if occasion were offered, the Oke and the Vine would find it a harder taske to suppresse them, then ever they had to raise them; That in her negotiations with Druina and Ampelona shee hath turnd entreating to treating: That she hath beene the Incendiary directly or collaterally of all the combustions that have happened this side the line, ever since her revolt from the Olive; That she is a forge of false Coynes, whereby she hath damnified Elaiana as much as any other way, by importing counterfait stampes: that shee hath rare inventions to export Gold and Silver, to raise or depresse their rates, and abase the allay; That she hath reaches beyond IEVVE, or GENOWAY in new wayes of Usury, in Bankes, Lotteries, and Lombards, in bargaining and bartering, for shee will make the Fox tayle pay for the whole skinne; That she marr's her neighbours Markets abroad, underselling them in their owne commodities; That shee is growne extraordinary witty in devising new tortures, by fire and water, as she made tryall lately upon the Druinians in Baymona: In fine that She is a nest of Water Ratts, a mount of Pismires, the Caterpiller Cankar and Cobwebbs that infects the Olive and hinders his further growth, the vermine that corrodes his mines. Thus the Elaianian Satyr did rave, and rend the very ayre with his loud clamors, but in regard they are but the fruits of adusted choler, and the evaporations of a vindicative spirit, Itelia needs not much care for them, besides she must give loosers leave to speak . For my own particular, I professe to respect and love Itelia for divers regards, yea, I admire the Itelians for their industry and inventions at shore  & sea, where they swim like Elephants, whiles other wade like sheep, and indeed they are the only doers of miracles in these moderne times, for they force an habitation with infinite expence and paines out of the very jawes of Neptune, by checking his impetuous billowes, and teaching the world, how much art, can curbe and controule Nature . I love them for their cleanliness, in their food, fabrickes, and shipping; for their singular parsimony, for their perseverance, and indefatigable pursute of their designes at home and abroad, For that rare unitie and unanimous zeale they have to the common good, which is such that so many differing Groves seeme to be but one Tree girt about with the cincture of concord. I wonder at them for their prudent and equall distribution of wealth, not one amongst them being excessive rich or excessive poore, nor upon any part of the earth fewer beggars, it being as rare to see one there, as it had been to have met with a Poet in Platoes common-wealth. I honour them for their exactnesse in military discipline, for no where is the marching Souldier more regular; I commend them for their plain downe-right dealing, and punctuality in payment of cambios, contracts and the Souldiers Salary, and herein give me the service of a common-wealth, rather than a kingdome; And lastly, I must love them in regard they are the surest confederates of Druina, for I know not, where else she can picke out a fast friend, or reposefull confident of such reciprocall interest, and whose politicke ends are so concentricke; a friend that will shine with her in the darke, if need be, as old willowes use to doe: That she helpes away Druina with many of her superfluous Graffs, and breeds her military Instruments, and touching the mutuall dependency of conservation betweene them, that Embleme of the two pitchers swimming together representing Druina and Itelia with this motto, Si concutimur, frangimur, carieth with it a great deale of truth. I respect her that she stucke close to Druina in two great actions; one of defence, the other of offence against Elaiana; And could Elaiana have brought her intentions home to her aym, as to have rangd all Leoncia to an entire obedience, and so have made her her chiefe rendevous, and magazin of instruments of warre, and Academy of armes, what just danger and perpetuall concussions of feare, she would have struck into Druina and Ampelona also, one of a meane capacity and foresight may easily judge. And now that Itelia is come to so convenient and settled subsistence, it were no unwholesome advise that she would take for her motto,  \---Nil ultra, hic terminus esto. A true maxime it is, and ever hath beene, that, that state which goeth out of the lists of mediocrity, passeth also the limits of safety: there is a cloud of examples to this purpose: while Sparta kept her selfe within those boundaries that Lycurgus prescrib'd unto her, she was both safe and flourishing; but attempting to enlarge her territories by new acquests of other Cities in Greece and Asia, shee went every day declining: But what need I rake the ashes of antiquity for instances so farre off? Let Adriana her sure friend and confederat forewarne her, who no longer then one age agoe, thinking by offensive undertakings upon her neighbours to spread her wings wide, was like to mewe all her feathers . Therefore Itelia should doe well, to stand now chiefly upon the defensive, specially neere home, for it is no lesse prudence, to preserve then purchase, And if she thinks to grapple more, I feare it will weaken her hold, and must needs prejudice some places which now flourish with commerce under her, that have risen out of the ruines of these she goeth about to fasten upon further, and besides (which is not the least thing to be thought upon) it will breed scruples and ombrages of doubts in her confederats, and draw on her selfe more envie then she is aware of. It is not improper that the Itelian is compard to the Ant for his sedulity and labour; and let him still continue an Ant, for if he thinke to turne to a fly, Elaiana will tell him she hath a proverb, that God gives winges to the Ant, that she may destroy her selfe the sooner . The truth is, that Itelia is growne up, by an extraordinary industry, to a mighty height and subsistence of wealth, and navigable power: and the world is now at that passe, that he who is Lord of the Sea, is also of the shore; Nor I dare avouch, did the Roman republicke though as well swadled in her infancy, as any that ever was, come neere her in so short a time, and some observe that in her proceedings she drawes to a neare analogie with the Roman, whose two most advantagious vertues in casting the foundation of that vast monarchy, was paines, and parsimony; for the first, she is admirable, specially at Sea, where She swimmes like the great Leviathan, and carrieth away Druina's fish by whole fleets, turning them abroad into present treasure, or bartering them for rich commodities; and this may be said to be one of the maine staples of her commerce. It is trafficke that gives her a being, in the mystery whereof she over reachet all others, for navigation being her only trade, and having little or no lands at all to manure, she digges into the bowels of the deep, and having had in times pass'd but a few fisher boates, she now displayeth her colours through all parts of the vast Ocean, where any of the windes blow, which from the number of foure shee first brought to a subdivision of two and thirty, And of these foure worthies which compassed the terrestriall Globe one was hers, two of the other of Druina . And it seemes Nature her selfe hath purposely design'd her Natives and the Country it selfe for Navigation and Negotiation; Them, as I said before by a dextrous kind of propensity, the Country, by apt position; For many mighty rivers passing through her Territories to disimboke themselves into the Ocean, they may bee said to pay her tribute as well as to Neptune; which rivers branching themselves into large and bearing streames, doe so fitly serve one another, and all the whole, that it seemes dame Nature, in framing humane bodies did not discover more providence in the distribution of veines and arteries for the easie conveyance of bloud into each part, as she hath shewd here in dispersing, and disposing of those waters so orderly for trafficke: These Rivers bring her what the large continent of Rhenusium, and other Easterne dominions use to affoord, and she lying betweene them and the Sea, furnisheth them with all sorts of far fetchd forren commodities; Thus she makes a rare vertue of necessity, for having almost nothing of her owne, yet She abounds with all things. Furthermore it is observed that war, which useth to impoverish others, enricheth her, for navall prizes make up a good part of her wealth; But while want and war makes her thus trot up and downe, it is questiond, if her plants were rooted in some selfe sufficient soyle, whether they would still continue so industrious; or whether they would subsist as well if they were suffered to rest in a supine and perfect peace, as they have done hitherto in war; peace leaving every one to attend his particular pleasure or profit, while the apprehensions of feare in time of warre make all concur for the common safety: And the long familiar habitude, they have had of armes is such, that they have as much certaintie in their art of War, as others have in theirs of peace . Touching these doubts I will not undertake their decision, but leave it to them, who have felt the pulse of their dispositions longer then I. There is no part of the habitable earth, considering the small circuit of territory Leoncia hath, where there is a greater number of martiall instruments, for the Olive cut his Ragged staffe out of one of these Groves, at first, where there is also a greater confluence of all sorts of exoticke plants, and where one may find more differing rites, customes and tempers of humors. They that border upon Ampelona are quicke, vivacious and approaching the conversable nature of their neighbours: They that spring up in the middle part, which are the right Leoncians, somewhat more slow, and retird. The Itelians discrepant from both, respectlesse of gentry, of few words, for they barrell up commonly more then they can broach, and so may be said to be like a great bottle with a narrow necke; yet are they most cunning and circumspect in negotiating, specially when they have bin tampering with the Vine or the hop, and are dabbled a little with their liquor. They are of a homely out-side, and heavie in action, which heavinesse is recompenced with two notable advantages, advisednesse and perseverance, mighty friends to great attempts; And all this may be imputed to the property of the soyle it selfe, which being all twixt marsh and moorish, hath such a qualifying force, that when plants of a more vivacious temper come to ingraft amongst the Willowes and Osiers, their imps presently partake rather of the nature of the soyle, then the stocke, and so doe all animals else. Having thus travers'd the diameter of Ampelona, visited Elaiana, pass'd through Leoncia, and taken such a painefull survay of Itelia, and her asssociated Groves, I should seeme injurious to Druina to have saluted her so slightly; Therefore I will re-imbarke and steere my course thither againe, and then proceed in my maine designe. sufficient that she seemes as it were to thrust away from her all the world besides, as being a substantive that can stand by it selfe . This is shee upon whom the beames of true piety did shine in the very infancy, for no sooner had the Roman Eagles beene there displaid, but the standard of the crosse appeard: The first Emperour and King that ever marchd under that banner issuing out of her bowels. This is she, who had three great Kings her Captives at once, who made one of her royall Okes carry away in triumph Ampelonas Lillies upon his victorious branches where they have growne and blossom ever since. The Imperiall Cedar servd under her colours, quartering his armes with hers, and receiving pay himselfe; And in that Martiall Forrest of Ampelona, her exploits were so admirable, that it hath beene questiond, and that by no meane Critickes, whether her's there, or sometimes Rome's high feates of armes against the Hannibalian Carthage were more difficult and glorious. This is shee that performd such costly expeditions and Martiall pilgrimages to the upper world, and in her voyage thither (as a revenge for inhospitality) conquerd the Citherean Isle, and for her exemplary prowes was offered the Crowne of the holiest of Citties, and more then once the Imperiall diademe of the westerne world; Her Monarques living in that sublimity and largenesse of repute, that they were taken to bee the common Arbiters of Soveraigne quarrells up and downe the world. In fine, this is she who of late yeares raysd the Willowes to such a height from a company of Shrabbs, by preserving them from being crushed by the ragged Staffe of that broad spreading Olive Elaianas King, whom she exhausted and reduced to such an exigent, that by publique Declaration he proclaimd himselfe insolvent of those vast summes hee had taken upon credit; whereby it was then sayd, Hee made more ill faces up and downe amongst the Banquiers on the Exchanges, then ever that famous Painter Michael Angelomade good . This is she who cloathes not onely her owne natives and circumiacent neighbours, but the remotest regions of the earth with her rich fleeces, where the innocent creatures that beare them in that exuberancy, being free from the affrightments of all savage and rapacious animalls, feed securely upon the luxurious honysuckled earth, which dame nature, by a most exact distribution (as if she had wantoniz'd and plaied the Bawd with her selfe) hath cut out into varieties of sportfull plaines, fertile valleyes, and delightfull hills, whose bowells in sundry places are pregnant either with inexhaustible veines of most usefull, and well concocted mineralls, or necessary fuell: No Region abounds more with Chases, Parkes, Woods, Groves, and goodly Trees, and of all other, Druina is beholden to Trees, for with their Boughs a good part of her preserved it selfe from the enemy by a notable stratageme: Her lower region swarmes with all sorts of fowle, her Rivers with fish, and her Seas with whole shoales and mountaines of them, which her neighbours know too well. This is she which for the benignity of the clime is called the female Paradise, and not without good Iudgement did that great Archflamin give her youth the attribute of Angels, shee produceth such pure complexions. And the heavenly (bodies it seemes) worke not here outwardly onely, but they have an interne inclinatory operation upon the motions of the mind also in a different manner from others, for her natives are not so light and airie, as her next transmarin neighbours, nor so affectedly grave and slow as others, nor so dull and heavy as those of that soyle, whence they were first transplanted, but of a middle composed temper, symbolizing nearest with them of Bombycina; And it is well knowne, that the Druinian hath bin evrey where so cryed up for an innated integrity, that before he mingled with Forreners, and so by Coalition with them grew more Mercuriall; he was accounted the uprightst dealer of any other upon earth, and to this day hee retaines much of his primitive esteeme, that in divers places abroad, his very word will countervaile the bond or pawne of another. To conclude, this may be termd the land of fortune, and a microcosme of her selfe, which by the gentle influence of the starres, abounds with that affluence of all things, that for hospitality among her owne, and towards all commers else ther's not her parallell: her delight is to have old Trees without dores, and old servants within; And indeed so plentifull she is in hospitality, that I have heard Druina taxd abroad, that too many in her, do use to digge their owne graves with their teeth: Besides, some thinke that since the hop hath got amongst them, her Trees being subject to be fild with stones and gravell, it hinders the length of their growth, withall, t'is observd the Grape doth them no good, being of late yeares usd to be so sophisticated with sulphury heterogeneous mixtures; Adde hereunto their too early inoculations; And that odde kind of smoake which hath fatally got amongst them, and being so excessively suckd, must needs dry up their radicall moysture, and so hasten their fall: but all this is accidentall: I will end with one property Druina is cried up for, above all other, that when Forreiners, though sprung up under the daintiest climes take once rooting in her, she makes them quickly forget their owne homes: As if the lotus grew only here, the vertue of whose fruit is, to cause in the eaters an oblivion of all other foyles; and indeed the lotus of all other Trees hath most affinity with the Oke . There is no place upon the habitable earth, where the muses have two such dainty Groves of Laurels, so choice and rich seates, which both for plentifull exhibitions, and sumptuous edifices of that kind are unparalleld: They perpetually produce hopefull young cions, which germinat with all kind of knowledge, and come by degrees to a perfect maturity, whereby she is alwaies furnished with nurseries of scientificall graffes, which she disperseth up and downe to unfold the sacred Oracles, for which she is now as renowned, as sometimes she was for her Druyds; And for a cumble of all felicity piety shines here in her genuine true lustre, neither adulterated with any forc'd colours to set a specious glosse upon her, by any phantasticke forme of outward ceremony; Nor is she bereavd of such decent robes and (whereof some fanaticke spirits would strip her starke naked) that may make her appeare in a venerable and comely garb: This stately Forrest hath multitudes of gentle lodges, and strong retraites, amongst which the great Emporiall Tamisond is the prime, which take all her dimensions together, (for she hath not the advantage of the circular figure) with her suburbian, and conterminent fabrickes, may well compare in magnitude and number of soules with the greatest assembly of houses in the lower world. For wealth and an ubiquitary commerce, none can exceed her, And for government diurnall and nocturnall with a grave rich and magnificent magistracy, ther's not her fellow. The proud River which makes her bed at her feet is arched over with such a curious pile of stones, that, considering the rapid course of the deepe streame that roares under it, may well take place amongst the wonders of the world; The Nereian goddesse comes twice every naturall day fourescore thousand paces off to visit her, to render her thankes as it were, for the rich tribute she useth to pay her. Here is the Imperiall chamber of Druinas Monarque, the prime rendevous of Nobles and Gentry, the sole staple of the Marchant, all the prime tribunalls of justice and equity, and no where is the criminall part thereof so cautiously executed, or the life of the meanest shrub more valued, I could wish the divill part were answerable in point of expedition, and that John an Okes had not so many turnings and windings in this Forrest. In summe, this is the epitome of all Druina, so that some have askd abroad whether Druina bee in Tamisond, or Tamisond in Druina; And herein (and that not undeservedly) Druina is taxd abroad of a sol aecisme in her government, that she should suffer to run into one Grove, that sap which should go to vegetat the whole Forrest; so that some have compard Tamisond to the spleene in the naturall body, by whose swelling the other members become ill affected; whereas her forren neighbours, by a wholesome distribution appropriat some staple commodity or peculiar charter of commerce to severall places, whereby they equally flourish, grow populous, potent and opulent . Forrest which serves her for a shelter as t'were against blustering Boreas, well set, but nothing so thick, with stout and tough Trees (though growne somewhat knobby of late) of a different plantation and policy, which hath beene but lately co-afforested with her: at that time when she threw the fortunat cast of sice-ace, and when to her three former Lions, there was a fourth added for her defence, which made Druina verifie that, which all former ages held for a Paradox, and take for the burthen of her song (and I hope there will be never cause to the contrary:)  Omne bonum nobis ex Aquilone venit. An ancient Forrest she is, for she pretends to shew a continued uninterrupted succession of above one hundred Kings. As at other times, so specially this last halfe century of yeares, she hath produced many ventrous and martiall spirits, who for their prowesse in the North east parts have purchas'd a great esteeme. A long time the royall Vine made use of her Trees as of matches to set Druina a fire, whensoever she attempted any thing against him, puzling her with unlucky diversions, therefore the Vine reserves to this day a row of them about him for his safety. This caus'd many of the Martiall Okes to make sundry shrewd inrodes into Cardenia, so far as to bring away her Kings Captive, and make some of them breath their last in battaile; But now for the greater glory of Druina, they are both ingrafted upon one stocke into one body politicke, and receive mutuall benefit from each other, the one sappe, the other strength; For by this conjunction, I hope, Druina may rest secure, that the Lillies shall never hereafter make use of the Thistle against her Roses; And so shee may prove Carduus Benedictus unto her. and ancient Indigen ae, the first nursery of Plants, that sprouted out of her, fatally thrust amongst an Assembly of mountaines. They long time wrastled and strenuously tug'd for their libertie, and that with a no lesse magnanimous then constant pertinacity, yea when they were reducd to a handfull, hem'd in betweene those hills, they did notables feates; At last being over set with multitudes (which hath beene the fortune of the bravest spirits upon earth) they chose to bow a little, rather then breake . Yet with this proviso, that the Princely spray which should be their toppe Tree, should spring forth from amongst themselves: So prevalent is the instinct of nature, and energie of fancy they beare to their owne soyle . And very remarkable it is, that after the revolution of above one thousand yeares, and so many turmoyles and changes of governments and masters, ( Druina having foure times yeelded to the fury of forren force) the just hand of providence should bring the royall Oke to sprout againe out of this ancient stocke, and that Druina should resume, and be knowne againe by her primitive denomination; A race of resolute stout Trees they are, much valuing the antiquitie of their growth, and so abounding with mettall and heat, that they quickly take fire, and become touch-wood; they often clash their branches one against the other, and very sensible they are of parting with the least drop of sappe . The Trident-bearing God hath not such secure and commodious inlets, or rather a Gallerie of Clossets, to court and imbosome himselfe into our Grandame Earth, in all the vast expanded Ocean. The prime of the nine Hero's (whom beside that which is fabulous, there is truth enough to make famous) was a plant of this growth, by whose conquests Druina may lay just clayme (though she had no other) not only to Lurana, but other dominions also, nay if first discovery may entitle a right, to Columbina also, which as some strongly conjecture, was found out by a straying Prince of Monticolia seven ages since: And this presumption is drawne from the analogy of speech, wherein there are diverse words that are the same in both languages, both for sound and sense, with other traces and markes. The most admird of all prophane Prophets whose predictions have beene so much scann'd and cried up, and are yet valued up and downe the world, did vaticinate here: And the first Monastery that ever the world had, wherein the sacred fire of Christian piety did burne, was amongst these mountaines, the sparkles whereof slew so far, that diverse Regions, which groapd before in the darke corners of paganisme, were enlightned thereby. Besides observable it is, what a precious blessing is lately found out (having beene reserved and lockd up as it were all this while in Natures bowels) to make this most ancient part of Druina happy now in the decrepit age of the world; A rich mine and generative mint of treasure, the gainefull returnes whereof, exceed more and more the labour and charge of those multitudes that are hourely set a worke thereby. working sea; she is replenish'd and very thicke set with strong and well trunked Trees of all sorts, reduc'd at last to a perfect obedience to Druinas diademe partly by voluntary reddition & desire of protection, and partly by conquest: A multiplying and healthy spacious Forrest she is, plentifully furnishd with all those benefits, that aire, earth, and water use to affoord for necessity or pleasure. There are no where such huge ponds and fresh lakes, with goodly rivers and safe maritime harbours inviting forren commerce, the soyle fatt and luxurious in diverse places, and antipatheticall to all venemous creatures, as Druina her neighbour is to all ravenous; Her lower region is stird, and ratified with fresh quickning windes more frequently then other Forrests, which makes her lesse subject to contagious diseases; so that I beleeve the saying of that Elaianian Generall (who being asked what he thought of Lurana, answered; That when the ill spirit profferd our Saviour all the kingdomes of the earth, he verily beleeved he intended to have still reserv'd Lurana for himselfe) proceeded rather from the resentment of the ill successe and disgracefull repulses hee had there, then from any sound judgment, or demerit of the Country; Nor can I subscribe to him that said LVRANA was a good Countrey for them onely to live in, who wanted a Countrey, that shee is a fripperie of Bankerupts, who flie thither from Druina to play their after-game . The plants here are of a strenuous Bulke, agile and very patient of hardnesse, though not of labour, for the greatest fault of this great FORREST is, that shee swarmes with too many Drones, whereby Shee may bee called insignis, sed segnis terra, Somewhat incomposed they are in their trimming, extraordinary tender (and so are the brute Animalls also) of their young ones, crafty and of a passable reach of understanding, light of beliefe and great listners after newes, which may bee imputed to the long time of their unsettled government, fearing alwaies some innovation or imminent danger, And by reason of their frequent revolts they have drawn upon themselves the pressures of war so often, that it seems to have somewhat cowed their spirits, as may be gather'd from the very accent of their words, which they prolate in a whining kind of querulous tone, as if they were still complaining  & crest-fallen; nor do they beleeve to have come yet to the worst, for they have an old prophecy that the time will come when Lurana shall weepe o're the Druinians graves . Before this rough forrest was civilizd, and trim'd by Druina, she had peculiar lawes  & customs of her own, but some of them were such that as one said, if they had been practis'd in Hell, they would have turnd up tupsiturvie the very kingdome of Satan, Some of Druinas Monarckes made voyages thither in their own persons; and many of the royall stemme were sent to governe, but alwayes one of her prime Elmes, to whom I read of foure generall submissions that were made: but the conquest could not bee consummated till of late yeares, which may be imputed to some errors in the course of civill and martiall policy. It was the practise of that selfe admiring mistresse of the last Monarchy, into all Countries where she tooke footing, with the lance to bring in her language, and lawes; This was not done here, but the Natives were left still incapable of Druinas lawes, which only extended to her owne plantations: So that the law of the Conqueror, did neither protect their lifes, nor revenge their deaths, for it was no felony to fell downe any of them, yea in time of peace: Nor in civill causes could they implead or commence sute against any of the Druinians, or imbud, ingraffe, insoliat or inoculat upon any of them unlesse he were formerly infranchizd by charter of denization; so that the meere Luranians were reputed, out-lawes, enemies and Aliens in their owne soyle; But this may be ascrib'd not so much to the policy of Druina, as to the great ones that came thither from her to plant themselves and push on a fortune, who disswaded the communication of Druinas lawes to the natives, because they might oppresse, spoyle, rob, peele, proyne, and grubbe them up at pleasure; In these unsettled times many of Druina, and of late yeares of Cardenia also tooke firme rooting in the best and fattest soyles of Lurana, so that they are growne since to a notable height; Amongst whom (now that I treat of Trees ) the Corke did thrive wonderfully, and no doubt but by a singular benediction from above, the dew of heaven falling so plentifully upon his endeavours, as appeares in all his branches, which he sees grafted upon noble scutcheons, and honourable shields; so that he may be call'd the miracle of his time, all things considered. Another reason that hindred a settled peace, and period of this conquest, was those vast proportions of lands which were distributed among Druinas Adventurers, which were such, that the whole Forrest was in a manner cantonizd amongst a very few in number, of whom some had regall rights, there being eight County Palatines at once where the royall writ could not runne; They had also implicit Commission left to discretion, and not tied to any regular forme of plantation; And those huge tracts of ground they lorded over begat wealth, wealth usherd in pride, and pride tumultuary contentions amongst themselves, which gave the Luranians advantage to fish in those troubled waters for their liberty, and make often encroachments upon them; But had the Oke himselfe gone to the Forrest, the inferior Trees had not shot up so high . Another mistake was, that the first undertakers made ill choice of the seates of their habitations; for they erected forts and houses in the open plains, turning the Natives into the Woods and places of fastnesse, whence they made eruptions and retraicts at pleasure, and whereas C aesar sometimes spake of the Scythians, Difficilius erat invenire, quam vincere; These were the over-sights in civill policy, now there were also some in the conduct of the martiall affaires; first, the small handfulls of Souldiers Druina sent, which came either unseasonably, or ill accommodated and payed. Then the cold pursute of the maine designe, which like fire newly kindled under greene wood, was often made to flash a little, and so left to goe out. So that for the reduction of this spacious Forrest to a perfect rule of obedience, Druina stood all this while in her owne light, and could not see the Wood for Trees: untill there sprung up a notable Virago a Princely female, for whom it seemes the high hand of providence had as it were pointed out, and reservd this exploit; who besides the suppression of some intestine rebellions in her owne Forrest, the raysing of Itelia to a free and faire Grove of Willowes, and reaching her Princely boughs to settle the Crowne of Ampelona upon the right royall Vine, besides the navall wars with Elaiana, and sundry other costly diversions, yet she made a full and finall conquest of Lurana; And this worke was done in a fulnesse of time, and concurrence of all felicity, when her royall successor was to bring another Soveraigne Crowne to aggrandize, and adde to the Imperiall and triumphant glory of Druina . Her predecessors in their course of governement did but sometimes cast up the ground, and so leaving it fallowe, it became quickly oregrowne with weeds; But shee like a great houswife did cast seed into it, sowing therein her owne lawes, and utterly extirpating all other; she did ingraffe all upon one stocke, making no difference twixt the Luranian and them of Druina, by which coalition she received all alike into her immediat protection under the safe shadow of her Royall branches, making the beames of justice to bee equally displayed upon all with like lustre. Yet for all this there was little returne of the vast expence of treasure that might have served to purchase as great a Crowne, which was imployed to compasse these ends, nor could Lurana though a most copious Countrey of her selfe, bee brought by any parsimonious policy to support her selfe, but still Druina must part with her very radicall moysture, and wast her owne vitall spirits to preserve her authority there, untill that of late yeares the royall Oke did light upon Count Rhodophill (a stout and solid instrument most proper for so knotty a taske, as well for courage as Counsell, and cut out for government and high affaires) who balancing all matters in the scales of his high and spacious understanding, hath so rectified all obliquities, beginning first with the vindication of wrongs done to the house of the Almighty; And so regulated the exorbitant expences both civill and military, that the old arrearages under which that Crown had long gron'd being defrayed, he hath brought Lurana to uphold and maintaine her selfe, and returne Druina for her protection, fruitfulnesse, and reducement to civility, a setled tribute proportionable to her greatnesse and plenty; So happie and advantagious it is, for a Prince to employ an able and idoneous Minister for the conduct of his state affaires; He hath woun'd up the strings of that Musicall instrument (which Lurana gives for her crest) so dextrously, and tuned her Orpheus -like (who in times past by his melodious straines made the very Trees to follow him) to such a key, that she never gave a truer note; And indeed the right way was never hit upon, untill now; Druina's Majesty never stood so high a tiptoe, nor shind with a greater lustre; The Soveraigne power which Druinas Monarcke useth to transmit for ruling and regulating that rough Forrest, was never so individed and entire in the person of one, whereas before some of the great ones caried themselves in that height, as if they had beene Colleagues with him: The scales of Iustice never mov'd more equally, for whereas before matters pass'd through a large grate, they may be said to be sifted now through a silken sive: commerce never flourished more; And the military forces ( which are the sinewes, and best security of a conquerd Countre, ) were never better appointed, more exactly disciplind, and punctually paid; And whereas before, all places of profit and honour were either ingross'd or forestalld by reversionary grants (the bane and bug- beares of industry) or confer'd upon unworthy and ill affected Ministers, Druinas Monarque may now exercise all acts of grace and bounty with more freedome and choice; A singular incitement and golden spurre to vertuous and active spirits; Lastly, the royall desmesnes and treasure was never more improv'd, for whereas formerly Lurana servd as a goose for every one to plucke, her feathers goe only now to fill the pillow of the Crown: So that putting all this together, Lurana may say as once that seven hild Citie which was head of the last Monarchy (and pretends to be still of the Hierarchie ) did say, Lateritia fui, futura sum marmorea . But I have wandred too long in this Forrest, I will now hoise sayle, and returne to Druina, where I shall fixe my selfe a while, but in regard the wind is not faire, I will stay a little, and spend the time to deduce out of what hath beene spoken this short Corollarie. Touching the relation that Druina with her united Crownes, hath to other states, it is to be considered, that the power of this part of the world, is balanced betweene the Oke, the Vine, and the Olive; as for the CEDAR, and others, they shall come in hereafter. Elaiana hath the advantage of both the other in treasure, but shee is thinne planted, hath diverse nurseries to supply, many irons perpetually in the fire, wants Corne, her dominions lye scattered, hath bold accessible coasts, and the conveyance of her Bullion from Columbina subject to bee intercepted in the passage; And should Druina breake out againe into any traverses of Warre, and serious Hostilitie with her, Druina hath lately got no small advantage of her, by acquest of those Islands which lye in the Carreere to Columbina, which she colonizeth, and fortifieth dayly more and more. Ampelona is thick set, and abounds with stirring Spirits, lyeth close together; and being roundish and passable, no one part is farre from succouring each other: Shee super-abounds with Corne, which is quickly convertible to Coyne; and being the common Mart and Thorow-Faire, lying in the middle of so many great Neighbours, can never want Money: Insomuch, that if you goe to the intrinsique value of things, shee will not, in regard of these Advantages, want much in weight, of the huge bulke of Elaiana . Druina being surrounded with the Sea, and having alwayes so many moving invincible Castles in Centinell, is hardly to be invaded; her King being sayd to keepe as a Tortoise in his shell, and having many other Insularie advantages. So that it may be very properly sayd of the Oke, as the holy Prophet speakes of another great Tree; That the Waters make him great, and the Deepe sets him on high . Druina would hardly be able to deale with any of the other single, unlesse upon the Defensive; but joynd with Itelia, she can give them both Law at Sea; and confederating with either of the other two, she is able to oppresse the third. Now, the onely entire Head that confronts Elaiana's greatnesse, and is the Remora that stops her progresse, is Ampelona: Therefore, that saying carryeth with it a great deale of Truth, and no lesse Caution; That the day of the ruine of Ampelona, is the Eeve of the subversion of Druina . Therefore, from the time the Olive grew to be so great, Druina for strong reasons of State, hath inclind ever since, rather to maintaine Ampelona, then any way to enfeeble her. And once, when the adventrous Vine was taken prisoner by the Olive, which was about the time that the Olive began first to shoot out his branches so wide, the Oke did contribute to ransome him. Moreover, in that memorable great Incendium, which rag'd so long by intermissive fitts throughout the whole Body of Ampelona; to quench which, Elaiana, out of pretence of zeale to Religion, sent great Barrels of Water, though some say they were filld with Pitch and Oyle, which did rather encrease and feed the Fire: I say, at that time, when there was a Designe to Provinciate the whole Kingdome; Druina, though offerd a Canton, would not accept of it. So then, this linke of mutuall conservation enchaining them, the Oke may be presumd to be a sure Confederate of the Uine and the Willowes also, all the while they containe themselves within those bounds they are in, at present. But if they should over-master the Olive in Leoncia, it would much alter the case. No addition could make Ampelona more dangerous and suspectfull to Druina, then Leoncia; for so it were farre worse then if the Olive had all Leoncia solely to himselfe, in regard they would fall into one continued and entire peece. But to conclude, there cannot be a truer Maxime, for the safetie of Druina and her Confederates, then this of a late great States-man:  Decrescat Oliva , nec crescat Vitis . And thus have I finished the perambulation of Druina, with all her Pourliews, and Perquisits, together with her next transmarine neighbours, with whom she hath most pratique and necessarie intelligence. I should now passe to Rhenusium (and so o're the Mountaines, to Bombycina ) but that I am afraid to loose my selfe in so vast a Forrest, before I should begin my promised Storie: Therefore I will deferre their Character to some emergent occasion out of the matter it selfe, and in the interim resume my subject, and returne to my first Epoche . But before I proceed, I will give the Reader this short touch, that I doe not purpose, by this discourse of Trees, to bring him into a Labyrinth, or impervious darke Thicket; for I know some, under borrowed Names and Types, have affected obscuritie, of purpose to amuse the Reader, and make themselves admired for profound Reaches, when oftentimes their Fancies prove flat Impertinencies, and Non-sense: No; the Woods that I will lead him into, shall be faire and open (as he may partly perceive, by what hath preceded) so that he may easily distinguish twixt the kinds of Trees; it shall be lucus a lucendo . And imagine I am now returned to Druina; where I find all things flourishing, in a rare conjuncture of Peace, Securitie, Honour, and Plentie, under the Branches of the stately Caledonian Oke, newly settled in his triumphant Throne, begirt with Cions of his owne royall Stemme, and encircled with multitudes of ancient and nobly extracted Elmes, holy and reverend Yewes, learned Laurels, stout Poplars, with other goodly Trees; the Lillies and Roses White and Red, did bourgeon round about him, the Muses and Graces made Festivals, the Faunes, Satyres, and Nymphs, did dance their Roundelayes, all the Trees of the field did clap their hands; and never were seene such Halcyonian dayes: The Saturnian times of Gold let none henceforth admire, behold a true Pearly Age . All the neighbouring Forrests stood at a gaze, envying this high felicitie: The Vine, the Firre, the Myrtle, the Willowes, sent to congratulate and comply with Druina; but above all other, the Olive, so shrewdly shaken before by her. To performe which worke, the prime Officer of Honour Elaiana had by Land, was sent Ambassadour, and that in a most high and courtly manner, to present the newly enthroniz'd OKE with a Branch of Olive, the Embleme of Peace, and Elaiana's ancient Cognisance: Which being accepted, Druina in correspondence of State, sent her prime Officer at Sea, her Thalassiarcha, in such a splendid equipage, that Elaiana rings of the renowne of it, to this day. The parts adjoyning to Elaiana's royall Court did so strayne themselves to entertaine and welcome him, with his numerous Traine, that some yeares passed, before they could recover themselves many miles about: for so gratefull was his Errand, being an Embassie of Peace, and so bitter were the resentments and fatall effects of the former Warre, that young and old did blesse him as he passed; deeming he had beene some Angell descended from Heaven, and that his attendants were some kind of Seraphins, they so admir'd their comelinesse; which did unbeguile the vulgar of the odde opinion the Loyolists had formerly infused into them, by their concionatorie Invectives, That the Druinians, since they left Petropolis, were transform'd into strange horrid shapes; some having Dogs heads, others Swines countenances, others huge tayles hanging behind them. Such Ceremonies as these being mutually performd twixt Druina and her Confederates, and some other domestique Triumphs ended; the royall OKE (as well to expresse his Princely acknowledgement for his free and peacefull reception to Druina's Throne, without the least motion of opposition or murmure, which usually happen at such Changes, (whereat the neighbouring Princes, specially Ampelona's then Warlike Monarch, stood in a kind of admiration) which reception was accompanied also with unparallell'd acclamations of Epidemicall joy, as also for redresse of divers Grievances, rectifying of Enormities, and enacting wholesome Lawes) sent out Summons for a generall Assembly, where his Royall Majestie, with all the noble Elmes, the grave and learned Yewes, and a selected number of the choisest Poplars, should meet in one Body, to consult of the common Good; and here you might behold a goodly sight, the Epitome of all Druina . But there preceded a notable act of Princely grace: For whereas some, out of the motions of a malevolent spirit, and impostumated hearts, had, during the former universall Exultations of Ioy, beene detected, to have had a most Treasonable and dangerous Designe on foot against the Majestie of the Royall OKE, whereof they had beene legally convicted and doom'd; He meerely, out of his inclination to Mercie, (wherein Kings come nearest to the Almightie ) sent a private Missive, all of his owne Characters, to pluck them out of the very jawes of Death; even then, when having made their peace with Heaven and Earth, the fatall Axe was imminent to fall upon them, and cut them quite off. And as this first, so were the rest of his whole reigne high Acts of Clemencie. But upon the very point, when the fore-named great Congregation was to re- assemble; behold, a horrid Plot of such a nature, that it seemd rather to have been a Peece hammerd in Hell, by a Conventicle of Cacod aemons, then trac'd by humane invention. A sulphureous Mine it was, prepard and fitted with that Artifice, that in one Puffe it should have blowne up to the Clouds, and made but a Squib of that mightie Assembly, with many thousands of innocent Soules besides: Druina's Soveraigne Monarch, with his Royall Consort, and Princely Imps, Root and Rinde, Stemme and Stock, Bud and Blossome, had all beene blasted; the reverend Yewes, noble Elmes, and stout Poplars, had beene all turnd to Charcoale; yea, the furie of it had extended to the Embrio in the Wombe; nay, the very inanimate Bodies had not beene exempt; the sumptuous ancient Structures neere adjoyning, all the Tribunals of Iustice, yea, the prime Sanctuarie Druina had, would have gone to wrack; nay, it would have raysed up her dead Princes out of their sleeping Vrnes, to behold this black Spectacle: My haire stands on end, my heart trembleth at the horror of it: The Trinacrian Vespers, and Bartholomean Massacre, were nothing to this. And Religion must be the Maske, to cover this Hellish attempt:  Tantum Religio potuit suadere malorum? Sacred Lady, must thou be the Mantle to cover this infandous Worke? Thou which usest to goe clad in the white Uest of Innocencie, must thou have a Deianira's Shirt now cast upon thee, a Robe of Bloud? Thou which marchest alwayes with the Armour of Light, must thou be made accessarie to such a horrible Act of subterranean darkenesse? Thou which injoynest subjects indispensable obedience to their Soveraigns, because they are the anoynted and Archetypes of the Almighty, yea Gods upon earth, must thou be now made a complice to Assassines and Traytors? In fine, thou to whom the Prince of peace left for legacy his seamelesse close-woven garment of unity to decke thy selfe, must thou be brought to make ruptures and throw the ball of discord twixt Soveraigne and subject? Absit, absit . For the discovery of this prodigious plot, specially the quality of it, it seemes by some secret supernaturall instinct, Druinas Monarque himselfe, when all his great Sages were at a stand, hit right upon it, for it being fore-threatned, and advertisement being fortunately lighted upon, that a sudden blow should bee given, which should bee no sooner doing, then a peece of paper burning, His Majestie entring into the secret Cabinet of his owne deepe and free-borne thoughts positively avouch'd, that it must bee some project of nitre, then which nothing is more sudden and impetuous, more violent and irresistible: and herein hee prov'd as much Prophet, as Prince . For oftentimes the conceptions of Kings are as farre above the vulgar, as their condition is, for being higher elevated, and walking upon the battlements of Soveraignty, they sooner receive the inspirations of Heaven. They which make profession to pry into mysteries of estate, passed divers judgements upon this, some gave out, that the warlike Vine had sent advise of it, and that the then secretst of Druinas Sages, that great instrument of state had fore-knowledge of it, but suffred the fatall threed to bee spunne out to that length for some politique respects, and then to cut it off in the very nicke. Not long after a notorious high act of Treason, drawing to a neare analogie with this, for the instrument was led by the same ill spirit, except that the one was single, yet upon the person of a publique person, the other of multitudes, if you consider the Agents or Patients; The one was crushed in the shell, as it was upon poynt of hatching, and so most happily prevented, but this was fully perpetrated upon the body of the great Martiall Uine which swayed the Scepter of the then most flourishing Ampelona; And Religion that holy and harmelesse Matrone, must be made to sharpen the poynt of that fatall steele which did scarifie and penetrate him to the very heart, and suddenly fell'd him to the ground; It was done when hee had a potent Army so fam'd and feard farre and neare, composed of choice Veteranes upon a great mysticall designe in perfect equipage, which continueth a riddle to this day: And in the midst of those triumphs that were prepared for his Queene who had her Temples newly begirt with Ampelonas royall diademe. And her fancies it seemes the night before were propheticall, having dream'd that those Diamonds wherewith her Crowne were embellishd, did turne to Pearles, which are accounted the Emblemes of teares. But most remarkable it is what one of his owne Confidents did forewarne him of twenty yeares before, who told him being newly come to the Crowne, and forced to comply with the times in point of Ecclesiasticall affaires, and being assaulted and wounded in the mouth by a young Loyolist. Sir , You see how just and punctuall God Almighty is in his Iudgements, for I hope you have denied the Religion you were first nurtured in, but from the teeth outward, so he hath struck you there, but take heede your heart goe not from it, for hee will strike you there the next time, which proved precisely true. Not unlike this prophetique judgement was that which fell upon one of his predecessors not long before, who being so incensed against the Eusebians, that he vowed to plucke out one of their eyes to stigmatize and distinguish them from others; He was thrust the very same day into the eye himselfe by an Eusebian, whereof hee breathed his last. A hard fate it was that three of Ampelona's Royall Monarques should fall within so narrow a compasse of time by such mortall stroakes. The last the most accomplished of all the rest, was the most lamented, who out of his cold Vine seemes, methinkes, to send this mournefull caveat to the greatest potentats on Earth. That they are but weake penetrable things, and though somewhat refind and kneaded from that courser sort of stuffe, which goeth to the composition of the Cittizens of the world, yet they are so much the more brittle ware, onely they differ in ther office, which neverthelesse makes them to have farre lesse to hope for, then to feare. A greater example hereof there could not be then in this great Puissant Prince, a Prince in whom nothing of worth was wanting, a patterne of all heroique vertues, except that he was transported sometimes too far by that Sexe, which overcame the first, the strongest, and wisest, that ever were of humane race. Wonderfull he was in acts of peace and warre, hee had bin victorious in foure maine battailes, before he could peaceably weare the Crowne, hee weeded the Kingdome of such as were devoted to Elaiana, and manumizd it, from that most dangerous confederacy which was fermenting many yeares, weakning it by armes, but dashing it to peeces by wit. For his Acts of peace, he inrichd Ampelona with a greater proportion of silke and wooll, he beautified her in many places with sumptuous structures, cut passages twixt great Navigable Rivers, and was like to do the like twixt Sea and Sea. And some say he had a designe to erect such a spirituall independent dignity in Ampelona, that his subjects should not neede to clammer the hills so often to Petropolis; he dismorgagd the Crowne demeanes, made an increase of munition, armes and treasure, and left behind a masse of Gold that surmounted the height of a Lance; And all this may be ascribd to his owne activenesse. For, as for the outward windowes of his Soule, he was rarely quicke and perspicacious, so was hee inwardly Eagle-eyed, and perfectly versd in the humours of his subjects. And such a great Artist hee was in government, that he preservd Ampelona (which abounds more then one part of the Earth besides with boysterous spirits and hot working braines) twenty yeares together without the least tintamarre or noise of commotion: A brave sprightfull Prince hee was, composed of such a mould, that though hee wanted but very few yeares of his grand Climacterique, when the mortall Stab was given him; yet the Anatomists adjudgd, That if Nature had beene sufferd to have runne her owne course in him, without this fatall interruption, hee might have doubled his Age. Never was there Monarch, that Lorded more over his Subjects hearts: Which, as in many passages of his Life, so after his Death it appeard; when by the universall Vote, hee was eternizd to future Ages with the Title of GREAT, and that his Statues should be erected in all the Mart Townes of Ampelona .  \------stat Magni nominis Umbra. The Martiall Uine being thus cut downe, Ampelona fell under a Female Government, (a Female of rare endowments and Princely worth) untill the succeeding young royall Cion should come to maturitie: And they speake of an old Law, That the Heire of Ampelona's Crowne is adjudgd then to have passd his Minoritie, when he is growne to the height of a Sword . So that during this Government, it may be sayd (notwithstanding the contrarie Proverbe:)  Lunae radiis maturescebat botrus. Not long after the Uine, the mightie Olive his neighbour fell, who with his Beades was sayd to preserve all his time his spacious Dominions, as his Imperiall Grandsire did by the Pike, and his Sire, that great Magus of his dayes, by the Pen; who, for some rare vertues that dwelt in him, I cannot pretermit with silence. He was the greatest Conqueror of himselfe, and King of his owne affections, that ever was; being alwayes at home within himselfe, in an admired equall temper of humors: No change at all was found in him at good or bad Events, or any sudden tumultuarie Chance; whereof I will give a few notable instances. After that memorable great Battaile and Navall Expedition against Alcharona, (when all Bombycina, with the adjacent Islands, were at the stake) was wonne, the relation being brought him, what a glorious Victorie was got, and with what difficultie, and how long she fluttred upon the wings of doubtfull successe, he was not surpriz'd a whit with any exulting motions of joy; onely he sayd, That his Brother, who was Generalissimo in the service, had venturd very farre: And it was the first time that he ever daignd to stile him Brother, though they were of the same Stock, but he a Branch of the wild Olive . These were the most important and gladsomst tidings that possibly could be brought him, both concerning himselfe and all the Westerne world, as the case then stood. For ill newes also, he was the same: For, in that mightie Expedition against Druina, when the very Virgin newes was brought him of the most disastrous miscarriage of his Fleet, that monstrous Sea-Giantesse, the hugest that ever spread sayle upon salt water, take Bulk and Building together; when all the circumstances were punctually related unto him, he was not mov'd a jot from himselfe, but calmely sayd, He had sent them to fight against Druina , not against the Deitie of Heaven . And these were the saddest newes that possibly could come. This having beene an Enterprise so much ruminated upon, so moulded and matur'd by time, with infinite expence; the Legalitie of the Act confirmd and animated by a speciall Benediction from the great Arch-Flamin, and puffd up with such a certitude and infallibilitie of hopes and presumptions, that in Petropolis there were Bonefires alreadie made, in joy of the Conquest of Druina . Yet, at the sayd long expected relation, there appeared not in him the least alteration or resentment in the world, for the miscarriage of this Mightie Action, and Invincible Fleet, as she was tearm'd; which prov'd, as one sayd, but a kind of Morrice-dance upon Druina's Waves. Another time, being shut up a whole day in his Closet, to dispatch some private instructions for Leoncia, about the time of her first revolt; and bringing them forth fairely written, to be dryed, his then Secretarie (that famous minister of State) being with the suddennesse of his comming surpriz'd, pour'd the Ink-box all over the Writings, and so defac'd them, that they were made altogether illegible: This did not a whit stirre him, but calmely call'd for more Paper, to rescribe them; shewing him the difference twixt the Ink-box and Sand-box, against the next time. Thus in Eclipses and Sunne-shine, in Calme and Tempests, at ill or fortunate Occurrences, he was immoveably the same; nor could any sudden inexpected contingencie, were it of never so great consequence, distract, much lesse divorce him from himselfe. The Philosophers teach, That in naturall Bodies, all things decay by the inward conflict of their Principles, and reluctancie of the predominant Elements: for, if a Body were eavenly balanced by the foure Elements whence the humours are derived, it would bee unperishable. The manners of the minde often follow the temper of these humors, therefore in this Prince it seemes, there were the sedomst and weakest struglings amongst them that could be; A serious reservd speculative Prince he was, and could see farre and neare without Spectacles or Prospective, and as it was said of one of Druinas Monarques, hee was used to stand in the darke to others, but he made all the world to stand in the light to him . He would often complaine against his Sister of Druina, in that she fomented the Itelians his owne naturall Subjects against him, that shee intercepted his Treasure, and countenanced her Captaines to robbe him in Columbina, and all this without provocation as he thought, pretending that hee had deservd otherwise of her, by being once the chiefest instrument of saving her life, and restoring her to liberty, and having an Ambassador resident then at her Court, when these traverses of Enmitie happened. Hee was a great example of Pietie in his kinde, and that in so intense a degree, that he was used to say, If he knew the Princely plant which first sprung out of him did but brandle or h aesitat in his Religion, hee would have his breast ripped up, and those thoughts plucked out of him, nay he would gather stickes himselfe to burne him . The cause of the so earely fall of that Prince is a riddle to this houre, but onetime in a gay humour he wished in the hearing of his Sire, hee had Elaiana's Crowne upon his head but onely one day; And this extravagant wish (as 'twas thought) did him no good; for not long after, he was transplanted into the other World by an immature Fate. Another Argument, or rather Monument, of the Pietie of this Platonique Prince, was that Worke of Wonder, that glorious Structure, which with expence of eight Millions of Treasure, and twentie three yeares of Time, (he himselfe enjoying the contentment of it twelve whole yeares after it was finishd) he causd to be erected, in memorie of that famous Battaile he got against Ampelona, being then in Leoncia: And not as much in honour of the day, as of the Martyr, whose day it was; proportioning the Fabrique to the shape of that Instrument he suffered upon. The Handle of it, makes a Magnificent Royall Palace; the Body, an huge Assembly of Cloysters, which make up a Convent, and an Academie. And so intentive were his thoughts upon this Piece of Pietie, that when the long-longd for tidings were poasted to him, of the miscarriage of the fore-mentioned Fleet, which sayld at first with the wings of such confidence against Druina; he then having his eyes fixd upon a Mason, who was fitting a Corner-Stone, he would neither aske, heare, or reade one syllable, untill he saw that Stone settled. Such a vast Pile was never reard up by Scaffold: and I subscribe to them that hold, the World hath not the like, in one entire Piece. And built it is with that unusuall solidnesse, and moderate height, that it seemes in his first thoughts he intended to make a Sacrifice of it to perpetuitie, and to contest with the Iron Teeth of Time. It hath a Quadrangle for every Moneth in the Yeare: and whosoever will take an exact survey of it, must goe above 30000 paces forward, about and backward, within the circumference of the Walls; and the very keyes of this huge Edifice, poise above 1000 weight. This great Magus being seizd upon by the hand of Death, he sayd none should carry him to his owne Sepulcher, meaning that mightie Monument, but himselfe: Where he was no sooner come, but this huge Olive, which flourishd so long, (though shaken with many shrewd stormes) fell, as they say, of vermiculation, being all worme-eaten within. The succeeding Princely Olive, though in profound reaches of Policie he came short of him, yet in Pietie he rather exceeded him. He relyed more upon the Spirituall power then the Temporall, holding it the safest course: And indeed, it was one of the Cardinall instructions his expiring Sire left him; and the other was, that he might warre with all the world, if he were in peace with Druina . A little after, he yeelded to treat with the Itelians as with Free-States; from which words, they ever since derive their independencie, though Elaiana denie, that she ever pronounc'd them positively free, but retorts the argument upon them: For, if she condescended to treat with them as with Free-States, the Hypothesis must be, that they were not free: for the Topique Axiome is, Nullum simile est idem; but whether it will hold in Policie, I will not determine. Altapinus, ) and Rhenusium abounds with Princes, yet they are from the beginning but branches fallen from the Imperiall Cedar, whereof some are growne up single, other are multiplied into a great number of Groves . Huge is that extent of ground which belongs to the perambulation of this large Forrest, which were shee entirely subject to the Cedar, would prove formidable both to the Vine, the Olive, and the Oke with all other, and would bee able of her selfe to make head against that huge Giantesse Alcarona; But Rhenusium being divided betweene so many absolute Princes, and they of about equall puissance, (as a great River cut into many Channells growes weaker and shallower) Rhenusium strives onely to counterpoize her selfe. Her Trees are well timbred, tall and beautifull, they are all commonly of the nature of the Plane, or Hortensius his grass, which love to bee watred with wine, but they use not onely to bee watred therewith, but to bee overwhelmd and drownd therein, for they drinke often passively, which made one ascribe unto them these two properties. To understand more then they can utter; And drinke more then they can carry . And the universality of this vice, seemes to take away the infancy of it; so that whosoever is temperat there, must needs bee more temperat then any where else, for he must bee so, per antiperistasin, being surrounded, and besiegd as it were about with the contrary habit. The time was that the Cedar stretched forth his Imperiall branches as farre as the Mountaines of the Moone, and that the King of Birds nested within his leaves, thicke featherd, and with fullsummd wings fastning his Talents East and West; but now I know not by what fate or fortune tis come to passe, the Eagle is become halfe naked, and the Cedar very thinne leavd, so that for many Ages it hath bin a kinde of continuall Autumne with him. In so much that whosoever will undertake now the Imperiall diademe, must have of his owne wherewith to support and protect it; which I beleeve is one of the reasons, that it hath continued these two Ages and more yeares in that stemme which is now so much spoken of, and envyed in the World. And this reason of State sounds well why the Septemvirate lets it continue there so long, because this Race having its hereditary territories as Ramparts upon those regions that the huge Easterne Bramble Tyrannizeth over, is best able to preserve Rhenusium from his Fury. But to know the true cause why the Cedar hath so long warped, and fallen to this decay, I must lead you over the hills to Bombycina, that great Magazin of wits, and Minion of Nature, where some places acknowledge no other season but the spring; and they who abstract Paradise from the Earthly Globe, would have it to bee in that part of the Heavens which is her Canopie. Petropolis is the City which once awed not onely all Bombycina, but signorizd over most parts of the habitable earth, so farre, that her tropheys and territories were sayd to know no frontires; yet at first the circuit of her walls was hardly a mile, and her pomerium and perquisits adjoyning where they stretched furthest, scarce six, and the first number of her plants about 3000. Yet with time and fortune she so swelled up, that she became 50. miles about, and her Dominions above 3000. miles long; And the number of Graffs which sprang at one time in and about her walls, in a famous cense that was made, amounted to above three millions. Hence the Imperiall Cedar shot out his warlike branches farre and neare for many ages, untill the Ivie clasping and clinging close about him, suckd out of him much of his very radicall moisture to vegetat and quicken himselfe, so that those twinings and embracements of the Ivie proved but as Iudas kisses, and this mongst many others is one of the causes of the Cedars decay, out of whose ruines the Ivie did climbe up to a monstrous height; And if it be lawfull to passe from Trees to Birds, that memorable comparison which one publikely preached in the very Court of the Ivie, when hee was Residentiarie upon the skirts of Ampelona three Ages since was not improper, at which time that renowned Poet Laureat did so bitterly inveigh against the exorbitancies of Petroplis, calling her the mother of heresie, shop of vice, and forge of falsehood; which comparison was, that this so high growne Ivie was like that featherlesse bird, which went about to begge plumes of other birds to cover his nakednesse, they moved with commiseration clad him with part of their owne, to which worke the Eagle did contribute much; This Bird having his barenesse coverd with those adventitious feathers, did thrive wonderfully, and grew so gay that they all turned to Peacocks plumes, into whose nature the Bird himselfe did also degenerat, and it is well knowne what the Peacocke is Embleme of. He began to pecke at, and prey upon those Birds that were his benefactors, untill be made some of them stark buzzards. Others have compard the Ivie to the Stagge in the fable, which shrowded himselfe under the branches of the Vine in a time of necessity, which being passed, hee fell a browzing, and to eate those leaves which preserved him; Thus the Ivie is sayd to use the Cedar, with others of his Patrons, who out of a high conceipt of sanctity they held of him, because he was the great Arch Flamin, protected him upon all occasions, and would not stand out with him in any thing: But pitty it is, that the fruits of Piety should bee so abused; and that, that high degree of honour, that great Arch- Flamin-Ship which at first was ordained to bee a spurr a to holinesse, should after become a stirrop to pride . And as Petropolis at her first rise, when shee came to bee Mistresse of the fourth Monarchy, and was at her highest flourish, used to clip the wings of victory, that shee should not fly away from her; so shee would have done to Religion also, since the Ivie came to be her Lord, that it should be found no where else, but betweene her walls; which made all the World to have recourse to her, as to the sole Oracle of sacred Truth, the Source of saving Knowledge, and Consistorie of Mercie: and going about to monopolize Religion by these steps, she made meere Merchandize of holy things, and grew to be an excellent Chymist, that could transmute Lead into Gold; perswading the silly Client, that out of that Lead he might make Keyes to open Heaven Gates. Thus Religion got wealth, Piety begot Policy, then the Daughters were sayd to devour their Mothers. Adde hereunto, that it was the practice of the Ivie, to suscitate and engage the Cedar, with other Princes whom he could get into his grapple, to holy Expeditions abroad, and sometimes to make them clash their branches one against the other, at home; whereby he tooke often opportunitie, to seize upon something towards the strengthening and embulking of himselfe. Thus the Ivie clinging so close to the Conscience, brought the Cedar, the Vine, and the Oke, with all the Westerne Potentates, to bow unto him, and doe homage to his very Trunke, and in a manner to idolatrize him, and tremble as the Aspe before him. He qualified the Cedar with the Character of his first Sonne; the Vine, of his younger; and the Oke, of his adopted; though I know no reason, why the Oke may not challenge the right of Primogeniture above all the rest, in regard his Crownes were first irradiated with the gleames of sacred Truth; and, as some great Clerks avouch, before Petropolis her selfe: and touching that Title, which doth peculiarize Druina's Monarch from all other, it is much more ancient then the common opinion holds it. The Olive, this last Centenarie of yeares, hath much complyed with the Ivie, making profession to be his Champion: and indeed, he hath more reason then others to induce him thereunto, in regard he holds most of his Dominions in Fee of him; and amongst the rest, Hipparcha, which is one of the fairest Flowers of his Crowne, being the most delicious Soyle of all Bombicina: and this he detaines from the Ivie, much against his will, for he should be the true possessorie Lord thereof: But the Olive dispenseth with his Conscience, to passe it over with a Complement, and a Heriot once every yeare, though he incurre the thunder of an unavoidable Curse thereby. But it is observd, that that brave prauncing Courser, which Hipparcha gives for her Crest, being formerly so full of mettle, that he would scarce brooke Bridle or Saddle, hath beene so broken and brought low by her, that he will now very patiently take the Bitt, and beare a Pack-saddle or Panniers, if need require, which they lay on him once every three yeares . The Ivie, by the degrees aforesaid, being led by such another Genius, it seemes, as the first Nurserie of Plants Petropolis had, who varnishd all their attempts with a singular reverence to the Gods, came from very small beginnings to a stupendious height. But there is one shrewd brand on it, that his greatest Patron opened a way to the Empire by a black way of perfidiousnesse and Treason, in felling downe that Cedar, which was his liege Lord and Master; and to comply with the Ivie, condescended to give him, among other benefits, Petropolis for his Court. Ever since, the great Arch-Flamin hath wonderfully thriven: for proceeding to domineere over, and captivate the noblest part of the intellectuall Creature, he assumd power to depose Soveraigne Princes, to dispose of their Diademes, and to dispense with their subjects from all tyes of naturall obedience. And so liberall he hath beene, as to give away Druina (which he tearmd his inexhausted Source ) once to the Vine, another time to the Olive; but with this Proviso, if they could conquer her: wherein they both foulely fayld, though they employd the utmost of their strenght. And the Ivie came to doe these Feates by force and terror, a course very disagreeable to his Calling: For the Temporall and Spirituall Power should have an analogie with those two faculties of the Soule, the Will, and the Understanding: The Will dealeth with the Vnderstanding by way of power and peremptorie command, but the Vnderstanding, after a sweet way of meekenesse, conducts the Will by perswasions and strength of Reason, and so leads him along in a Golden Chaine . He amusd the World, that the Keyes which open and shut Heaven, and let downe to Hell, hang upon his Branches; the threats of his displeasure, came to be as dreadfull as Thunderbolts: but of late yeares, they are found to be of a cleane contrarie qualitie: For the Thunderbolt is observed to quash and crush those Bodies, which with their toughnesse resist, but to spare those which are plyable and yeelding; as oft times we finde the Body of the Tree crushd to flitters, when the Bark is not touchd: but those Fulminations which are darted from Petropolis, are of a quite different nature; for upon them that withstand and beare up against them, they are as Thunderbolts fallen into the Sea, forcelessse . And hereof the Royall Oke (and some hold, That the right Oke, being ) made first proofe of, of any other Soveraigne Prince; then the Firre, the Ash, with others, followed: And memorable is the Answere which one of the Royall Firres made Petropolis, when shee would have exacted a new Pecuniarie Dutie of him; and it was this: That he had receiv'd Life from his Parents, the Kingdome from his People, and Religion from Petropolis, which if Petropolis desir'd, let her take it to her againe . Moreover, this great Arch-Flamin amusd the world, That he was indued with the Spirit of infallibilitie, That he was a speaking Scripture; so that, Heresie was defind to be nothing else all the world over, then an opinion in holy things contrarie to his decision . And easie it was to induce the Poplars to beleeve this, who were allowd no other Bookes but Images; and taught besides, That Ignorance was the Mother of Devotion; and that in praying, God Almightie would understand them well enough, though they did not understand themselves, nor the words wherein they prayed: And in such Orisons, how is it possible that the heart and tongue should be Relatives? But strange it seemes to me, that He who is mounted to this high Office, should be quite out of the reach of all Error, (for, commonly when one climbes very high, his head is subiect to turne ) considering, how grossely ignorant some of them were, that they understood not the Language of the Liturgie, considering also what prodigious Vices reignd in some of them; And Vice, Ignorance, and Error are commonly individuall Mates, ushering in one another . Their owne Secretarie, one that was best capable to know their intrinsique Counsels, Practises, and Humours, hath left upon record, That some of them made way unto this more then humane Dignitie, by Murther, others by Poyson, many by Simonie, some by the Sword, and one by tampring with ill Spirits; Adulterie, Incest, and Blasphemie, have branded some of them; Fornication held a Peccadillo, and Pride became an inseparable companion to it: And one of the cunningst sleights of the Devill, is, when he cannot fall one upon plaine ground, to lift him up with Pride . Which here grew so visible, that many beleeve the power of the Ivie had beene long since at an end, had not the reputation and reverence the World beares to the humilitie and povertie of some innocent Graffs, that creepe up in holy Orders under him, borne out the scandall of his Excesses: For it was plainely discovered, that whereas the Owle was usd to build his Nest in the Ivie, Superstition and Error (which are also Birds of Darknesse ) thrust him out, and tooke his roome. But of late yeares, that super-politique and irrefragable Societie of the Loyolists have proppd up the Ivie; so that all their consultations and studie tends to aggrandize him, to render him sole and supreme Lord of all the Earth: And, as for the Spirituall Power they would hoyse him up to be the onely Head; so for the Temporall, they would also have one Lord Paramount . And because it is most probable, to bring that mightie worke to passe by the Olive, in regard of his spacious Dominions; therefore, all their policie tends to exalt him: insomuch, that of late yeares it is observd, of what Soyle soever a Loyolist is, he is halfe Factor for the Olive . And when at the beginning of the Tumults in Leoncia, he was advisd to erect Citadels and Forts up and downe, to keepe under his subjects, One of his then greatest Sages answerd, It would farre more secure the Countrey, if the Societies of the Loyolists were multiplyed for their Convents would serve for Castles . Profound Clerks they are, and the chiefest Court Rabbies, and the closest sort of Intelligencers; for they have a way to scrue into the most inmost Closets of Princes, and to goe betweene the very Bark and the Tree; though many times they prove Earewigs and Caterpillers to the tallest Trees . Nor doe they make their Mercuries ex quolibet ligno; for they never admit any Blocks into their Societie, but the best-timbred and choisest Plants, which they reare up for such uses, as best sutes and goes along with the graine of their Genius . And though it be against their Canon, to receive Money for Almes; yet wheresoever they plant, they presently grow up to an incredible encrease of Wealth. These Seraphicall Fathers doe so under-value all other Orders, that they have a saying: The Church is the Soule of the World, the Clergie the Soule of the Church, and they the Soule of the Clergie. Amongst other points Petropolis holds, and these Loyolists with their maine policie labour to uphold, one is, That whosoever they be, though they have the same primitive Symbole and substance of Faith with her; yet if they grow not within her inclosure, they are no other then Logges ordaind for Hell-fire. Which Opinion, though it carry with it an hot kind of Zeale, it hath little Charitie, I am sure, with it: For, besides those Myriads of Plants which grow up, and fall, under the Oke, the Firre, the Ash, and the Willowes, and are thick set with Petropolitans in Rhenusium and Ampelona, with sundry other Forrests, which have long since shaken off the still-encroaching Ivie; that vast Tract of Earth which Uolgania containes, and those numberlesse multitudes which are up and downe Alcarona; nay, those which are in and about the holyest of Cities, with that immense Region, which some hold to extend from one Tropique to the other, Lorded over by Jochan Belul, who tearmes himselfe also the Head of the Church, and Touchstone of sacred Truth, and Tree of Knowledge, &c. (whom that great Clerke, and late Corrector of Times, would have to beare another Name, but wrongfully) I say, that huge Territorie, which this great Monarch, with his Abuna, doth possesse; since all these beare the generall Character of Christians, and have the grounds and exercise of the Rites of true Pietie, though in divers formes, it is an hard Censure, to judge that they are nought else but Brushwood, prepard for eternall flames, and utterly incapable to be made Timber for the inlarging of the Court of Heaven: But I beleeve this Tenet proceeds from a kind of Policie, to serve onely for Terror. Let none mistake me, as if, while I treat of Trees, I should goe about to make poysond Arrowes of them, to dart at Petropolis: No; I reverence her from my very Soule, for the first ancient Mother Church: but it hath beene the practice of the common Enemie, That where Truth erecteth her Church, he helpes Error to reare up a Chappell hard by: I firmely subscribe, and submit my selfe to whatsoever was ordaind and acted in her, the first foure Centurie of yeares; for, nothing makes more for the confirmation of my Faith, then her Doctrine and practise then. For in those Ages, a great many of her blessed Arch-Flamins creeping lowly upon the ground, yeelded themselves to be made Bonefires, for the maintenance of Truth; and out of their ashes, sprung up more and more innumerable holy Plants, which did wonderfully propagate, and they were all indued with the vertue of the Palme; the more they were oppressd and overset with the weight of Persecution, the faster, stronger, and streighter they grew up . In those dayes, the light of Divine Knowledge did streame from Petropolis, in beames of Innocencie, Simplenesse, and Humilitie; but afterwards ( helas ) it came to be offuscated and halfe choakd up with Fogges of humane Fancies. Some presume to affirme, that if the Almightie would assume a visible externe shape, it should be compounded of Light and Truth, they are so essentiall unto him: Petropolis was once adornd with both these; but long since, the one hath beene shrewdly dimmd, the other depravd, though neither quite extinguishd (as some affirme in her.) So that I beleeve Druina had never forsaken Petropolis, had Petropolis stood firme to herselfe, and not swervd from her first grounds. But I find, that all the Devices and Crochets of new Inventions which crept into her, tended either to enrich or enlarge the Ivie . The Barke of the Prime Apostle was imployed to Pyracie, and his Keyes to unlock the Treasuries of Princes; and where they could not doe, the Sword should breake them open. But for his imaginarie Exchequer, wherein were hoorded the redundancie of good workes, nothing must open that, but Keyes of massie Gold; Arguments were turnd to Armes, and Miters to Helmets: which made the World, in stead of being rectified, to run headlong into strange obliquities of Schisme and Confusion. As much, if not more affiance and conceit of comfort began to be had in them, who once were sinners, and but yet supposed Saints, then in the Saviour himselfe: Vowes and Orisons were made to them, that knew nothing of the heart; and amongst such a number of pettie Deities, God was halfe forgotten. Dignities in Heaven, were disposd of on Earth; and to one of their Moderne Saints, that place is given, which Lucifer lost. And the blessedst of mortall Wights, that ever breathd the Ayre of this lower Region, now questionlesse the highest Saint in the Celestiall Hierarchie, began to be so impertinently importund, that a great part of Divine Liturgie was addressd solely to her, in such a way that she questionlesse detests. They came so farre in this point, that to make a perfect Salve for a sick Soule, they held there must be a mixture and compound made of Milke and Bloud, and that they are both of equall vertue. Traditions and the Ivies Decretalls were made of equall force, and as authenticall as the sacred Charter it selfe, and as much obliging the Conscience; and his Commands observd with more terror, then those which were delivered by the Voice of the Almightie, in Thunder and Lightning. It came to passe, that it grew a common thing, for one to plant a Tree, and with one part to heat his Oven, with the other to roast his Meat, and to make his God of the third. And whereas at the beginning, Man was made after Gods image, which must be understood of the interne graces of the Soule, it grew a common practise, to make God after mans image in externe grosse corporeall shapes, whereas the incomprehensible Majestie of the Almighty can neither bee circumscribd in place, nor represented in Picture, but darkely describd by an aggregation of his Attributes. And whereas Hee being a Spirit ought to bee servd in spirit, and chiefely with interne worship, and ingraven onely in the Tables of the heart, most of His service came now to bee externe in shewes and representations, His Temples being filled with certaine kindes of Antique faces and great Puppets in every corner; so that Petropolis became (as a little after her first foundation she was) a meere Grove of Idolls . Moreover the minde was caried away with such a fond conceipt, that Heaven, and that eternall weight of glory which is reserved there for the Blessed, might be over-merited by surplusage of works; Whereas there was never any proportion yet twixt infinity and things finite; nor was this Earth ever held but an indivisible point, and a thing of no dimension at all in respect of the Heavens; and there should be alwayes a kind of proportion twixt the worke and the reward . Thus they thought to climbe up to Heaven, upon the Tree of their owne Merits, whereas they should have observed that the Publican was bid to come downe the Tree, before Grace could descend upon him. After this unlucky brood of errors, there crept in odde Philosophicall subtilties, and forc'd termes of Art, which did much puzzle Sacred Theologie, and threw as it were dirt in her face, with their classicall distinctions, cavills, quiddities, and so transformd her to a meere kinde of sophistry and logomachy. Yet all this cannot deprive Petropolis of the Character of a true Church, (I cannot say adverbially true ( and God is a lover of adverbs ) she still hath the essentiall grounds, with the externe profession and exercise of saving knowledge. Though Tares repullulat, there is Wheate still left in the Field, the Foundation is good, though some odde Superstructures have been raisd upon the first story; And he that pries into her with impartiall eyes, will find that shee is not so corrupt in her positions, as in her practise, for many who have beene allured by her Bookes, have beene averted againe by her Churches, and the sight of her ceremonies, and antique formes, which in some places are such, that whereas Divinity should goe clad like a Grave Venerable Matron, shee may bee sayd to bee accoutred rather like a Courtisane . But some there are who doe prosecute Petropolis with such a blacke irreconcileable malice, that whatsoever hath beene once practised in her, though arbitrary and indifferent in it selfe, tending happily to decency and externe Ornament onely, they hold it to be flat Idolatry; They thinke they can never sly farre enough from her, whereby many of them striving to fly from superstition fall into flat prophanesse, holding this hatred of Petropolis to bee a poynt of holinesse; so that they may bee sayd to hate her Religion rather, then the corruption which depraves it; Nay such is their malignancy in this kind, that it extends to the very inanimat Creatures of Stone, Wood and Glasse, so farre, that had they their wills, there should not a Roofe, Wall or Window stand which was once consecrated by Petropolis . And he was well servd for his blind Zeale, who going to cut downe an ancient white Hauthorne-Tree, which because she budded before others, might bee an occasion of Superstition, had some of the prickles flew into his eye, and made him Monocular. Yet for all the specious fruits of sanctity these Dotard Trees outwardly beare, they are found commonly rotten at the heart, they are like putrified Wood shinining in the darke; And their fruit like that which is sayd to growe hard by the Sodomitique Lake, fayre and goodly without, but hanled, crumbleth to Ashes; So injurious they are to Prayer (being the very Marrow into which the Soule melts in her Dovotion to Heaven ) that the would thrust her out of her owne House (the Temple) at least give her a small roome that may be (unlesse she prove the extemporall issue of their owne shallow braines) harrowed over with such impertinent Tautologies, and bold Expostulations. Such a deadly feud they have to hierarchy and degrees in holy Functions, that they account those high Luminaries which from all times have beene appoynted for the Guidance and Government of the Church, to be nought else but Comets, and ill boding Starres. In their Conventicles they doe commonly bella cum personis magis, qu am peccatis gerere . Seldome doe they give their Flockes any Milke, but strong Meates; they still thunder out Lighning and Tempest, and the dreadfull Curses of the Law, which must needs whoony many a poore Conscience upon dangerous Rocks, and doubts, and fits of Despaire, and seldome do they apply the sweet, and Soule-solacing Lenitiffs of the Gospell, wherewith the corresives of the Law should be tempered, whence it may be inferd, that they thinke oftner of Hell then Heaven. Adde hereunto, that some of these great Santons will not stick to expound the sacred Text, upon the warrant of their owne private spirits, as if God Almightie appeard to them out of a Bush; but hereby they usually worke themselves into some odde illumination of an egregious dotage: For they should learne, That in holy things, he that strikes upon the Anvill of his owne Braine, is in danger to have the sparkles flye into his Face, which must needes dazzle him: nor is he unlike him, who layeth together hot burning Coales with his naked Fingers, in stead of a paire of Tongs. I could wish, that these sciolous Zelotists had more Judgement joynd with their Zeale, that they would not runne away so farre from their Text; it were well, that they would suffer Reason to perswade them, before she invades them, as commonly in Argument shee doth: That they had more of the spirit of Conformitie and Obedience, to the Constitutions and Commands of lawfull Authoritie; which commonly every ignorant and shallow mechanique spirit amongst them, will presume to censure or demurre upon, and upon every triviall Cavill rayse Clamours. As in Itelia, where these fanatique spirits most swarme, not long agoe two of their greatest Clerks kept a mightie adoe, Whether Aarons Ephod was of Sea-greene, or Sky-colour: and this disturbd a while the whole Assembly, there being hot abetters on both sides. And indeed, these obstreperous Sceptiques are the greatest bane of Divinitie, who are so full of the spirit of Contradiction, that they raise daylie new disputes, and multiplie Controversies, so that they are almost without number. And if the Loyolists on the one side, and they on the other were quite grubd vp ( For they are but Brambles in the Lords Vinyard ) or cut downe (and there is a strong warrant that every Tree which beareth not good fruit should be cut downe ) or that they were sent to plant in Vtopia, it were no great matter. For with their extremes they blow the Bellowes, and are the common Incendiaries of all combustions wheresoever they come; For the One, they have it from their first Planter who had beene of the profession of bloud; therefore they would propagat Pietie as Alchavona doth hers, with the sword, and so make Religion to bee Gladij pedissequa, and which is worse, the Mantle, to palliat all their designes, so that if one should prie narrowly into the carriage of their actions, it would put him in mind of that damnable tenet of the Atheist, In nomine Domini fit omne malum . And betweene these two, the Westerne Church, yea, Faith her selfe, that sacred Ladie, doth suffer as twixt two Malefactors, the one disturbing her peace, the other depraving her doctrine; but the time will come that they shall be both crushed to peeces, on both sides, and not a bone of hers broken. But nothing is so naturall to the humane Creature, and which he longs after, and delights in more, then novelty and change, yea in holy things; And as long as hee is compounded of the foure Elements, whose very being consists in mutabilitie, his braine must still fluctuate with new fancies; As long as there are diversitie of Climes, whence the Celestiall bodies send downe their influences, and make impressions upon the mind in different degrees of temper, there must be various Idea's and conceptions of the Deity, as well as of all other things; And as time doth worke a revolution in it selfe, so it doth in all sublunary matters; We grow weary of old things, of Morall and Politique Lawes, of the most exact and regularst Languages, of outward habits, yea the inward habitudes are subject to this; nay Religion her selfe is not exempt, but like the Moone hath Eclipses, Changes and Spots; But as some Astronomers affirme those Specks which are discerned in the body of the Moone to be causd, by the shadowy reflections of Rocks  & Mountaines which are upon the surface of the Earth; So the swelling vaine conceipts, that arise, and puffe up the mind, are the causes of such blemishes in Religion. An undenyable principle it is, that there is but one Truth , and one Tracke which leadeth to the right notion of the Almighty : And certainely Hee being a Spirit and the most simple of essences, they approach nearest this Track , who serve Him, as I sayd before, in Spirit and simplicity of thoughts, with the least mixture of externe Rights and humane inventions: for as in Heraldry, tis held a rule, that the plainer the Coat of Armes is, the more ancient it is: so in the blazon of true Religion, the more simple and plaine the forme is, (yet I alwayes presuppose decencie) the nearer it comes to the old Primitive times. Therefore, that Religion which hath least of the outward object, to avoyd all occasions of Idolatrie, but worships the God-head by a speculative act of the Understanding, and goeth directly to Himselfe: That Religion which derogates from the Creature, and ascribes most glory to the Creator: That which transferres not his Honour, (whereof he is most jealous) or mis-applyeth it to any other: That which makes the poore peccant Soule relye onely upon the Riches of his Mercie, and so by a necessarie recourse to enbosome and endeare her selfe unto him; That Religion surely is most agreeable to the invisible and omniscious God. And my heart trembleth, when I thinke how few there are of this, upon the surface of the Earth: For, as one who had conversd farre and neere with the Citizens of the world, doth avouch, if the Globe of the Earth were divided into thirtie parts, they would hardly make up three parts of thirtie. But whither am I thus transported? I hope to be dispensd withall, for the qualitie of the subject, which is the unum necessarium, which made me dwell so long upon it. I should now post back to Druina; but that before I part with Bombycina, I must needs salute the amorous Myrtle (and her Metropolis Adriana ) in regard she hath beene alwayes a true Confederate to the Royall Oke . Islands, in the very jawes of Neptune: where being planted at the very first a Christian (a prerogative she worthily vaunts of above all other) she hath continued a Virgin ever since, neere upon twelve long Ages, under the same forme and face of Government, without any visible token, or least wrinckle of old Age. The great Arch-Flamin espousd her once to Neptune; and a Prophecie there is, That she shall continue a Virgin, untill he forsakes her: and he, of late yeares, is observd to shrinke, and grow weaker about her, as if she had made him over-labour himselfe too much upon her. And it is well knowne, no place swimmes more in all manner of wanton pleasure; witnesse those multitudes of Medlars which make their Beds, and are permitted to grow about the Myrtle, for which she is so much spoken of all the world over. Most renowned Adriana hath beene, for brave exploits up and downe the World, having wrestled with the greatest of Earthly Potentates; She re-establishd the Easterne Cedar more then once, in his Throne; she restord the Ivie twice in his holy Seat, being chasd out of Petropolis: which made the great Arch- Flamin of late yeares to be foulely taxd of a kind of ingratitude, in offering to cause her Armories to be defacd in his Court, having so well deservd of him: But it is thought, since she expelld the Loyolists out of her Territories, Petropolis hath still a grudge to her, which lyeth yet indigested, and is in her like Lees in the bottome of a Tub of Wine, which at the least stirring of the Vessell is readie to rise up. By the Charter of her Saint, she is to have in her Arsenall as many warlike Vessels, as there be dayes in the yeare; and in the Summer season, as many in course as there be houres in the naturall day, to scoure three hundred miles of Sea, whereof she is Protectresse. And some kind of Vessels she hath, which knew not how to be beaten, until of late yeares that top of Druina's Cavaliers (one that hath spirit enough to actuate that goodly tall Bulke) receiving from them some affronts, met with them handsomely, and bangd them to good purpose. In that dangerous League, when most of the Occidentall Potentates were banded against her, and in a manner conspird to sinke her, shee bore up above water, against them all. But her custome hath beene, to piece the Lyons skinne with a Fox tayle, and so to supply the weakenesse of Force, by wilinesse of Art, and advantage of Treatie. And it is well knowne, how the Myrtle hath taught the Willowes of late yeares part of her Cunning; betweene whom, there is an irrefragable Confederacie, to bayt Elaiana, and stoppe the further growth of the Olive . Amongst other things, Adriana is much cryed up for, her rich Treasure is one, which Elaiana hath often attempted to exhaust: And one of her Embassadours desiring on a time to see it, seemd to slight it, in comparison of his great Masters Treasure, which is perpetually growing, and hath no bottome, as that had: Which made one say, That Adriana, in relation to the foure Elements, hath her Citie in Water, her Treasure in the Ayre, her Vertue in Fire, which makes the Earth so to flye away from her. True it is, that of late yeares the Myrtle hath beene at a stand, in improving the Treasure of her Saint, since Elaiana hath crossd the Equinoctiall, and found out a Track by Sea to Levantina; whence Adriana did use to receive, not farre from her owne home, and dispense through all the Westerne world, those aromatique and daintie Fruits the Indian Trees affoord: but she gives out, that the losse of that Trade is recompenc'd, by certaine singular Immunities she hath through some of the Dominions of Alcarona: So that of late yeares she is shrewdly suspected to be a Concubine to the huge Bramble, who hath often loppd her Myrtle, and cut off the onely Regall Branch she had: And against him it must be confessd, shee is the greatest Rampart, and best Securitie all the Westerne Princes have any where by Sea. Thus the Myrtle flourisheth still: And truly, a rare and wonderfull thing it is, that for so long a tract of Time, considering the violent stormes that have shaken her so often, she should still continue fresh, and without warping, or any considerable change, or the least symptome of old Age, as I sayd before. Whereas other Politicall Bodies, of a farre greater Bulk, have met with their Grand Climacterique, and receiv'd Changes, in a farre shorter Revolution of Time. For Politicall Bodies, as well as Naturall, have their degrees of Age, Declinings and Periods; which I cannot so properly tearme Periods, as Successions or Vicissitudes. Common-weales have often turnd to Kingdomes, and Realmes have beene cut out into Republiques; the ruine of one, being still the raysing of the other; as one foot cannot be lifted up, till the other be downe: Witnesse those foure mightie Monarchies, which were as Spokes upon Fortunes Wheele, or as so many Nayles driving out one another. And so is it also in Naturall Bodies; the corruption of one, is still the generation of another: so that, it seemes, Nature hath her Wheele also, as well as Fortune; and these Changes and Chances, tend to preserve the whole from decaying. So, that the opinion of that Adrianian , since much enriched by a Learned Druinian , is farre from deserving to be exploded for a Paradox, viz. That the Vniverse doth not decay or impaire at all in the whole, but in its individuals and parts. For, as the preservation of the World, is a continuall Production; so in this Production, as I sayd before, the corruption of one, forerunnes the generation of another: Therefore, to beare up the whole, if there be a decay in one place, 'tis recompened in some other: so that one may say, Nature danceth in a Circle, and by this Circulation, preserves the visible World. The Meteorologists observe, that amongst the foure Elements, which are the ingredients of all sublunarie Creatures, there is a notable kind of correspondencie: the Fire, by condensation looseth to the Aire; the Aire, by rarefaction looseth to the Fire; Water attenuated, becomes Aire; Aire thickned, becomes Water; the Earth, by secret conveyances, lets in the Sea, and sends it back fresh; her Bowels serving, as it were, for a Lymbiquo. So that wee see hereby, there is a punctuall retribution, and a kind of mutuall compensation betweene them, which, doubtlesse, tends to the propagation and encrease of all compounded Bodies; amongst which, there is also a perpetuall and restlesse succession of Individuals, to keepe the whole from fayling. For, as a Shippe (as one made a very apposite comparison) riding at anchor, tosseth and tumbleth up and downe perpetually, yet cannot goe beyond the length of the Cable to which shee is tyed, and so in this turbulent motion sheweth a constancie: so is it with the Universe, wherein in all things hang by the Plummets of Providence. Therefore, I cannot subscribe to their speculation, that thinke the World hath beene long since in a Hectique Feaver, and so drawing on to a Consumption: That neither Vegetable, Sensitive, nor Rationall Creatures, are in that height of perfection, as in former times: That Vertue shines not with so strong a lustre: That Invention is farre shallower, and Age shorter: That the Moderne World, compard with the Ancient, is as a Dwarfe upon a Gyants shoulders, or as Noone shadowes compard to the Mornings. I must confesse, Antiquitie is venerable; which makes us extenuate things present, and extoll things passd, and make it still the Burden of our Song, VVell fare the old Times ; implying thereby, a palpable decay or dotage in all things. Yet we find, that the two great Luminaries of Heaven, and the rest of the Celestiall Bodies, have still the same vertue and operation, without the least imaginarie diminution; all Elementarie Bodies receive vigour and strength from their influence. Therefore I doe not see, how the present can be so farre inferiour, in point of perfection, to them of former Ages, considering the virtuall Causes remaine still in the same strength: and as for Invention, Wisedome, and Learning, I doe not see, but the second thoughts of latter Ages, may be as wise as those of elder Times. I know, the time must come, that Heaven and Earth shall passe away, and that there will be a finall Dissolution, though no Annihilation of the Matter, but a destruction of the Old Forme, and introduction of a New. And of late yeares, some would be so foole-hardie, as to presume to be more of the Cabinet Counsell of God Almightie, then the Angels themselves, (by whose ministerie, some say, he created the World) as to point at the precise Time of this Dissolution: amongst other arguments, they fetch downe one from Heaven it selfe; which is, that the Polar Starre, which is in the tayle of the lesser Beare, was in Ptolomey's time twelve Degrees from the Pole of the Equator ; this Starre hath insensibly still crept nearer the Pole, so that now 'tis but three Degrees off, when it comes to touch or make the nearest approach that can be to the Pole, which may well come to passe in 500 yeares; Nature her selfe, they say, must expire, or some notable Period. But I have beene carryed away too farre by this Speculation, causd by Adriana; which, of any Politicall Body, may be producd for an instance, against a generall decay, and impairing of the Moderne World: Though some, which repine at the Myrtles prosperitie, say, That those stout and ventrous Trees, wherewith she was usd to be fencd, are lately degenerated (in point of valour) to weake Reeds, for their Pusillanimitie, and too much Caution, when they come to any Warlike encounter. And now it is high time for me to shake hands with Adriana, and Bombycina also; whereof I must not forget to tell you, that the Olive now occupyeth foure parts of seven, if she were so divided: And to his Greatnesse, and the apprehension of feares and jealousies they have, that he would fish in troubled waters, may be ascribd the Concord and Calme of Bombycina's Princes; who, as once the Mice would have hung a Bell at the Cats Neck, but after consultation, could not agree who should venture first to put it on; would plot something still against the Olive . Adde hereunto, that besides this Peace, there is plentie of Treasure, that comes to Bombycina by the Olive, who makes one of her proudest Cities his Scale, for remitting his Moneyes to Leoncia: But that Citie, in respect of him, may be sayd to be as a Partridge under a Faulcons wings; who can seize upon her at pleasure, but doth not, for politique respects. Bombycina was usd to be most under the Mulberry, the wisest of all Trees; for, he never puts forth his Buds, till all the cold weather be pass'd: And so indeed, the Plants Bombycina produceth, are accounted the wisest, politiquest, and most reserved and cautious of all other. 'Tis a Rule amongst them: That he cannot be essentially wise, who openeth all the Boxes of his Brest to any. They are, for the most part, of a speculative complexion; And he is accounted little lesse then a foole, who is not melancholy once a day. They are onely bountifull to their betters, from whom they hope to receive a greater benefit: To others, the Purse is closest shut, when the Mouth opens widest; nor are you like to get a piece of Cake there, unlesse yours be knowne to be in the Oven . Yet are they the greatest embracers of Pleasure, of any other upon Earth; and they esteeme of Pearles as Pebbles, so they may satisfie their gust, in point of Pleasure or Revenge. Here you shall find Love and Hatred, Vertue and Vice, Atheisme and Religion, in their Extremes; for the greatest Wits depravd, are the most dangerous; Corruptio optimi, est pessima: Yet the Character one lately gave of them, seemes to favour too much of the Satyre: viz. That the Bombycinian is unnaturall in his Lust, irreconcilable in his Hatred, and unfoordable in his thoughts: That with one breath, hee bloweth hot and cold; and to compasse his owne ends, he will light a Candle to the Devill. I know, there is no Countrey, without her Nick. As Ampelona , to be a great Bedlam . --- Bombycina , a great Bordell . Rhenusium , a huge Brew-house . Elaiana , Natures Sweating-Tub . Druina , a Stage of Mimiques . Lurana , a Fripperie of Bankrupts . Monticolia , a Conventicle of Hills . Cardenia , the Urinall of the Planets . And Itelia , the Suburbs of Hell , being situated lowest of any other upon the Earthly Globe. For my owne particular, were I to associate with a stranger, I would single out a Bombycinian before any other, for my conversation: for, of those twelve severall sorts of Forreners I have had occasion to converse withall, I never knew any yet symbolizing so much with them of Druina, or complying more with their humour. Altapinus, newly arrivd in Druina upon a high designe of love, and no lesse then to the fairest branch of the Royall Oke, that Mirror of all perfections; The Itelians and the old Fox of Ardennes, with Druinas greatest Arch-Flamin, did mainely advance the worke, together with the Princely Orange, and the Willowes; but the Royall Firre of Elatena, and that great Queene from which she sprang, gave but cold consent thereunto, and it was thought it lessened some part of her naturall affection towards her ever after. Yet Altapinus was admitted a Suitor, and as he was in hot pursuite of this brave attempt of love, behold a most mournefull accident of fate intervenes; the fall of that brave Standell, which should have immediatly succeeded the Royall Oke, in all his Dominions; This strucke an Earthquake into all hearts for the present, which were affected with various passions of griefe, feare, amazement, and darke suspitions, that in regard his fall was so immature and sudden, it could not bee without some sinister practise of violent meanes, nor can some bee wean'd from that conceit to this day, imputing the cause of it to a precocitie of Spirit and valour in him, and that therefore some infectious Southerne Aire did blast him. But this is certaine that there was intelligence of it in Elaianas Court amongst the Luranian Loyolists a prety while before his fall. This incomparable Prince was so lamented, that all kind of Trees throughout the whole Forrest hung downe their heads, and seemd to be turnd to Cypresses for the time, which being expird, the nuptialls of Prince Altapinus were consummated, and when the conjugall knot was a tying, the Princely Bride was observd to bee possessd with a sudden apprehension and eruptions of joy, which as the iron decree of fate would have it, turnd after into many pangs, God wot, of anguish and sorrow. For being but a few yeares settled in Rhenusium, during which time all the neighbouring Princes envied their high felicity; Behold the Cedar, by the instigation of the Loyolists, fell out with the Homebians who had elected him to be their King, provided that he would keepe their priviledges inviolable, but they alleadging hee had infringed them, they would continue no longer under the shelter of his boughs, but shooke him off, tore his Seales, and resumd liberty to choose another King. Hereupon they made a proffer of their Crowne (I cannot say it was the mayden proffer) to Pr: Altapinus, who consulting upon it, though not so maturely, as the disastrous events shewd afterwards, accepted it. Many there were which animated him thereunto, and amongst other motives of incitement they usd, one was, that if he had courage enough to adventure upon the fairest branch, and sole of that kind of Druinas Royall Oke, he might very well venture upon a Crowne when it was tendred him . Thus he went triumphantly to Homebia where hee was inaugurated and crown'd king with many high expressions of joy and triumph. About these times behold a fatall torch appeared in the Heavens, placed there by the great Architect of the world, to forewarne Mortals of their miseries, And the direfullst effects it produc'd were under that clime: Those blazing lampes which in this latter age had appeared in the asterismes of Cassiop aeia, the Serpent and Swan brought not forth such horrid events as this in the Virgin signe. It were to disgresse from the scope of this discourse, to make disquisition whether these unusuall lights be hospites or Indigen ae, newcome guests or old Inhabitants in Heaven, or whether they bee meere meteorologicall impressions not transcending the upper Region, or whether to bee rank'd amongst celestiall bodies; I leave the indagation of this high cause to the Disciples of Iohannes de sacro bosco of Iohn of holy bush, it being not the subject of my Trees at this time. But these hairie lampes have beene noted to have been alwaies the fatall Vshers of calamity and alterations in states; And as upon earth prodigious births portend no good, so these new engendred monsters above, point alwaies at some sad events to follow, either ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/igr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogvgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/itigr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , or ![](/images/inline/pgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/oacgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/lgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/egr.gif) ![](/images/inline/mgr.gif) ![](/images/inline/ogr.gif) ![](/images/inline/sfgr.gif)  , warres, pestilence, or famine, all which have most miserably rag'd through poore Rhenusium ever since, and cease not to this very houre; and that with such fury, that in many places the bed cannot priviledge the sick, nor the cradle the suckling, nor the great belly the Embryo, nor the Tribunall the Magistrate, nor the Altar the Priest: The chiefe grounds of all which, was imputed to this revolt of the Homebians, from the Cedar . For the heavens bright eye had scarce run one whole carreere through the Zodiake, but towards that season of greatest mirth throughout the whole yeare, The Cedar had capitulated with the Elder, (who from that time forward fell sicke of the gall, (a disease incident to old trees ) against Altapinus, though he was the principall branch of his stock ) to muster up certaine military forces to his use, for the expence of which service he engag'd part of his Country to him, with which forces, though fewer in number, and tyred with long marches, he suddenly assailed Altapinus his royall army, and got the day. The Elder pursued his victory to the very walls, where Altapinus with the Princely Carbasilis raignd, and being surpriz'd were constrain'd to flye in confusd manner with halfe bag and baggage. Thus the Inconstant goddesse turnd her wheele about, and for this shadowy Crown made him loose the substance, viz. his Princely inheritance, the brave territories of Baccharia . Some there are which thought it much that Altapinus appeard not himselfe in the field, the day of this battaile, in regard his newly worne Crowne stood upon the fortune of it; And that having good store of treasure in cash hee suffered his Souldiers to bee heartlesse, and ready to mutiny for pay, most of that treasure falling afterwards a bootie to the enemy. The infortunate Altapinus traversing up and down Rhenusium came at last with the Princely Carbasilis to Itelia, where the martiall Orenge well- comd her with high demonstrations of joy, and his first congratulation was, that if she had beene the Masculine Plant, Homebias Crowne had never beene lost so slightly . And good reason they had to be welcome to Itelia, for it is more than conjecturd, that t'was she who put Prince Altapinus upon this fatall enterprise to advance her owne ends. For the truce with Elaiana being then upon point of expiring, she had no hope to draw Druinas Monarke, whose genius was so strongly bent for peace, but by these meanes, into military engagements, that so part of Elaianas strength might fall upon him: but Itelia reckond without her host in this point. For the first tydings being brought him of that undertaking, Hee calls his sages together, and in a profound sence of sorrow, and a kind of propheticke spirit (and the Oke of all other Trees is only fatidicall ) told them, what a fearefull infortunate businesse this would prove; And that the youngest there amongst them should not see the end of it; which by sad experience hath provd too true,  & yet continueth. Moreover he was usd to say that the Homebians made use of Altapinus, as the Fox did of the Catts foot to pull the Apple out of the fire for his own eating: And from that day to his last, he disavowed the Act, nor would he affoord Altapinus the title of King, alleadging that it would bee a dangerous president to justifie the tumultuary uprisings of subjects in that kind against their King. And as this disastrous businesse begun with an ominous Comett, so there hath an ill planett, hung over it ever since, for scarce any enterprise hath prosperd in the procedure of it, but one calamity still usherd in another. Finis unius mali, Gradus est futuri . As if some ill-boding Mandrake had beene found out, and grubd up in Baccharia, at the beginning of this fatall undertaking. The Cedar having thus debelld the Homebians, to are the labells of most of their ancient lawes, made new ordinances, and put some of them to exquisite torments, pretending that, that Crowne belongd no more to him by Election, but that he was their proprietary Liege Lord by Conquest . Nor did he hold this to be an equall reparation for the indignity he had received by Altapinus, but made his recourse to his Nephew the Olive, whom he partly intreated as being the strongest of his stocke (and therefore should be sensible of the affront) and partly summond him as being Prince of the Rhenusian Empire, and holding Leoncia and other territories in homage of him, to assist him with some auxiliary forces, to vindicat this high disgrace, which was done him by Altapinus . Hereupon the Olive lent him his great Captaine the Thorne, with the flower of his forces in Leoncia, who shortly after invaded Baccharia (Altapinus his ancient patrimony, and Carbasilis joynture) whereof hee impatronizd himselfe without scarce one stroake given; though at that time the Princes that were his confederates, had in a ready martiall equipage twise the number the Thorne had: But it seemes they all prov'd stupid unweldy blockes, and they colourd their cowardise with some presumptions they had, that Dolus versabatur in Generali; that their chiefe leader was corrupted before hand with Elaianas gold. Thus that great body of logges disbanded in part, yet some kept still together, as shall bee said hereafter. The Cedar upon this new acquest, disingag'd his owne territory that he had transmitted to the Elder, and gave him part of Baccharia for caution for his disbursments; And to the Olive he transferrd the tenablest and strongest places there to hold them as Commissary under him. While these feates were a doing in Rhenusium a hardy Cavalier, as hee hath given notable proofes both at Sea and shoare, was sent from Druina against the Timauranians at the request of the royall Olive, and this was done by the negotiation of Mordogan that notable engin of policy; And it was done of purpose, as it appeard afterwards, to weaken and divert the strength of Druina, while the Thorne invaded, and seizd upon Baccharia . This Cavalier complaind he was sent to fight with his armes tied behinde him, for his Commission being so strict ( and strength without Commission sufficient, is like a match without fire ) that could not meddle with any thing upon the land, Elaiana also failing of that kind of supply shee had promisd to joyne to his, hee could not doe those exploits which might have bin atchievd with such a power; yet his attempt before Galeri was brave, had the Heavens continued propitious, and to speake the truth of any publike expedition, Druina made abroad ever since, this redounded least to her prejudice; For he met with no passive encounter, at all, but was master of the Sea, and securd traficke all the while; But as the foresaid attempt in Galeri roade for fyring all kinde of bottomes wherein (her offensive strength only consists) was prevented and dash'd, by sudden still perpendicular cataracts of raine: so an Age since when that restlesse Martialist Elaianas King and Emperour had an enterprise to destroy Galeri, being in sight of shoare, with a most powerfull fleet, one of her Flamins went upon a rocke hard by, and after some kind of exorcising speeches and postures, he tooke a long white wand, and strooke the waves thrise, And going thereupon to the Towne, hee encouraged the inhabitants thereof with notable exaggerations of confidence, that they should be of good cheere, for before night there should be Elaianians in Galeri market as cheape as birds. Hereupon the Heavens did suddenly change hue, and a most fearefull tempest fell, In so much that the Emperour himselfe escaped with extreme difficulty; And it fell true that his Souldiers were sold by multitudes in Galeri's Bannier towards the evening a little after the shipwracke. I will not presume to pry into the secrets of the Almighty disposer of all things whose hand-mayd nature is, how farre hee lets loose the reines to the ill spirit of the ayre, to cause such sudden impressions upon the Elements, whereof there are daily wonderfull examples amongst this crue of Corsaries. I know Philosophy and strength of art can doe much, and by connexion of naturall Agents and patients fittly applied can produce such effects that may seeme admirable to those that know not the cause; but for these extemporall meteors, I beleeve it is beyond the reach of humane skill, unlesse the ill spirit hath a hand in it. But what a foule shame is it, that one base Nest of Picaroons should confront and dayly damnifie all the Westerne World? Vnlesse the dishonour thereof be recompencd with this advantage, That the Voyaging Merchant sayles with stronger and better-built Vessels, which may serve the publique upon occasion of Warres. These times were very fatall to Favourites, both in Elaiana, Druina, and Ampelona . In Elaiana, that ancient Elme, which bore up that spacious Monarchie like another Atlas, and servd as a mightie Prop to the Olive, and did what he would in Petropolis for so many yeares, was removd from the Helme: but fore- seeing the storme which was like to fall upon him from the Secular power, hee wisely transformd himselfe into an Yew; and 'tis well knowne, what high prerogatives the Yews have in Elaiana . His eldest Graff succeeded him a while in Royall favour; but he quickly fell, by the malignancie of great ones; the apprehension whereof, sunke so deepe into him, that it brought him to his last end. His brave old Sire hearing that, sent him word a little before his fall; That he understood he was dying like a Foole (of meere conceit;) for his owne part, he feard no other enemies, but his yeares. In Druina also, that high-growne Tree, which had been long fosterd under the indulgent branches of the Royall Oke, became enamord with the faire Consort of one of the noblest Elmes in the whole Forrest; who having continued some yeares fruitlesse, and fearing a perpetuall barrennesse with him, articled against his frigiditie, and so pleaded for a Divorce: He perceiving Majestie to appeare in it, made but cold opposition. Hereupon it was referrd to the reverend Yews, to determine; and amongst them, some gave their suffrage for a Nullitie. A discreet Confident of that great Tree, (which came from a low Plant to be so eminent) dissuading him from ingraffing upon anothers right, was taken as a block out of the way, clapd in Prison, and afterwards made away by Poyson. Hereupon He, with his new Consort, being after an exact Scrutinie, found by the Sages of the Law to be privie to this black Act, were adjudgd to be struck off by the stroake of Iustice: but by the clemencie of the Royall Oke (who never quite forsooke any whom he once favourd) they were still permitted to live; but for ever removd, from being any more so neere, under the shadow of his pure and Vice-detesting boughs . And as in naturall privations, there is no recession to habit, so is it commonly in the favour of Princes; whence if one fall, he is never re-admitted into that fullnesse and strength of confidence and grace. But the inferiour instruments in this black Act, sufferd: Which gave occasion to some Critiques abroad, to compare Druina's Lawes to them of while the small ones were intangled . Nor did the first act of this, doe any good to the honour of the Civill Lawes of Druina . Yet a notable piece of exemplarie Iustice was acted upon the Guardian of Druina's prime Fortresse; who being found onely privie to some of these passages, was doomd to death, to the terror of others, for betraying that high trust that belongs to that Office: And his death was the more remarkable, because he confess'd, that Heavens just judgement was fallen upon him; in regard, that to restraine himselfe from Gaming, whereunto he was excessively addicted, he made a solemne Vow, (which he often broke afterwards) That if he played any more, above such a value, he might suffer upon such a fatal Tree . That nimble Eirenarch (so cryed up by Reports ) who then stood at the Helme of the Law, wherein he was so active, that Druina's Monarch was usd to say, He was like a Cat throw him which way you would, he would light on his feet: This Iusticer proceeded with that acrimonie to cut downe this (now pittied) great Tree, with his high-descended Mate, and others, that of their sprigs he made a Rod for himselfe; for ever after, he went alwayes declining: which some held to be a deserved judgement upon him, in regard he was often observd to insult upon miserie, and to loose a Life sooner then a Ieast, when he sat upon the Tribunall of Iustice. In Ampelona also, about this conjuncture of time, a politique Plant of Bombicina's growth, being by the favour of that stately Tree, out of which the now regnant Vine sprouted forth, made to over-top all the rest of the noble and Princely Elmes in that Forrest, was at the Gate of the Royall Court suddenly felld, draggd up and downe, his privatst parts lopp'd off, miserably chopp'd, and the remainder of his body reducd to ashes, whereof part was hurld into the ayre, part into the water, to extinguish the very memorie of him. While this Tragique act was a perpetrating, the generall Crie about him, was Vivat Rex: whereby was fulfilld the prediction of a Wizard, with whom he had tampred not long before, touching the course of his fortunes; who told him, That in short time they should be such, that he should be carryed about the streets of Tutelia with such a publique acclamation of joy. His Consort, an Enchantresse, as some would have her, ranne the same destinie: But that which made the world speake of it the more, was, that after he had been thus, as a man would thinke, quite extinguishd, his Processe was formed; whereby he was found guiltie of nought else, that I could learne, which was actionable, but of Ambition, which like the Crocodile, never leaves growing; and that being an exotique Plant, he went about to take too deepe rooting in Ampelona . The procedure of this businesse seemd very strange to the world, that the Royall Uine, having alreadie assumd the Character of Iust, should give way, that such a horrid Tragedie should be acted in his owne Royall Palace, (for Palaces of Kings should be Sanctuaries) and that the Delinquent was not proceeded against, by Legall forme of Law, till after this violent Death, which preceded the Sentence of Condemnation. He that succeeded him in favour, did suddenly make such a flight, that from vulgar Shrubs, he made himselfe, and two more which were nearest to him in stock, to be rankd amongst the tallest Elmes in Ampelona: yet he fell also by a kind of fatall destinie (Pestilentiall, though not so precipitate) in the first heat of the Warres against the Eusebians, to which he had incited his Royall Master. What will become of Ramundas, who hath the Vogue at present, in comparison of whom, for transcendencie of height and continuance, the other two were but Mushrumps; I will not undertake to divine: But observd it is, That the ground whereon Favourites stand, is no where more slipperie, and fuller of Precipices, then in Ampelona : Which makes Ramundas to barricado himselfe with as much policie and strength as may be devisd, against all shocks of Violence. hammered upon the Anvill of policy, and nationall wisdome) did now openly appeare and advance it selfe; To which end the Royall Oke, to remove all blockes that might lye in the way, ridde himselfe of those places he held in deposito of the Itelians to prevent any request or proposition that should happily come that way from Elaiana; And considering the daily expences Druina was at, and the vast sommes she was out upon them, and that most necessary dependency of conservation and community of danger, that was and still must bee twixt her and Itelia, this Act was not such a great soloecisme in policy, as some Criticks would have it, who in regard they were the very keys of Itelia, and her associated Groves, observd, that while Druina kept them in her hands, she was more awed and respected by the Willowes then she hath beene since. At the close of this businesse, the royall Oke did an act full of Majesty by forbearing much of those huge sommes which might have beene demanded; And it was in recognition of those rich presents, Carbasilis receivd, when she passd through the Willowes to Baccharia . To negotiat this great businesse of alliance twixt Druina and Elaiana, Earle Mordogan a shrewd complying Instrument, was employed, and going to have his first audience, a peece of the royall palace fell under him which could be no good omen . Mordogan had studied the Genius of Druinas Monarke so exactly, that he seldome departed from him with refusalls, hee had such a rare faculty by facetious wayes to dispatch the most important affaires of state; Hee employed all his art (and I beleeve his heart also went along) and left no stone unrolld to bring this mighty worke to passe; yet so infortunate hee was, that his endeavours prov'd plausible neither in Druina nor Elaiana: But for my part, I am clearely of opinion, that he really wishd well unto, and lov'd the Druinians next to them of his owne soyle best of any other, and so much he protested being arrested, by the iron mace of fate, a little after he had beene designd to returne to Druina, when summond to his last end, it was no time for him to boggle with the world; And the gracious Oke now regnant (to whom the Olive did churlishly put over young Mordogan for a reward of the manifold services of his dead sire) did not onely resent his fall, but vindicat him from those aspersions that were malevolently cast upon him to have alwayes played with a staffe of two ends, the one of Olive, the other of Oke . Yet he received divers outrages in Druina, and one time when he had beene rudely usd and assaulted as he passd through the streets of Thamisond, and news thereof being posted, though not by his means, to Elaianas Court, where the Royall Oke had then two Soveraigne Ministers representing himselfe, yet there was no violence at all offerd them or theirs; which made Elaiana take the advantage to arrogat to her selfe more civility in this kinde then Druina . This causd him to say, that Druinas bran was very course, but her flowre wondrous fine; for the taller sort of Trees who could looke over into the true state of things, highly esteemd him, though the poplars who see no further then the rind, contemnd and vilified him, bringing him often upon the stage, and making him the common subject of their pasquils, wherein he rather gloried, then grew discontented. Amongst other facetious passages of Mordogan, I cannot omit one which happend upon his last departure from Druina, At which time being magnificently feasted by the chiefest Magistrate of Thamisond, In the midst of these jollities, he askd leave to begin two healths; The first, was to the King his Masters mistresse, The second to his Wife; the healths being gone round, he thus expounded himselfe. That his great Masters mistresse was Levantina, and none are so fond of a Mistresse, but if a friend hath a private favour of her, he will winke at it; and such was Levantina, who though she properly belongd to his Master, yet he suffereth the brave adventurers of Druina (whereof many were there present) to have about with her, and he passeth it by, and takes not much exception at it; But his Masters Wife was Columbina whom he desired to have wholly to himselfe, and therfore that none should meddle with her; (But the Willowes of late have gone about to make him a notorious Cuckold, and have had ready money to lye with her.) Like to this was that, when a little after the going of Altapinus to Homebia he was invited to a solemne meeting, where that flexanimous and golden toungd Orator (then gardian of the Kings conscience) began the King of Homebias health, he pleasantly pledg'd it, and passd it over, saying it was the first time that ever he pledged the Cedars health in Druina . For his opinion in holy things, he had a charitable conceipt of Druina's Religion, and seemd to slight many things in that of Petropolis, as will appeare by these few instances following. In a serious discourse once of holy orders, when many things were canvasd pro & con, hee said, That hee feared the same doome, and destiny attended the Loyolists that befell in times passd, another great Religious order of Cavaliers, who were growne so excessively rich, that they were utterly suppressed with a strange kind of suddennesse every where, and so became a common booty to their Princes .  1 Another time when that sappy and fruitfull Tree (out of whose stocke sprouted that comely Elme which grevv so high under the branches of the Royall Oke, and did flourish long in his sole favour) had such a vogue at Court, that shee hoisd up, and tumbled downe some great Officers at pleasure, and that extraordinary recourse vvas had to her for matters of grace, Earle Mordogan dispatching a post to Elaiana, sent advise that there were never better hopes of DRVINAS conversion to Petropolis then then, for they began to worship the Mother more than the sonne . Lastly, when that long flourishing Favorit in Elaiana, had fallen, and to shelter himselfe from those stormes which he foresaw, would thunder upon him from the temporall power, did cover himselfe with a scarlet robe (the highest of spirituall dignities) Mordogan was askd by Druinas Monarke, whether he had sent for a benediction from his new elected Cardinall, He answered, There was once in Elaiana one who had a Plum Tree in his Garden which was winde fallen, and there being a statue made of the Trunke of this Tree and placed in the Church for adoration, he was asked why he neglected to worship that statue as hee did others, He answered, that he knew that statue from a plant, and what kinde of fruit the Tree had borne, therefore hee thought there was no adoration expected from him . Out of these instances you may inferre that he was an Anti-Loyolist, and liked not all things in Petropolis . Nor was that noble Elme Count Sophronio whom Druinas Monarke employed to Elaiana to this end, lesse dextrous and discreet, who although he was not so nimble and Mercuriall as Mordogan, yet he rather exceeded him in solidity and a high reach of understanding. He made a rare discovery of certaine plants, that were rotten at the heart, (yet daily servd about the Royall Oke ) that were devoted by pensionary obligations to the Olive . He went bravely attended to the Cedar's Court, and so to the Eldars, with whom he was not behind hand. Hee engagd his owne argentry to make up a somme of treasure to preserve those troupes from disbanding, which were then in motion for the recovery of Baccharia under CAMPANTHROPO, That admired Captaine of his time, who was said to make Souldiers spring up out of the very earth to follow him, though he had not a crosse to pay them salary; And although hee had beene put many times to the foyle and to extreme exigents, yet he never fell sans resource, but still rallied his squandred squadrons, and made offensive head againe, And most brave was that Retrait (and honourable retrait is the difficult thing in the feat of armes) which hee made, when by the point of the sword, hee pass'd through the very heart of Leoncia to his intended rendezvous, where he caus'd the Thorne to burne his tents and rayse the costly siege hee had then a foot, before one of the prime townes of the Itelians. And this was the greatest cloud that ever fell upon the Thorne, since hee entred into Elaianas service, but hee dispelld it not long after, and made his honour to shine with a greater lustre then ever, by taking in that Towne whereof the Orenge was proprietary Lord, notwithstanding that the Oke, the Vine, the Firre, and the Ash appeard, some more, some lesse in that action for the Willowes . Some say this sunk so deep into the Princely Orenge, that it did accelerat his fall, which hapned not long after. And he being gon, the Thorne wisely retired to Bombycina the Soyle whence hee first sprung, fearing that fortune who being a Female loves Youth best, would frowne, and turne her backe towards him now in his declining times . There was a strong emulation twixt these two great Martialists, And the out of a Marchants stocke, and consequently was not capable of competition with him who came of a Princelie Extraction; He sent him word that it was a more glorious thing for a Marchant to have command over Princes, then for a Prince to be commanded by Marchants. A brave quarter-giving Enemy the Thorne was, but the service of the Olive (unlesse you throw into the Scales the high honour and fame hee purchased thereby) provd over precious to him, for hee spent not onely the vigour of his dayes therein, but exhausted much of that great estate he brought with him so farre, that his owne plants, some of them, are forced to subsist meerely by Pensions from Elaiana . But that which was worse being before a Towne in Bombycina neare his owne home, which he had so blockd up and stormd, as that he had her as a Bird in a Cage, he was suddenly commanded by inexpected order from Elaiana to raze his workes, and raise the siege, notwithstanding that the Warre continued longer; This they say he resented so deepely, that retyring to his owne naturall Soyle, he presently after fell . But it is no new tricke in policy, for diverting the least dishonour that should fall upon the State, to destroy some Instruments, and make them Sacrifices for the publique. This great Captaine had so highly deservd of the Olive (and Cedar also by taking in of Baccharia ) that his services seemd to transcend all reward; And by him one may learne this lesson. That supererogatory services, and too great benefits from Subjects to Kings are of dangerous consequence, when they make the mind more capable of merit then duty . Those fearefull Fires which were kindled through all parts of poore Rhenusium, had now rag'd extreamly, to quench which, the Royall Oke sent sundry of his Noble Elmes in many costly legations from time to time, but good King, While he laboured for peace, they made themselves ready for battaile . And herein the Cedar proved very ingratefull to him, considering the fairenesse of his proceedings; And touching the Elder, what could be expected from him but knotty and crooked hollowhearted dealings? Yet by his high credit with the Olive, he often asswagd the fury of those conflagrations, by suspension of Armes and cessation of all acts of hostility, and preservd Baccharia a long time from invading; And hee proceeded so far by treaty, that he was profferd to have the Imperiall Ban taken off, of Altapinus upon his conformity to a submission, that so hee might bee rendred capable to treat, and travell through Rhenusium; to have also an entire surrender made of his possessions to his Eldest Graff, which should be affianced to one of the Cedars branches, and in the interim to be brought up in Druina's Court. Moreover hee should be restored to his Dignity after that old decayed Elder should fall, upon whom the sayd Dignity had beene in a shuffling imperfect manner conferrd, yet with this proviso, that the next Heire should not be prejudiced . These propositions being sent to Altapinvs , hee replied, that whereas the adverse party, requird a Personall submission, and that this should precede all other things, by naturall order usd in like cases, the restitution of his Country which was a thing materiall should goe before, and then the other which is but a poynt of Ceremony, should follow; And whereas hee had already complied with the Cedar to signe an Instrument for the conditionall resignation of the Crowne of Homebia , and done other acts of Conformity, and no performance at all on the Cedars side; If these intentions of his were reall, the sayd submission might bee done as well by a Deputy . had, and because that commonly Dolus versatus in universalibus, the Royall Oke sent a choice confident to Elaiana's Court (for there was the mill vvhere these matters were a grinding) to know the truth, and reality of things, who having boldly acquitted himselfe of his charge, and brought advise that matters were still involv'd in generalls, Behold a most rare adventure, Prince Rocalino, vvith Villerio, and two discreet confidents vvell versd in the Olives Court, post away in private disguise to Elaiana, traversing the whole diameter of Ampelona, where Rocalino came in so favourable a conjuncture of time, that he saw the splendor of the Ampelonian Court in a sett stately shevve, where among other rarities, he beheld one of Natures choicest peeces, the Princesse Aretine, sparckling like a constellation amongst the rest, in moving measures. Little thought he then, that she was predestined for him, by the high hand of heaven where all mariages are made; But humane eyes cannot see beyond their horizon, they cannot discerne future contingencies, and in the conduct of worldly actions, what wee desire or dread seldome directly falls out, but something intervenes and concludes wee least thought of, and if what we expect doe happen, they come not many times till after the search, which sheweth that there is a supernaturall all-disposing power above; Wherefore it is not safe for our mindes to stay at second causes, for this may induce a forgetfulnesse of the first, but we must passe higher, and by a speculative act of the understanding observe the disposition, dependency and subordination of causes to the high will of providence, and then we will confesse with the Poet, that the chiefe linke of natures chaine is tied to the foot of Jupiters chaire . From Ampelona's Court Rocalino flevv upon the wings of love towards Elaiana, and it was in the beginning of that season, that the Lady Flora useth to cloath our Grandame Earth, with a nevv livery diapred with various flovvers, and chequerd with all delightfull objects; a season that was usd to bee no lesse proper, than propitious to lovers . The pretty songsters of the spring with their various notes did seeme to welcome him as he passd, the woods put forth their blossomes, the earth her Primeroses and daiseyes to behold him, the aire blew with gentle Zephires. But in the Heavens it was observed there was an inauspicious conjunction betweene Iupiter and Saturne that dull and malevolent planet . Rocalino being come with no lesse difficulty then danger to the Olives royall Court, the first thing hee did was to dispatch a post presently to Druina to carry newes of his safe arrivall there. That night and next day after there were darke whispers up and down, but towards the evening Villerio went privately to the royall palace where he had audience, and whence Chenandra the sole ingrosser of the Olives favour, did accompanie him backe to wellcome Prince Rocalino, who magnifying that brave journey, and discovering wonderfull motions of joy, Hee said the Olive and the Oke should part the world betweene them, and that it should bee a match presently, for he doubted not but hee came thither to be of their Religion; whereunto answer being made, that hee came not thither for Religion, but for a Wife; Chenandra replied short, that there must bee then a dispensation procurd from Petropolis. That night Elaianas Monark himselfe came to congratulate Prince Rocalino to Sophronio's dwelling, but he mett him halfeway, and with much complement and mutuall embraces parted for that time. The next day he brought forth in a solemne stately kinde of march the Lady Amira (the jewell which should have beene the prize and guerdon of that heroicke adventure) to bee seene of purpose by Rocalino in transitu; But it being divulgd abroad it was Prince Rocalino that was come, all were transformd into a kind of amazement, which broake out after into incredible acclamations of gladnesse, every one extolling to the very starres, the bravery of the action, And the generall vote was, that it were great pitty but the Lady Amira though she were a goddesse, should be throwne into his armes that very night, hee had so well deservd every inch of her; They said further that all the Angels in Heaven came along with him, for the Country having extreamely suffered by a long unusuall drowth, upon his comming there fell downe most wholsome fructifying showers, wherein t'was said, the Earth dranke healths to congratulate his comming thither . The next morning the Royall Olive sent some prime Elmes to attend Prince Rocalino in quality of Officers of state, and a little after he was brought to the royall palace in the same state Elaiana's Kings use to be attended the day of their Coronation. The Royall Olive himselfe accompanied him, with all the flower of his Court, and alwayes from that day to the very last he stayed there, he gave him still the precedency, transmitting to him all petitions and matters of grace; multitudes of prisoners were releasd, and indeed there wanted nothing that might be added to the very height of all externe honour and ceremony. But let us looke a little into the interiour carriage of the maine businesse, and there you shall finde that,  Quercus connubium, connubia tractat Oliva. When Rocalino arrivd, matters were brought to that perfection by the strenuous negotiation of Sophronio, that there wanted nothing for the consummation of all things, but a dispensation from Petropolis, which at last came, and before that time Rocalino was not admitted to speake with the La: Amira in quality of a Sutor, but a Prince; Now the said dispensation came cloggd with an unhappy inexpected clause, thrust in of purpose, as it appeard, to retard the procedure of things, which was, that whereas there were Certaine Articles condescended unto by Druina's Monarke in favour of the Petropolitans that were in that kingdome, and other Crownes under his dominion, the great Archflamin demanded caution for the performance of them; The Royall Oke answered, that he could give no other caution then his word and oath, and Rocalino should doe the like, which should be confirmd by his Counsell of state and exemplified under Druinas broad Seale; but this would not satisfie unlesse some Petropolitan Soveraigne Prince would engage himselfe for them. Hereupon all matters were like to goe off the hinges, and a buzze went out, that Rocalino intended to get away covertly. In these traverses Chenandra steps forth, and said there were three wayes to conclude this businesse; two good, and one bad; The first good way was, that Prince Rocalino should become a Petropolitan. The second was, that as Elaiana was oblig'd to him for his free comming thither, so Shee might as freely deliver him the Lady Amira , trusting him without further conditions. The ill way was, not to trust Rocalino at all with any thing, but binde him as fast as they could. While matters were thus a canvasing, and gathering ill bloud, Elaianas King steppd out, and prosterd to engage himselfe by oath, for the satisfaction of the great Archflamin, but with this proviso, that hee must first consult with his ghostly fathers, whether he might do it Salva conscientia or no. Hereupon the businesse was referrd to a comittee of the learnedst Yewes, and the state of the question was, Whether the Olive might with safety of conscience take an oath in behalfe of Druinas Monarke, and Rocalino, for performance of such and such Articles that were agreed upon in favour of the Petropolitans, throughout the kingdomes of the Royall Oke. This assembly long demurrd and dwelt upon the question, and after a long protraction of time, they concluded at last affirmatively; And in case the Oke faild to execute what was stipulated, the Olive was to vindicate his Oath, and right himselfe by the sword . This difficulty being surmounted, there was exceeding great joy, and all the Capitulations were interchangeably sworne unto both by the Oke and Olive, and as Chenandra said in Elaiana, so the Royall Oke himselfe was so confident, that he said; All the devills in hell could not now breake the match; whereunto a blunt facetious Knight being by, answerd, that there was never a devill now left in hell, for they were all gone to ELAIANA to helpe to make up the match . But matters being scrued up to this height, the great Archflamin, as heaven would have it, fell; Vpon which tydings the Royall Olive came to Prince Rocalino and told him that he had receivd very ill newes, which was, that the holy Sire, who was so great a friend to the intended alliance (who had formerly writ unto, and sent to visit Prince Rocalino) was taken away by the hand of fate, and in regard there was yet no contract but a treaty only a foot, hee could not proceed further in this businesse without a ratification of the former licence by Melissanus the newly chosen Archflamin, which by reason of his indisposition of health, and the large distance of place, could not bee dispatchd with that celerity that was wishd: But now that his highnesse was pleasd to stay so many years for a wife, might well stay a few months longer, and he would undertake to negotiat and procure that dispatch from Petropolis with all the expedition that might be; And if he pleasd to give way that the La: Amira's journey to Druina might be defer'd, untill the next ensuing spring, he would give him a blanke to write his owne conditions, touching the surrendry of Baccharia, which might recompence his so long stay: Prince Rocalino upon this answerd, that he was infinitely bound to his Majesty for all those transcendent favours hee had receivd since his arrivall to his Court, and the reasons that inducd him to undertake so hazardous a journey were two; One to streigthen the league of amity with his Majesty in his owne person; the other was, to give the world a greater testimony of his love to the Lady Amira to whom hee had already transmitted his best affections; And hee had thought the Soveraigne Agents of his Royall sire, had brought matters to that ripenesse, that hee needed not to have come thither to treat of a mariage, but to fetch home a Wife; Now since his Majesty alleadgd that the late holy Archflamin being gone, hee cannot proceed further without the approbation of Melissanus the newly Elect, hee desird him to consider that if his Majestie had a spirituall sire to comply withall, hee had a naturall sire to obey, which was Druinas Royall Oke, whose toppe being already periwiggd with snowy age, was sickly and impotent and subject to many indispositions, therefore hee feard that hee being his sole Masculin plant, and the staffe and comfort of his age, it had already wrought some ill impressions in him, that he wanted him so long beyond the proposed time. Besides the eyes of all this his so long absence might produce ill effects, and dangerous consequences of state at home; Adde hereunto that there was a Royall fleet already floating on the Seas for his transfretation, and the season, if hee retarded his voyage any longer, would grow rough and dangerous. Moreover his Majesty was not ignorant, that the Capitulations which his Royall Sire had signd and sworne unto, and were confirmd by his Counsell of state, were done with this proviso, that if hee be not returnd in Druina by such a time, all that was passd should be pro non facto . The Olive hearing this, stood a while at a stand, and after said, Since his Highnesse had pressd the necesssity of his departure with such pregnant reasons; if he feard any commotion in Druina, by reason of any thing that might reflect upon these proceedings, hee would send an army with him of purpose; And since matters were so, his Highnesse might thinke fit to leave a substitutive power, with whom he pleasd to bee contracted to the La: Amira, which should be precisely done ten dayes after the confirmation should come from Petropolis; And if hee pleased to repose that trust in him, he would faithfully discharge it, and esteeme it a singular favour, and then hee might send when, and whom hee pleasd for her, for ever after she should be at his disposing . Prince Rocalino replied, That touching his first proposition, for an army to goe with him, the remedy would be farre worse than the disease, though there should bee tumults in Druina; For the second, he made semblance to bee mightily taken with it, saying, that of all the Grandezas he had received since his comming to his Royall Court, this surmounted all the rest, therefore he would leave a power behind in Sophronio's hands, to that end. This being done, Rocalino without the least ombrage of discontentment, prepares for his journey backe, leaving behind him Gemmes of invaluable esteeme, and such as was confessd, never to have beene seene the like in that Court, as presents for the Lady Amira, which were, I cannot deny, very honourably returnd by Elaiana after the rupture of the treaty, and publike declaration of warre. The Olive himselfe with the rest of the royall stemme, accompanied him a dayes journey of, and never were seene streighter embracements, and outward arguments of love and reiterated endearements betweene any, then betweene the Olive and Rocalino at their departure. But Villerio and Chenandra parted not so lovingly, Villerio telling him, That hee acknowledged himselfe unmeasurably obligd, to the royall Majesty of the Olive, and the rest of the Princely branches in an eternall tye of gratitude, and that therefore he would mainly endeavour, in what in him lay, to nourish and strengthen still the peace twixt the dominions and subjects of both Crownes, But for your selfe Count Chenandra, you have so many wayes disobliged me, that I cannot make any profession of future friendship to you without flattery; Chenandra answered very short, that hee accepted of what hee had said, and so they parted. Prince Rocalino taking his leave of the Lady Amira, was desird by her to see a Vestall Saint in his way as he passd, who was then cried up for miracles; In some divine exercises she was reported to be often lifted up in the aire, and appeare as fresh as a rose, though she was so furrowd with age, that she lookd like a spirit kept in a bagge by some conjurer. But hee comming thither, and shee mingling discourse with him a long time, the substance whereof was for the most part, that he should bee good to the Petropolitans in Druina, and to bestow an alme amongst her poore vestall sisters, there could no elevations be discernd, or any sudden changes at all in her, or any other miraculous feates, though shee could have never shewd them in better company. Prince Rocalino being conveniently attended to the Sea side, and with extreame hazard embarkd, a private instrument was dispatchd in his name to Elaianas Court with instructions to Sophronio to stay the delivery of the proxy, till further directions from him; But these instructions were not to bee delivered untill the Ratification had come from Petropolis . In the interim great preparations were made against the celebration of the nuptials, The Lady Amira applyed her selfe daily to learne Druinas language, the Soveraigne Ministers which represented the person of Druinas Monarke, carried themselves rather like subjects towards her, then Ambassadours; Many rich accoustrements and presents shee had provided for Prince Rocalino, Her family was assignd her, her officers distinguishd, And (which weigheth much with me, for the reality of the thing) Sophronio had provided a great number of brave liveries for his attendants, as rich as any that ever were worn in that Court, and matters were cryed up with such a certitude, that the mart went twenty to one, the businesse would take. At last the Ratification came plenary, and absolute from Petropolis, but a cunning rumor went out, it had come some weekes before, upon which the private instructions which were sent in Prince Rocalino's name were anticipated by Sophronio, who while he remaind anxious and fearefull to preferre a private order to the prejudice of the high Commission of Druina's Monarke under the greatest scale, which none can countermaund or suspend but the same power that gives it, hee proceeded still untill new instructions came from the Royall Oke himselfe to stay the delivery of the said proxy; And that whereas before he treated singly of a match, hee should now joyne the Restitution of Baccharia with it, for he would not marry Rocalino in joy, and leave Carbasilis in teares . Sophronio solliciting the royall Olive upon the new Commission, and not receiving a satisfactory positive answer, had order to depart that Court, and so all was dashd to peeces. VVhence I learne, that in politicall affaires, as well as mechanicall, it is farre easier to pull downe, then build up; for that structure which was above tenne sommers a building, and that by no meane Artists, was destroyd in a moment . And the world adjudged Elaiana to be well apayed for the hard measure she had offerd Prince Rocalino, to tantalize him so long with dilatory hopes, and let him returne at last without his errand: For upon the very point, when the businesse should have beene consummated, and the Lady Amira tendred, the motion may bee said to have beene rejected as it were by Druina . Many obstacles concurrd to hinder this great worke. The maine of all, difference in Religion; for so simple and blockish were they of Elaiana, that the common voice was, Prince Rocalino came thither to make himselfe a Christian; And happy had it beene for that businesse, if he had never lodgd in the Royall Palace, but had taken one of his owne, wherein Druinas liturgie, and the rites of her Church might have openly appeard to unbeguile those silly wretches. The clashings twixt Villerio, Sophronio, and Chenandra, who opposd it as long as t'was safe for him, the exceptions that were taken at Villerios Commission. But pitty it was, that the intendments of Soveraigne Princes, specially such an action as that, which concernd the incolumity and peace of all the Westerne world, the quenching of those fires in Rhenusium, the reinvesting of Carbasilis in Baccharia, which as it was then given out, should be redelivered at the instance of the Lady Amira after the Match, to ingratiat her selfe thereby the more to the Druinians, besides a mighty advantage of commerce, for no Country is able to doe that all this should bee frustrated by privat passions and interests. Another rub in the way, was the disaffection of those Ministers that were sent last to Druina to finish all things, especially one of them, and he the chiefest, whose heart did not go along with the businesse. It was also discovered that the Luranians (of whom multitudes subsist by the Olive, who if the businesse had taken effect had beene dismissed, and that Crowne disburdened of those Pensions they received, but they preferring to sticke there rather to a certaintie, then to seeke new fortunes, and begin the world againe in their owne Soyle) did no good offices in the conduct of this businesse. Besides 'twas thought the Ampelonian, and the Myrtles Ambassadors, with others there Resident, were not idle. Furthermore it had beene wished that some had had more Discretion joynd with their Zeale to this great businesse, which should have made them more cautious and reservd in their speeches and behaviour, and complied better with the humour of the Elaianians, against who  & the poverty of that countrie, they would openly inveigh and gibe at, even in the Royall Palace. Some sayd, if they had left an eye behinde them in Elaiana, they would not come thither to fetch it againe; Others, that they would never returne thither unlesse it were to Conquer her; Others, that they would never see her againe unlesse twere in a Mappe; Others would say, they thought there was no Resurrection out of her ground . Which puts me in mind of that boysterous Buffon, who sayd in the Royall presence of Elaianas Monarque, that his Master was nearest and likest to God Almighty of any King upon Earth, and being asked why? Hee answered that God Almighty had but onely one Sonne, and Hee was sent to bee Crucified by Iewes; And Druinas King also having but one, hee sent him to bee crucified by Elaianians. But for Rocalino himselfe, as Elaiana rings of the renowne of that heroique Enterprize, and will doe, to all Posteritie, so to this day his memorie and fame is fresh in that Court, for his sage and Princelie comportment, mixd with such a becomming gravitie, that it suted with the very genius of that Nation, where a Prince without gravitie, is said to be like a Peacock without a Tayle . Whence it may be inferrd, that though the maine businesse tooke not (which continues a darke kind of riddle to this day) yet Rocalino gaind much in poynt of honour, besides the mighty experience ( which is the great Looking-glasse of Wisdome ) he purchased thereby. Never was Lady so gallantly courted, no not Daphne her selfe (whom the amorous god converted to a Laurell ) was woo'd with that braverie, and strength of affection, which was shewed with that fervor, that Elaiana very poorely made use of it, to gaine time  & get stricter conditions; for as I heard one of them say, Love is like a Panne of Charcole, which meeting with the wind its contrary, makes it turne more ardent; Or like a rapid torrent which jusling against a damme swells higher; so love meeting with opposition growes hotter and stronger. But a most unworthy thing it was, and which all the world cryed out at, to make this his heat of love, and comming thither, two acts which should have accelerated the businesse, to turne to his disadvantage. But it hath thriven with them accordingly, for it is observd that their affaires up and downe the world ever since have thriven but very odly. After his departure it was disputed pro & con, whether that affection whereof he had shewed such brave testimonies, was reall or no; howsoever it was granted by both sides, that Rocalino had purchased a high opinion of honour by it; for if it was reall, hee shewed himselfe to be a great master of his affections, that he could checke and call them home so soone; If it was otherwise, it discovered a high poynt of wisedome, to act the part of an Amorist so lively and pathetically Had that blind Greeke, one of the Muses first Priests, bin contemporarie to this heroique adventure, how proud had hee beene of so sublime a subject to heighten his fancie, a subject indeed adequate to Apollo himselfe and his whole quire of Daughters; And I cannot wonder enough, that none all this while to whom Ex meliore luto finxit pr aecordia Titan, have not employed their Talent to this taske, considering the rarenesse, and richnesse of the matter. But to resume my discourse, Sophronio having received that foresaid new command from the Royall Oke, went to propound the entire  & speedy surrender of Baccharia . The OLIVE answered, that if a treatie would bee commencd with the Cedar , who was now Lord of it, and Hee, with the Elder, (but his Commissioners,) if hee came not to termes of conformity, hee would joyne armes with Druina to recover it, and for caution hereof hee would engage that rich Citie whither his fleet of treasure arrives yearely. But this not satisfying, hee went to take his leave of Elaianas King, who had commanded Chenandra a little before to tell him in his name, that hee had receivd advise of his Revocation, and understood also by diverse advertisements, what clouds were engendring in Druinas Court, and in regard the envie which was drawne upon him proceeded from the labours and endeavours he had employed to finish the match, therefore he would hold him selfe much touchd in honour, if for this cause any should so prevaile against him as to cause his ruine or disgrace. Therefore he would write to Druina's King, and send a particular Ambassador, if neede requird, to represent the true state of things, in regard that Sophronio had servd him with that exactnesse of fidelity which was well knowne to the world, and to Elaiana , in particular, that it deservd not onely to be assisted with all good offices, but it was fit to be rewarded, and published; And that the Royall Olive for the example of his owne subjects, and encouragement of those that did or hereafter should serve other Princes with that punctuality as Sophronio had done, had commanded him to offer him a blanke signd by the Royall Olive himselfe, wherein he might set downe his owne conditions, both in point of title and fortune; And this hee did in no way to oblige another Prince his subject, but only as an encouragement to honest and faithfull proceedings, and therefore he would not make these offers in private but justifiable to the world, and would accompany all hee should doe, with a declaration, that this hee had done, was for the service hee had done his owne Master. Sophronio replied, that he was much afflicted to heare such language; and that hee desird it might be knowne and understood, that Elaiana was not any way beholden to him, for what ever he had done, he did it, for that he thought it fittest, for his Masters service and his own honour, without having any relation to Elaiana; And that he servd a Master from whom he was assurd of justice and due reward: And for those who were thought his enemies, hee knew their power to bee great, but hee servd so just a Master, that hee doubted not, but his innocency would prevaile against any wrong, they should intend him; And though his own integrity would not give him leave to apprehend any kind of danger or disfavour from his said Master, and were he assured to runne into eminent danger, yet would he rather goe home to cast himselfe at his feete for mercy, and thereby comply with the duty and honour of a faithfull servant, then to bee the greatest of Elaianas Princes. So I leave this mighty businesse for a Riddle (as I said before) both to the present and all future ages; For the bookes of Kings are written in darke Characters which few can uncypher, and their Actions like deepe foords, wherein Elephants may only swimme; Or as great Rivers, whereof we see the course of the streame, but know not the source . So I leave also Sophronio preparing for his journey, and inexpressible it is, what a blacke kind of obstupefaction, and regret all the world was possesd withall in Elaianas Court, specially the La: Amira, who, wee thought, would have turnd into one of the Heliades (those amber weeping-trees) for sorrow. Many arguments of a reall love appeard from her towards Rocalino, amongst others one was, that she caused many divine duties to be performed for his safety in his returne to Druina; where being landed he fell down and kissd the very earth for joy; And being come to Thamisond, one would have thought that huge body composd of such numberlesse peeces had beene all one fire, and turnd to one flame from those huge piles of sacrifices of universall joy, notwithstanding those huge cataracts of water that powrd downe from the meteors; But greater farre, and more ardent were those inward flames of gladnesse, wherewith all hearts did burn and sparkle to see their Rocalino againe. All mouths were full with Oken leafs and in the Wood so wide, &c. with other such songs and catches of airie mirth; The very inanimat creatures as steeples and walles, did shake with joy, yea the very pavements and channels pledgd healths for this happie returne. Amongst other forren congratulations which came from farre and neare, CARBASILIS suddenly sent, but with this Complement, That next to the hand of divine providence, he might thanke her, and her numerous graffs, that hee came so safely and freely backe, so that I cannot but deride their shallownesse, and poverty of judgment, who thinke Elaiana had any designe to detaine him there. The Royall Oke summond hereupon a generall assembly, wherein by the relations of Villerio (and indeed he for his own particular had little reason to love Elaiana ever after for some disrespects that had passd,) the two treaties, touching the alliance with Elaiana, and restitution of Baccharia were quite dissolvd by the unanimous vote of that great Assembly, not one dissenting from it, which made his Majestie say, That he thought they were led by one spirit, as the seventy Interpreters . And nothing could be more pleasing to the Druinians then the rupture of these treaties, as the case then stood, for they were extreamely nettled to see the Princely standell of their Royall Oke returne from Elaiana with a branch of willowes . Nor indeed did the poplars and coppices and vulgar sort of Druinas Trees, specially Thamisond, ever affect this match, for they were transported with such a reasonlesse aversenesse to it, that whosoever did speake but in favour of it, or discoverd any good wishes to it, hee was presently held a Petropolitan, and to have swallowed a leafe of the Ivie . The Petropolitans throughout all Druina were exceedingly dejected and crest-fallen at these proceedings, and that matters went so crosse in Elaiana; And as it was observed to be an ill favourd augury, that a peece of the royall tarrasse fell under Mordogan at his first audience, when he came Hoc agere, when the treaty of alliance begun to be in serious agitation; so a little before this dissolution of it, another fatall accident, or rather tragique presage fell out in Thamisond: For as the Petropolitans were in midst of divine exercise, and some say inveighing against the Eusebians, the Oratory suddenly tumbled downe, so that a great number of them were quashd to death by the very inanimat creatures of stones and rubbish to the consternation of all the world. And this happened when they were a gogge and building of Castles in the aire, and at the height of their hopes, that by vertue of the said alliance, they should have a kind of liberty of conscience equall to a Toleration. The Royall Oke following the advise of the foresaid great Counsell prepared for a warre, which quite turnd the match, to powder; Mars thrusts Hymen out of dores, and Ianus gates flew wide open; Then which nothing could bee more thwarting and opposite, the one to his disposition, the other to his desires which had beene so vehemently carried that way for many yeares; They promised to make him belovd at home, and feard abroad as much as any Prince that was, to which end they gave him round sommes of moneys; A polemicall Counsell was erected for the conduct of the martiall affaires, and by the gracious condescent of Majesty they were to dispose of the pecuniary levies that were made to that end. As matters were reducd to this passe, behold a notable peece of machiavillianisme, formd and complotted against Villerio by the Soveraigne Ministers Elaiana had then in Thamisond; who in a private audience they desird to have of Druinas Monarke, undertooke to discover unto him a notable conjuration intended both against his royall dignity and person, which was; That Villerio with some of the Prime of his Counsell had consulted of the arguments and meanes that were to be taken for the dissolving of the forementioned treaties; And that their consultations passd so farre, that if the Majesty of Druinas King would not accommodat himselfe to their Counsels herein, he should have a house of pleasure where hee might retire himselfe to his sports, in regard that prime Rocalino had now yeares and parts answerable for the publike governement . The royall Oke upon this imperfect overture, made many instances unto them that they would give him the Authors of so pernicious a conspiracy; but they instead of confirming the great zeale they pretended to beare him, all the answer they made consisted of arguments against the discovery of the Conspirators. Hereupon his Majesty commanded some of his secretst Counsellors, with others to be examind and sworne, and that such interrogatories should bee propounded unto them that were most pertinent to the accusation; wherby there was found in Villerio, and the rest who were impeachd a very cleare and sincere innocency, touching these foule imputations. This being so, new instances were made to the said Ambassadors, that they should not prefer the discovery of the names of the conspirators to the security of his royall Majesty, the truth and honour of themselves; and the hazard of an opinion to be held the tracers of a plot of such malice, fedition and danger; But the Informers continued in a knobby kinde of obstinacy resolving still to conceale the names of the Authors. Hereupon Druinas Monarch sent two of his sages to tell them, that they being the Authors of an accusation so pernicious, had rendred themselves incapable to treat further with him, and were it not for the respect he bore to Elaiana's King whose person they did represent, hee would and could by the law of Nations and the right of his owne Royall Iustice proceed against them with such severity as the offence deservd, but for the reason aforesaid hee would leave the reparation thereof to the justice of the Royall Olive himselfe of whom he would demand and require it . Hereupon the Soveraign Minister who was then employed in ELAIAN A was commanded to require refaction and satisfaction against the Informers or rather inventors and forgers of the aforesaid misinformation, which was of that quality, that it was sufficient to put impressions in him of perpetuall jealousies, in regard that through Villerio , they did wound Prince Rocalino , and the best of his subjects; for it was not probable, that Villerio would have hurld himselfe into such an enterprise without communicating of it first to him, yet notwithstanding the Royall Oke would not mingle the correspondence and friendship he holds with the Majesty of the Olive , with the faults and offences of his Ministers, but leave them, and restraine them to themselves. These things being represented to Elaianas King, he seemd then to be somwhat sensible of them; but when the aforesaid Ministers were returnd, they were onely confind for a few daies: but afterwards instead of reprehension they were rather rewarded and further employed. Not long after, the Royall Oke who all his life time had continued in a constant calme of tranquillity, notwithstanding that al the circumjacent Forrests were often in fearefull combustions about him, and had beene the gracious Vmpire of so many Soveraigne quarrels (glorying in the attribute of peacefull (and might bee said to have bin the Caducean Rod which composd and charmd all dissentions twixt other Princes) was feld by the dire hand of fate, being newly plungd in a war against Elaiana . From the very time that hee sprouted first above ground, he was pursued with treasonable practises, and his tutelar Angell still mervailously garded him. Nor was there ever any Monarke upon earth since his time that writ from the Cedar to the shrub, of a greater latitude of learned knowledg, which made him to bee termd Druinas third University. Aarons rod never bore more buds then under the branches of this gracious Oke; Nor did the Groves of the Muses and common wealth of letters so fructifie at any time; so, that in the firmament of learning hee will shine to all posterity a starre of the greatest magnitude, Crescet oculto velut Arbor aevo, Fama.------ Touching his profound reach in holy things, let that pourtrait drawne out of the sacred Oracle, and the difficultst part thereof, beare the world witnesse; which peece hee sent the great Archflamin to pay him all old arrearages. Never any Country flourished more in the Commutative part of justice, as did Druina in his time, specially the first tenne yeares, in which space, besides other places, THAMISOND did so enrich her selfe, that shee gathered more than she had done in thirty yeares before. His stately spouse sprung out of the ancient stemme of the Royall Firre of Elatena, was transplanted some yeares before to the celestiall Paradise, whither t'was said she went in Noahs Arke, and He in Elia's Chariot, alluding to the quality of their diseases, the one aquatike, the other hot and dry . In this peacefull Prince there was an admird concurrence of many high Platonique vertues, onely be would sometimes come too neare the fire of passion, yet never in any serious, but sudden triviall passages. Munificent hee was beyond the ordinary custome of Kings; most confident of the fidelity of his Agents and Instruments; For hee was wont to say, that when hee employed any servant in a serious businesse of trust, he would not imbitter the sweetnesse hee conceavd of his fidelitie with any mixtures of feare or diffidence. Yet if any miscarried, the distaste would not dwell long in him, nor I dare say did the Sunne ever goe downe upon his anger. Some there were upon whom the beames of his regall favour reflected more strongly. And why not? have not the wisest of Earthly Monarques had their Favorits? For if every Creature is left free to like where he list, it were preposterous and injurious to deprive Kings of that liberty which the meanest of their Subjects enjoy, they command multitudes of Subjects as they are Kings, but they are subjects to their owne passions, as they are composed of foure Elements. The Princely Standell which had beene a long time the hopes of Druinas Crowne, became now the Crowne of her hopes, and succeeded in the Royall Throne.  \------Tandem fit surculus Arbor. A Prince endued with such a strength of vertue, that he seemes to strike malice dumbe; A Prince of whom it may be sayd, that he hates the very names of those vices that are incident to Princes, more then other Princes hate the vices themselves. He was well balancd, and of a growth just ripe for this mighty burden, having newly taken the vest of virility, and being reard up to a comely cleane timbred strong bulke, wonderfull active and patient of toyle; And if forren travell begets wisedome in regard the eye, which hath a more immediate commerce with the soule, and is a faithfuller witnesse then the eare; Hee is the best traveld Prince by the Sea and Land of any, and therein hath the advantage of his neighbours. Of a solid and excelling judgement in the hardest and choycest things, but specially in the service and deserts of his Officers and servants, who in a Monarchy are accordingly active or carelesse, as the Prince is capable to distinguish and judge of their labours; Whereby I hope to see Druina vindicated more and more of the aspersions the world abroad casts upon her; that she slowly seekes after well qualified instruments, and more slowly cherisheth vertue in her owne plants, but admires any thing in strangers, and is more ready to employ them, though she have of her owne, equally if not better qualified. Most singularly indulgent hee is of his Royall Consort, which is so acceptable to Heaven, that shee corresponds with him, in bringing him forth many reall fruits of his love, sweet Princely Graffes, which I may well avouch, are the best for alliance and stocke that ever the earth had, being as immediately extracted out of the Oke and the Vine, so are they nearely allied to the Cedar, the Olive, the Firre, the anciently descended Vine, and all the best stemmes of the Westerne world; So that if ever any Plants sprung de femine Div um , as some Philosophers affirmd, they may be said to have sprung so. He is inflexibly just in the expiation of the crying sinne of murther, yet most tender of the life of the meanest shrub that groweth under his Princely boughes. Most tenacious he is, of his purposes, when they have beene pondred, and layne long in the ballance of mature deliberation, and winnowed by the debate of his sages. But above all things else (and indeed all things else are but bables to this) hee is most punctuall in his pietie to heaven; so that take all this together, this inference will result, that if hee were, but one of the ordinary vulgar plants, they that know aright, would judge him to be one of the compleatest, and most vertuous of all Druina . But the Crown which descended upon him was inlayed with so many difficulties, that it might be justly calld a Crowne of thornes for many yeares; For after along calme of peace, hee was left newly engagd in a war against one of the greatest of earthly Monarchs, and (as it was said of one of his progenitors) with a rustie sword, and empty purse, the Crowne being fallen into a bottomlesse pit or gulph of debt, besides his own former arreares; The moving fortresse which are the chiefe strength of Druina were in slender repaire, his magazines of amunition ill supplied; The Lady Carbasilis with her numerous issue were to bee provided for, and hee was left to seeke for a spouse for himselfe. But by the speciall favour of heaven, hee hath surmounted all these difficulties and brought the glory of Druinas diademe to cast a greater splendor then ever it did. Touching a royall Consort, the high hand of providence, reservd for him such a one, that there never sprung up above ground a more beauteous or approaching nearer some celestiall deity; for through those starry casements of her soule, one may discerne in her a kind of divinity transcending the race of mortals, so that in this Virginian Vine, the saying of the wisest of Kings may be verifyed, That a good Wife, is a Tree of life . This young royal Oke being now setled in his throne, he sends Villerio to visit the disconsolat ( arbasilis, and to confirme a league defensive and offensive with the Willowes his fast friends . He suddenly sends a mighty fleet against Elaiana, but the Critickes of those times abroad, said, this fleete so quickly riggd shewd rather the power then providence of Druina, yet she returnd without any passive encounter at all. He employes two of his noblest Elmes to treat of an alliance with that peerles peece of natures rarities, the Lady Aretine, which great businesse by their wise and successeful negotiation was concluded in fewer months, then Elaiana spent yeares in her treaty; so that the La: Aretine was entitled by holy rite, Queene of Druina, which shee would not accept of, unlesse shee had the title of Ampelona's Queene also added. Thus the youngest spray of the great martiall Vine came to Druina, with a great masse of ready treasure, and a row of her owne Country Grasses for her first sett of servants; But they misdemeaning themselves by some fond fopperies of superstition in prejudice of the La: Aretine her health, and for other morall miscariages were suddenly dismissd and sent backe to Ampelona with bagge and baggage, all their salaries being punctually payed them to a penny, and many of them parted with rewards; Though a very moderne Chronicler traduceth Druina in this point, to have dismissd them without their wages, & c. But as in this, so in many other relations hee takes up things upon trust; and imperfect partiall information; A grosse defect in a royall Chronologer, nor indeed can it be judgd whether his faults in this kind, or flatteries throughout the whole body of his story, bee grosser; And whereas history should bee the torch of truth, hee makes her in diverse places a fuliginous linke of lies . The renvoy of the Ampelonians was ill taken by the Royall Vine, and the suddennes of the action did much aggravate the businesse, with the quality of the persons, being for the most part younger Graffes, having parted with what they had in their owne soyle to take rooting and grow up in Druina about the Lady Aretine . Vpon these distasts the voyaging Marchants pillage one another, as they found advantage, yet the two Kings stirrd not a good while after; For it is with Kings sometimes, as with Porters, whose packs may justle one against the other, yet they remaine good friends still . Not long after DRUINAS Monarke convokes an universall Assembly; To whom, He declard to have calld them together for the safety of Religion, for securing his kingdomes and subjects at home, having two such mighty Monarkes his actuall enemies, for the assisting of his Allies and Confederates abroad, specially the Royall Firre, who had lately embarkd himselfe very far in open war against the Cedar principally in behalfe of Prince Altapinus , and was reducd to wonderfull streights, being chasd out of a great part of his dominions, by the Cedars Generall . For these with other important motives hee propounded a supply of Treasure. These things at first overture were well resented by the lower assembly, who with much alacritie agreed to a good round supply, and indeed it was the greatest gift that ever subjects gave KING, but before it was brought to any sound perfection, this good worke was unluckily disturbd by a multitude of questions concerning the priviledge of the subject, and prerogative of the Soveraigne; by which delayes the reality and reputation of that great Donative was much lessened, and the forren actions, the Royall Oke was engagd in abroad receivd much prejudice. Yet he did formally confirme unto them all their ancient priviledges, and gave two most gracious answers to their petitions tending to this end: And having complied with them thus to their hearts desire, as also in two former Assemblies wherein were delivered them as sacrifices some of the Crowne Officers, and done them sundry other Acts of Princely grace, yet some extravagant spirits given over to fancy, and faction, disturbd the calme of these proceedings. They fall like thunder upon Villerio, alleadging that he was the cause of the incongruity in government at home, and of disasters abroad; That he was the first that deflourd the Virgin honour, making her a kinde of prostitut, and meere marchandise salable for white and redde earth, which is too base a price for her, that should be the prime guerdon of vertue, through whose temple only, there should be a passage to hers. They complaine of his exorbitant power, having in his hands the privatst and most reposefull offices of trust, by sea and land, & such as were incompatible and never known in the person of one subject . They cry out that none received advancement but his progeny, which they termd the tribe of fortune, with other high clamours: Thus hee who in their former meetings was a great subject of their commendation, when for dissolving the two Treaties with Elaiana they said he had done so well, that he deservd to have his statue publikely erected in the midst of Thamisond, became now the chiefe subject of their complaints and grievances. But the rayes of Royall Majesty reverberated so strongly upon Villerio, that they dispell'd all those clouds, which did hang over and thus obumbrat him, and the rather because Evidence, which is the lanterne of of the Law, was wanting, these accusations having no other proofe but publike fame. In these times a warlike fleet was prepar'd against Ampelona, in regard the Vine had not performd certaine capitulations, that were promised the Royall Oke in favour of the Eusebians there, besides one moitie of the Lady Aretines dower was not sent according to Article, with other provocations and secret motives. The enterprise fayling, though the first Invasion (and would heaven had pleasd the retreat had beene answerable) was made with as brave a resolution as any martiall attempt could possibly be, and in managing the Souldier Villerio, with the rest, shewed undeniable assurances of valour: yet the Royall Oke was not a whit daunted hereby, but presently commanded a greater number of vessels of warre to bee riggd and made ready in pursute of the same designe, upon which Villerio was to goe Generalissimo againe; But being upon point of embarking, this great Commander having at his becke such a multitude of martiall spirits was suddenly cut off, to the consternation and amazement of all the world, by a fatall stroake which was given him with a small contemptible instrument, and with such an admirable advantage, that it was impossible either by slight or art, or strength of engine, to dispatch one sooner out of this world; And which made the act more tragicall, his noble Consort, then pregnant, beheld him thus felld, and weltring upon the ground presently after. Thus fell that procere goodly faire timberd Elme in the fulnesse of his strength, who had so long flourish'd under the gracious branches of two Royall Okes , having led halfe his life in that height of fortune, and affluence of all earthly pleasure; who being thus fallen, many inferior Trees grew great out of his boughs, In so much that the saying of the Philosopher , who being askd, what was a doing in heaven, answerd, Magn ae ollae franguntur, & ex frustis earum minores fiunt , mought have beene not improperly applied to what then passd in Druina . Out of this sad Catastrophe may bee drawne this lesson, That great ones may secure themselves from guilt, but not from envie, which like the Sunne-beames beates upon rising grounds, and towring high Trees, when the shrub is safe. Cernis ut ventis agitatur ingens Pinus.------ He had a concurrence of all those gracefull parts, that might attract Princely love, and conduce to the accomplishment of a Courtier, and had hee containd himselfe still in that condition, hee might happily have lasted untill time had covered him with hoary mosse. The Royall Majesty which first tooke him into favour, agenid and traind him up for his own turne by certaine degrees in the most pertinent affaires and Mysteries of State, observing therein the progresse of nature which suffereth no motion to passe from one extreme to another, but by intermediat spaces, as she useth to passe from Winter to Summer by the interposition of the spring, and so returne to Winter by Autumne: so that Platonike Prince servd himselfe of certaine pawses to advance and employ him; And hee was no improper peece to worke upon, having so pliable and gentle a genius, that he grew very pregnant and dextrous in the art of government. Among other maximes of policy he proposd to himselfe in the conduct of his affaires, one was to neglect apologies, whereof he said, he saw no other fruit then to multiply discourse, and humour the vulgar, nor did he ever value any pasquils that were dropd up and downe, so farre, as to thinke them worthy of his revenge, which questionlesse was a well settled Rule, for Libels neglected quickly finde their owne graves; and dissipat to ayre . Hee was none of those Idolaters that worship the beast with many heads, that use to burne incense to the vulgar. And as herein, so in many other things, great abilities appeard in him, for extraordinary must be the wisdome of him who floateth upon the streame of Soveraigne favour, wherein there is seldome any sistence, twixt sinking and swimming. A sure friend he was, and a resenting foe, a brave Master to servants, and a remembrer of the least good office; For his stocke; he transplanted most of them to plentifull soyles. And doubtlesse hee had a brave soule to actuat that comely composure; And an innated valour appeard in him, when hee put himselfe upon the Souldiers defense as he receivd the mortall stabbe. I will conclude with part of a Character that a judicious Cavalier gave lately of him; Hee was a great example of Sobriety and temperance, but not of continency. The Assassin that feld him found oftentimes strong and strange reluctancies in himselfe, nor could hee give any other reason that pushd him forward to this black attempt, but that he was blasted by the great Assembly, and so thought it an act agreeable to heaven to take away the partition wall betweene the King and his people, and make him a sacrifice to the publike, though with an unavoydablenesse of his owne destruction, confronting thereby death in the face; Whereby was verified that saying, that he who is carelesse of his owne life, is master of another's . But Heaven forbid that this custome which hath such a vogue in other parts, should take footing in DRUINA . This tragedie being acted, the Royall Oke pursueth his designe for supporting of Petrina, with the Eusebians in Ampelona, but this disaster as it bred confusion for the time, so it causd a stand in the procedure of that great action, which gave the Vine respit to finish those stupendous circumvallations and barricadoes hee had reard up by sea and land to begirt Petrina; In so much that when another noble Elme was sent with strength sufficient to have achievd a greater exploit, he found her passd cure. This some say went to the very heart of Elaiana, who in regard of that notable advantage, and addition of united power the Uine got hereby, would have found some way or other to have relievd Petrina, had she thought Druina would have missd it. The great Assembly aforesaid rejoynd, and mett againe in one body, and now he that was supposd to be the cause of the tempest being throwne overboard, there were great hopes a calme should ensue, but the storme continued as furious as ever, and unlucky passions blustred as much, if not more, than they had done formerly in Villerios time. They flew a fresh upon other great Officers and questiond a duty, that for garding of the seas, and common defence of the realme had beene indisputably granted to so many preceding Kings for a bene esse, which they made difficulty to affoord the Royall Oke regnant, unles he would first renounce alright to it, and so receive it meerely from them. Thus they choppd logicke with Soveraigne Majesty who movd with these traverses, resolvd though to his unutterable griefe to dismisse this great Counsell, but upon the point when this was to be done in forme, the lower assembly in a strange tumultuary manner adjournd themselves, before they had receivd his royall pleasure. They denied him his Officers at armes, violated the prolocutor, being twise sent for, delayed to let in his messenger, and discontentments turning thus to a strange kind of disobedience, they broake up in confusion. Adde hereunto that notwithstanding there was another peculiar Assembly of Reverend Yewes of purpose for the regulating and sweeping cleane of the house of the Almighty, yet the poplars must make it their office to tamper with the constitution of holy things; And indeed this is one of the greatest scandals and brands, that not only Petropolis, but other Forreners (who have with her forsaken Petropolis ) cast upon Druina. viz. that her Ecclesiasticall Ordinances are the commands and injunctions of this secular power, and members of this Assembly, who not only confirme (which may become them well enough, and is necessary for a generall obedience) but take upon them to be Iudges herein. So that one being askd what they did in that lower great Assembly, hee was answerd pleasantly, That they were making of a new Creed; Another was over-heard to say, that hee could not bee quiet in his Conscience, untill the holy text should be confirmd by an Act of theirs . Whence may bee inferrd, that some of them beleeve, it belongs to them to make sanctions, as well as statutes . This inducd the Royall Oke, though he be responsible to none for an account of his actions but to the high Majestie of Heaven, to publish an open protest unto the world, for the satisfaction of his better sort of subjects, of the causes of these disorders, declaring that while Villerio liv'd, hee was intitled to all the distempers and ill events of former assemblies, therefore much endeavour was usd to demolish him as the only wall of separation twixt their Soveraigne and them, but he now being cut off, no alteration was found amongst them at all, or calmenesse in their proceedings. He was pleasd to declare further, that he imputed not these commotions to the whole Assembly, knowing that there were amongst them, many religious, grave and well minded Patriotts, but the sincerer and better part of them being over-borne by the clamours and practises of others, who carelesse of their duties, and taking advantage of the times and his necessities, constraind him to breake off that meeting, which had it beene answerd with like duties on their parts, as love on his, might have prov'd happie to all Druina. These fatall distempers as they did much hurt to the body politicke at home, for they were like humours stirrd in the naturall body without evacuation, so did they produce disadvantagious effects abroad, and better had it been that the Raysers and fomenters of them had never sprang up in Druina . The Royall Firre had engagd himselfe in the quarrell of Altapinus against the Cedar, and he had proceeded so far as to the imminent and actuall danger of his owne person. And expecting from Druina those monthly supplies which were promised by capitulation, partly for want of them, the one halfe of his territories being already over-runne and plundred, hee was constraind to shuffle up a peace with the Cedar (without Druinas privity.) And it was high time for him, for whereas the Firre was usd to bee a dwelling for the stork, the Eagle was like to build his nest there . The foresaid great expedition to relieve Petrina did also suffer hereby, and indeed the whole party of the Eusebians every where up and downe the world, who had their eyes fixd upon Druinas Monarke their defendor . Who so much labouring to take the old wonted great trodden way, for supplies towards the support of such publike designes, was constraind at last to take the higher roade, by having recourse to his Soveraigne prerogative to ballast the common purse of the state; And a kingdome is like a Shippe at Sea, whose ballast should be the Princes Coffers; which if they be light and emptie, she will do nought but tumble up and downe, nor can she be made to run a direct and steddy Course . About this time fell one of the noblest Elmes in the whole Forest, extracted of the ancient stocke of the Monticolians, that bore the smallest, yet chiefest staffe of office and command in Druinas Court; And his fall was the more remarkable, because the night immediately before he was discoursing of, and slighting the art of those foolish Astrologers, and Genethliacall Ephemerists, that use to pry into the horoscope of Nativities, whereof one had much tampred with his, and positively affirmd he should not reach 51. yeares, And now said hee, I have liv'd (thankes bee to Heaven) fiftie one yeares and a day compleat, But the next morning hee was taken with an Apoplexie, whereof he presently died; much lamented hee was, for his noblenes, and mervailous candor of disposition, on, and other brave endowments, and therefore generally belov'd in Citie, Court, and Country . And being a long time averse to the match with Elaiana Mordogan put a shrewd pernicious complement upon him; For being at a private audience in discourse with Druinas Monarke, hee fell to magnifie the greatnesse, loyalty, and wealth of his subjects; and specially of this noble Elme, who had such rooting in the hearts of the poplars, that upon any faction, or tumult, he verily thought he could draw after him all the Trees of the Forrest . But this was spoken of purpose to make some impression of jealousies in the breast of Majesty. As these traverses happened in Druina, behold Bumelias King the Martiall Ash, holding himselfe to bee much affronted by the Cedar in that he would vouchsafe no audience to his Ambassadors, and that hee encroachd upon the Territories of his ALLIES; As also for some preventive reasons of state; He crosseth those cold Seas, and rusheth into Rhenusium like a whirlewind, carrying all before him though with small numbers at first, not exceeding 7000. Yet like a ball of snow tumbling downe a hill, hee still gatherd strength as he passd: and made Chips of all the Trees he met withall. Hee restored two of his said Allies to their entire possessions, and proceeding further, and being dared as he was a Cavalier by that great Veteran Captaine then the Cedars Generall (who the day before had shrewdly shaken the plane) to meete him in pitchd field; He answerd that he was something more than a Cavalier, and that he had thousands under him as good as that General himselfe, therefore he would not fayle to finde him out speedily . The next day he kept his word and gave him battaile, where hee carried away as faire and compleat a victory as possibly could be, and thereby he freed the Planes Country from the impendent dangers that hung over it. He marchd still on, making his passage by the point of the sword every where, He crosseth the great River that denominates Rhenusium, upon whose bankes hee kept his festivals in an admired triumphant manner in one of the chiefest Archstamins townes, whither Ambassadours resorted unto him from farre and neare, as if he had beene some Cesar . The Royall Vine being displeasd that he had crossd that great River, and invaded the Territories of the Church (whereof he had taken the protection) without his privity, sent to tell him by his Ambassador; That if he did not stand to his Articles, he had an Army of 80000. to enter into Rhenusium when hee pleased. The magnanimous Ash answerd, that he had not infringd the least tittle of what was articled, that they aymd at one marke, and their ends were concentrike, and he knew how to make his way in Rhenusium, better than he could tell him . And touching the Archflamin in whose metropolis hee then kept his Court, hee had broke promise both with the Royall Vine and him, by ceasing to bee neutrall; As for the menace hee sent, if Ampelona had 80000. to rush into to Rhenusium , he had 20000. and with them he would be sooner at the walles of Tutelia, then those 80000. could be on the frontiers of Rhenusium . Afterwards he made himselfe master of Baccharia, but to re-invest Altapinus there, hee would have tied him to hard, and indeed to very harsh termes; first, That hee should make no leavie of Military forces, without his consent. That he should supply him with so many thousands upon his owne charge during these warres; that hee should still reserve two of the chiefest Townes of Baccharia in deposito, where hee might put in garrison to be maintaind by the contributions of the Countrey; That hee should make no league or confederacy with any other, without his privity and consent . That there should bee free exercise of the Bumelian Religion throughout all Baccharia, and an Academy, and Schooles erected to that end. That he should acknowledge, under God, to have receivd his Country from him; with diverse other such restrictions. But that noble stout Elme whom the Royall Oke employed at that time in Rhenusium in a high quality, of purpose to observe his motions, would not condescend hereunto. Hence Bumelias King breakes his way to the Elders Court, where he shooke him ill favouredly for the time, ranging through the very bowels of his Country, and plundring all wheresoever he came, as farre as his very cells and clossets. But as no violent course lasteth long, this irresistible torrent of his tropheys was stoppd by the dire hand of destiny, so that in the throng of his owne victorious troupes, this martiall Ash was felld, the greatest of his enemies whom hee most redoubted for his valour, falling before in his sight. So that, as in life, so at, and after his death he provd a Conqueror, falling upon the bed of honour and victory both at once, in a party colourd field Gules and Argent, but the crest Sable, so that it was impossible for a Souldier to bid the world farewell, in a braver manner. His fall for the present strucke an earth quake into all minds, nor could the vulgar bee inducd a great while to beleeve that he was feld, thinking him to bee impenetrable, and above the stroake of fate. An Heroicke Prince he was, and in such a height, that it was said the soule of C aesar had entred into him; So that some thinke he sprung of the race of that Tree , whereof Achilles speare, and Hercules Club were made, only hee was taxd to bee over-ventrous and headstrong; besides there were some, that observd him, to bee somewhat elated by that monstrous course of conquering, but as Adrianas Ambassadour apologiz'd for him, He had been more than a mortall wight, if he had not been somewhat altered at the successe of such high feates, which were such, that considering the quality of the Country, Townes, and enemies, none of the twelve Caesar acts, paralleld his in so short a time. But I will relate a thing worthy of wonder; amongst others who receivd contentment at the proceedings of the Warlike Ash, Melissanus the great Archflamin would be often inquisitive, and well pleasd to heare of any successefull encounter of his against the Cedar . Some thinke the reason was, in regard the Cedar had a little before disturbd the peace of Bombicina, and joynd with Elaiana to kindle a new fire in her, therefore hee was well contented to see him a little shaken. Others say, there was some secret tye, that if the Ash should compasse his designes in Rhenusium, he should assist Melissanus to recover Hipparcha, (which the Olive hath so long detaind from Petropolis ) as a reward for his neutralitie: Hereupon when there was a great Contracto in the holy Senat, at the time when the Cedars and Olives Embassadors demanded pecuniary supplies out of the holy treasure for the support of Religion in RHENVSIVM and preventing the further spreading of the ASH, the IVIE himselfe answered, That he was satisfied Religion was neither the subject nor scope of those Warres; And that the holy treasure, was to bee reservd, and issued for holy uses, and not misapplied to any other ends . Whereunto one of the prime members of that high Senat, replying, That the Ivie for his coldnesse in the Cedars quarrell was traducd abroad for halfe an Hereticke, he was taken up very short, and adjudgd corrigible for such presumptuous language. Amongst many others, which had obligations to the martiall Ash, the Plane receivd no small benefit by him; for hee preservd his Country three severall times from impendent and actuall danger; but it seemes he quickly forgot him, for after his fall hee shuffled up a peace with the Cedar in which the Bumelians were quite excluded: And it had beene wishd, that the princely plane, (though allowed his sprincklings of wine, because as the Arbolists; observe it is more naturall to him, and makes him thrive better than any other Tree ) had in these traverses beene lesse wavering, and not suffered himselfe to be shaken with such incertaine blasts: for I cannot tell how often he put in, and pulld out his pin from the stake . Had the adventrous Ash survivd that fatall, yet victorious, day he fell on, many think the Cedar was so far shrunk that he had beene put to very hard shifts to have made head against him to any purpose againe. For indeed his progresse was such, that both sides stood at a stand, gazing and doubting where his conquest would terminat. And had he brought his intents home to his ayme, he would have cast the policy of the lower world into a new mould, and happily have put his own confederates to stand upon their gard; And as for many others, so had it not been wholesome for Druina, that his acquests had extended further, which makes mee, that I cannot wonder enough at the shallownesse and impertinent zeale of the vulgar sort in Druina, who were still so eager, and joyfull to heare him still goe on, and carried away with such an ignorant devotion for his successes, when it little concernd their religion or security. Amongst divers others who rejoycd and triumphd at the fall of the war-like Ash, the Elder lifted up his hollow boughs, so high, that a little after he took heart of grace to court one of the youngest sprayes of the Imperiall Cedar for his Consort, though in point of age he quadrupply exceeded her, being cauterizd in foure severall places about his body to have vent for his malignant humors, wherewith it seemes he much abounded, specially towards Prince Altapinus, who was one of the nearest to him in stocke; Besides his young Consort was sprung as close to him, and as neare as could be out of his own stemme . Yet neither disparity of yeares, nor propinquity of stocke, could hinder the designe policy had herein, but he carried her cleare away; And what fruit can be expected of this inoculation, but blacke unsavourie berries, and Flowers onely to make the tartest Viniger, such as the ELDER naturally beares. And what fruit also the beech will produce by his late ingrafting upon the other spray, though in a farre ignobler way, (having by letters and instruments) attempted a Princely Graffe, which as farre precels her, which hee hath lighted upon, as a Damaske Rose doth the Couslip in natures workemanship, quantum lenta solent inter viburna cupressi, ) I had rather expect then determine. But these kinde of infolliations wresting so farre the lawes of nature, have seldome prov'd prosperous; I know not what they may doe upon this moderne politicke race, which as she pretends to have mounted to this might and largenesse by these meanes, so shee goeth on, to ciment her designes, and fortifie her selfe still by this course; But some of the best genethliacall Arbolists observe, that though these unequall imbuddings may flourish for a time, they will fade away at last by a fate, that unavoydably useth to attend them. Before the lowest of the celestiall bodies had finishd her monthly course, ALT APINUS also fell, who had beene a companion to the warlike Ash in many of his exploits through Rhenusium; A Prince who by a hard destiny, became a tennis-ball a long while to the blind Goddesse; A Prince in whom many vertues did co-habit. He was free from that vice Rhenusium is so naturally addicted unto, where the custome is so generall that it takes away the conscience to be peccant therein. Very sedulous hee was in the pursute of his affaires, parsimonious and wonderfully indulgent of his young Cions, and the glory of her sexe Carbasilis, who though Homebias Crowne was lost, yet by her Princely comportment, shee got then another kingdome which shee retaines ever since, as may bee inferrd out of her name; For at the beginning of these unlucky traverses, shee wisely turnd her selfe (though sprouted naturally of the Oke ) into a palme, and with a more than feminine courage tooke for her motto ever since,  \------Sub mole resurgo. For it can hardly bee judgd, whether her various sorts of pressures, or patience were greater. Many brave adventrous spirits fell for love of her; amongst others I cannot forget, the high-hearted martialist Brunonio, who first lost his lands, then one of his chiefest limbes, and lastly his life in her quarrell . Nor can I omit here a Noble Elme sprung up in the streets of Tamisond, who hath beene a most constant and resolute Adventurer, and conversd with danger a great while for her, though with extraordinary expence, the late losse of his libertie, and many traverses of apparant hazard, even to the admiration of the Ash himselfe, and envie of others. Not long before these times, there being interchangeable overtures made on all sides; The Royall Oke renewed a peace both with the Vine and the Olive, twixt whom there passd many shockes; for the Olive, the worst that Druina suffered was, that she exchangd Coales for Sugar . And now behold a glorious serenity of peace againe in Druina, having had two of her potentst neighbours upon her backe at once. It hath beene a maxime often verified in policy; That Kings may marry, but not their Crownes, and never was this more exemplified, then by the alliance of those Princely sprayes that sprung of the last great Martiall Vine, who notwithstanding that of themselves there were never any in whom sweetnesse of disposition, and vertue her selfe was more resplendent in such a degree, as if the three graces had contributed their utmost power to make them good; yet I know not by what fate or fortune t'is come to passe, there have fallen out diverse traverses of Warre, since the inarching of those graffes, upon the Olive, the Pine, and the Oke; Which yet continueth, and is daily exasperated twixt the Olive and the Vine, who though at first, they crossd one anothers designes by sending auxiliary forces in collaterall wayes, they doe now directly and in good earnest, clash their branches one against the other . For the justnesse of their quarrell, I will not undertake here to debate it; nor determine whether a just feare without any active invasion or offence bee sufficient grounds to Ampelona for a warre, and whether it may deserve the name of a defensive. I have reade that the true cause of the Peloponnesian . Warre (though they were blanchd with other specious colours) was the over-growing greatnesse of Athens, which did as it were impose upon the Lacedemonians a necessity of armes; Preventive Warres have beene practised by the best policied states, they rid the Forrest oftentimes of superfluous plants; and are as a purge for the body politicke: And in all ages it hath beene held a maine part of providence, to have an eye, That their confining neighbours, should neither by too neare an approach, or encrease of territory, or enfeebling of confederates, nor by ingrossing of trade, or stopping of passage, receive any addition of strength, And in point of wealth to beare up still in equall proportion, upon the enhancement of the rates of coyne, excrescence of demeanes, or imposition of tolls; This makes the Vine so Salt his subject, and the Olive pepper his so much. The lawfulnesse of warre in the generall was never questiond, so it have a Soveraigne head, not otherwise. For the Almighty is the God of Hosts and armes, as well as of peace; And warres well grounded are nought else but sutes of appeale to the consistory of heaven, when there is no superior on earth to determine the cause: And besides the lawfulnesse hereof, there seemes to bee a kinde of inevitablenesse and necessitie in it; Some Philosophers were of opinion, that the world doth subsist by a perpetuall strife in some part or other, I goe not above the concave of the Moone, where the celestiall bodies, though in relation to us (poore mortals) they seeme to strange, and have their contrary motions, eclipses and oppositions, yet amongst themselves they are in a most regular, and constant sweet course of concord; But for the elementary world, all things are in a kind of restlesse conflict; The Elements themselves, which are the primitive ingredients of all bodies, are in perpetuall combat, they still encroach one upon another, and labour to repell each other, but amongst the rest the fire is most vigorous and ravenous, the earth hath frequent fits of the Palsie, the Sea is never still, the aire is agitated with winds, and new monsters and meteorologicall impressions are hourely engendred; so in humane bodies composd of this stuffe, there is an incessant warfare amongst the humours for predominancy, and while this naturall war lasteth, the earth cannot be without civill and politicall preliations, the mind following most commonly the temper of the body. But a madde tenet it was of the Candian (in that divine and high soaring Philosopher) that peace is but a naked and empty name, a kinde of Chymera, and that every state expects but its advantage to set upon the skirts of the other, whence hee concludes, that there is alwayes a kinde of fermentation of warre, and no kinde of reall love and league betweene Princes, but only an impuissance or inconveniencie to doe hurt. An age there was, and t'was the last, when Druina, Ampelona, and Elaiana were so circumspect, and Eagle eyed, that scarce an acre of ground, could bee gotten by either of the three, but the other two would bee sure to doe their best, to set the scales even again. And the like diligence hath beene practised in diverse other Regions, and it seemes is now by Ampelona, by reason of the late new acquests the Olive, and his race in Rhenusium have made; which induceth her to sticke more close then ever to Itelia, as also to the Bumelians, who else I beleeve had gone neere to have quite disbanded long before now. The Princely Sycomore which stood as a screene twixt Ampelona and Rhenusium hath smarted for this, being fallen just under the same fatall predicament, as Altapinus, both exulating from their owne patrimoniall Territories. But a hard case it seemes to bee, that the Princely spray which was of the selfe same ancient stocke with the Sycomore, being branches of the same Tree, should in the verdantst season of her virginity, bee coupled according to the true rites of sacred law, with Ampelonas apparant heire, and then, poore Lady, to bee abandoned without the least imaginary fault of hers; And more strange it seemes to the world, that Ampelona, specially that now her prime Minister of state is of a holy function, should goe about to preferre a particular temporary custome of hers, viz that her Heire apparent should not any wayes dispose of himselfe to marriage, without the privity and consent of the State, to the prejudice and flat breach of the eternall law of the Almighty: And so to attempt the nullifying of that act, and loosning of that knot which by divine Ordinance should bee indissoluble; And so make a kinde of medlar of that Princely Sycomore, shee being every way superior to his first Consort. It is true, policy is warrantable, yet but as a hand-maid to divinity, and absurd it is to make the Mistresse stoope and give place to the servant; Policy is like the Apocrypha, which is allowed to be digested into one volume, and read with the sacred Text, but when it thwarts any thing that is Canonicall, away with it. The ravishing of the Sycomore's Country, hapned in an unlucky time for young Altapinus, for, I beleeve, it rendred the Treaty for a restitution of Baccharia more knotty and difficult; In so much that some think they must be put in Counter-scales hereafter, and move both upon one hinge . A much famed statist Elaiana had halfe an age since, was usd to say, that if Ampelona had three things favourable, she were eternall, viz. Petropolis, the Sea, and Counsell . Touching the first, Malissanus who now swayes the great Archflaminship, is mightily devoted to her, having beene so long rooted in her, that it seemes he naturally affects her soyle and plants. And oftentimes we finde that nature her selfe yeelds to custome, that great Giant, who is so prevalent, that oftentimes, wee shape the discourse of reason, and course of nature to the inbred notions and preconceptions it hath imprinted in our minds, besides, habituall frequency of conversation is one of the greatest loadstones of love. For the Sea, Itelia serves her for her docke and Arsenall, nor was shee ever so improv'd and potent that way; And I wish Itelia may never have cause to rue the time she did it. For Counsell, she hath lighted upon an Instrument of a mervailous contriving and sedulous spirit, as solid as hee is subtile, which is rare under that Clime, In so much that some have termd him the prodigie of prudence, others have soard higher, and calld him the grand Genius, and tutelar Angell of Ampelona, others flie yet higher, and call him the supreme Intelligence, the spirit that moves the heavens and the starres, the Ph aenix of the earth, and such like superlatives, and Hyperbole's . He is so strongly rooted in the opinion of the Royall Vine, that hee post- poseth filiall, and fraternall love, to his favour towards him. Some give other Characters of him, and call him the Incendiary of Ampelona, that his mind is of the colour of his habit, sanguine; That he is indued with the same spirit, that sometimes a famous Archflamin in Elaiana was, who said that Gunpowder in the field gave as sweet a perfume, as Incense at the Altar; This makes him keepe such a stirre with Drum and trumpet up and downe in many places; yet though that humour sutes with the colour of his Coat, it doth not I am sure with his calling. Nor because hee hath got a peculiar title to distinguish him from others, should hee be so farre elated with that Eminency as to expect priority of place of such high Ministers, who immediately represent Soveraigne and independent Majesty, and if hee be stout in this point, he must give them leave to be stately . But for his intermedling with armes, hee is the more excusable, because many others of his Coat in these times are not only martiall directors, but Commanders and Actors in open field, making Tents their Temples, and singing Te Deum with the noise of the Canon, so that those Warres which are now in motion, may be calld The holy Warres, being directed and managed most, by such Ministers. And here I will insert a late passage of a great provinciall Governor, and the oldest Martialist of Ampelona, who comming to visit a great Archflamin, that is now a Navall Generall, Hee sent to desire him to have a little patience, for hee was dispatching some Captaines and other Officers, who were to goe presently to Sea upon a designe of consequence . The provinciall Governour staying not, the Archflamin went the next day to excuse himselfe to him. The Veteran Governour hearing hee was there, sent to desire him to stay a little, for he was newly entred into a peece of Saint Austin, de Civitate Dei, and as soone as he had read it over, he would attend his Reverence . But to give Ramundas this prime Minister of state in Ampelona (for that's his title) his due, (and I honour him the more, because the first great act hee did when hee came to the helme was the alliance with Druina ) The Royall Vine hath done notable feates by the strength of his Counsell. He hath debelld the Eusebians who formerly stood upon the strength of their own gard, having sundry maritime and inland Forts, and places of fastnesse for their security, but they are brought to subsist now meerely by his mercy, having no other assurance for their safety, but his pleasure. And it seemes hee easily dispenseth with himselfe to performe, what his two immediate predecessors were bound by sacred tie, and Article to observe. For hee hath declard long since, That what the one did, hee did it out of feare; what the other, his great sire, did, he did it out of love (though he had his eares often stoppd with Cotton at their petitions) but for his part, hee neither lov'd them, nor feard them . And it must bee granted, this was one of the greatest weakenesses Ampelona had, for foren Princes and some of her owne Grandees, servd themselves of the Eusebians, as of matches to set her on fire within dores at pleasure. The ancient Elmes that lifted up their heads so high in their governments, wch some held as confidently as if it had bin their inheritance, and so lessened the opinion of the vassall to the Soveraigne, he hath remov'd, and placd therein inferiour Trees, not of so ancient a stocke, whereof some are trienniall, others during pleasure. Hee hath mervailously enhanc'd the revenues, and perquisits of the Crowne, to many millions more than it was, though with a pitifull excoriation of the poorer sort, so that from 14. they are mounted to 20. millions in the last estimat that was made. He hath clammerd over the huge neighbouring hils, making his way by the swords point, and setled one of his owne vassals, though opposd by the Cedar and Olive to be one of the Soveraigne Princes of Bombycina, and in the passage seiz'd upon the territories of the Princely Pine who made halfe resistance, but having effected his purpose, he freely surrendred it, yet reserving still to himselfe a key to enter Bombycina at pleasure. Hee hath disturbed the passage Elaiana had got through the vale, from Bombycina to Rhenusium . He hath so scourgd the Sycomore, who had offended him, that hee hath sent him to wander up and downe for another soyle to plant himselfe in. Hee hath regaind, though with infinite toyle and treasure those Islands Elaiana had a while rooted her selfe in neere Bombycina . And lastly, to bring you nearer home, he gave the Olive many smart knockes when hee thought to have planted himselfe in the confines of his Country, which provd too hot a soyle for the Elaianians, which made one of them to leave behind this motto upon the walls of a forsaken Fort. O Ampelonians, if we had been such as the world takes us to be, and you such as you have beene wont to; be our deeds had beene yours, and yours ours. These high feates the Vine hath done since he was proppd by this Genius; And behold lately a mighty blessing droppd downe from heaven upon him, and all Ampelona, viz. a rare masculine branch sprung out of him, and the lovely Olive, his Royall mate, after twenty three yeares inoculation, which hath transformd all the world to wonder. So that Ampelonas great Queene may answer her teeming neighbours as the Lionesse did the Fox, who reproaching her of sterility and such slownesse in breeding said, t'is true, I breed slowly but what I bring forth is a Lion; the application is obvious; And I hope the Lion of the Tribe of Judah will be graciously pleasd to make this inexpected regall late offspring a Prince of peace, that his birth may quash all farre fetchd reaches of ambitious policy, and put Christendome in a new mould of peace, least, besides those parts wherein she is already stucke, shee feele in other of her members, the prickles of that huge Bramble, who hath it for the prime part of his Letany, That intestine warres bee still fomented twixt Christian Princes; And good reason hee hath to pray so, for the greatest armes hee ever usd against them were their owne divisions . Nor is Druinas Monarch destitute of prudent and strenuous Counsell, though he need it not so much, for he can see better without spectacles; Nor is his favour like that of the Vine, and Olive's ingrossd all by one, but every one of his prime independent Ministers is his Favourite within the bounds of his own Office; Hee hath an Intelligence to every spheare, amongst whom he diffuseth his beames, according as they shall move in a regular motion every one in his owne Orbe, and stand subordinate to him their primus Motor; And indeed, as the systeme and symphony of musicke is not made by one or two, but diversity of strings and notes, so politicall harmony consists in the correspondence of the greatest Ministers, and their unanimous resolution after some conflict of opinions, for as fire breaks out of flint by concussion, so wisdome and truth issueth out of the agitation of argument . Tamisond never flourished more with building and bullion, and bravery of all things. Her great Sanctuary, the greatest take all dimensions together, of any in the Europ aean world, which by the iron teeth of time and injury of the meteors had so mouldred away, that she was upon point of being reducd to her first principles, a confusd Chaos of stone and rubbish, is like to looke as youthfull as ever she did; When the Eagle built his nest, every bird brought in a feather; And certainely a good spirit cannot dwell in him, who grumbles to send a stone towards the bearing up of the House of the Almighty . Nor doth Tamisond encrease this way by houses, Palaces or streets onely, but she hath a whole new Towne reard up lately to enlarge her skirts; And whereas before, her walls were of light combustible matter, they are now of a new solid structure and stuffe. Though some would thinke, that in regard she drawes on in this kind so much to the West, she is towards her declining times; and they ground this augury upon the height of bravery and profusenesse shee is come to, which commonly bring with them, luxury and softnesse, and they have beene alwaies observed to be symptomes of a waining state . For navall strength, since Druina sate in Thetis lap, and had her white cliffs washd with her waves, she was never so well appointed; Not long since, the world thought shee had beene fallen to so low an ebbe, that she was not able to set out a fleet Royall to Sea, which made some so insult over her, that they questiond her Soveraignty, yea in her owne waves; But lately shee hath appeard like her selfe, and put them all to silence, unbeguiling the world of this erroneous opinion. The late moving Castle she hath built, hath already purchasd such renowne; that it is confessd by all her neighbours, there never sloated the like upon salt waters. She hath restord a Forren Emperour to his right; And it is the duty of Soveraigne Princes, to see wrong vindicated, and right take place though amongst Barbarians being sought unto: And besides the glory of that action, there is a speciall benefit accrues thereby to Druina, for that nest of base ravenous birds which so much impeachd her commerce is pulld down, and many of her own plants, who languished in that hot scorching soylein most miserable slavery, brought home. They cannot therefore have their hearts well planted in them, who repine at such contributions which the sages of the law have once avouched legall, since they daylie see such necessary and glorious effects thereof; And the (legall) leavies the Soveraigne raysers of the subject, are as vapours which the sunne exhales up into the middle Region (the wombe of the Meteors) which fall downe afterwards in sweet silver showres to fructifie the earth . The golden chaine of policy hath beene alwayes held to be, That the defense of a kingdome is the office of the Prince, the honour of the Peeres, the service of the Souldier, and the charge of the subject, for Qui sentit commodum, sentire debet  & on us. Adde hereunto, that alleageance is an act of reciprocation; as it bindes the King to protect, so it ties the subject to contribute, and by this correspondence there is a quid pro quo. But as in Druina , so in all other Forrests, it is usuall for the Poplars to clash their branches, and still make a noise at the present times and soloecismes, in government, though they know neither the disease, nor the remedy. They think to discerne the least moat in the body politicke, building certaine fantasticke formes of ruling, and soothing their shallow imaginations, that they could set the state in such frames, the particular application whereof would prove absurd and grosse impertinencies. Touching eminent or imminent danger, though there be some Arcana Imperii in every state, which the Soveraigne and his sages should onely know and not disperse amongst the vulgar, It was apparently visible, how the fairest flower of Druinas diademe, the dominion of the Seas was aymd at, and like to be pluckd off, was it not high time then for her to rigge her vessels, and put her selfe upon an extraordinary gard? Moreover they are far wide who think Druina can joyne security and peace together, as long as the Olive with the Cedar and the Vine are up in actuall armes by Sea and Land hard before her, for a peace may bee clapd up betweene them with that suddennesse, that some of those forces which are now in motion may inexpectedly fall upon her skirts. Touching Ampelona some have beene over-heard to say that the late invasion upon her Islands for reliefe of Petrina stickes still in her stomacke but halfe disgested, thinking she hath not repaird her honour to the height, nor taken equall revenge according to the rules of retaliation, by that successefull repulse only. And for Elaiana some hold (though I do not) never yet made hearty peace with any Eusebian Prince, and the peace she makes proceeds either from disability or unseasonablenes to hurt. And since she holds the Canons of the last great Counsell (whither t'was said the holy Ghost was usd to be sent in cloake-bagges from Petropolis ) in so much reverence and authority as the sacred Oracles themselves which were immediately inspird from heaven, of which Canons one was, that H aereticis (meaning the Eusebians) non est tenenda fides; since I say that Elaiana stands so readily appointed and so neare, it would very ill become the policy of Druina, to let her vessels lye rotting upon the Carine, and not to be ready upon a preventive gard, least she re-incurre that aspersion which in former ages stuck fowlly to her, which was to be wise, a posteriori, after the blow was given, when Hannibal is Ante Portas. And now that all the neighbouring Forrests, which had been formerly shaken, and riven with the thunderbolts of war, did admire and envie the sweete peace and serenity of Druina, her Royall Oke being onely  \------Medijs tranquillus in undis; Behold an unhappy mist did rise in the North in Cardenia, (and Cardenia is knowne to bee much subject to mists .) Some say Cardenia hath the same quarrell to her Soveraigne, that she hath to the Sun for dwelling too far distant from them: but it was discovered that this cloud was engendred of the exhalations of divers discontented spirits, specially some of the great ones, who did suscitat the inferior sort of Flamins, that depended upon them for their subsistence to vent seditious doctrine against the Hierarchy, and chiefest governours in holy things, fearing that by a post-liminous way something should bee re-annexd both to Church and Crowne, which had alwayes beene possessd by by them time out of mind. These obstreperous Sermocinators (who in Cardenia sway as much, if not more, upon the conscience then the Loyalists else where doe) make easie impressions upon the minds of the vulgar, specially the femalls who first broak out into acts of violence, so that it may be said this sedition came in, as sin did first into the world by the female sexe, who relying upon the immunity of their kinde, did many unbefitting and strange barbarisms, little tending to the honour of Cardenia, And with these the meaner sort of mechanikes concurd, and at last the tallest Elmes appeard, so that the whole Forrest was in a fearefull combustion, and the Bels every where rung backward, the Regalia seizd upon, and government thrust quite of the hinges . A strange league is made without consent of royall Majesty, point blank against the lawes of Cardenia, and nothing will serve their turne but the utter extinguishing of the greatest Luminaries of the Church, and the abjuration of whatsoever the late royall Oke (who they glory to have bin the most religious and learnedst Prince that ever wore Diademe) had done in point of ecclesiasticall government. The meaner sort of the dispensers of sacred Oracles (who of all other, were the greatest monsters of ingratitude to their Soveraigne (who had found out a way not long before to augment and ascertaine their stipends, and free them from that servile kinde of clientele they stood in to the seculars) in lieu of pious documents and wholesome doctrines tamper chiefly with matters of state, and out of a fanatique zeale minister more fuell to encrease the flames; they cryed out that the ready way to return to Petropolis, was, to passe by Druina ; that her forme of publike prayer (though they acknowledge the first Compilers thereof to bee glorious Martyrs) was meere Idolatry. This little tended to the honour of Cardenia, for all her neighbours cryed out against her, that shee should cast such a brand upon the Eusebian Religion, as to loose all respects of passive obedience, if need had bin, ( for subjects should be willowes, and not Okes ) and to stand in open defiance and armes against their naturall liege Lord; And where people runne together and joyne in armes (bee it for defence or offence) without a Soveraigne head, I know what terme it deserves, all the world over. The sages of Druina consult how to quench these flams. Some were of opinion, that, all the while they broak not out into incursions by land, or depredations at Sea, nor tooke in forren force, nor did any externe act of violence; it was not dishonourable for Druina, to look on a while, yet pinch them in commerce every way, and to be sure to keep them at the staves end. Bombycina hath a saying, That the Prince, who upon every commotion of the subject, rusheth presently into open war, is like him who sets his owne house a fire to roast his egges . Kings have many wayes to meet with their people, besides effusion of bloud, and profusion of treasure, they have long reaches.  Non nost longas Regibus esse manus? Nor is Phlebotomy, in the body politicke, as well as the naturall, prescrib'd for all diseases . Some of the wisest Emperours have gone to worke with mutinous subjects by cunctation, as the Sun did to take away the passengers cleake, not as the ruffling wind, for Royall Maiesty like the Sun hath her rayes also, which dazzleth the eyes of disloyalty, and glancing upon rebellion, makes it melt to nothing, like a Gorgons head, or a Beare reard up of snow . But it hath beene the fate of the best and potentst Monarches to have water throwne sometimes into their Wine by tumultuous subjects, witnesse the Vine, and the OLIVE hard by. But I trust Cardenia will not be so ingratefull to Druina, as to receive Plummes from her so many yeares, and now to throw the stones at her. The Thistle I hope will not offer to clash against the Soveraigne Rose, considering the multiplicity of advantages she hath by her. And the single Lion (though rampant) will be better advisd then set himselfe against three, considering how often he hath felt their pawes: A good instrument may (by some ill favourd accident) bee out of tune, but being put in againe, the musicke will be as good as ever, I hope Cardenia will prove so . And now will I put a period to this parley, this Iargon of Trees, for I can find them no further matter of discourse, unlesse I should make them to prophecy, and so out-runne their Epoch . Many more things could have beene couchd here (as a discerning Reader may well perceive) which I leave to future ages, and transmit to the post-Nati, when the times shall be enfranchizd, and posterity manumitted: For there be some Historicall truths, which are like the Medlar not ripe enough (to be written) till they be rotten: Nor was this shadow of Trees darke enough for them, it being my intention at first not to pursue or presse this allegory so farre as to inslave my matter unto it, and so put it in a kinde of stockes, but that I did obtaine leave of my selfe sometimes by obvious and easie expressions to comply with the Readers capacity; Otherwise hee might have thought it to have beene some senselesse phantasticke Romance, which might have brought him to that passe, that he could not have beene able as hee went along to have seene the Wood for Trees; No, it will appeare that I labour to bring him often into the Plaines, and that I was very carefull to shunne the bogs, for they are dangerous, and there is no state without them . Wherefore I hope this knotty ill twisted peece, will passe current without exception, offence or calumny; and that my impartiall dealing will serve for a Pale to fence out the Goats from my Forrest, though I must confesse there may some few criticismes or graines of browne salt, and small dashes of vineger be found here and there, to make the discourse more sapid, but this tartnesse is farre from any gall or uenome, wherewith the pages of some Moderne Authors of our next transmarin neighbours do usually swell, and are yet exposd to vent by publicke authority though they writ flat and plaine without any disguise at all; I presume you have tasted no such bitternesse here, albeit I might have done it with more priviledge and good manners, writing under types . No; you shall find no blacke satyres range in my woods; if there bee any, they are white harmelesse ones, and drawing neere to the nature of Fayries. late shall bee, that the high Majesty which is here meant by the Oke, may in vigor, and strength of constitution (if it bee within the possibility of nature) attaine unto the age of the Oke, which is observd to exceed all other terrestriall creatures in long aevity. May he be to his enemies as the Oke is to the Olive, which as the Arbolists observe, shrinkes away to nothing, if he be but neere the roots of the Oke; may Honour set up her stand in him, and victory her tent under his branches; may he bee like that blessed Tree planted on the waters side (as he is already surrounded and strengthened with waters) which brings forth her fruit in due season, whose leafe fadeth not, and prospereth in all his undertakings . Long may his fruitfull Vine infolliat and clasp about him with embracements of Princely love, that their soules may transmigrat into each other: Long may the dew of heaven distill upon them, to make them bourgeon and propagat amongst themselves, untill they bee encircled with a large row of young gemmes, and cions of their owne royall stocke, which to the fulnesse of earthly contentment, they may see shoot up and germinat, and ingrafted also upon other Princely scutcheons and shields, and so grow ripe to succeed them here, when they shall be transplanted to the celestiall Paradise, to become true Ierusalem Okes, to flourish there for ever with the Tree of life, and behold him who troad the VVine prsse, and once suffered upon a Tree, to purchase for them, that shall bee truly ingrafted into him here, Palmes of Victory, and immarcessible ghirlands of glory and triumph to all eternity.
