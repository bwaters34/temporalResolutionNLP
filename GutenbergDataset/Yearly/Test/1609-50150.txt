 Caret symbols indicate superscript text.
 Small capitals have been converted to ALL CAPITALS.
 Old or archaic spellings have been preserved.
 In the text of the actual play, lowercase âsâ has been replaced by
   the âlong sâ, âÅ¿â. The capital letter âWâ is often replaced with
   âVVâ, the letter âvâ and the letter âuâ are used interchangeably,
   and the letters "i" and "j" are also used interchangeably.
 Many of the characters names in the play have various spellings,
   e.g.,    MERE-CRAFT and MERECRAFT, MEERECRAFT
              EVER-ILL and EVERILL
         FITZ-DOTTEREL and FITZDOTTEREL

                 DIVEL and DIVELL.
 The footnotes in the actual play were added by the author as part of
   his thesis. The references for these footnotes are the line numbers.
   Since each scene begins the line numbers over at 1, these footnotes
   have been collected at the end of each scene, and refer to the
   appropriate line in the preceding scene.

PREFACE


In _The Devil is an Ass_ Jonson may be studied, first, as a student;
secondly, as an observer. Separated by only two years from the
preceding play, _Bartholomew Fair_, and by nine from the following,
_The Staple of News_, the present play marks the close of an epoch in
the poetâs life, the period of his vigorous maturity. Its relations
with the plays of his earlier periods are therefore of especial
interest.

The results of the present editorâs study of these and other
literary connections are presented, partly in the Notes, and partly
in the Introduction to this book. After the discussion of the
purely technical problems in Sections A and B, the larger features
are taken up in Section C, I and II. These involve a study of the
authorâs indebtedness to English, Italian, and classical sources, and
especially to the early English drama; as well as of his own dramatic
methods in previous plays. The more minute relations to contemporary
dramatists and to his own former work, especially in regard to
current words and phrases, are dealt with in the Notes.

As an observer, Jonson appears as a student of London, and a satirist
of its manners and vices; and, in a broader way, as a critic of
contemporary England. The life and aspect of London are treated, for
the most part, in the Notes; the issues of state involved in Jonsonâs
satire are presented in historical discussions in Section C, III.
Personal satire is treated in the division following.

I desire to express my sincere thanks to Professor Albert S. Cook
for advice in matters of form and for inspiration in the work; to
Professor Henry A. Beers for painstaking discussion of difficult
questions; to Dr. De Winter for help and criticism; to Dr. John M.
Berdan for the privilege of consulting his copy of the Folio; to
Mr. Andrew Keogh and to Mr. Henry A. Gruener, for aid in bibliographical
matters; and to Professor George L. Burr for the loan of books from
the Cornell Library.

A portion of the expense of printing this book has been borne by the
Modern Language Club of Yale University from funds placed at its
disposal by the generosity of Mr. George E. Dimock of Elizabeth,
New Jersey, a graduate of Yale in the Class of 1874.

INTRODUCTION


A. EDITIONS OF THE TEXT


_The Devil is an Ass_ was first printed in 1631, and was probably put
into circulation at that time, either as a separate pamphlet or bound
with _Bartholomew Fair_ and _The Staple of News_. Copies of this
original edition were, in 1640-1, bound into the second volume of the
First Folio of Jonsonâs collected works.[1] In 1641 a variant reprint
edition of _The Devil is an Ass_, apparently small, was issued
in pamphlet form. The play reappears in all subsequent collected
editions. These are: (1) the âThird Folioâ, 1692; (2) a booksellerâs
edition, 1716 [1717]; (3) Whalleyâs edition, 1756; (4) John
Stockdaleâs reprint of Whalleyâs edition (together with the works
of Beaumont and Fletcher), 1811; (5) Giffordâs edition, 1816; (6)
Barry Cornwallâs one-volume edition, 1838; (7) Lieut. Col. Francis
Cunninghamâs three-volume reissue (with some minor variations) of
Giffordâs edition, 1871; (8) another reissue by Cunningham, in
nine volumes (with additional notes), 1875. The _Catalogue_ of the
British Museum shows that Jonsonâs works were printed in two volumes
at Dublin in 1729. Of these editions only the first two call for
detailed description, and of the others only the first, second,
third, fifth, and eighth will be discussed.

=1631.= Owing to irregularity in contents and arrangement in
different copies, the second volume of the First Folio has been
much discussed. Gifford speaks of it as the edition of 1631-41.[2]
Miss Bates, copying from Lowndes, gives it as belonging to 1631,
reprinted in 1640 and in 1641.[3] Ward says substantially the
same thing.[4] In 1870, however, Brinsley Nicholson, by a careful
collation,[5] arrived at the following results. (1) The so-called
editions of the second volume assigned to 1631, 1640, and 1641 form
only a single edition. (2) The belief in the existence of âthe
so-called first edition of the second volume in 1631â is due to the
dates prefixed to the opening plays. (3) The belief in the existence
of the volume of 1641 arose from the dates of _Mortimer_ and the
_Discoveries_, âall the copies of which are dated 1641â, and of
the variant edition of _The Devil is an Ass_, which will next be
described. (4) The 1640 edition supplies for some copies a general
title-page, âR. Meighen, 1640â, but the plays printed in 1631 are
reprinted from the same forms. Hazlitt arrives at practically the
same conclusions.[6]

The volume is a folio by measurement, but the signatures
are in fours.

Collation: Five leaves, the second with the signature A_3 B-M in
fours. Aa-Bb; Cc-Cc_2 (two leaves); C_3 (one leaf); one leaf; D-I in
fours; two leaves. [N]-Y in fours; B-Q in fours; R (two leaves); S-X
in fours; Y (two leaves); Z-Oo in fours. Pp (two leaves). Qq; A-K in
fours. L (two leaves). [M]-R in fours. A-P in fours. Q (two leaves).
[R]-V in fours.

The volume opens with _Bartholomew Fayre_, which occupies pages
[1-10], 1-88 (pages 12, 13, and 31 misnumbered), or the first group
of signatures given above.

2. _The Staple of Newes_, paged independently, [1]-[76]
(pages 19, 22, and 63 misnumbered), and signatured independently
as in the second group above.

3. _The Diuell is an Asse_, [N]-Y, paged [91]-170 (pages 99, 132,
and 137 misnumbered). [N] recto contains the title page (verso blank).
N_2 contains a vignette and the persons of the play on the recto, a
vignette and the prologue on the verso. N_3 to the end contains the
play proper; the epilogue being on the last leaf verso.

One leaf (pages 89-90) is thus unaccounted for; but it is evident
from the signatures and pagination that _The Diuell is an Asse_ was
printed with a view to having it follow _Bartholomew Fayre_. These
three plays were all printed by I. B. for Robert Allot in 1631.
Hazlitt says that they are often found together in a separate volume,
and that they were probably intended by Jonson to supplement the
folio of 1616.[7]

Collation made from copy in the library of Yale University at
New Haven.

It was the opinion of both Whalley and Gifford that the publication
of _The Devil is an Ass_ in 1631 was made without the personal
supervision of the author. Gifford did not believe that Jonson
âconcerned himself with the revision of the folio, ... or, indeed,
ever saw itâ. The letter to the Earl of Newcastle (_Harl. MS._ 4955),
quoted in Giffordâs memoir, sufficiently disproves this supposition,
at least so far as _Bartholomew Fair_ and _The Devil is an Ass_
are concerned. In this letter, written according to Gifford about 1632,
Jonson says: âIt is the lewd printerâs fault that I can send your
lordship no more of my book. I sent you one piece before, The Fair,
... and now I send you this other morsel, The fine gentleman that
walks the town, The Fiend; but before he will perfect the rest I fear
he will come himself to be a part under the title of The Absolute
Knave, which he hath played with meâ. In 1870 Brinsley Nicholson
quoted this letter in _Notes and Queries_ (4th S. 5. 574), and
pointed out that the jocular allusions are evidently to _Bartholomew
Fair_ and _The Devil is an Ass_.

Although Gifford is to some extent justified in his contempt for the
edition, it is on the whole fairly correct.

The misprints are not numerous. The play is overpunctuated.
Thus the words ânowâ and âagainâ are usually marked off by
commas. Occasionally the punctuation is misleading. The mark of
interrogation is generally, but not invariably, used for that of
exclamation. The apostrophe is often a metrical device, and indicates
the blending of two words without actual elision of either. The most
serious defect is perhaps the wrong assignment of speeches, though
later emendations are to be accepted only with caution. The present
text aims to be an exact reproduction of that of the 1631 edition.

1641. The pamphlet quarto of 1641 is merely a poor reprint of the
1631 edition. It abounds in printerâs errors. Few if any intentional
changes, even of spelling and punctuation, are introduced. Little
intelligence is shown by the printer, as in the change 5. I. 34 SN.
(references are to act, scene, and line) He flags] He stags. It is
however of some slight importance, inasmuch as it seems to have been
followed in some instances by succeeding editions (cf. the omission
of the side notes 2. I. 20, 22, 33, followed by 1692, 1716, and W;
also 2. I. 46 his] a 1641, f.).

The title-page of this edition is copied, as far as the quotation
from Horace, from the title-page of the 1631 edition. For the
wood-cut of that edition, however, is substituted the device of a
swan, with the legend âGod is my helperâ. Then follow the words:
âImprinted at London, 1641.â

Folio by measurement; signatures in fours.

Collation: one leaf, containing the title-page on the recto, verso
blank; second leaf with signature A_2 (?), containing a device (St.
Francis preaching to the birds [?]), and the persons of the play on
the recto, and a device (a saint pointing to heaven and hell) and the
prologue on the verso. Then the play proper; B-I in fours; K (one
leaf). The first two leaves are unnumbered; then 1-66 (35 wrongly
numbered 39).

1692. The edition of 1692[8] is a reprint of 1631, but furnishes
evidence of some editing. Most of the nouns are capitalized, and
a change of speaker is indicated by breaking the lines; obvious
misprints are corrected: e. g., 1. 1. 98, 101; the spelling is
modernized: e. g., 1. 1. 140 Tiborne] Tyburn; and the punctuation is
improved. Sometimes a word undergoes a considerable morphological
change: e. g., 1. 1. 67 Belins-gate] Billings-gate; 1. 6. 172, 175
venter] venture. Etymology is sometimes indicated by an apostrophe,
not always correctly: e. g., 2. 6. 75 salts] âsalts. Several changes
are uniform throughout the edition, and have been followed by all
later editors. The chief of these are: inough] enough; tother]
tâother; coozen] cozen; haâs] has; then] than; âhem] âem (except G
sometimes); injoy] enjoy. Several changes of wording occur: e.g., 2.
1. 53 an] my; etc.

1716. The edition of 1716 is a booksellerâs reprint of 1692. It
follows that edition in the capitalization of nouns, the breaking up
of the lines, and usually in the punctuation. In 2. 1. 78-80 over two
lines are omitted by both editions. Independent editing, however, is
not altogether lacking. We find occasional new elisions: e. g., 1.
6. 121 Iâhave] Iâve; at least one change of wording: 2. 3. 25 where]
were; and one in the order of words: 4. 2. 22 not love] love not. In
4. 4. 75-76 and 76-78 it corrects two wrong assignments of speeches.
A regular change followed by all editors is wiues] wifeâs.

1756. The edition of Peter Whalley, 1756, purports to be âcollated
with all the former editions, and correctedâ, but according to
modern standards it cannot be called a critical text. Not only
does it follow 1716 in modernization of spelling; alteration of
contractions: e. g., 2. 8. 69 Toâa] Tâa; 3. 1. 20 In tâone] Intâ one;
and changes in wording: e. g., 1. 1. 24 strengths] strength: 3. 6.
26 Gentleman] Gentlewoman; but it is evident that Whalley considered
the 1716 edition as the correct standard for a critical text, and
made his correction by a process of occasional restoration of the
original reading. Thus in restoring âCraneâ, 1. 4. 50, he uses the
expression,--âwhich is authorized by the folio of 1640.â Again in 2.
1. 124 he retains âpettyâ from 1716, although he says: âThe edit.
of 1640, as I think more justly,--_Some_ pretty _principality_.â
This reverence for the 1716 text is inexplicable. In the matter of
capitalization Whalley forsakes his model, and he makes emendations
of his own with considerable freedom. He still further modernizes the
spelling; he spells out elided words: e. g., 1. 3. 15 Hâ has] he has;
makes new elisions: e. g., 1. 6. 143 Yoâ are] Youâre; 1. 6. 211 I am]
Iâm; grammatical changes, sometimes of doubtful correctness: e. g.,
1. 3. 21 Iâle] Iâd; morphological changes: e. g., 1. 6. 121 To scape]
Tâescape; metrical changes by insertions: e. g., 1. 1. 48 âtoâ; 4. 7.
38 âbut nowâ; changes of wording: e. g., 1. 6. 195 sad] said; in the
order of words: e. g., 3. 4. 59 is hee] he is; and in the assignment
of speeches: e. g., 3. 6. 61. Several printerâs errors occur: e. g.,
2. 6. 21 and 24.

1816. William Giffordâs edition is more carefully printed than
that of Whalley, whom he criticizes freely. In many indefensible
changes, however, he follows his predecessor, even to the insertion
of words in 1. 1. 48 and 4. 7. 38, 39 (see above). He makes further
morphological changes, even when involving a change of metre: e.g.,
1. 1. 11 Totnam] Tottenham; 1. 4. 88 phantsie] phantasie; makes new
elisions: e. g., 1. 6. 226 I haâ] Iâve; changes in wording: e. g.,
2. 1. 97 Oâ] O!; and in assignment of speeches: e. g., 4. 4. 17. He
usually omits parentheses, and the following changes in contracted
words occur, only exceptions being noted in the variants: froâ]
from; giâ] give; hâ] he; haâ] have; âhem] them (but often âem); iâ]
in; oâ] on, of; tâ] to; thâ] the; upoâ] upon; wiâ] with, will; yoâ]
you. Giffordâs greatest changes are in the stage directions and
side notes of the 1631 edition. The latter he considered as of âthe
most trite and trifling natureâ, and âa worthless incumbranceâ. He
accordingly cut or omitted with the utmost freedom, introducing new
and elaborate stage directions of his own. He reduced the number of
scenes from thirty-six to seventeen. In this, as Hathaway points out,
he followed the regular English usage, dividing the scenes according
to actual changes of place. Jonson adhered to classical tradition,
and looked upon a scene as a situation. Gifford made his alterations
by combining whole scenes, except in the case of Act 2. 3, which
begins at Folio Act 2. 7. 23 (middle of line); of Act 3. 2, which
begins at Folio Act 3. 5. 65 and of Act 3. 3, which begins at Folio
Act 3. 5. 78 (middle of line). He considered himself justified in
his mutilation of the side notes on the ground that they were not
from the hand of Jonson. Evidence has already been adduced to show
that they were at any rate printed with his sanction. I am, however,
inclined to believe with Gifford that they were written by another
hand. Giffordâs criticism of them is to a large extent just. The note
on â_Niaise_â, 1. 6. 18, is of especially doubtful value (see note).

1875. âCunninghamâs reissue, 1875, reprints Giffordâs text without
change. Cunningham, however, frequently expresses his disapproval of
Giffordâs licence in changing the textâ (Winter).

this volume in 1640 is sometimes called the Second Folio. It should
not be confused with the 1631-41 Edition of the second volume.

B. DATE AND PRESENTATION

We learn from the title-page that this comedy was acted
in 1616 by the Kingâs Majestyâs Servants. This is further
confirmed by a passage in 1. 1. 80-81:

          Now? As Vice stands this present yeere? Remember,
          What number it is. _Six hundred_ and _sixteene_.

Another passage (1. 6. 31) tells us that the performance
took place in the Blackfriars Theatre:

          Today, I goe to the _Black-fryers Play-house_.

That Fitzdottrel is to see _The Devil is an Ass_ we learn later
(3. 5. 38). The performance was to take place after dinner (3. 5. 34).

At this time the Kingâs Men were in possession of two theatres,
the Globe and the Blackfriars. The former was used in the summer,
so that _The Devil is an Ass_ was evidently not performed during
that season.[9] These are all the facts that we can determine with
certainty.

Jonsonâs masque, _The Golden Age Restored_, was presented, according
to Fleay, on January 1 and 6. His next masque was _Christmas, his
Masque_, December 25, 1616. Between these dates he must have been
busy on _The Devil is an Ass_. Fleay, who identifies Fitzdottrel
with Coke, conjectures that the date of the play is probably late in
1616, after Cokeâs discharge in November. If Coke is satirized either
in the person of Fitzdottrel or in that of Justice Eitherside (see
Introduction, pp. lxx, lxxii), the conjecture may be allowed to have
some weight.

In 1. 2. 1 Fitzdottrel speaks of Bretnor as occupying the position
once held by the conspirators in the Overbury case. Franklin, who
is mentioned, was not brought to trial until November 18, 1615.
Jonson does not speak of the trial as of a contemporary or nearly
contemporary event.

Act 4 is largely devoted to a satire of Spanish fashions. In 4. 2. 71
there is a possible allusion to the Infanta Maria, for whose marriage
with Prince Charles secret negotiations were being carried on at this
time. We learn that Commissioners were sent to Spain on November
9 (_Cal. State Papers, Dom. Ser._), and from a letter of January
1, 1617, that âthe Spanish tongue, dress, etc. are all in fashionâ
(_ibid._).

These indications are all of slight importance, but from their united
evidence we may feel reasonably secure in assigning the date of
presentation to late November or early December, 1616.

The play was not printed until 1631. It seems never to have been
popular, but was revived after the Restoration, and is given by
Downes[10] in the list of old plays acted in the New Theatre in Drury
Lane after April 8, 1663. He continues: âThese being Old Plays,
were Acted but now and then; yet being well Performâd were very
Satisfactory to the Townâ. The other plays of Jonson revived by this
company were _The Fox_, _The Alchemist_, _Epicoene_, _Catiline_,
_Every Man out of his Humor_, _Every Man in his Humor_, and
_Sejanus_. Genest gives us no information of any later revival.

C. THE DEVIL IS AN ASS

Jonsonâs characteristic conception of comedy as a vehicle for the
study of âhumorsâ passed in _Every Man out of his Humor_ into
caricature, and in _Cynthiaâs Revels_ and _Poetaster_ into allegory.
The process was perfectly natural. In the humor study each character
is represented as absorbed by a single vice or folly. In the
allegorical treatment the abstraction is the starting-point, and the
human element the means of interpretation. Either type of drama, by
a shifting of emphasis, may readily pass over into the other. The
failure of _Cynthiaâs Revels_, in spite of the poetâs arrogant boast
at its close, had an important effect upon his development, and the
plays of Jonsonâs middle period, from _Sejanus_ to _The Devil is an
Ass_, show more restraint in the handling of character, as well as
far greater care in construction. The figures are typical rather than
allegorical, and the plot in general centres about certain definite
objects of satire. Both plot and characterization are more closely
unified.

_The Devil is an Ass_ marks a return to the supernatural and
allegorical. The main action, however, belongs strictly to the type
of the later drama, especially as exemplified by _The Alchemist_.
The fanciful motive of the infernal visitant to earth was found to
be of too slight texture for Jonsonâs sternly moral and satirical
purpose. In the development of the drama it breaks down completely,
and is crowded out by the realistic plot. Thus what promised at first
to be the chief, and remains in some respects the happiest, motive
of the play comes in the final execution to be little better than
an inartistic and inharmonious excrescence. Yet Jonsonâs words to
Drummond seem to indicate that he still looked upon it as the real
kernel of the play.[11]

The action is thus easily divisible into two main lines; the
devil-plot, involving the fortunes of Satan, Pug and Iniquity, and
the satirical or main plot. This division is the more satisfactory,
since Satan and Iniquity are not once brought into contact with the
chief actors, while Pugâs connection with them is wholly external,
and affects only his own fortunes. He is, as Herford has already
pointed out, merely âthe fly upon the engine-wheel, fortunate to
escape with a bruisingâ (_Studies_, p. 320). He forms, however, the
connecting link between the two plots, and his function in the drama
must be regarded from two different points of view, according as it
shares in the realistic or the supernatural element.

I. THE DEVIL-PLOT


Jonsonâs title, _The Devil is an Ass_, expresses with perfect adequacy
the familiarity and contempt with which this once terrible personage
had come to be regarded in the later Elizabethan period. The poet, of
course, is deliberately archaizing, and the figures of devil and Vice
are made largely conformable to the purposes of satire. Several years
before, in the Dedication to _The Fox_,[12] Jonson had expressed his
contempt for the introduction of âfools and devils and those antique
relics of barbarismâ, characterizing them as âridiculous and exploded
folliesâ. He treats the same subject with biting satire in _The Staple
of News_.[13] Yet with all his devotion to realism in matters of petty
detail, of local color, and of contemporary allusion, he was, as we
have seen, not without an inclination toward allegory. Thus in _Every
Man out of his Humor_ the figure of Macilente is very close to a purely
allegorical expression of envy. In _Cynthiaâs Revels_ the process was
perfectly conscious, for in the Induction to that play the characters
are spoken of as Virtues and Vices. In _Poetaster_ again we have the
purging of Demetrius and Crispinus. Jonsonâs return to this field
in _The Devil is an Ass_ is largely prophetic of the future course
of his drama. The allegory of _The Staple of News_ is more closely
woven into the texture of the play than is that of _The Devil is an
Ass_; and the conception of Pecunia and her retinue is worked out with
much elaboration. In the Second Intermean the purpose of this play is
explained as a refinement of method in the use of allegory. For the old
Vice with his wooden dagger to snap at everybody he met, or Iniquity,
appareled âlike Hokos Pokos, in a jugglerâs jerkinâ, he substitutes
âvices male and femaleâ, âattired like men and women of the timeâ. This
of course is only a more philosophical and abstract statement of the
idea which he expresses in _The Devil is an Ass_ (1. 1. 120 f.) of a
world where the vices are not distinguishable by any outward sign from
the virtues:

    They weare the same clothes, eate the same meate,
    Sleep iâ the self-same beds, ride iâ those coaches.
    Or very like, foure horses in a coach,
    As the best men and women.

_The New Inn_ and _The Magnetic Lady_ are also penetrated
with allegory of a sporadic and trivial nature. Jonsonâs
use of devil and Vice in the present play is threefold. It
is in part earnestly allegorical, especially in Satanâs long
speech in the first scene; it is in part a satire upon the
employment of what he regarded as barbarous devices; and
it is, to no small extent, itself a resort for the sake of comic
effect to the very devices which he ridiculed.

Jonsonâs conception of the devil was naturally very far from mediÃ¦val,
and he relied for the effectiveness of his portrait upon current
disbelief in this conception. Yet mediÃ¦valism had not wholly died out,
and remnants of the morality-play are to be found in many plays of
the Elizabethan and Jacobean drama. Rev. John Upton, in his _Critical
Observations on Shakespeare_, 1746, was the first to point out the
historical connection between Jonsonâs Vice and devils and those of
the pre-Shakespearian drama. In modern times the history of the devil
and the Vice as dramatic figures has been thoroughly investigated, the
latest works being those of Dr. L.W. Cushman and Dr. E. Eckhardt,
at whose hands the subject has received exhaustive treatment. The
connection with Machiavelliâs novella of _Belfagor_ was pointed out
by Count Baudissin,[14] _Ben Jonson und seine Schule_, Leipzig 1836,
and has been worked out exhaustively by Dr. E. Hollstein in a Halle
dissertation, 1901. Dr. C.H. Herford, however, had already suggested
that the chief source of the devil-plot was to be found in the legend
of Friar Rush.

[12] _Wks._ 3. 158.

[13] _Wks._ 5. 105 f. Cf. also Shirley, Prologue to _The Doubtful Heir_.

[14] Count Baudissin translated two of Jonsonâs comedies into German,
     _The Alchemist_ and _The Devil is an Ass_ (_Der Dumme Teufel_).


1. _The Devil in the pre-Shakespearian Drama_

The sources for the conception of the devil in the mediÃ¦val drama
are to be sought in a large body of non-dramatic literature. In this
literature the devil was conceived of as a fallen angel, the enemy of
God and his hierarchy, and the champion of evil. As such he makes his
appearance in the mystery-plays. The mysteries derived their subjects
from Bible history, showed comparatively little pliancy, and dealt
always with serious themes. In them the devil is with few exceptions a
serious figure. Occasionally, however, even at this early date, comedy
and satire find place. The most prominent example is the figure of
Titivillus in the Towneley cycle.

In the early moralities the devil is still of primary importance, and
is always serious. But as the Vice became a more and more prominent
figure, the devil became less and less so, and in the later drama his
part is always subordinate. The play of _Nature_ (c. 1500) is the first
morality without a devil. Out of fifteen moralities of later date
tabulated by Cushman, only four are provided with this character.

The degeneration of the devil as a dramatic figure was inevitable. His
grotesque appearance, at first calculated to inspire terror, by its
very exaggeration produced, when once familiar, a wholly comic effect.
When the active comic parts were assumed by the Vice, he became a mere
butt, and finally disappears.

One of the earliest comic figures in the religious drama
is that of the clumsy or uncouth servant.[15] Closely allied
to him is the under-devil, who appears as early as _The
Harrowing of Hell_, and this figure is constantly employed
as a comic personage in the later drama.[16] The figure of
the servant later developed into that of the clown, and in
this type the character of the devil finally merged.[17]

[15] Eckhardt, p. 42 f.]

[16] _Ibid._, p. 67 f.]

[17] In general the devil is more closely related to the
clown, and the Vice to the fool. In some cases, however, the devil
is to be identified with the fool, and the Vice with the clown.


2. _Jonsonâs Treatment of the Devil_

In the present play the devil-type is represented by the arch-fiend
Satan and his stupid subordinate, Pug. Of these two Satan received
more of the formal conventional elements of the older drama, while Pug
for the most part represents the later or clownish figure. As in the
morality-play Satanâs chief function is the instruction of his emissary
of evil. In no scene does he come into contact with human beings, and
he is always jealously careful for the best interests of his state. In
addition Jonson employs one purely conventional attribute belonging to
the tradition of the church- and morality-plays. This is the cry of
âHo, ho!â, with which Satan makes his entrance upon the stage in the
first scene.[18] Other expressions of emotion were also used, but âHo,
ho!â came in later days to be recognized as the conventional cry of the
fiend upon making his entrance.[19]

How the character of Satan was to be represented is of course
impossible to determine. The devil in the pre-Shakespearian drama was
always a grotesque figure, often provided with the head of a beast and
a cowâs tail.[20] In the presentation of Jonsonâs play the ancient
tradition was probably followed. Satanâs speeches, however, are not
undignified, and too great grotesqueness of costume must have resulted
in considerable incongruity.

In the figure of Pug few of the formal elements of the
pre-Shakespearian devil are exhibited. He remains, of course, the
ostensible champion of evil, but is far surpassed by his earthly
associates, both in malice and in intellect. In personal appearance he
is brought by the assumption of the body and dress of a human being
into harmony with his environment. A single conventional episode,
with a reversal of the customary proceeding, is retained from the
morality-play. While Pug is languishing in prison, Iniquity appears,
Pug mounts upon his back, and is carried off to hell. Iniquity comments
upon it:

    The Diuell was wont to carry away the euill;
    But, now, the Euill out-carries the Diuell.

That the practice above referred to was a regular or even
a frequent feature of the morality-play has been disputed,
but the evidence seems fairly conclusive that it was common
in the later and more degenerate moralities. At any rate,
like the cry of âHo, ho!â it had come to be looked upon
as part of the regular stock in trade, and this was enough
for Jonsonâs purpose.[21] This motive of the Vice riding the
devil had changed from a passive to an active comic part.
Instead of the devilâs prey he had become in the eyes of
the spectators the devilâs tormentor. Jonson may be looked
upon as reverting, perhaps unconsciously, to the original
and truer conception.

In other respects Pug exhibits only the characteristics of the
inheritor of the devilâs comedy part, the butt or clown. As we have
seen, one of the chief sources, as well as one of the constant modes
of manifestation, of this figure was the servant or man of low social
rank. Pug, too, on coming to earth immediately attaches himself to
Fitzdottrel as a servant, and throughout his brief sojourn on earth he
continues to exhibit the wonted stupidity and clumsy uncouthness of
the clown. He appears, to be sure, in a fine suit of clothes, but he
soon shows himself unfit for the position of gentleman-usher, and his
stupidity appears at every turn. The important element in the clownâs
comedy part, of a contrast between intention and accomplishment,
is of course exactly the sort of fun inspired by Pugâs repeated
discomfiture. With the clown it often takes the form of blunders
in speech, and his desire to appear fine and say the correct thing
frequently leads him into gross absurdities. This is brought out with
broad humor in 4. 4. 219, where Pug, on being catechized as to what
he should consider âthe height of his employmentâ, stumbles upon the
unfortunate suggestion: âTo find out a good _Corne-cutter_â. His
receiving blows at the hand of his master further distinguishes him
as a clown. The investing of Pug with such attributes was, as we have
seen, no startling innovation on Jonsonâs part. Moreover, it fell
into line with his purpose in this play, and was the more acceptable
since it allowed him to make use of the methods of realism instead
of forcing him to draw a purely conventional figure. Pug, of course,
even in his character of clown, is not the unrelated stock-figure,
introduced merely for the sake of inconsequent comic dialogue and rough
horse-play. His part is important and definite, though not sufficiently
developed.

[18] In the Digby group of miracle-plays roaring by the devil is a
prominent feature. Stage directions in _Paul_ provide for âcryeing
and roryingâ and Belial enters with the cry, âHo, ho, behold meâ.
Among the moralities _The Disobedient Child_ may be mentioned.

[19] So in _Gammer Gurtonâs Needle_, c 1562, we read: âBut
Diccon, Diccon, did not the devil cry ho, ho, ho?â Cf. also the
translation of Goulartâs Histories, 1607 (quoted by Sharp, p. 59):
âThe fellow--coming to the stove--sawe the Diuills in horrible
formes, some sitting, some standing, others walking, some ramping
against the walles, but al of them, assoone as they beheld him,
crying Hoh, hoh, what makest thou here?â

[20] Cf. the words of Robin Goodfellow in _Wily Beguiled_
(_O. Pl._, 4th ed., 9. 268): âIâll put me on my great carnation-nose,
and wrap me in a rowsing calf-skin suit and come like some hobgoblin,
or some devil ascended from the grisly pit of hellâ.

[21] Cushman points out that it occurs in only one drama,
that of _Like will to Like_. He attributes the currency of the notion
that this mode of exit was the regular one to the famous passage in
Harsnetâs _Declaration of Popish Impostures_ (p. 114, 1603): âIt was
a pretty part in the old church-playes, when the nimble Vice would
skip up nimbly like a jackanapes into the devilâs necke, and ride the
devil a course, and belabour him with his wooden dagger, till he made
him roare, whereat the people would laugh to see the devil so
vice-hauntedâ. The moralities and tragedies give no indication of
hostility between Vice and devil. Cushman believes therefore that
Harsnet refers either to some lost morality or to âPunch and Judyâ.
It is significant, however, that in âPunch and Judyâ, which gives
indications of being a debased descendant of the morality, the devil
enters with the evident intention of carrying the hero off to hell.
The joke consists as in the present play in a reversal of the usual
proceeding. Eckhardt (p. 85 n.) points out that the Viceâs cudgeling
of the devil was probably a mere mirth-provoking device, and
indicated no enmity between the two. Moreover the motive of the
devil as an animal for riding is not infrequent. In the _Castle of
Perseverance_ the devil carries away the hero, Humanum Genus. The
motive appears also in Greeneâs _Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay_ and
Lodge and Greeneâs _Looking Glass for London and England_, and
especially in _Histriomastix_, where the Vice rides a roaring devil
(Eckhardt, pp. 86 f.). We have also another bit of evidence from
Jonson himself. In _The Staple of News_ Mirth relates her reminiscences
of the old comedy. In speaking of the devil she says: âHe
would carry away the Vice on his back quick to hell in every playâ.


3. _The Influence of Robin Goodfellow and of Popular Legend_

A constant element of the popular demonology was the belief in the
kobold or elfish sprite. This figure appears in the mysteries in
the shape of Titivillus, but is not found in the moralities. Robin
Goodfellow, however, makes his appearance in at least three comedies,
_Midsummer Nightâs Dream_, 1593-4, _Grim, the Collier of Croyden_,
c 1600, and _Wily Beguiled_, 1606. The last of these especially
approaches Jonsonâs conception. Here Robin Goodfellow is a malicious
intriguer, whose nature, whether human or diabolical, is left somewhat
in doubt. His plans are completely frustrated, he is treated with
contempt, and is beaten by Fortunatus. The character was a favorite
with Jonson. In the masque of _The Satyr_, 1603,[22] that character
is addressed as Pug, which here seems evidently equivalent to Puck or
Robin Goodfellow. Similarly Thomas Heywood makes Kobald, Hobgoblin,
Robin Goodfellow, and Pug practically identical.[23] Butler, in the
_Hudibras_,[24] gives him the combination-title of good âPug-Robinâ.
Jonsonâs character of Pug was certainly influenced in some degree both
by the popular and the literary conception of this âlubber fiendâ.

The theme of a stupid or outwitted devil occurred also both in ballad
literature[25] and in popular legend. Roskoff[26] places the change in
attitude toward the devil from a feeling of fear to one of superiority
at about the end of the eleventh century. The idea of a baffled devil
may have been partially due to the legends of the saints, where the
devil is constantly defeated, though he is seldom made to appear stupid
or ridiculous. The notion of a âstupid devilâ is not very common in
English, but occasionally appears. In the Virgilius legend the fiend
is cheated of his reward by stupidly putting himself into the physical
power of the wizard. In the Friar Bacon legend the necromancer delivers
an Oxford gentleman by a trick of sophistry.[27] In the story upon
which the drama of _The Merry Devil of Edmonton_ was founded, the devil
is not only cleverly outwitted, but appears weak and docile in his
indulgence of the wizardâs plea for a temporary respite. It may be said
in passing, in spite of Herfordâs assertion to the contrary, that the
supernatural machinery in this play has considerably less connection
with the plot than in _The Devil is an Ass_. Both show a survival of
a past interest, of which the dramatist himself realizes the obsolete
character.

4. _Friar Rush and Dekker_

It was the familiar legend of Friar Rush which furnished the groundwork
of Jonsonâs play. The story seems to be of Danish origin, and first
makes its appearance in England in the form of a prose history
during the latter half of the sixteenth century. It is entered in
the _Stationerâs Register_ 1567-8, and mentioned by Reginald Scot in
1584.[28] As early as 1566, however, the figure of Friar Rush on a
âpainted clothâ was a familiar one, and is so mentioned in _Gammer
Gurtonâs Needle_.[29] The first extant edition dates from 1620, and has
been reprinted by W. J. Thoms.[30] The character had already become
partially identified with that of Robin Goodfellow,[31] and this
identification, as we have seen, Jonson was inclined to accept.

In spite of many variations of detail the kernel of the Rush story is
precisely that of Jonsonâs play, the visit of a devil to earth with
the purpose of corrupting men. Both Rush and Pug assume human bodies,
the former being âput in rayment like an earthly creatureâ, while the
latter is made subject âto all impressions of the fleshâ.

Rush, unlike his counterpart, is not otherwise bound to definite
conditions, but he too becomes a servant. The adventure is not of his
own seeking; he is chosen by agreement of the council, and no mention
is made of the emissaryâs willingness or unwillingness to perform
his part. Later, however, we read that he stood at the gate of the
religious house âall alone and with a heavie countenanceâ. In the
beginning, therefore, he has little of Pugâs thirst for adventure,
but his object is at bottom the same, âto goe and dwell among these
religious men for to maintaine them the longer in their ungracious
livingâ. Like Pug, whose request for a Vice is denied him, he goes
unaccompanied, and presents himself at the priory in the guise of a
young man seeking service: âSir, I am a poore young man, and am out of
service, and faine would have a maisterâ.[32]

Most of the remaining incidents of the Rush story could not be used
in Jonsonâs play. Two incidents may be mentioned. Rush furthers the
amours of his master, as Pug attempts to do those of his mistress.
In the later history of Rush the motive of demoniacal possession is
worked into the plot. In a very important respect, however, the legend
differs from the play. Up to the time of discovery Rush is popular
and successful. He is nowhere made ridiculous, and his mission of
corruption is in large measure fulfilled. The two stories come together
in their conclusion. The discovery that a real devil has been among
them is the means of the friarsâ conversion and future right living. A
precisely similar effect takes place in the case of Fitzdottrel.

The legend of Friar Rush had already twice been used
in the drama before it was adopted by Jonson. The play
by Day and Haughton to which Henslowe refers[33] is not
extant; Dekkerâs drama, _If this be not a good Play, the
Diuell is in it_, appeared in 1612. Jonson in roundabout
fashion acknowledged his indebtedness to this play by the
closing line of his prologue.

          If this Play doe not like, the Diuell is inât.

Dekkerâs play adds few new elements to the story. The first scene is
in the infernal regions; not, however, the Christian hell, as in the
prose history, but the classical Hades. This change seems to have
been adopted from Machiavelli. Three devils are sent to earth with
the object of corrupting men and replenishing hell. They return, on
the whole, successful, though the corrupted king of Naples is finally
redeemed.

In certain respects, however, the play stands closer to Jonsonâs drama
than the history. In the first place, the doctrine that hellâs vices
are both old-fashioned and outdone by men, upon which Satan lays so
much stress in his instructions to Pug in the first scene, receives a
like emphasis in Dekker:

                       ... âtis thought
    That men to find hell, now, new waies have sought,
    As Spaniards did to the Indies.

and again:

                         ... aboue vs dwell,
    Diuells brauer, and more subtill then in Hell.[34]

and finally:

    They scorne thy hell, hauing better of their owne.

In the second place Lurchall, unlike Rush, but in the same way
as Pug, finds himself inferior to his earthly associates. He
acknowledges himself overreached by Bartervile, and confesses:

    I came to teach, but now (me thinkes) must learne.

A single correspondence of lesser importance may be added. Both devils,
when asked whence they come, obscurely intimate their hellish origin.
Pug says that he comes from the Devilâs Cavern in Derbyshire. Rufman
asserts that his home is Helvetia.[35]

5. _The Novella of Belfagor and the Comedy of Grim_

The relation between Jonsonâs play and the novella attributed to
NiccolÃ² Machiavelli (1469-1522) has been treated in much detail by Dr.
Ernst Hollstein. Dr. Hollstein compares the play with the first known
English translation, that by the Marquis of Wharton in 1674.[36] It is
probable, however, that Jonson knew the novella in its Italian shape,
if he knew it at all.[37] The Italian text has therefore been taken as
the basis of the present discussion, while Dr. Hollsteinâs results, so
far as they have appeared adequate or important, have been freely used.

                ... And were it numberâd well,
    There are more devils on earth than are in hell.

]


Both novella and play depart from the same idea, the visit of a devil
to earth to lead a human life. Both devils are bound by certain
definite conditions. Belfagor must choose a wife, and live with her ten
years; Pug must return at midnight. Belfagor, like Pug, must be subject
to âogni infortunio nel quale gli uomini scorronoâ.

In certain important respects Machiavelliâs story differs essentially
from Jonsonâs. Both Dekker and Machiavelli place the opening scene in
the classical Hades instead of in the Christian hell. But Dekkerâs
treatment of the situation is far more like Jonsonâs than is the
novellaâs. Herford makes the distinction clear: âMacchiavelliâs Hades
is the council-chamber of an Italian Senate, Dekkerâs might pass for
some tavern haunt of Thames watermen. Dekkerâs fiends are the drudges
of Pluto, abused for their indolence, flogged at will, and peremptorily
sent where he chooses. Machiavelliâs are fiends whose advice he
requests with the gravest courtesy and deference, and who give it
with dignity and independenceâ. Further, the whole object of the
visit, instead of being the corruption of men, is a mere sociological
investigation. Pug is eager to undertake his mission; Belfagor is
chosen by lot, and very loath to go. Pug becomes a servant, Belfagor a
nobleman.

But in one very important matter the stories coincide, that of the
general character and fate of the two devils. As Hollstein points out,
each comes with a firm resolve to do his best, each finds at once that
his opponents are too strong for him, each through his own docility
and stupidity meets repulse after repulse, ending in ruin, and each is
glad to return to hell. This, of course, involves the very essence of
Jonsonâs drama, and on its resemblance to the novella must be based any
theory that Jonson was familiar with the latter.

Of resemblance of specific details not much can be made. The two
stories have in common the feature of demoniacal possession, but
this, as we have seen, occurs also in the Rush legend. The fact that
the princess speaks Latin, while Fitzdottrel surprises his auditors
by his âseveral languagesâ, is of no more significance. This is one
of the stock indications of witchcraft. It is mentioned by Darrel,
and Jonson could not have overlooked a device so obvious. Certain
other resemblances pointed out by Dr. Hollstein are of only the most
superficial nature. On the whole we are not warranted in concluding
with any certainty that Jonson knew the novella at all.

On the other hand, he must have been acquainted with
the comedy of _Grim, the Collier of Croydon_ (c 1600).
Herford makes no allusion to this play, and, though it was
mentioned as a possible source by A. W. Ward,[38] the subject
has never been investigated. The author of _Grim_ uses the
Belfagor legend for the groundwork of his plot, but handles
his material freely. In many respects the play is a close
parallel to _The Devil is an Ass_. The same respect for the
vices of earth is felt as in Dekkerâs and Jonsonâs plays.
Belphegor sets out to

                     ... make experiment
    If hell be not on earth as well as here.

The circumstances of the sending bear a strong resemblance to the
instructions given to Pug:

    Thou shalt be subject unto human chance,
    So far as common wit cannot relieve thee.
    But whatsover happens in that time,
    Look not from us for succour or relief.
    This shalt thou do, and when the timeâs expired,
    Bring word to us what thou hast seen and done.

So in Jonson:

                    ... but become subject
    To all impression of the flesh, you take,
    So farre as humane frailty: ...
    But as you make your soone at nights relation,
    And we shall find, it merits from the State,
    You shall haue both trust from vs, and imployment.

Belphegor is described as âpatient, mild, and pitifulâ; and during his
sojourn on earth he shows little aptitude for mischief, but becomes
merely a butt and object of abuse. Belphegorâs request for a companion,
unlike that of Pug, is granted. He chooses his servant Akercock,
who takes the form of Robin Goodfellow. Robin expresses many of the
sentiments to be found in the mouth of Pug. With the latterâs monologue
(Text, 5. 2) compare Robinâs exclamation:

    Zounds, I had rather be in hell than here.

Neither Pug (Text, 2. 5. 3-4) nor Robin dares to return without
authority:

    What shall I do? to hell I dare not go,
    Until my masterâs twelve months be expirâd.

Like Pug (Text, 5. 6. 3-10) Belphegor worries over his reception in
hell:

    How shall I give my verdict up to Pluto
    Of all these accidents?

Finally Belphegorâs sensational disappearance through the
yawning earth comes somewhat nearer to Jonson than does
the Italian original. The English comedy seems, indeed,
to account adequately for all traces of the Belfagor story
to be found in Jonsonâs play.

[36] A paraphrase of _Belfagor_ occurs in the Conclusion of
Barnaby Richeâs _Riche his Farewell to Militarie Profession_, 1581,
published for the Shakespeare Society by J. P. Collier, 1846. The
name is changed to Balthasar, but the main incidents are the same.

[37] Jonson refers to Machiavelliâs political writings in
     _Timber_ (ed. Schelling, p. 38).

6. _Summary_

It is certain that of the two leading ideas of Jonsonâs comedy, the
sending of a devil to earth with the object of corrupting men is
derived from the Rush legend. It is probable that the no less important
motive of a baffled devil, happy to make his return to hell, is due
either directly or indirectly to Machiavelliâs influence. This motive,
as we have seen, was strengthened by a body of legend and by the
treatment of the devil in the morality play.


7. _The Figure of the Vice_

It is the figure of the Vice which makes Jonsonâs satire on the
out-of-date moralities most unmistakable. This character has been
the subject of much study and discussion, and there is to-day no
universally accepted theory as to his origin and development. In the
literature of Jonsonâs day the term Vice is almost equivalent to
harlequin. But whether this element of buffoonery is the fundamental
trait of the character, and that of intrigue is due to a confusion
in the meaning of the word, or whether the element of intrigue is
original, and that of buffoonery has taken its place by a process of
degeneration in the Vice himself, is still a disputed question.

The theory of Cushman and of Eckhardt is substantially the same,
and may be stated as follows. Whether or not the Vice be a direct
descendant of the devil, it is certain that he falls heir to his
predecessorâs position in the drama, and that his development is
strongly influenced by that character. Originally, like the devil, he
represents the principle of evil and may be regarded as the summation
of the seven deadly sins. From the beginning, however, he possessed
more comic elements, much being ready made for him through the partial
degeneration of the devil, while the material of the moralities was
by no means so limited in scope as that of the mysteries. This comic
element, comparatively slight at first, soon began to be cultivated
intentionally, and gradually assumed the chief function, while the
allegorical element was largely displaced. In course of time the
transformation from the intriguer to the buffoon became complete.[39]
Moreover, the rapidity of the transformation was hastened by the
influence of the fool, a new dramatic figure of independent origin,
but the partial successor upon the stage of the Viceâs comedy part. As
early as 1570 the union of fool and Vice is plainly visible.[40] In
1576 we find express stage directions given for the Vice to fill in
the pauses with improvised jests.[41] Two years later a Vice plays the
leading rÃ´le for the last time.[42] By 1584 the Vice has completely
lost his character of intriguer[43], and in the later drama he appears
only as an antiquated figure, where he is usually considered as
identical with the fool or jester.[44] Cushman enumerates the three
chief rÃ´les of the Vice as the opponent of the Good; the corrupter of
man; and the buffoon.

The Vice, however, is not confined to the moralities, but appears
frequently in the comic interludes. According to the theory of Cushman,
the name Vice stands in the beginning for a moral and abstract idea,
that of the principle of evil in the world, and must have originated
in the moralities; and since it is applied to a comic personage in
the interludes, this borrowing must have taken place after the period
of degeneration had already begun. To this theory Chambers[45] offers
certain important objections. He points out that, although âvices in
the ordinary sense of the word are of course familiar personages in the
moralsâ, the term Vice is not applied specifically to a character in
âany pre-Elizabethan moral interlude except the Marian _Respublica_â,
1553. Furthermore, âas a matter of fact, he comes into the interlude
through the avenue of the farceâ. The term is first applied to the
leading comic characters in the farces of John Heywood, _Love_ and
_The Weather_, 1520-30. These characters have traits more nearly
resembling those of the fool and clown than those of the intriguer of
the moralities. Chambers concludes therefore that âthe character of the
vice is derived from that of the domestic fool or jesterâ, and that
the term was borrowed by the authors of the moralities from the comic
interludes.

These two views are widely divergent, and seem at first wholly
irreconcilable. The facts of the case, however, are, I believe,
sufficiently clear to warrant the following conclusions: (1) The early
moralities possessed many allegorical characters representing vices
in the ordinary sense of the word. (2) From among these vices we may
distinguish in nearly every play a single character as in a preÃ«minent
degree the embodiment of evil. (3) To this chief character the name of
Vice was applied about 1553, and with increasing frequency after that
date. (4) Whatever may have been the original meaning of the word, it
must have been generally understood in the moralities in the sense
now usually attributed to it; for (5) The term was applied in the
moralities only to a character in some degree evil. Chambers instances
_The Tide tarrieth for No Man_ and the tragedy of _Horestes_, where
the Vice bears the name of Courage, as exceptions. The cases, however,
are misleading. In the former, Courage is equivalent to âPurposeâ,
âDesireâ, and is a distinctly evil character.[46] In the latter he
reveals himself in the second half of the play as Revenge, and although
he incites Horestes to an act of justice, he is plainly opposed to
âAmyteâ, and he is finally rejected and discountenanced. Moreover
he is here a serious figure, and only occasionally exhibits comic
traits. He cannot therefore be considered as supporting the theory
of the original identity of the fool and the Vice. (6) The Vice of
the comic interludes and the leading character of the moralities are
distinct figures. The former was from the beginning a comic figure or
buffoon;[47] the latter was in the beginning serious, and continued to
the end to preserve serious traits. With which of these two figures
the term Vice originated, and by which it was borrowed from the other,
is a matter of uncertainty and is of minor consequence. These facts,
however, seem certain, and for the present discussion sufficient: that
the vices of the earlier and of the later moralities represent the
same stock figure; that this figure stood originally for the principle
of evil, and only in later days became confused with the domestic
fool or jester; that the process of degeneration was continuous and
gradual, and took place substantially in the manner outlined by Cushman
and Eckhardt; and that, while to the playwright of Jonsonâs day the
term was suggestive primarily of the buffoon, it meant also an evil
personage, who continued to preserve certain lingering traits from the
character of intriguer in the earlier moralities.

of God in contrast with the devil.


8. _Jonsonâs Use of the Vice_

The position of the Vice has been discussed at some length because
of its very important bearing on Jonsonâs comedy. It is evident,
even upon a cursory reading, that Jonson has not confined himself to
the conception of the Vice obtainable from a familiarity with the
interludes alone, as shown in Heywoodâs farces or the comedy of _Jack
Juggler_. The character of Iniquity, though fully identified with the
buffoon of the later plays, is nevertheless closely connected in the
authorâs mind with the intriguer of the old moralities. This is clear
above all from the use of the name Iniquity, from his association with
the devil, and from Pugâs desire to use him as a means of corrupting
his playfellows. Thus, consciously or unconsciously on Jonsonâs part,
Iniquity presents in epitome the history of the Vice.

His very name, as we have said, links him with the morality-play. In
fact, all the Vices suggested, Iniquity, Fraud, Covetousness, and Lady
Vanity, are taken from the moralities. The choice of Iniquity was
not without meaning, and was doubtless due to its more general and
inclusive significance. In Shakespeareâs time Vice and Iniquity seem
to have been synonymous terms (see Schmidt), from which it has been
inferred that Iniquity was the Vice in many lost moralities.[48]

Of the original Vice-traits Iniquity lays vigorous claim to that of the
corrupter of man. Pug desires a Vice that he may âpractice there-with
any play-fellowâ, and Iniquity comes upon the stage with voluble
promises to teach his pupil to âcheat, lie, cog and swaggerâ. He offers
also to lead him into all the disreputable precincts of the city.
Iniquity appears in only two scenes, Act 1. Sc. 1 and Act 5. Sc. 6. In
the latter he reverses the usual process and carries away the devil to
hell. This point has already been discussed (p. xxiv).

Aside from these two particulars, Iniquity is far nearer to the fool
than to the original Vice. As he comes skipping upon the stage in the
first scene, reciting his galloping doggerel couplets, we see plainly
that the element of buffoonery is uppermost in Jonsonâs mind. Further
evidence may be derived from the particularity with which Iniquity
describes the costume which he promises to Pug, and which we are
doubtless to understand as descriptive of his own. Attention should
be directed especially to the wooden dagger, the long cloak, and the
slouch hat. Cushman says (p. 125): âThe vice enjoys the greatest
freedom in the matter of dress; he is not confined to any stereotyped
costume; ... the opinion that he is always or usually dressed in a
foolâs costume has absolutely no justificationâ. The wooden dagger, a
relic of the Roman stage,[49] is the most frequently mentioned article
of equipment. It is first found (1553-8) as part of the apparel of Jack
Juggler in a print illustrating that play, reproduced by Dodsley. It is
also mentioned in _Like Will to Like_, _Hickescorner_, _King Darius_,
etc. The wooden dagger was borrowed, however, from the foolâs costume,
and is an indication of the growing identification of the Vice with
the house-fool. That Jonson recognized it as such is evident from his
_Expostulation with Inigo Jones_:

    No velvet suit you wear will alter kind;
    A wooden dagger is a dagger of wood.

The long cloak, twice mentioned (1. 1. 51 and 85), is another
property borrowed from the fool. The natural fool usually wore a
long gown-like dress,[50] and this was later adopted as a dress for
the artificial fool. Muckle John, the court fool of Charles I., was
provided with âa long coat and suit of scarlet-colour sergeâ.[51]

Satanâs reply to Pugâs request for a Vice is, however, the most
important passage on this subject. He begins by saying that the Vice,
whom he identifies with the house fool, is fifty years out of date.
Only trivial and absurd parts are left for Iniquity to play, the
mountebank tricks of the city and the tavern fools. Douce (pp. 499
f.) mentions nine kinds of fools, among which the following appear:
1. The general domestic fool. 4. The city or corporation fool. 5.
Tavern fools. Satan compares Iniquity with each of these in turn. The
day has gone by, he says:

    When euery great man had his _Vice_ stand by him,
    In his long coat, shaking his wooden dagger.

Then he intimates that Iniquity may be able to play the
tavern fool:

    Where canst thou carry him? except to Tauernes?
    To mount vp ona joynt-stoole, with a _Iewes_-trumpe,
    To put downe _Cokeley_, and that must be to Citizens?

And finally he compares him with the city fool:

    Hee may perchance, in taile of a Sheriffes dinner,
    Skip with a rime oâ the table, from _New-nothing_,
    And take his _Almaine_-leape into a custard.

Thus not only does Jonson identify the Vice with the fool, but with the
fool in his senility. The characteristic functions of the jester in the
Shakespearian drama, with his abundant store of improvised jests, witty
retorts, and irresistible impudence, have no part in this character. He
is merely the mountebank who climbs upon a tavern stool, skips over the
table, and leaps into corporation custards.

Iniquity, then, plays no real part in the drama. His introduction is
merely for the purpose of satire. In _The Staple of News_ the subject
is renewed, and treated with greater directness:

â_Tat._ I would fain see the fool, gossip; the fool is the
finest man in the company, they say, and has all the wit:
he is the very justice oâ peace oâ the play, and can commit
whom he will and what he will, error, absurdity, as the toy
takes him, and no man say black is his eye, but laugh at himâ.

In _Epigram 115, On the Townâs Honest Man_, Jonson
again identifies the Vice with the mountebank, almost in
the same way as he does in _The Devil is an Ass_:

                     ... this is one
    Suffers no name but a description
    Being no vicious person but the Vice
    About the town; ...
    At every meal, where it doth dine or sup,
    The clothâs no sooner gone, but it gets up,
    And shifting of its faces, doth play more
    Parts than the Italian could do with his door.
    Acts old Iniquity and in the fit
    Of miming gets the opinion of a wit.

[48] This designation for the Vice first appears in _Nice Wanton_,
1547-53, then in _King Darius_, 1565, and _Histriomastix_, 1599
(printed 1610).

II. THE SATIRICAL DRAMA


It was from Aristophanes[52] that Jonson learned to combine with
such boldness the palpable with the visionary, the material with the
abstract. He surpassed even his master in the power of rendering the
combination a convincing one, and his method was always the same. Fond
as he was of occasional flights of fancy, his mind was fundamentally
satirical, so that the process of welding the apparently discordant
elements was always one of rationalizing the fanciful rather than
of investing the actual with a far-away and poetic atmosphere. Thus
even his purely supernatural scenes present little incongruity. Satan
and Iniquity discuss strong waters and tobacco, Whitechapel and
Billingsgate, with the utmost familiarity; even hellâs âmost exquisite
torturesâ are adapted in part from the homely proverbs of the people.
In the use of his sources three tendencies are especially noticeable:
the motivation of borrowed incidents; the adjusting of action on a
moral basis: the reworking of his own favorite themes and incidents.

[52] See Herford, p. 318.


1. _General Treatment of the Plot_

For the main plot we have no direct source. It represents, however,
Jonsonâs typical method. It has been pointed out[53] that the
characteristic Jonsonian comedy always consists of two groups, the
intriguers and the victims. In _The Devil is an Ass_ the most purely
comic motive of the play is furnished by a reversal of the usual
relation subsisting between these two groups. Here the devil, who was
wont to be looked upon as arch-intriguer, is constantly âfooled off
and beatenâ, and thus takes his position as the comic butt. Pug, in a
sense, represents a satirical trend. Through him Jonson satirizes the
outgrown supernaturalism which still clung to the skirts of Jacobean
realism, and at the same time paints in lively colors the vice of a
society against which hell itself is powerless to contend. It is only,
however, in a general way, where the devil stands for a principle, that
Pug may be considered as in any degree satirical. In the particular
incident he is always a purely comic figure, and furnishes the mirth
which results from a sense of the incongruity between anticipation and
accomplishment.

Fitzdottrel, on the other hand, is mainly satirical. Through him Jonson
passes censure upon the city gallant, the attendant at the theatre, the
victim of the prevalent superstitions, and even the pretended demoniac.
His dupery, as in the case of his bargain with Wittipol, excites
indignation rather than mirth, and his final discomfiture affords us
almost a sense of poetic justice. This character stands in the position
of chief victim.

In an intermediate position are Merecraft and Everill. They succeed in
swindling Fitzdottrel and Lady Tailbush, but are in turn played upon by
the chief intriguer, Wittipol, with his friend Manly. Jonsonâs moral
purpose is here plainly visible, especially in contrast to Plautus,
with whom the youthful intriguer is also the stock figure. The motive
of the young manâs trickery in the Latin comedy is usually unworthy and
selfish. That of Wittipol, on the other hand, is wholly disinterested,
since he is represented as having already philosophically accepted the
rejection of his advances at the hands of Mrs. Fitzdottrel.

In construction the play suffers from overabundance of material.
Instead of a single main line of action, which is given clear
precedence, there is rather a succession of elaborated episodes,
carefully connected and motivated, but not properly subordinated. The
plot is coherent and intricate rather than unified. This is further
aggravated by the fact that the chief objects of satire are imperfectly
understood by readers of the present day.

Jonson observes unity of time, Pug coming to earth in
the morning and returning at midnight. With the exception
of the first scene, which is indeterminate, and seems at
one moment to be hell, and the next London, the action is
confined to the City, but hovers between Lincolnâs Inn,
Newgate, and the house of Lady Tailbush. Unity of action
is of course broken by the interference of the devil-plot and
the episodic nature of the satirical plot. The main lines
of action may be discussed separately.

In the first act chief prominence is given to the intrigue
between Wittipol and Mrs. Fitzdottrel. This interest is
continued through the second act, but practically dropped
after this point. In Act 4 we find that both lovers have
recovered from their infatuation, and the intrigue ends by
mutual consent.

The second act opens with the episode of Merecraftâs plot to gull
Fitzdottrel. The project of the dukedom of Drownedland is given chief
place, and attention is centred upon it both here and in the following
scenes. Little use, however, is made of it in the motivation of
action. This is left for another project, the office of the Master of
Dependencies (quarrels) in the next act. This device is introduced in
an incidental way, and we are not prepared for the important place
which it takes in the development of the plot. Merecraft, goaded by
Everill, hits upon it merely as a temporary makeshift to extort money
from Fitzdottrel. The latter determines to make use of the office in
prosecuting his quarrel with Wittipol. In preparation for the duel,
and in accordance with the course of procedure laid down by Everill,
he resolves to settle his estate. Merecraft and Everill endeavor to
have the deed drawn in their own favor, but through the interference
of Wittipol the whole estate is made over to Manly, who restores it to
Mrs. Fitzdottrel. This project becomes then the real turning-point of
the play.

The episode of Guilthead and Plutarchus in Act 3 is only slightly
connected with the main plot. That of Wittipolâs disguise as a Spanish
lady, touched upon in the first two acts, becomes the chief interest of
the fourth. It furnishes much comic material, and the characters of
Lady Tailbush and Lady Eitherside offer the poet the opportunity for
some of his cleverest touches in characterization and contrast.[54] The
scene, however, is introduced for incidental purposes, the satirization
of foreign fashions and the follies of London society, and is
overelaborated. The catalogue of cosmetics is an instance of Jonsonâs
intimate acquaintance with recondite knowledge standing in the way of
his art.

Merecraftâs âafter gameâ in the fifth act is of the nature of an
appendix. The play might well have ended with the frustration of his
plan to get possession of the estate. This act is introduced chiefly
for the sake of a satire upon pretended demoniacs and witch-finders. It
also contains the conclusion of the devil-plot.

_The Devil is an Ass_ will always remain valuable as a historical
document, and as a record of Jonsonâs own attitude towards the abuses
of his times. In the treatment of Fitzdottrel and Merecraft among the
chief persons, and of Plutarchus Guilthead among the lesser, this
play belongs to Jonsonâs character-drama.[55] It does not, however,
belong to the pure humor-comedy. Like _The Alchemist_, and in marked
contrast to _Every Man out of his Humor_, interest is sought in plot
development. In the scene between Lady Tailbush and Lady Eitherside,
the play becomes a comedy of manners, and in its attack upon state
abuses it is semi-political in nature. Both Gifford and Swinburne have
observed the ethical treatment of the main motives.

With the exception of Prologue and Epilogue, the doggerel couplets
spoken by Iniquity, Wittipolâs song (2. 6. 94), and some of the
lines quoted by Fitzdottrel in the last scene, the play is written
in blank verse throughout. Occasional lines of eight (2. 2. 122),
nine (2. 1. 1), twelve (1. 1. 33) or thirteen (1. 1. 113) syllables
are introduced. Most of these could easily be normalized by a slight
emendation or the slurring of a syllable in pronunciation. Many of
the lines, however, are rough and difficult of scansion. Most of the
dialogue is vigorous, though Wittipolâs language is sometimes affected
and unnatural (cf. Act 1. Sc. 1). His speech, 1. 6. 111-148, is
classical in tone, but fragmentary and not perfectly assimilated. The
song already referred to possesses delicacy and some beauty of imagery,
but lacks Jonsonâs customary polish and smoothness.

As a work of art the play must rely chiefly upon the vigor of its
satiric dialogue and the cleverness of its character sketches. It lacks
the chief excellences of construction--unity of interest, subordination
of detail, steady and uninterrupted development, and prompt conclusion.

[54] Contrasted companion-characters are a favorite device with
Jonson. Compare Corvino, Corbaccio, and Voltore in _The Fox_, Ananias
and Tribulation Wholesome in _The Alchemist_, etc.

[55] It should be noticed that in the case of Merecraft the method
employed is the caricature of a profession, as well as the exposition
of personality.


2. _Chief Sources of the Plot_

The first source to be pointed out was that of Act 1. Sc. 4-6.[56]
This was again noticed by Koeppel, who mentions one of the
word-for-word borrowings, and points out the moralistic tendency in
Jonsonâs treatment of the husband, and his rejection of the Italian
storyâs licentious conclusion.[57] The original is from Boccaccioâs
_Decameron_, the fifth novella of the third day. Boccaccioâs title
is as follows: âIl Zima dona a messer Francesco Vergellesi un suo
pallafreno, e per quello con licenzia di lui parla alla sua donna, ed
ella tacendo, egli in persona di lei si risponde, e secondo la sua
risposta poi lâeffetto segueâ. The substance of the story is this. Il
Zima, with the bribe of a palfrey, makes a bargain with Francesco. For
the gift he is granted an interview with the wife of Francesco and in
the latterâs presence. This interview, however, unlike that in _The
Devil is an Ass_, is not in the husbandâs hearing. To guard against any
mishap, Francesco secretly commands his wife to make no answer to the
lover, warning her that he will be on the lookout for any communication
on her part. The wife, like Mrs. Fitzdottrel, upbraids her husband,
but is obliged to submit. Il Zima begins his courtship, but, though
apparently deeply affected, she makes no answer. The young man then
suspects the husbandâs trick (e poscia sâincominciÃ² ad accorgere dellâ
arte usata dal cavaliere). He accordingly hits upon the device of
supposing himself in her place and makes an answer for her, granting an
assignation. As a signal he suggests the hanging out of the window of
two handkerchiefs. He then answers again in his own person. Upon the
husbandâs rejoining them he pretends to be deeply chagrined, complains
that he has met a statue of marble (una statua di marmo) and adds:
âVoi avete comperato il pallafreno, e io non lâho vendutoâ. Il Zima is
successful in his ruse, and Francescoâs wife yields completely to his
seduction.

A close comparison of this important source is highly instructive.
Verbal borrowings show either that Jonson had the book before him, or
that he remembered many of the passages literally. Thus Boccaccioâs
âuna statua di marmoâ finds its counterpart in a later scene[58] where
Mrs. Fitzdottrel says: âI would not haue him thinke hee met a statueâ.
Fitzdottrelâs satisfaction at the result of the bargain is like that
of Francesco: âI haâ kept the contract, and the cloake is mineâ (omai
Ã¨ ben mio il pallafreno, che fu tuo). Again Wittipolâs parting words
resemble Il Zimaâs: âIt may fall out, that you haâ bought it deare,
though I haâ not sold itâ.[59] In the mouths of the two heroes,
however, these words mean exactly opposite things. With Il Zima it is a
complaint, and means: âYou have won the cloak, but I have got nothing
in returnâ. With Wittipol, on the other hand, it is an open sneer, and
hints at further developments. The display of handkerchiefs at the
window is another borrowing. Fitzdottrel says sarcastically:

                   ... Iâll take carefull order,
    That shee shall hang forth ensignes at the window.

Finally Wittipol, like Il Zima, suspects a trick when Mrs.
Fitzdottrel refuses to answer:

    How! not any word? Nay, then, I taste a tricke inât.

But precisely here Jonson blunders badly. In Boccaccioâs story the
trick was a genuine one. Il Zima stands waiting for an answer. When no
response is made he begins to suspect the husbandâs secret admonition,
and to thwart it hits upon the device of answering himself. But in
Jonson there is no trick at all. Fitzdottrel does indeed require his
wife to remain silent, but by no means secretly. His command is placed
in the midst of a rambling discourse addressed alternately to his wife
and to the young men. There is not the slightest hint that any part
of this speech is whispered in his wifeâs ear, and Wittipol enters
upon his courtship with full knowledge of the situation. This fact
deprives Wittipolâs speech in the person of Mrs. Fitzdottrel of its
character as a clever device, so that the whole point of Boccaccioâs
story is weakened, if not destroyed. I cannot refrain in conclusion
from making a somewhat doubtful conjecture. It is noticeable that while
Jonson follows so many of the details of this story with the greatest
fidelity he substitutes the gift of a cloak for that of the original
âpallafrenoâ (palfrey).[60] The word is usually written âpalafrenoâ and
so occurs in Florio. Is it possible that Jonson was unfamiliar with the
word, and, not being able to find it in a dictionary, conjectured that
it was identical with âpallaâ, a cloak?

In other respects Jonsonâs handling of the story displays his
characteristic methods. Boccaccio spends very few words in description
of either husband or suitor. Jonson, however, is careful to make plain
the despicable character of Fitzdottrel, while Wittipol is represented
as an attractive and high-minded young man. Further than this, both
Mrs. Fitzdottrel and Wittipol soon recover completely from their
infatuation.

Koeppel has suggested a second source from the _Decameron_, Day 3,
Novella 3. The title is: âSotto spezie di confessione e di purissima
coscienza una donna, innamorata dâun giovane, induce un solenne frate,
senza avvedersene egli, a dar modo cheâl piacer di lei avessi intero
effettoâ. The story is briefly this. A lady makes her confessor the
means of establishing an acquaintance with a young man with whom she
has fallen in love. Her directions are conveyed to him under the guise
of indignant prohibitions. By a series of messages of similar character
she finally succeeds in informing him of the absence of her husband
and the possibility of gaining admittance to her chamber by climbing a
tree in the garden. Thus the friar becomes the unwitting instrument of
the very thing which he is trying to prevent. So in Act 2. Sc. 2 and 6,
Mrs. Fitzdottrel suspects Pug of being her husbandâs spy. She dares not
therefore send Wittipol a direct message, but requests him to cease his
attentions to her

    At the Gentlemans chamber-window in _Lincolnes-Inne_ there,
    That opens to my gallery.

Wittipol takes the hint, and promptly appears at the place indicated.

Von Rapp[61] has mentioned certain other scenes as probably of
Italian origin, but, as he advances no proofs, his suggestions may be
neglected. It seems to me possible that in the scene above referred
to, where the lover occupies a house adjoining that of his mistress,
and their secret amour is discovered by her servant and reported to
his master, Jonson had in mind the same incident in Plautusâ _Miles
Gloriosus_, Act. 2. Sc. 1 f.

The trait of jealousy which distinguishes Fitzdottrel was suggested
to some extent by the character of Euclio in the _Aulularia_, and a
passage of considerable length[62] is freely paraphrased from that
play. The play and the passage had already been used in _The Case is
Altered_.

Miss Woodbridge has noticed that the scene in which Lady Tailbush and
her friends entertain Wittipol disguised as a Spanish lady is similar
to Act 3. Sc. 2 of _The Silent Woman_, where the collegiate ladies call
upon Epicoene. The trick of disguising a servant as a woman occurs in
Plautusâ _Casina_, Acts 4 and 5.

For the final scene, where Fitzdottrel plays the part of a bewitched
person, Jonson made free use of contemporary books and tracts. The
motive of pretended possession had already appeared in _The Fox_
(_Wks._ 3. 312), where symptoms identical with or similar to those in
the present passage are mentioned--swelling of the belly, vomiting
crooked pins, staring of the eyes, and foaming at the mouth. The
immediate suggestion in this place may have come either through the
Rush story or through Machiavelliâs novella. That Jonsonâs materials
can be traced exclusively to any one source is hardly to be expected.
Not only were trials for witchcraft numerous, but they must have formed
a common subject of speculation and discussion. The ordinary evidences
of possession were doubtless familiar to the well-informed man without
the need of reference to particular records. And it is of the ordinary
evidences that the poet chiefly makes use. Nearly all these are found
repeatedly in the literature of the period.

We know, on the other hand, that Jonson often preferred to get his
information through the medium of books. It is not surprising,
therefore, that Merecraft proposes to imitate âlittle Darrelâs tricksâ,
and to find that the dramatist has resorted in large measure to this
particular source.[63]

The Darrel controversy was carried on through a number of years between
John Darrel, a clergyman (see note 5. 3. 6), on the one hand, and
Bishop Samuel Harsnet, John Deacon and John Walker, on the other. Of
the tracts produced in this controversy the two most important are
Harsnetâs _Discovery of the Fraudulent Practises of John Darrel_,[64]
1599, and Darrelâs _True Narration of the Strange and Grevous
Vexation by the Devil of 7 Persons in Lancashire and William Somers
of Nottingham_, ... 1600. The story is retold in Francis Hutchinsonâs
_Historical Essay concerning Witchcraft_, London, 1720.

Jonson follows the story as told in these two books with considerable
fidelity. The accompaniments of demonic possession which Fitzdottrel
exhibits in the last scene are enumerated in two previous speeches.
Practically all of these are to be found in Darrelâs account:

               ... roule but wiâ your eyes,
    And foam at thâ mouth. (Text, 5. 3. 2-3)
               ... to make your belly swell,
    And your eyes turne, to foame, to stare, to gnash
    Your teeth together, and to beate your selfe,
    Laugh loud, and faine six voices. (5. 5. 25 f.)

They may be compared with the description given by Darrel: âHe was
often seene ... to beate his head and other parts of his body against
the ground and bedstead. In most of his fitts, he did swell in his
body; ... if he were standing when the fit came he wold be cast
headlong upon the ground, or fall doune, drawing then his lips awry,
gnashing with his teeth, wallowing and foaming.... Presently after he
would laughe loud and shrill, his mouth being shut closeâ. (Darrel,
p. 181.) âHe was also continually torne in very fearfull manner, and
disfigured in his face ... now he gnashed with his teeth; now he fomed
like to the horse or boare, ... not to say anything of his fearfull
staring with his eyes, and incredible gapingâ. (Darrel, p. 183.) The
swelling, foaming, gnashing, staring, etc., are also mentioned by
Harsnet (pp. 147-8), as well as the jargon of languages (p. 165).

The scene is prepared before Merecraftâs appearance (Text, 5. 5. 40.
Cf. _Detection_, p. 92), and Fitzdottrel is discovered lying in bed
(Text, 5. 5. 39; 5. 8. 40). Similarly, Somers performed many of his
tricks âunder a coverletâ (_Detection_, p. 104). Sir Paul Eitherside
then enters and âinterprets allâ. This is imitated directly from
Harsnet, where we read: âSo. [Somers] acting those gestures M. Dar.
did expound them very learnedlye, to signify this or that sinne that
raigned in Nott. [Nottingham].â Paulâs first words are: âThis is the
_Diuell_ speakes and laughes in himâ. So Harsnet tells us that âM. Dar.
vpon his first comming vnto Som. affirmed that it was not So. that
spake in his fitts, but the diuell by himâ. Both Fitzdottrel (Text, 5.
8. 115) and Somers (_Narration_, p. 182) talk in Greek. The devil in
Fitzdottrel proposes to âbreak his necke in jestâ (Text, 5. 8. 117),
and a little later to borrow money (5. 8. 119). The same threat is
twice made in the _True Narration_ (pp. 178 and 180). In the second of
these passages Somers is met by an old woman, who tries to frighten him
into giving her money. Otherwise, she declares, âI will throwe thee
into this pit, and breake thy neckâ. The mouse âthat should haâ come
forthâ (Text, 5. 8. 144) is mentioned by both narrators (_Detection_,
p. 140; _Narration_, p. 184), and the pricking of the body with
pins and needles (Text, 5. 8. 49) is found in slightly altered form
(_Detection_, p. 135; _Narration_, p. 174). Finally the clapping of the
hands (Text. 5. 8. 76) is a common feature (_Narration_, p. 182). The
last mentioned passage finds a still closer parallel in a couplet from
the contemporary ballad, which Gifford quotes from Hutchinson (p. 249):

    And by the clapping of his Hands
    He shewâd the starching of our Bands.

Of the apparatus supplied by Merecraft for the imposture, the soap,
nutshell, tow, and touchwood (Text, 5. 3. 3-5), the bladders and
bellows (Text, 5. 5. 48), some are doubtless taken from Harsnetâs
_Discovery_, though Darrel does not quote these passages in the
_Detection_. We find, however, that Darrel was accused of supplying
Somers with black lead to foam with (_Detection_, p. 160), and Gifford
says that the _soap_ and _bellows_ are also mentioned in the âBishopâs
bookâ.

Though Jonson drew so largely upon this source, many details are
supplied by his own imagination. Ridiculous as much of it may seem to
the modern reader, it is by no means overdrawn. In fact it may safely
be affirmed that no such realistic depiction of witchcraft exists
elsewhere in the whole range of dramatic literature.

[63] Gifford points out the general resemblance. He uses Hutchinsonâs
     book for comparison.

[64] This book, so far as I know, is not to be found in any American
library. My knowledge of its contents is derived wholly from
Darrelâs answer, _A Detection of that sinnful, shamful, lying and
ridiculous Discours, of Samuel Harshnet, entituled: A Discoverie,
etc.... Imprinted 1600_, which apparently cites all of Harsnetâs more
important points for refutation. It has been lent me through the
kindness of Professor George L. Burr from the Cornell Library. The
quotations from Harsnet in the following pages are accordingly taken
from the excerpts in the _Detection_.


3. _Prototypes of the leading Characters_

The position of the leading characters has already been indicated. Pug,
as the comic butt and innocent gull, is allied to Master Stephen and
Master Matthew of _Every Man in his Humor_, Dapper of _The Alchemist_,
and Cokes of _Bartholomew Fair_. Fitzdottrel, another type of the gull,
is more closely related to _Tribulation Wholesome_ in _The Alchemist_,
and even in some respects to Corvino and Voltore in _The Fox_. Wittipol
and Manly, the chief intriguers, hold approximately the same position
as Wellbred and Knowell in _Every Man in his Humor_, Winwife and
Quarlous in _Bartholomew Fair_, and Dauphine, Clerimont, and Truewit in
_The Silent Woman_. Merecraft is related in his character of swindler
to Subtle in _The Alchemist_, and in his character of projector to Sir
Politick Wouldbe in _The Fox_.

The contemptible âlady of spirit and woman of fashionâ is one of
Jonsonâs favorite types. She first appears in the persons of Fallace
and Saviolina in _Every Man out of his Humor_; then in _Cynthiaâs
Revels_, where Moria and her friends play the part; then as Cytheris in
_Poetaster_, Lady Politick in _The Alchemist_, the collegiate ladies
in _The Silent Woman_, and Fulvia and Sempronia in _Catiline_. The same
affectations and vices are satirized repeatedly. An evident prototype
of Justice Eitherside is found in the person of Adam Overdo in
_Bartholomew Fair_. Both are justices of the peace, both are officious,
puritanical, and obstinate. Justice Eithersideâs denunciation of the
devotees of tobacco finds its counterpart in a speech in _Bartholomew
Fair_, and his repeated âI do detest itâ reminds one of Overdoâs
frequent expressions of horror at the enormities which he constantly
discovers.


4. _Minor Sources_

_The Devil is an Ass_ is not deeply indebted to the classics. Jonson
borrows twice from Horace, 1. 6. 131, and 2. 4. 27 f. The half dozen
lines in which the former passage occurs (1. 6. 126-132) are written in
evident imitation of the Horatian style. Two passages are also borrowed
from Plautus, 2. 1. 168 f., already mentioned, and 3. 6. 38-9. A single
passage (2. 6. 104 f.) shows the influence of Martial. These passages
are all quoted in the notes.

The source of Wittipolâs description of the âCioppinoâ, and the mishap
attendant upon its use, was probably taken from a contemporary book
of travels. A passage in Coryatâs _Crudities_ furnishes the necessary
information and a similar anecdote, and was doubtless used by Jonson
(see note 4. 4. 69). Coryat was patronized by the poet. Similarly,
another passage in the _Crudities_ seems to have suggested the project
of the forks (see note 5. 4. 17).

A curious resemblance is further to be noted between several passages
in _The Devil is an Ass_ and _Underwoods 62_. The first draft of this
poem may have been written not long before the present play (see Fleay,
_Chron._ 1. 329-30) and so have been still fresh in the poetâs mind.
The passage _DA._ 3. 2. 44-6 shows unmistakably that the play was
the borrower, and not the poem. Gifford suggests that both passages
were quoted from a contemporary posture-book, but the passage in the
epigram gives no indication of being a quotation.

The chief parallels are as follows: _U. 62._ 10-14 and _DA._ 3. 3.
165-6; _U. 62._ 21-2 and _DA._ 3. 3. 169-72; _U. 62._ 25-6 and _DA._ 3.
2. 44-6; _U. 62._ 45-8 and _DA._ 2. 8. 19-22. These passages are all
quoted in the notes. In addition, there are a few striking words and
phrases that occur in both productions, but the important likenesses
are all noted above. In no other poem except _Charis_, _The Gipsies_,
and _Underwoods 36_,[65] where the borrowings are unmistakably
intentional, is there any thing like the same reworking of material as
in this instance.




III. SPECIFIC OBJECTS OF SATIRE


_The Devil is an Ass_ has been called of all Jonsonâs plays since
_Cynthiaâs Revels_ the most obsolete in the subjects of its satire.[66]
The criticism is true, and it is only with some knowledge of the abuses
which Jonson assails that we can appreciate the keenness and precision
of his thrusts. The play is a colossal exposÃ© of social abuses. It
attacks the aping of foreign fashions, the vices of society, and above
all the cheats and impositions of the unscrupulous swindler. But we
miss its point if we fail to see that Jonsonâs arraignment of the
society which permitted itself to be gulled is no less severe than that
of the swindler who practised upon its credulity. Three institutions
especially demand an explanation both for their own sake and for their
bearing upon the plot. These are the duello, the monopoly, and the
pretended demoniacal possession.

[65] See Introduction, Section C. IV.

[66] Swinburne, p. 65.


1. _The Duello_

The origin of private dueling is a matter of some obscurity. It was
formerly supposed to be merely a development of the judicial duel or
combat, but this is uncertain. Dueling flourished on the Continent,
and was especially prevalent in France during the reign of Henry III.
Jonson speaks of the frequency of the practice in France in _The
Magnetic Lady_.

No private duel seems to have occurred in England before the sixteenth
century, and the custom was comparatively rare until the reign of
James I. Its introduction was largely due to the substitution of the
rapier for the broadsword. Not long after this change in weapons
fencing-schools began to be established and were soon very popular.
Donald Lupton, in his _London and the Countrey carbonadoed_, 1632,
says they were usually set up by âsome low-country soldier, who to
keep himself honest from further inconveniences, as also to maintain
himself, thought upon this course and practises itâ.[67]

The etiquette of the duel was a matter of especial concern. The two
chief authorities seem to have been Jerome Carranza, the author of a
book entitled _Filosofia de las Armas_,[68] and Vincentio Saviolo,
whose _Practise_ was translated into English in 1595. It contained two
parts, the first âintreating of the vse of the rapier and daggerâ, the
second âof honor and honorable quarrelsâ. The rules laid down in these
books were mercilessly ridiculed by the dramatists; and the duello was
a frequent subject of satire.[69]

By 1616 dueling must have become very common. Frequent references
to the subject are found about this time in the _Calendar of State
Papers_. Under date of December 9, 1613, we read that all persons who
go abroad to fight duels are to be censured in the Star Chamber. On
February 17, 1614, âa proclamation, with a book annexedâ, was issued
against duels, and on February 13, 1617, the King made a Star Chamber
speech against dueling, âon which he before published a sharp edictâ.

The passion for dueling was turned to advantage by a set of improvident
bravos, who styled themselves âsword-menâ or âmasters of dependencies,â
a _dependence_ being the accepted name for an impending quarrel. These
men undertook to examine into the causes of a duel, and to settle or
âtake it upâ according to the rules laid down by the authorities on
this subject. Their prey were the young men of fashion in the city,
and especially âcountry gullsâ, who were newly come to town and
were anxious to become sophisticated. The profession must have been
profitable, for we hear of their methods being employed by the âroaring
boysâ[70] and the masters of the fencing schools.[71] Fletcher in _The
Elder Brother_, _Wks._ 10. 283, speaks of

           ... the masters of dependencies
    That by compounding differences âtween others
    Supply their own necessities,

and Massinger makes similar comment in _The Guardian_, _Wks._, p. 343:

         When two heirs quarrel,
    The swordsmen of the city shortly after
    Appear in plush, for their grave consultations
    In taking up the difference; some, I know,
    Make a set living onât.

Another function of the office is mentioned by Ford in _Fancies Chaste
and Noble_, _Wks._ 2. 241. The master would upon occasion âbraveâ a
quarrel with the novice for the sake of âgilding his reputationâ, and
Massinger in _The Maid of Honor_, _Wks._, p. 190, asserts that he would
even consent âfor a cloak with thrice-died velvet, and a cast suitâ to
be âkickâd down the stairsâ. In _A King and No King_, B. & Fl., _Wks._
2. 310 f., Bessus consults with two of these âGentlemen of the Swordâ
in a ridiculous scene, in which the sword-men profess the greatest
scrupulousness in examining every word and phrase, affirming that they
cannot be âtoo subtle in this businessâ.

Jonson never loses an opportunity of satirizing these despicable
bullies, who were not only ridiculous in their affectations, but who
proved by their âfomenting bloody quarrelsâ to be no small danger
to the state. Bobadill, who is described as a Paulâs Man, was in
addition a pretender to this craft. Matthew complains that Downright
has threatened him with the bastinado, whereupon Bobadill cries out
immediately that it is âa most proper and sufficient dependenceâ and
adds: âCome hither, you shall chartel him; Iâll shew you a trick or
two, you shall kill him with at pleasureâ.[72] Cavalier Shift, in
_Every Man out of his Humor_, among various other occupations has the
reputation of being able to âmanage a quarrel the best that ever you
saw, for terms and circumstancesâ. We have an excellent picture of
the ambitious novice in the person of Kastrill in _The Alchemist_.
Kastrill, who is described as an âangry boyâ, comes to consult Subtle
as to how to âcarry a business, manage a quarrel fairlyâ. Face assures
him that Dr. Subtle is able to âtake the heightâ of any quarrel
whatsoever, to tell âin what degree of safety it liesâ, âhow it may be
borneâ, etc.

From this description of the âmaster of dependenciesâ the exquisite
humor of the passage in _The Devil is an Ass_ (3. 3. 60 f.) can be
appreciated. Merecraft assures Fitzdottrel that this occupation, in
reality the refuge only of the Shifts and Bobadills of the city, is a
new and important office about to be formally established by the state.
In spite of all their speaking against dueling, he says, they have
come to see the evident necessity of a public tribunal to which all
quarrels may be referred. It is by means of this pretended office that
Merecraft attempts to swindle Fitzdottrel out of his entire estate,
from which disaster he is saved only by the clever interposition of
Wittipol.

2. _The Monopoly System_

Jonsonâs severest satire in _The Devil is an Ass_ is directed against
the projector. Through him the whole system of Monopolies is indirectly
criticised. To understand the importance and timeliness of this attack,
as well as the poetâs own attitude on the subject, it is necessary to
give a brief historical discussion of the system as it had developed
and then existed.

Royal grants with the avowed intention of instructing the English in
a new industry had been made as early as the fourteenth century,[73]
and the system had become gradually modified during the Tudor dynasty.
In the sixteenth century a capitalist middle class rose to wealth and
political influence. During the reign of Elizabeth a large part of
Cecilâs energies was directed toward the economic development of the
country. This was most effectually accomplished by granting patents to
men who had enterprise enough to introduce a new art or manufacture,
whether an importation from a foreign country or their own invention.
The capitalist was encouraged to make this attempt by the grant of
special privileges of manufacture for a limited period.[74] The
condition of monopoly did not belong to the mediaeval system, but was
first introduced under Elizabeth. So far the system had its economic
justification, but unfortunately it did not stop here. Abuses began to
creep in. Not only the manufacture, but the exclusive trade in certain
articles, was given over to grantees, and commodities of the most
common utility were âingrossed into the hands of these blood-suckers
of the commonwealth.[75] A remonstrance of Parliament was made to
Elizabeth in 1597, and again in 1601, and in consequence the Queen
thought best to promise the annulling of all monopolies then existing,
a promise which she in large measure fulfilled. But the immense growth
of commerce under Elizabeth made it necessary for her successor, James
I., to establish a system of delegation, and he accordingly adapted
the system of granting patents to the existing needs.[76] Many new
monopolies were granted during the early years of his reign, but in
1607 Parliament again protested, and he followed Elizabethâs example by
revoking them all. After the suspension of Parliamentary government in
1614 the system grew up again, and the old abuses became more obnoxious
than ever. In 1621 Parliament addressed a second remonstrance to James.
The king professed ignorance, but promised redress, and in 1624 all the
existing monopolies were abolished by the Statute 21 James I. c. 3. In
Parliamentâs address to James âthe tender point of prerogativeâ was
not disturbed, and it was contrived that all the blame and punishment
should fall on the patentees.[77]

Of all the patents granted during this time, that which seems to have
most attracted the attention of the dramatists was one for draining the
Fens of Lincolnshire. Similar projects had frequently been attempted
during the sixteenth century. In the list of patents before 1597,
catalogued by Hulme, seven deal with water drainage in some form or
other. The low lands on the east coast of England are exposed to
inundation.[78] During the Roman occupation large embankments had been
built, and during the Middle Ages these had been kept up partly through
a commission appointed by the Crown, and partly through the efforts of
the monasteries at Ramsey and Crowland. After the dissolution of these
monasteries it became necessary to take up anew the work of reclaiming
the fen-land. An abortive attempt by the Earl of Lincoln had already
been made when the Statute 43 Eliz. c. 10. 11. was passed in the year
1601. This made legal the action of projectors in the recovery of marsh
land. Many difficulties, however, such as lack of funds and opposition
on the part of the inhabitants and neighbors of the fens, still stood
in their way. In 1605 Sir John Popham and Sir Thomas Fleming headed a
company which undertook to drain the Great Level of the Cambridgeshire
fens, consisting of more than 300,000 acres, at their own cost, on the
understanding that 130,000 acres of the reclaimed land should fall
to their share. The project was a complete failure. Another statute
granting a patent for draining the fens is found in the seventh year of
Jac. I. c. 20, and the attempt was renewed from time to time throughout
the reigns of James and Charles I. It was not, however, until the
Restoration that these efforts were finally crowned with success.

When the remonstrance was made to James in 1621, the object of the
petitioners was gained, as we have seen, by throwing all the blame upon
the patentees and projectors. Similarly, the dramatists often prefer
to make their attack, not by assailing the institution of monopolies,
but by ridicule of the offending subjects.[79] Two agents are regularly
distinguished. There is the patentee, sometimes also called the
projector, whose part it is to supply the funds for the establishment
of the monopoly, and, if possible, the necessary influence at Court;
and the actual projector or inventor, who undertakes to furnish his
patron with various projects of his own device.

Jonsonâs is probably the earliest dramatic representation of the
projector. Merecraft is a swindler, pure and simple, whose schemes are
directed not so much against the people whom he aims to plunder by the
establishment of a monopoly as against the adventurer who furnishes
the funds for putting the project into operation:

               ... Wee poore Gentlemen, that want acres,
    Must for our needs, turne fooles vp and plough _Ladies_.

Both Fitzdottrel and Lady Tailbush are drawn into these schemes so
far as to part with their money. Merecraft himself pretends that he
possesses sufficient influence at Court. He flatters Fitzdottrel, who
is persuaded by the mere display of projects in a buckram bag, by
demanding of him âhis countânance, tâappeare inât to great menâ
(2. 1. 39). Lady Tailbush is not so easily fooled, and Merecraft has
some difficulty in persuading her of the power of his friends at Court
(Act 4. Sc. 1).

Merecraftâs chief project, the recovery of the drowned lands, is also
satirized by Randolph:

    I have a rare device to set Dutch windmills
    Upon Newmarket Heath, and Salisbury Plain,
    To drain the fens.[80]

and in _Hollandâs Leaguer_, Act 1. Sc. 5 (cited by Gifford):

                            Our projector
    Will undertake the making of bay salt,
    For a penny a bushel, to serve all the state;
    Another dreams of building waterworkes,
    Drying of fenns and marshes, like the Dutchmen.

In the later drama the figure of the projector appears several times,
but it lacks the timeliness of Jonsonâs satire, and the conception
must have been largely derived from literary sources. Jonsonâs
influence is often apparent. In Bromeâs _Court Beggar_ the patentee is
Mendicant, a country gentleman who has left his rustic life and sold
his property, in order to raise his state by court-suits. The projects
which he presents at court are the invention of three projectors. Like
Merecraft, they promise to make Mendicant a lord, and succeed only in
reducing him to poverty. The character of the Court Beggar is given in
these words: âHe is a Knight that hanckers about the court ambitious
to make himselfe a Lord by begging. His braine is all Projects, and
his soule nothing but Court-suits. He has begun more Knavish suits at
Court, then ever the Kings Taylor honestly finishâd, but never thrivâd
by any: so that now heeâs almost fallen from a Palace Begger to a
Spittle oneâ.

In the _Antipodes_ Brome introduces âa States-man studious for the
Commonwealth, solicited by Projectors of the Countryâ. Bromeâs list of
projects (quoted in Giffordâs edition) is a broad caricature. Wilson,
in the Restoration drama, produced a play called _The Projectors_, in
which Jonsonâs influence is apparent (see Introduction, p. lxxv).

Among the _characters_, of which the seventeenth century writers were
so fond, the projector is a favorite figure. John Taylor,[81] the
water-poet, furnishes us with a cartoon entitled âThe complaint of M.
Tenterhooke the _Projector_ and Sir _T_homas Dodger the Patenteeâ. In
the rimes beneath the picture the distinction between the projector,
who âhad the Art to cheat the Common-wealeâ, and the patentee, who
was possessed of âtricks and slights to pass the sealeâ, is brought
out with especial distinctness. Samuel Butlerâs character[82] of the
projector is of less importance, since it was not published until
1759. The real importance of Jonsonâs satire lies in the fact that it
appeared in the midst of the most active discussion on the subject of
monopolies. Drummond says that he was âaccused uponâ the play, and that
the King âdesired him to conceal itâ.[83] Whether the subject which
gave offense was the one which we have been considering or that of
witchcraft, it is, however, impossible to determine.

3. _Witchcraft_

Witchcraft in Jonsonâs time was not an outworn belief, but a living
issue. It is remarkable that the persecutions which followed upon this
terrible delusion were comparatively infrequent during the Middle
Ages, and reached their maximum only in the seventeenth century.

The first English Act against witchcraft after the Norman Conquest was
passed in 1541 (33 Hen. VIII. c. 8). This Act, which was of a general
nature, and directed against various kinds of sorceries, was followed
by another in 1562 (5 Eliz. c. 16). At the accession of James I. in
1603 was passed 1 Jac. I. c. 12, which continued law for more than a
century.

During this entire period charges of witchcraft were frequent. In
Scotland they were especially numerous, upwards of fifty being recorded
during the years 1596-7.[84] The trial of Anne Turner in 1615, in
which charges of witchcraft were joined with those of poisoning,
especially attracted the attention of Jonson. In 1593 occurred the
trial of the âthree Witches of Warboysâ, in 1606 that of Mary Smith,
in 1612 that of the earlier Lancashire Witches, and of the later
in 1633. These are only a few of the more famous cases. Of no less
importance in this connection is the attitude of the King himself.
In the famous _Demonology_[85] he allied himself unhesitatingly with
the cause of superstition. Witchcraft was of course not without
its opponents, but these were for the most part obscure men and of
little personal influence. While Bacon and Raleigh were inclining
to a belief in witchcraft, and Sir Thomas Browne was offering his
support to persecution, the cause of reason was intrusted to such
champions as Reginald Scot, the author of the famous _Discovery of
Witchcraft_, 1584, a work which fearlessly exposes the prevailing
follies and crimes. It is on this side that Jonson places himself. That
he should make a categorical statement as to his belief or disbelief
in witchcraft is not to be expected. It is enough that he presents
a picture of the pretended demoniac, that he makes it as sordid and
hateful as possible, that he draws for us in the person of Justice
Eitherside the portrait of the bigoted, unreasonable, and unjust judge,
and that he openly ridicules the series of cases which he used as the
source of his witch scenes (cf. Act. 5. Sc. 3).

To form an adequate conception of the poetâs satirical purpose in
this play one should compare the methods used here with the treatment
followed in Jonsonâs other dramas where the witch motive occurs.
In _The Masque of Queens_, 1609, and in _The Sad Shepherd_, Jonson
employed the lore of witchcraft more freely, but in a quite different
way. Here, instead of hard realism with all its hideous details, the
more picturesque beliefs and traditions are used for purely imaginative
and poetical purposes.

_The Masque of Queens_ was presented at Whitehall, and dedicated to
Prince Henry. Naturally Jonsonâs attitude toward witchcraft would here
be respectful. It is to be observed, however, that in the copious notes
which are appended to the masque no contemporary trials are referred
to. The poet relies upon the learned compilations of Bodin, Remigius,
Cornelius Agrippa, and Paracelsus, together with many of the classical
authors. He is clearly dealing with the mythology of witchcraft.
Nightshade and henbane, sulphur, vapors, the eggshell boat, and the
cobweb sail are the properties which he uses in this poetic drama.
The treatment does not differ essentially from that of Middleton and
Shakespeare.

In _The Sad Shepherd_ the purpose is still different. We have none of
the wild unearthliness of the masque. Maudlin is a witch of a decidedly
vulgar type, but there is no satirical intent. Jonson, for the purpose
of his play, accepts for the moment the prevailing attitude toward
witchcraft, and the satisfaction in Maudlinâs discomfiture doubtless
assumed an acquiescence in the popular belief. At the same time the
poetical aspect is not wholly forgotten, and appears with especial
prominence in the beautiful passage which describes the witchâs forest
haunt, beginning: âWithin a gloomy dimble she doth dwellâ. _The Sad
Shepherd_ and the masque are far more akin to each other in their
treatment of witchcraft than is either to _The Devil is an Ass_.

     Spalding Club_, Aberdeen, 1841.

     year of this play.




IV. PERSONAL SATIRE


The detection of personal satire in Jonsonâs drama is difficult,
and at best unsatisfactory. Jonson himself always resented it as an
impertinence.[86] In the present case Fleay suggests that the motto,
_Ficta, voluptatis causa, sint proxima veris_, is an indication that we
are to look upon the characters as real persons. But Jonson twice took
the pains to explain that this is precisely the opposite of his own
interpretation of Horaceâs meaning.[87] The subject of personal satire
was a favorite one with him, and in _The Magnetic Lady_ he makes the
sufficiently explicit statement: âA play, though it apparel and present
vices in general, flies from all particularities in personsâ.

On the other hand we know that Jonson did occasionally indulge in
personal satire. Carlo Buffone,[88] Antonio Balladino,[89] and the
clerk Nathaniel[90] are instances sufficiently authenticated. Of these
Jonson advances a plea of justification: âWhere have I been particular?
where personal? except to a mimic, cheater, bawd or buffoon, creatures,
for their insolencies, worthy to be taxed? yet to which of these so
pointingly, as he might not either ingenuously have confest, or wisely
dissembled his disease?â[91]

In only one play do we know that the principal characters represent
real people. But between _Poetaster_ and _The Devil is an Ass_ there
is a vast difference of treatment. In _Poetaster_ (1) the attitude is
undisguisedly satirical. The allusions in the prologues and notices
to the reader are direct and unmistakable. (2) The character-drawing
is partly caricature, partly allegorical. This method is easily
distinguishable from the typical, which aims to satirize a class.
(3) Jonson does not draw upon historical events, but personal
idiosyncrasies. (4) The chief motive is in the spirit of Aristophanes,
the great master of personal satire. These methods are what we should
naturally expect in a composition of this sort. Of such internal
evidence we find little or nothing in _The Devil is an Ass_. Several
plausible identifications, however, have been proposed, and these we
must consider separately.

The chief characters are identified by Fleay as follows: Wittipol is
Jonson. He has returned from travel, and had seen Mrs. Fitzdottrel
before he went. Mrs. Fitzdottrel is the Lady Elizabeth Hatton.
Fitzdottrel is her husband, Sir Edward Coke.

=Mrs. Fitzdottrel=. The identification is based upon a series of
correspondences between a passage in _The Devil is an Ass_ (2. 6.
57-113) and a number of passages scattered through Jonsonâs works. The
most important of these are quoted in the note to the above passage. To
them has been added an important passage from _A Challenge at Tilt_,
1613. Fleayâs deductions are these: (1) _Underwoods 36_ and _Charis_
must be addressed to the same lady (cf. especially _Ch._, part 5). (2)
Charis and Mrs. Fitzdottrel are identical. The song (2. 6. 94 f.) is
found complete in the _Celebration of Charis_. In Wittipolâs preceding
speech we find the phrases âmilk and rosesâ and âbank of kissesâ, which
occur in _Charis_ and in _U. 36_, and a reference to the husband who
is the âjust excuseâ for the wifeâs infidelity, which occurs in _U.
36_. (3) Charis is Lady Hatton. Fleay believes that _Charis_, part
1, in which the poet speaks of himself as writing âfifty yearsâ, was
written c 1622-3; but that parts 2-10 were written c 1608. In reference
to these parts he says: âWritten in reference to a mask in which
Charis represented Venus riding in a chariot drawn by swans and doves
(_Charis_, part 4), at a marriage, and leading the Graces in a dance
at Whitehall, worthy to be envied of the Queen (6), in which Cupid had
a part (2, 3, 5), at which Charis kissed him (6, 7), and afterwards
kept up a close intimacy with him (8, 9, 10). The mask of 1608, Feb.
9, exactly fulfils these conditions, and the Venus of that mask was
probably L. Elizabeth Hatton, the most beautiful of the then court
ladies. She had appeared in the mask of Beauty, 1608, Jan. 10, but
in no other year traceable by me. From the Elegy, G. 36, manifestly
written to the same lady (compare it with the lines in 5 as to âthe
bank of kissesâ and âthe bath of milk and rosesâ), we learn that Charis
had âa husband that is the just excuse of all that can be done himâ.
This was her second husband, Sir Edward Coke, to whom she was married
in 1593â.

Fleayâs theory rests chiefly upon (1) his interpretation of _The
Celebration of Claris_; (2) the identity of Charis and Mrs.
Fitzdottrel. A study of the poem has led me to conclusions of a very
different nature from those of Fleay. They may be stated as follows:

_Charis_ 1. This was evidently written in 1622-3. Jonson plainly says:
âThough I now write fifty yearsâ. Charis is here seemingly identified
with Lady Purbeck, daughter of Lady Hatton. Compare the last two lines
with the passage from _The Gipsies_. Fleay believes the compliments
were transferred in the masque at Lady Hattonâs request.

_Charis_ 4 and 7 have every mark of being insertions. (1) They are in
different metres from each other and from the other sections, which in
this respect are uniform. (2) They are not in harmony with the rest of
the poem. They entirely lack the easy, familiar, half jocular style
which characterizes the eight other parts. (3) Each is a somewhat
ambitious effort, complete in itself, and distinctly lyrical. (4) In
neither is there any mention of or reference to Charis. (5) It is
evident, therefore, that they were not written for the _Charis_ poem,
but merely interpolated. They are, then, of all the parts the least
valuable for the purpose of identification, nor are we justified in
looking upon them as continuing a definite narrative with the rest of
the poem. (6) The evident reason for introducing them is their own
intrinsic lyrical merit.

_Charis_ 4 was apparently written in praise of some pageant, probably a
court masque. The representation of Venus drawn in a chariot by swans
and doves, the birds sacred to her, may have been common enough. That
this is an accurate description of the masque of February 9, 1608 is,
however, a striking fact, and it is possible that the lady referred
to is the same who represented Venus in that masque. But (1) we do
not even know that Jonson refers to a masque of his own, or a masque
at all. (2) We have no trustworthy evidence that Lady Hatton was the
Venus of that masque. Fleayâs identification is little better than a
guess. (3) Evidence is derived from the first stanza alone. This does
not appear in _The Devil is an Ass_, and probably was not written at
the time. Otherwise there is no reason for its omission in that place.
It seems to have been added for the purpose of connecting the lyric
interpolation with the rest of the poem.

_Charis_ 5 seems to be a late production. (1) Jonson combines in this
single section a large number of figures used in other places. (2)
That it was not the origin of these figures seems to be intimated by
the words of the poem. Cupid is talking. He had lately found Jonson
describing his lady, and Jonsonâs words, he says, are descriptive of
Cupidâs own mother, Venus. So Homer had spoken of her hair, so Anacreon
of her face. He continues:

    By her looks I do her know
    _Which you call_ my shafts.

The italicized words may refer to _U. 36._ 3-4. They correspond,
however, much more closely to _Challenge_, _2 Cup._ The âbath your
verse disclosesâ (l. 21) may refer to _DA._ 2. 6. 82-3. _U. 36._ 7-8
or _Gipsies_ 15-6.

               ... the bank of kisses,
    Where _you say_ men gather blisses

is mentioned in _U. 36._ 9-10. âThe passages in _DA._ and _Gipsies_[92]
are less close. The âvalley _called_ my nestâ may be a reference to
_DA._ 2. 6. 74 f. Jonson had already spoken of the âgirdle âbout her
waistâ in _Challenge_, _2 Cup._ _Charis_ 5 seems then to have been
written later than _U. 36_, _Challenge_, 1613, and probably _Devil is
an Ass_, 1616. The evidence is strong, though not conclusive.

_Charis_ 6 evidently refers to a marriage at Whitehall. That Cupid, who
is referred to in 2, 3, 5, had any part in the marriage of _Charis_ 6
is nowhere even intimated. That Charis led the Graces in a dance is
a conjecture equally unfounded. Jonson of course takes the obvious
opportunity (ll. 20, 26) of playing on the name Charis. That this
occasion was the same as that celebrated in 4 we have no reason to
believe. It applies equally well, for instance, to _A Challenge at
Tilt_, but we are by no means justified in so limiting it. It may have
been imaginary.

_Charis_ 7 was written before 1618, since Jonson quoted a part of it to
Drummond during his visit in Scotland (cf. _Conversations_ 5). It was
a favorite of the poetâs and this furnishes sufficient reason for its
insertion here. It is worthy of note that the two sections of _Charis_,
which we know by external proof to have been in existence before 1623,
are those which give internal evidence of being interpolations.

_Summary._ The poem was probably a late production and of composite
nature. There is no reason for supposing that the greater part was not
written in 1622-3. The fourth and seventh parts are interpolations.
The first stanza of the fourth part, upon which the identification
largely rests, seems not to have been written until the poem was put
together in 1622-3. If it was written at the same time as the other
two stanzas, we cannot expect to find it forming part of a connected
narrative. The events described in the fourth and sixth parts are not
necessarily the same. There is practically no evidence that Lady Hatton
was the Venus of 1608, or that _Charis_ is addressed to any particular
lady.

The other link in Fleayâs chain of evidence is of still weaker
substance. The mere repetition of compliments does not necessarily
prove the recipient to be the same person. In fact we find in these
very pieces the same phrases applied indiscriminately to Lady Purbeck,
Lady Frances Howard, Mrs. Fitzdottrel, perhaps to Lady Hatton, and even
to the Earl of Somerset. Of what value, then, can such evidence be?

Fleayâs whole theory rests on this poem, and biographical evidence is
unnecessary. It is sufficient to notice that Lady Hatton was a proud
woman, that marriage with so eminent a man as Sir Edward Coke was
considered a great condescension (_Chamberlainâs Letters_, Camden Soc.,
p. 29), and that an amour with Jonson is extremely improbable.

=Fitzdottrel.= Fleayâs identification of Fitzdottrel with Coke rests
chiefly on the fact that Coke was Lady Hattonâs husband. The following
considerations are added. Fitzdottrel is a âsquire of Norfolkâ. Sir
E. Coke was a native of Norfolk, and had held office in Norwich.
Fitzdottrelâs rÃ´le as sham demoniac is a covert allusion to Cokeâs
adoption of the popular witch doctrines in the Overbury trial. His
jealousy of his wife was shown in the same trial, where he refused to
read the document of âwhat ladies loved what lordsâ, because, as was
popularly supposed, his own wifeâs name headed the list. Jonson is
taking advantage of Cokeâs disgrace in November, 1616. He had flattered
him in 1613 (_U. 64_).

Our reasons for rejecting this theory are as follows: (1) The natural
inference is that Jonson would not deliberately attack the man whom
he had highly praised three years before. I do not understand Fleayâs
assertion that Jonson was always ready to attack the fallen. (2) The
compliment paid to Coke in 1613 (_U. 64_) was not the flattery of an
hour of triumph. The appointment to the kingâs bench was displeasing to
Coke, and made at the suggestion of Bacon with the object of removing
him to a place where he would come less often into contact with the
king. (3) Fitzdottrel is a light-headed man of fashion, who spends his
time in frequenting theatres and public places, and in conjuring evil
spirits. Coke was sixty-four years old, the greatest lawyer of his
time, and a man of the highest gifts and attainments. (4) The attempted
parallel between Fitzdottrel, the pretended demoniac, and Coke, as
judge in the Overbury trial, is patently absurd. (5) If Lady Hatton had
not been selected for identification with Mrs. Fitzdottrel, Coke would
never have been dreamed of as a possible Fitzdottrel.

=Wittipol.= He is a young man just returned from travel, which
apparently has been of considerable duration. He saw Mrs. Fitzdottrel
once before he went, and upon returning immediately seeks her out.
How does this correspond to Jonsonâs life? _The Hue and Cry_ was
played February 9, 1608. According to Fleayâs interpretation, this was
followed by an intimacy with Lady Hatton. Five years later, in 1613,
Drummond tells us that Jonson went to France with the son of Sir Walter
Raleigh. He returned the same year in time to compose _A Challenge at
Tilt_, December 27. Three years later he wrote _The Devil is an Ass_ at
the age of forty-three.

Wittipol intimates that he is Mrs. Fitzdottrelâs equal in years, in
fashion (1. 6. 124-5), and in blood (1. 6. 168). For Jonson to say this
to Lady Hatton would have been preposterous.

=Justice Eitherside.= Only the desire to prove a theory at all costs
could have prevented Fleay from seeing that Cokeâs counterpart is
not Fitzdottrel, but Justice Eitherside. In obstinacy, bigotry, and
vanity this character represents the class of judges with which
Coke identified himself in the Overbury trial. Nor are these merely
class-traits. They are distinctly the faults which marred Cokeâs career
from the beginning. It is certain that Coke is partially responsible
for this portraiture. Overbury was a personal friend of the poet, and
the trial, begun in the previous year, had extended into 1616. Jonson
must have followed it eagerly. On the other hand, it is improbable that
the picture was aimed exclusively at Coke. He merely furnished traits
for a typical and not uncommon character. As we have seen, it is in
line with Jonsonâs usual practise to confine personal satire to the
lesser characters.

=Merecraft.= Fleayâs identification with Sir Giles Mompesson has very
little to commend it. Mompesson was connected by marriage with James
I.âs powerful favorite, George Villiers, later Duke of Buckingham. In
1616 he suggested to Villiers the creation of a special commission for
the purpose of granting licenses to keepers of inns and ale-houses.
The suggestion was adopted by Villiers; Mompesson was appointed to the
Commission in October, 1616, and knighted on November 18 of that year.
The patent was not sealed until March, 1617. His high-handed conduct
soon became unpopular, but he continued in favor with Villiers and
James, and his disgrace did not come until 1621.

It will readily be seen that Mompessonâs position and career conform
in no particular to those of Merecraft in the present play. Mompesson
was a knight, a friend of the kingâs favorite, and in favor with
the king. Merecraft is a mere needy adventurer without influence at
court, and the associate of ruffians, who frequent the âStraitsâ and
the âBermudasâ. Mompesson was himself the recipient of a patent (see
section III. 2). Merecraft is merely the projector who devises clever
projects for more powerful patrons. Mompessonâs project bears no
resemblance to those suggested by Merecraft, and he could hardly have
attracted any popular dislike at the time when _The Devil is an Ass_
was presented, since, as we have seen, his patent was not even sealed
until the following year. Finally, Jonson would hardly have attacked a
man who stood so high at court as did Mompesson in 1616.

It is evident that Jonson had particularly in mind those projectors
whose object it was to drain the fens of Lincolnshire. The attempts, as
we have seen, were numerous, and it is highly improbable that Jonson
wished to satirize any one of them more severely than another. In a
single passage, however, it seems possible that Sir John Popham (see
page lx) is referred to. In Act 4. Sc. 1 Merecraft speaks of a Sir John
Monie-man as a projector who was able to âjump a business quicklyâ
because âhe had great friendsâ. That Popham is referred to seems not
unlikely from the fact that he was the most important personage who
had embarked upon an enterprise of this sort, that his scheme was one
of the earliest, that he was not a strict contemporary (d. 1607), and
that his scheme had been very unpopular. This is proved by an anonymous
letter to the king, in which complaint is made that âthe âcovetous
bloody Pophamâ will ruin many poor men by his offer to drain the fensâ
(_Cal. State Papers_, Mar. 14?, 1606).

=Plutarchus Guilthead.= Fleayâs identification with Edmund Howes I am
prepared to accept, although biographical data are very meagre. Fleay
says: âPlutarchus Gilthead, who is writing the lives of the great
men in the city; the captain who writes of the Artillery Garden âto
train the youthâ, etc. [3. 2. 45], is, I think, Edmond Howes, whose
continuation of Stowâs Chronicle was published in 1615.â

Howesâ undertaking was a matter of considerable ridicule to his
acquaintances. In his 1631 edition he speaks of the heavy blows and
great discouragements he received from his friends. He was in the habit
of signing himself âGentlemanâ and this seems to be satirized in 3. 1,
where Guilthead says repeatedly: âThis is to make you a Gentlemanâ (see
_N. & Q._ 1st Ser. 6. 199.).

=The Noble House.= Two proposed identifications of the ânoble houseâ,
which pretends to a dukeâs title, mentioned at 2. 4. 15-6. have been
made. The expenditure of much energy in the attempt to fix so veiled
an allusion is hardly worth while. Jonson of course depended upon
contemporary rumor, for which we have no data.

Cunninghamâs suggestion that Buckingham is referred to is not
convincing. Buckinghamâs father was Sir George Villiers of Brooksby in
Leicestershire. He was not himself raised to the nobility until August
27, 1616, when he was created Viscount Villiers and Baron Waddon. It
was not until January 5, 1617 (not 1616, as Cunningham says), that he
became Earl of Buckingham, and it is unlikely that before this time
any allusion to Villiersâ aspiration to a dukedom would have been
intelligible to Jonsonâs audience.

Fleayâs theory that the ânoble houseâ was that of Stuart may be
accepted provisionally. Lodowick was made Earl of Richmond in 1613, and
Duke in 1623. He was acceptable to king and people, and in this very
year was made steward of the household.

    Purest lips, soft banks of blisses,
    Self alone deserving kisses.

Are not these lines from Jonsonâs hand? This was the year of his
collaboration with Marston in _Eastward Ho_.




D. AFTER-INFLUENCE OF THE DEVIL IS AN ASS


A few instances of the subsequent rehandling of certain motives in
this play are too striking to be completely overlooked. John Wilson,
1627-c 1696, a faithful student and close imitator of Jonson, produced
in 1690 a drama called _Belphegor_, or _The Marriage of the Devil,
a Tragi-comedy_. While it is founded on the English translation of
Machiavelliâs novella, which appeared in 1674, and closely adheres
to the lines of the original, it shows clear evidence of Jonsonâs
influence. The subject has been fully investigated by Hollstein (cf.
_VerhÃ¤ltnis_, pp. 22-24, 28-30, 35, 43, 50).

_The Cheats_, 1662, apparently refers to _The Devil is an Ass_ in
the _Prologue_. The characters of Bilboe and Titere Tu belong to the
same class of low bullies as Merecraft and Everill, but the evident
prototypes of these characters are Subtle and Face in _The Alchemist_.

A third play of Wilsonâs, _The Projectors_, 1664, shows unmistakable
influence of _The Devil is an Ass_. The chief object of satire is
of course the same, and the character of Sir Gudgeon Credulous is
modeled after that of Fitzdottrel. The scenes in which the projects are
explained, 2. 1 and 3. 1, are similar to the corresponding passages in
Jonson. The _Aulularia_ of Plautus is a partial source, so that the
play in some features resembles _The Case is Altered_. In 2. 1 Wilson
imitates the passage in the _Aulularia_, which closes Act 2. Sc. 1 of
_The Devil is an Ass_ (see note 2. 1. 168).

Brome, Jonsonâs old servant and friend, also handled the subject of
monopolies (see page lxi). Jonsonâs influence is especially marked in
_The Court Beggar_. The project of perukes (_Wks._ 1. 192) should be
compared with Merecraftâs project of toothpicks.

Mrs. Susanna Centlivreâs _Busie Body_ uses the motives borrowed from
Boccaccio (see pp. xlv ff.). The scenes in which these appear must have
been suggested by Jonsonâs play (Genest 2. 419), though the author
seems to have been acquainted with the _Decameron_ also. In Act. 1.
Sc. 1 Sir George Airy makes a bargain with Sir Francis Gripe similar
to Wittipolâs bargain with Fitzdottrel. In exchange for the sum of a
hundred guineas he is admitted into the house for the purpose of moving
his suit to Miranda. âfor the space of ten minutes, without lett or
molestationâ, provided Sir Francis remain in the same room, though out
of ear shot (2d ed., p. 8). In Act 2. Sc. 1 the bargain is carried out
in much the same way as in Boccaccio and in Jonson. Miranda remaining
dumb and Sir George answering for her.

In Act 3. Sc. 4 (2d ed., p. 38) Miranda in the presence of her
guardian sends a message by Marplot not to saunter at the garden gate
about eight oâclock as he has been accustomed to do, thus making an
assignation with him (compare _DA._ 2. 2. 52).

Other motives which seem to show some influence of _The Devil is an
Ass_ are Mirandaâs trick to have the estate settled upon her, Charlesâ
disguise as a Spaniard, and Traffickâs jealous care of Isabinda. The
character of Marplot as comic butt resembles that of Pug.

The song in _The Devil is an Ass_ 2. 6. 94 (see note) was imitated by
Sir John Suckling.




APPENDIX EXTRACTS FROM THE CRITICS


GIFFORD: There is much good writing in this comedy. All the speeches
of Satan are replete with the most biting satire, delivered with an
appropriate degree of spirit. Fitzdottrel is one of those characters
which Jonson delighted to draw, and in which he stood unrivalled, a
_gull_, i. e., a confident coxcomb, selfish, cunning, and conceited.
Mrs. Fitzdottrel possesses somewhat more interest than the generality
of our authorâs females, and is indeed a well sustained character. In
action the principal amusement of the scene (exclusive of the admirable
burlesque of witchery in the conclusion) was probably derived from the
mortification of poor Pug, whose stupid stare of amazement at finding
himself made an _ass_ of on every possible occasion must, if portrayed
as some then on the stage were well able to portray it, have been
exquisitely comic.

This play is strictly moral in its conception and conduct. Knavery and
folly are shamed and corrected, virtue is strengthened and rewarded,
and the ends of dramatic justice are sufficiently answered by the
simple exposure of those whose errors are merely subservient to the
minor interests of the piece.

HERFORD (_Studies in the Literary Relations of England and Germany_,
pp. 318-20): Jonson had in fact so far the Aristophanic quality of
genius, that he was at once a most elaborate and minute student of the
actual world, and a poet of the airiest and boldest fancy, and that he
loved to bring the two rÃ´les into the closest possible combination. No
one so capable of holding up the mirror to contemporary society without
distorting the slenderest thread of its complex tissue of usages; no
one, on the other hand, who so keenly delighted in startling away
the illusion or carefully undermining it by some palpably fantastic
invention. His most elaborate reproductions of the everyday world are
hardly ever without an infusion of equally elaborate caprice,--a leaven
of recondite and fantastic legend and grotesque myth, redolent of old
libraries and antique scholarship, furtively planted, as it were, in
the heart of that everyday world of London life, and so subtly blending
with it that the whole motley throng of merchants and apprentices,
gulls and gallants, discover nothing unusual in it, and engage with the
most perfectly matter of fact air in the business of working it out.
The purging of Crispinus in the _Poetaster_, the Aristophanic motive
of the _Magnetic Lady_, even the farcical horror of noise which is the
mainspring of the _EpicÅne_, are only less elaborate and sustained
examples of this fantastic realism than the adventure of a Stupid
Devil in the play before us. Nothing more anomalous in the London of
Jonsonâs day could be conceived; yet it is so managed that it loses
all its strangeness. So perfectly is the supernatural element welded
with the human, that it almost ceases to appear supernatural. Pug, the
hero of the adventure, is a pretty, petulant boy, more human by many
degrees than the half fairy Puck of Shakespeare, which doubtless helped
to suggest him, and the arch-fiend Satan is a bluff old politician,
anxious to ward off the perils of London from his young simpleton of a
son, who is equally eager to plunge into them. The old savage horror
fades away before Jonsonâs humanising touch, the infernal world loses
all its privilege of peculiar terror and strength, and sinks to the
footing of a mere rival state, whose merchandise can be kept out of the
market and its citizens put in the Counter or carted to Tyburn.

A. W. WARD (_Eng. Dram. Lit._, pp. 372-3): The oddly-named comedy
of _The Devil is an Ass_, acted in 1616, seems already to exhibit a
certain degree of decay in the dramatic powers which had so signally
called forth its predecessor. Yet this comedy possesses a considerable
literary interest, as adapting both to Jonsonâs dramatic method, and
to the general moral atmosphere of his age, a theme connecting itself
with some of the most notable creations of the earlier Elizabethan
drama.... The idea of the play is as healthy as its plot is ingenious;
but apart from the circumstance that the latter is rather slow in
preparation, and by no means, I think, gains in perspicuousness as it
proceeds, the design itself suffers from one radical mistake. Pugâs
intelligence is so much below par that he suffers as largely on account
of his clumsiness as on account of his viciousness, while remaining
absolutely without influence upon the course of the action. The comedy
is at the same time full of humor, particularly in the entire character
of Fitzdottrel.

SWINBURNE (_Study of Ben Jonson_, pp. 65-7): If _The Devil is an Ass_
cannot be ranked among the crowning masterpieces of its author, it is
not because the play shows any sign of decadence in literary power or
in humorous invention. The writing is admirable, the wealth of comic
matter is only too copious, the characters are as firm in outline or as
rich in color as any but the most triumphant examples of his satirical
or sympathetic skill in finished delineation and demarcation of humors.
On the other hand, it is of all Ben Jonsonâs comedies since the date
of _Cynthiaâs Revels_ the most obsolete in subject of satire, the most
temporary in its allusions and applications: the want of fusion or even
connection (except of the most mechanical or casual kind) between the
various parts of its structure and the alternate topics of its ridicule
makes the action more difficult to follow than that of many more
complicated plots: and, finally, the admixture of serious sentiment and
noble emotion is not so skilfully managed as to evade the imputation of
incongruity. [The dialogue between Lady Tailbush and Lady Eitherside
in Act 4. Sc. 1 has some touches âworthy of MoliÃ¨re himself.â In Act
4. Sc. 3 Mrs. Fitzdottrelâs speech possesses a âa noble and natural
eloquence,â but the character of her husband is âalmost too loathsome
to be ridiculous,â and unfit âfor the leading part in a comedy of
ethics as well as of morals.â] The prodigality of elaboration lavished
on such a multitude of subordinate characters, at the expense of all
continuous interest and to the sacrifice of all dramatic harmony, may
tempt the reader to apostrophize the poet in his own words:

    You are so covetous still to embrace
    More than you can, that you lose all.

Yet a word of parting praise must be given to Satan: a small part as
far as extent goes, but a splendid example of high comic imagination
after the order of Aristophanes, admirably relieved by the low comedy
of the asinine Pug and the voluble doggrel by the antiquated Vice.

    Hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh, hoh, &c.
    To earth? and, why to earth, thou foooliÅ¿h Spirit?
    What woldâÅ¿t thou do on earth?

                           PVG. For that, great Chiefe!
    As time Å¿hal work. I do but ask my monâth.
    Which euery petty _puiânee Diuell_ has;                          5
    Within that terme, the Court of _Hell_ will heare
    Some thing, may gaine a longer grant, perhaps.

    SAT. For what? the laming a poore Cow, or two?
    Entring a Sow, to make her caÅ¿t her farrow?
    Or croÅ¿Å¿ing of a Mercat-womans Mare,                            10
    Twixt this, and _Totnam_? theÅ¿e were wont to be
    Your maine atchieuements, _Pug_, You haue Å¿ome plot, now,
    Vpon a tonning of Ale, to Å¿tale the yeÅ¿t,
    Or keepe the churne Å¿o, that the buttter come not;
    Spight oâ the houÅ¿ewiues cord, or her hot Å¿pit?                 15
    Or Å¿ome good Ribibe, about _KentiÅ¿h_ Towne,
    Or _HogÅ¿den_, you would hang now, for a witch,
    BecauÅ¿e Å¿hee will not let you play round _Robbin_:
    And youâll goe Å¿owre the Citizens Creame âgainÅ¿t Sunday?
    That Å¿he may be accusâd forât, and condemnâd,                   20
    By a _MiddleÅ¿ex_ Iury, to the Å¿atisfaction
    Of their offended friends, the _Londiners_ wiues
    WhoÅ¿e teeth were Å¿et on edge with it? FooliÅ¿h feind,
    Stay iâ your place, know your owne Å¿trengths, and put not
    Beyond the Å¿pheare of your actiuity.                            25
    You are too dull a Diuell to be truÅ¿ted                   [96]
    Forth in thoÅ¿e parts, _Pug_, vpon any affayre
    That may concerne our name, on earth. It is not
    Euery ones worke. The Å¿tate of _Hell_ muÅ¿t care
    Whom it imployes, in point of reputation,                       30
    Heere about _London_. You would make, I thinke
    An Agent, to be Å¿ent, for _LancaÅ¿hire_,
    Proper inough; or Å¿ome parts of _Northumberland_,
    So yoâ had good inÅ¿tructions, _Pug_.

                                        PVG. _O Chiefe!_
    You doe not know, deare _Chiefe_, what there is in mee.          35
    Proue me but for a fortnight, for a weeke,
    And lend mee but a _Vice_, to carry with mee,
    To practice there-with any play-fellow,
    And, you will Å¿ee, there will come more vponât,
    Then youâll imagine, pretious _Chiefe_.

                     SAT. What _Vice_?                              40
    What kind wouldÅ¿t thâ haue it of?

                   PVG. Why, any _Fraud_;
    Or _CouetouÅ¿neÅ¿Å¿e_; or Lady _Vanity_;
    Or old _Iniquity_: Iâll call him hither.

    INI. What is he, calls vpon me, and would Å¿eeme to lack a _Vice_?
    Ere his words be halfe Å¿poken, I am with him in a trice;        45
    Here, there, and euery where, as the Cat is with the mice:
    True _vetus Iniquitas_. LackâÅ¿t thou Cards, friend, or Dice?
    I will teach thee cheate, Child, to cog, lye, and Å¿wagger,
    And euer and anon, to be drawing forth thy dagger:
    To Å¿weare by Gogs-nownes, like a lusty _Iuuentus_,              50
    In a cloake to thy heele, and a hat like a pent-houÅ¿e.
    Thy breeches of three fingers, and thy doublet all belly,
    With a Wench that shall feede thee, with cock-Å¿tones and gelly.

    PVG. Is it not excellent, _Chiefe_? how nimble he is!

    INI. Child of hell, this is nothing! I will fetch thee a leape  55
    From the top of _Pauls_-Å¿teeple, to the Standard in _Cheepe_:
    And lead thee a daunce, through the Å¿treets without faile,
    Like a needle of _Spaine_, with a thred at my tayle.
    We will Å¿uruay the _Suburbs_, and make forth our Å¿allyes,
    Downe _Petticoate-lane_, and vp the _Smock-allies_,             60
    To _Shoreditch_, _Whitechappell_, and so to Saint _Kathernes_.
    To drinke with the _Dutch_ there, and take forth their patternes:
    From thence, wee will put in at _CuÅ¿tome-houÅ¿e_ key there,
    And Å¿ee, how the Factors, and Prentizes play there,
    FalÅ¿e with their MaÅ¿ters; and gueld many a full packe,          65
    To Å¿pend it in pies, at the _Dagger_, and the _Wool-Å¿acke_.

    PVG. Braue, braue, _Iniquity_! will not this doe, _Chiefe_?

    INI. Nay, boy, I wil bring thee to the Bawds, and the RoyÅ¿ters,
    At _Belins-gate_, feaÅ¿ting with claret-wine, and oyÅ¿ters,
    From thence Å¿hoot the _Bridge_, childe, to the Cranes
               iâ the _Vintry_,                                     70
    And Å¿ee, there the gimblets, how they make their entry!
    Or, if thou hadÅ¿t rather, to the _Strand_ downe to fall,
    âGainÅ¿t the Lawyers come dabled from _WeÅ¿tminÅ¿ter-hall_   [97]
    And marke how they cling, with their clyents together,
    Like Iuie to Oake; so Veluet to Leather:                        75
    Ha, boy, I would Å¿hew thee.

             PVG. Rare, rare!

                             DIV. Peace, dotard,
    And thou more ignorant thing, that Å¿o admirâÅ¿t.
    Art thou the Å¿pirit thou Å¿eemâÅ¿t? Å¿o poore? to chooÅ¿e
    This, for a _Vice_, tâaduance the cauÅ¿e of _Hell_,
    Now? as Vice Å¿tands this preÅ¿ent yeere? Remember,               80
    What number it is. _Six hundred_ and _Å¿ixteene_.
    Had it but beene _fiue hundred_, though Å¿ome _Å¿ixty_
    Aboue; thatâs _fifty_ yeeres agone, and _Å¿ix_,
    (When euery great man had his _Vice_ Å¿tand by him,
    In his long coat, Å¿haking his wooden dagger)                    85
    I could conÅ¿ent, that, then this your graue choice
    Might haue done that with his Lord _Chiefe_, the which
    MoÅ¿t of his chamber can doe now. But _Pug_,
    As the times are, who is it, will receiue you?
    What company will you goe to? or whom mix with?                 90
    Where canÅ¿t thou carry him? except to Tauernes?
    To mount vp ona joynt-Å¿toole, with a _Iewes_-trumpe,
    To put downe _Cokeley_, and that muÅ¿t be to Citizens?
    He neâre will be admitted, there, where _Vennor_ comes.
    Hee may perchance, in taile of a Sheriffes dinner,              95
    Skip with a rime oâ the Table, from _New-nothing_,
    And take his _Almaine_-leape into a cuÅ¿tard,
    Shall make my Lad _MaioreÅ¿Å¿e_, and her Å¿iÅ¿ters,
    Laugh all their hoods ouer their shoulders. But,
    This is not that will doe, they are other things               100
    That are receiuâd now vpon earth, for Vices;
    Stranger, and newer: and changâd euery houre.
    They ride âhem like their horÅ¿es off their legges,
    And here they come to _Hell_, whole legions of âhem,
    Euery weeke tyrâd. Wee, Å¿till Å¿triue to breed,                 105
    And reare âhem vp new ones; but they doe not Å¿tand,
    When they come there: they turne âhem on our hands.
    And it is fearâd they haue a Å¿tud oâ their owne
    Will put downe ours. Both our breed, and trade
    VVill Å¿uddenly decay, if we preuent not.                        110
    VnleÅ¿Å¿e it be a _Vice_ of quality,
    Or faÅ¿hion, now, they take none from vs. Car-men
    Are got into the yellow Å¿tarch, and Chimney-Å¿weepers
    To their tabacco, and Å¿trong-waters, _Hum_,
    _Meath_, and _Obarni_. VVe muÅ¿t therefore ayme                 115
    At extraordinary Å¿ubtill ones, now,
    When we doe Å¿end to keepe vs vp in credit.
    Not old _Iniquities_. Get you eâne backe, Sir,
    To making of your rope of Å¿and againe.
    You are not for the manners, nor the times:             [98]   120
    They haue their _Vices_, there, moÅ¿t like to _Vertues_;
    You cannnot know âhem, apart, by any difference:
    They weare the Å¿ame clothes, eate the Å¿ame meate,
    Sleepe iâ the Å¿elfe-Å¿ame beds, rid iâ thoÅ¿e coaches.
    Or very like, foure horÅ¿es in a coach,                         125
    As the beÅ¿t men and women. TiÅ¿Å¿ue gownes,
    Garters and roÅ¿es, foureÅ¿core pound a paire,
    Embroydred Å¿tockings, cut-worke Å¿mocks, and Å¿hirts,
    More certaine marks of lechery, now, and pride,
    Then ere they were of true nobility!                           130
    But _Pug_, Å¿ince you doe burne with Å¿uch deÅ¿ire
    To doe the Common-wealth of Hell Å¿ome Å¿eruice;
    I am content, aÅ¿Å¿uming of a body,
    You goe to earth, and viÅ¿it men, a day.
    But you muÅ¿t take a body ready made, _Pug_,                    135
    I can create you none: nor Å¿hall you forme
    Your Å¿elfe an aery one, but become Å¿ubiect
    To all impreÅ¿Å¿ion of the fleÅ¿h, you take,
    So farre as humane frailty. So, this morning,
    There is a handÅ¿ome CutpurÅ¿e hangâd at _Tiborne_,              140
    WhoÅ¿e Å¿pirit departed, you may enter his body:
    For clothes imploy your credit, with the Hangman,
    Or let our tribe of Brokers furniÅ¿h you.
    And, looke, how farre your Å¿ubtilty can worke
    Thorow thoÅ¿e organs, with that body, Å¿pye                      145
    AmongÅ¿t mankind, (you cannot there want vices,
    And therefore the leÅ¿Å¿e need to carry âhem wiâ you)
    But as you make your Å¿oone at nights relation,
    And we Å¿hall find, it merits from the State,
    Your Å¿hall haue both truÅ¿t from vs, and imployment.            150

    PVG. Most gracious _Chiefe_!

                 DIV. Onely, thus more I bind you,
    To Å¿erue the firÅ¿t man that you meete; and him
    Iâle Å¿hew you, now: Obserue him. Yonâ is hee,
                _He Å¿hewes_ Fitz-dottrel _to him, comming forth_.
    You Å¿hall Å¿ee, firÅ¿t, after your clothing. Follow him:
    But once engagâd, there you muÅ¿t Å¿tay and fixe;
    Not Å¿hift, vntill the midnights cocke doe crow.

    PVG. Any conditions to be gone.

                   DIV. Away, then.                                157

    I, they doe, now, name _Bretnor_, as before,              [97]
    They talkâd of _GreÅ¿ham_, and of Doctor _Fore-man_,
    _Francklin_, and _Fiske_, and _Sauory_ (he was in too)
    But thereâs not one of theÅ¿e, that euer could
    Yet Å¿hew a man the _Diuell_, in true Å¿ort.                       5
    They haue their chriÅ¿talls, I doe know, and rings,
    And virgin parchment, and their dead-mens Å¿culls
    Their rauens wings, their lights, and _pentacles_,
    With _characters_; I haâ Å¿eene all theÅ¿e. But--
    Would I might Å¿ee the _Diuell_. I would giue                    10
    A hundred oâ theÅ¿e pictures, to Å¿ee him
    Once out of picture. May I proue a cuckold,
    (And thatâs the one maine mortall thing I feare)
    If I beginne not, now, to thinke, the Painters
    Haue onely made him. âSlight, he would be Å¿eene,                15
    One time or other elÅ¿e. He would not let
    An ancient gentleman, of a good houÅ¿e,
    As moÅ¿t are now in _England_, the _Fitz-Dottrelâs_
    Runne wilde, and call vpon him thus in vaine,
    As I haâ done this twelue moneâth. If he be not,                20
    At all, why, are there Coniurers? If they be not,
    Why, are there lawes againÅ¿t âhem? The beÅ¿t artiÅ¿ts
    Of _Cambridge_, _Oxford_, _Middlesex_, and _London_,
    _Essex_, and _Kent_, I haue had in pay to raiÅ¿e him,
    TheÅ¿e fifty weekes, and yet hâappeares not. âSdeath,            25
    I Å¿hall Å¿uÅ¿pect, they, can make circles onely
    Shortly, and know but his hard names. They doe Å¿ay,
    Hâwill meet a man (of himÅ¿elfe) that has a mind to him.
    If hee would Å¿o, I haue a minde and a halfe for him:
    He Å¿hould not be long abÅ¿ent. Pray thee, come                   30
    I long for thee. Anâ I were with child by him,
    And my wife too; I could not more. Come, yet,
                        _He expreÅ¿Å¿es a longing to Å¿ee the Diuell_
    Good _Beelezebub_. Were hee a kinde diuell,
    And had humanity in him, hee would come, but
    To Å¿aue ones longing. I Å¿hould vÅ¿e him well,                    35
    I Å¿weare, and with reÅ¿pect (would he would try mee)
    Not, as the Conjurers doe, when they haâ raisâd him.
    Get him in bonds, and Å¿end him poÅ¿t, on errands.
    A thouÅ¿and miles, it is prepoÅ¿terous, that;              [100]
    And I beleeue, is the true cauÅ¿e he comes not.                  40
    And hee has reaÅ¿on. Who would be engagâd,
    That might liue freely, as he may doe? I Å¿weare,
    They are wrong all. The burnât child dreads the fire.
    They doe not know to entertaine the _Diuell_.
    I would Å¿o welcome him, obÅ¿erue his diet,                       45
    Get him his chamber hung with _arras_, two of âhem,
    Iâ my own houÅ¿e; lend him my wiues wrought pillowes:
    And as I am an honeÅ¿t man, I thinke,
    If he had a minde to her, too; I should grant him,
    To make our friend-Å¿hip perfect. So I would not                 50
    To euery man. If hee but heare me, now?
    And Å¿hould come to mee in a braue young Å¿hape,
    And take me at my word? ha! Who is this?

PVG.   FITZ-DOTTRELL.

    Sir, your good pardon, that I thus preÅ¿ume
    Vpon your priuacy. I am borne a Gentleman,
    A younger brother; but, in Å¿ome diÅ¿grace,
    Now, with my friends: and want Å¿ome little meanes,
    To keepe me vpright, while things be reconcilâd.                 5
    PleaÅ¿e you, to let my Å¿eruice be of vÅ¿e to you, Sir.

    FIT. Seruice? âfore hell, my heart was at my mouth,
    Till I had viewâd his Å¿hooes well: for, thoÅ¿e roÅ¿es
    Were bigge inough to hide a clouen foote.
                _Hee lookes and Å¿uruayâs his feet: ouer and ouer._
    No, friend, my numberâs full. I haue one Å¿eruant,               10
    Who is my all, indeed; and, from the broome
    Vnto the bruÅ¿h: for, iuÅ¿t so farre, I truÅ¿t him.
    He is my Ward-robe man, my Cater, Cooke,
    Butler, and Steward; lookes vnto my horÅ¿e:
    And helpes to watch my wife. Hâhas all the places,              15
    That I can thinke on, from the garret downward,
    Eâen to the manger, and the curry-combe.

    PVG. Sir, I Å¿hall put your worÅ¿hip to no charge,
    More then my meate, and that but very little,
    Iâle Å¿erue you for your loue.

                               FIT. Ha? without wages?              20
    Iâle harken oâ that eare, were I at leaÅ¿ure.
    But now, Iâm buÅ¿ie. âPrây the, friend forbeare mee,
    Andâ thou hadÅ¿t beene a _Diuell_, I Å¿hould Å¿ay             [101]
    Somewhat more to thee. Thou doÅ¿t hinder, now,
    My meditations.

           PVG. Sir, I am a _Diuell_. 25

    FIT. How!

           PVG. A true _Diuell_, S^r.

    Vnder your fauour, friend, for, Iâll not quarrell.
    I lookâd oâ your feet, afore, you cannot coozen mee,
    Your Å¿hooâs not clouen, Sir, you are whole hoofâd.
                                    _He viewes his feete againe._
    PVG. Sir, thatâs a popular error, deceiues many:                30
    But I am that, I tell you.

           FIT. Whatâs your name?

    PVG. My name is _Diuell_, S^r.

           FIT. SaiâÅ¿t thou true.

                   PVG. in-deed, S^r.

    FIT. âSlid! thereâs Å¿ome _omen_ iâ this! what countryman?

    PVG. Of _Derby-Å¿hire_, S^r. about the _Peake_.

                  FIT. That Hole
    Belongâd to your AnceÅ¿tors?

                    PVG. Yes, _Diuells_ arÅ¿e, S^r.                  35

    And turne away my tother man? and Å¿aue
    Foure pound a yeere by that? thereâs lucke, and thrift too!
    The very _Diuell_ may come, heereafter, as well.
    Friend, I receiue you: but (withall) I acquaint you,            40
    Aforehand, if yoâ offend mee, I muÅ¿t beat you.
    It is a kinde of exerciÅ¿e, I vÅ¿e.

INGINE.   WITTIPOL.   MANLY.
   FITZDOTTRELL.   PVG.

    Yonder hee walkes, Sir, Iâll goe lift him for you.

    WIT. To him, good _Ingine_, raiÅ¿e him vp by degrees,
    Gently, and hold him there too, you can doe it.
    Shew your Å¿elfe now, a _Mathematicall_ broker.

    ING. Iâll warrant you for halfe a piece.

                 WIT. âTis done, S^r.                                5

    MAN. Isât poÅ¿Å¿ible there Å¿hould be Å¿uch a man?

    WIT. You Å¿hall be your owne witneÅ¿Å¿e, Iâll not labour
    To tempt you paÅ¿t your faith.

           MAN. And is his wife
    So very handÅ¿ome, Å¿ay you?

                        WIT. I haâ not Å¿eene her,
    Since I came home from trauell: and they Å¿ay,                   10
    Shee is not alterâd. Then, before I went,
    I Å¿aw her once; but Å¿o, as Å¿hee hath Å¿tuck
    Still iâ my view, no obiect hath remouâd her.

    MAN. âTis a faire gueÅ¿t, Friend, beauty: and once lodgâd  [102]
    Deepe in the eyes, Å¿hee hardly leaues the Inne.                 15
    How doâs he keepe her?

                         WIT. Very braue. Howeuer,
    Himselfe be fordide, hee is Å¿enÅ¿uall that way.
    In euery dreÅ¿Å¿ing, hee doâs Å¿tudy her.

    MAN. And furniÅ¿h forth himselfe Å¿o from the _Brokers_?

    WIT. Yes, thatâs a hyrâd Å¿uite, hee now has one,                20
    To Å¿ee the _Diuell_ is an _AÅ¿Å¿e_, to day, in:
    (This _Ingine_ gets three or foure pound a weeke by him)
    He dares not miÅ¿Å¿e a new _Play_, or a _FeaÅ¿t_,
    What rate Å¿oeuer clothes be at; and thinkes
    HimÅ¿elfe Å¿till new, in other mens old.

           MAN. But Å¿tay,                                           25
    Doâs he loue meat Å¿o?

               WIT. Faith he doâs not hate it.
    But thatâs not it. His belly and his palate
    Would be compounded with for reaÅ¿on. Mary,
    A wit he has, of that Å¿trange credit with him,
    âGainÅ¿t all mankinde; as it doth make him doe                   30
    IuÅ¿t what it liÅ¿t: it rauiÅ¿hes him forth,
    Whither it pleaÅ¿e, to any aÅ¿Å¿emblyâor place,
    And would conclude him ruinâd, Å¿hould hee Å¿cape
    One publike meeting, out of the beliefe
    He has of his owne great, and Catholike Å¿trengths,              35
    In arguing, and diÅ¿courÅ¿e. It takes, I Å¿ee:
    Hâhas got the cloak vpon him.

         Ingine _hath won_ Fitzdottrel, _to âÅ¿ay on the cloake_.

      FIT. A faire garment,
    By my faith, _Ingine_!

                             ING. It was neuer made, Sir,
    For three Å¿core pound, I aÅ¿Å¿ure you: âTwill yeeld thirty.
    The pluÅ¿h, Sir, coÅ¿t three pound, ten Å¿hillings a yard!         40
    And then the lace, and veluet.

                         FIT. I Å¿hall, _Ingine_,
    Be lookâd at, pretitly, in it! Art thou Å¿ure
    The _Play_ is playâd to day?

           ING. O hereâs the bill, S^r.
                              _Hee giues him the_ Play-_bill_.
    Iâ, had forgot to giât you.

                         FIT. Ha? the _Diuell_!
    I will not loÅ¿e you, Sirah! But, _Ingine_, thinke you,          45
    The Gallant is Å¿o furious in his folly?
    So mad vpon the matter, that heeâll part
    Withâs cloake vpoâ theÅ¿e termes?

                 ING. TruÅ¿t not your _Ingine_,
    Breake me to pieces elÅ¿e, as you would doe
    A rotten _Crane_, or an old ruÅ¿ty _Iacke_,                      50
    That has not one true wheele in him. Doe but talke with him.

    FIT. I Å¿hall doe that, to Å¿atisfie you, _Ingine_,
    And my Å¿elfe too. With your leaue, Gentlemen.
                                     _Hee turnes to_ Wittipol.
    Which of you is it, is Å¿o meere Idolater
    To my wiues beauty, and Å¿o very prodigall                       55
    Vnto my patience, that, for the Å¿hort parlee?
    Of one Å¿wift houres quarter, with my wife,
    He will depart with (let mee Å¿ee) this cloake here
    The price of folly? Sir, are you the man?

    WIT. I am that ventârer, Sir.

          FIT. Good time! your name                                 60
    Is _Witty-pol_?

           WIT. The Å¿ame, S^r.

                FIT. And âtis told me,                       [103]
    Yoâ haue trauellâd lately?

                     WIT. That I haue, S^r.

                               FIT. Truly,
    Your trauells may haue alterâd your complexion;
    But Å¿ure, your wit Å¿tood Å¿till.

          WIT. It may well be, Sir.
    All heads haâ not like growth.

                          FIT. The good mans grauity,               65
    That left you land, your father, neuer taught you
    TheÅ¿e pleaÅ¿ant matches?

          WIT. No, nor can his mirth,
    With whom I make âhem, put me off.

       FIT. You are
    ReÅ¿oluâd then?

            WIT. Yes, S^r.

                        FIT. Beauty is the _Saint_,
    Youâll Å¿acrifice your Å¿elfe, into the Å¿hirt too?                70

    WIT. So I may Å¿till cloth, and keepe warme your wiÅ¿dome?

    FIT. You lade me S^r!

           WIT. I know what you wil beare, S^r.

    FIT. Well, to the point. âTis only, Sir, you Å¿ay,
    To Å¿peake vnto my wife?

            WIT. Only, to Å¿peake to her.

    FIT. And in my preÅ¿ence?

            WIT. In your very preÅ¿ence.                             75

    FIT. And in my hearing?

            WIT. In your hearing: Å¿o,
    You interrupt vs not.

                     FIT. For the Å¿hort Å¿pace
    You doe demand, the fourth part of an houre,
    I thinke I Å¿hall, with Å¿ome conuenient Å¿tudy,
    And this good helpe to boot, bring my Å¿elfe toât.               80

                           _Hee Å¿hrugs himÅ¿elfe vp in the cloake._

    WIT. I aske no more.

               FIT. PleaÅ¿e you, walk toâard my houÅ¿e,
    Speake what you liÅ¿t; that time is yours: My right
    I haue departed with. But, not beyond,
    A minute, or a Å¿econd, looke for. Length,
    And drawing out, maâaduance much, to theÅ¿e matches.             85
    And I except all kiÅ¿Å¿ing. KiÅ¿Å¿es are
    Silent petitions Å¿till with willing _Louers_.

    WIT. _Louers?_ How falls that oâ your phantÅ¿ie?

                             FIT. Sir.
    I doe know Å¿omewhat. I forbid all lip-worke.

    WIT. I am not eager at forbidden dainties.                      90
    Who couets vnfit things, denies him Å¿elfe.

    FIT. You Å¿ay well, Sir, âTwas prettily Å¿aid, that Å¿ame,
    He doâs, indeed. Iâll haue no touches, therefore,
    Nor takings by the armes, nor tender circles
    CaÅ¿t âbout the waÅ¿t, but all be done at diÅ¿tance.               95
    Loue is brought vp with thoÅ¿e Å¿oft _migniard_ handlings;
    His pulÅ¿e lies in his palme: and I defend
    All melting ioynts, and fingers, (thatâs my bargaine)
    I doe defend âhem, any thing like action.
    But talke, Sir, what you will. VÅ¿e all the _Tropes_            100
    And _Schemes_, that Prince _Quintilian_ can afford you:
    And much good do your _Rhetoriques_ heart. You are welcome, Sir.
    _Ingine_, God bâwâyou.

              WIT. Sir, I muÅ¿t condition
    To haue this Gentleman by, a witneÅ¿Å¿e.

               FIT. Well,
    I am content, Å¿o he be Å¿ilent.

                  MAN. Yes, S r.                                   105

    FIT. Come _Diuell_, Iâll make you roome, Å¿treight.
    But Iâll Å¿hew you
    FirÅ¿t, to your MiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e, whoâs no common one,
    You muÅ¿t conceiue, that brings this game to Å¿ee her.      [104]
    I hope thouâÅ¿t brought me good lucke.

                                  FIT. Wife,
    I do not know, that I haue lent it forth

    Or that Iâhaue eat or drunke the thing, of late,                 5

    Obey, it is thy vertue: hold no acts

    If I haue haue a longing to haue one tale more
    Goe of mee, what is that to thee, deare heart?
    Why Å¿houldÅ¿t thou enuy my delight? or croÅ¿Å¿e it?
    By being Å¿olicitous, when it not concernes thee?

    M^rs. FI. Yes, I haue Å¿hare in this. The Å¿corne will fall       15
    As bittterly on me, where both are laught at.

    Your families in _France_, wife, Å¿end not forth                 20
    Something, within the Å¿euen yeere, may be laught at?
    I doe not Å¿ay Å¿euen moneths, nor Å¿euen weekes,

    I giue âhem time. Once, within Å¿euen yeere,
    I thinke they may doe Å¿omething may be laught at.               25

    Let them that liÅ¿t, laugh Å¿till, rather then weepe
    For me; Heere is a cloake coÅ¿t fifty pound, wife,
    Which I can Å¿ell for thirty, when I haâ Å¿eene
    All _London_ inât, and _London_ has Å¿eene mee.                  30
    To day, I goe to the _Black-fryers Play-houÅ¿e_,
    Sit ithe view, Å¿alute all my acquaintance,
    RiÅ¿e vp betweene the _Acts_, let fall my cloake,
    PubliÅ¿h a handÅ¿ome man, and a rich Å¿uite
    (As thatâs a Å¿peciall end, why we goe thither,                  35
    All that pretend, to Å¿tand forât oâ the _Stage_)
    The Ladies aske whoâs that? (For, they doe come         [106]
    To Å¿ee vs, _Loue_, as wee doe to Å¿ee them)
    Now, I Å¿hall loÅ¿e all this, for the falÅ¿e feare
    Of being laught at? Yes, wuÅ¿Å¿e. Let âhem laugh, wife,           40
    Let me haue Å¿uch another cloake to morrow.
    And let âhem laugh againe, wife, and againe,
    And then grow fat with laughing, and then fatter,
    All my young Gallants, let âhem bring their friends too:
    Shall I forbid âhem? No, let heauen forbid âhem:                45
    Or wit, ifât haue any charge on âhem. Come, thy eare, wife,
    Is all, Iâll borrow of thee. Set your watch, Sir,
    Thou, onely art to heare, not Å¿peake a word, _Doue_,
    To ought he Å¿ayes. That I doe giâ you in precept,
    No leÅ¿Å¿e then councell, on your wiue-hood, wife,                50
    Not though he flatter you, or make court, or _Loue_
    (As you muÅ¿t looke for theÅ¿e) or Å¿ay, he raile;
    What ere his arts be, wife, I will haue thee
    Delude âhem with a trick, thy obÅ¿tinate Å¿ilence;
    I know aduantages; and I loue to hit                            55
    TheÅ¿e pragmaticke young men, at their owne weapons.
    Is your watch ready? Here my Å¿aile beares, for you:
    Tack toward him, Å¿weet _Pinnace_, whereâs your watch?

            _He diÅ¿poÅ¿es his wife to his place, and Å¿ets his watch._

    WIT. Iâle Å¿et it. Sir, with yours.

                 M^rs. FI. I muÅ¿t obey.

    MAN. Her modeÅ¿ty Å¿eemes to Å¿uffer with her beauty,              60
    And Å¿o, as if his folly were away,
    It were worth pitty.

              FIT. Now, thâare right, beginne, Sir.
    But firÅ¿t, let me repeat the contract, briefely.
                               _Hee repeats his contract againe._
    I am, Sir, to inioy this cloake, I Å¿tand in,
    Freely, and as your gift; vpon condition                        65
    You may as freely, Å¿peake here to my Å¿pouÅ¿e,
    Your quarter of an houre alwaies keeping
    The meaÅ¿urâd diÅ¿tance of your yard, or more,
    From my Å¿aid SpouÅ¿e: and in my Å¿ight and hearing.
    This is your couenant?

             WIT. Yes, but youâll allow                             70
    For this time Å¿pent, now?

                  FIT. Set âhem Å¿o much backe.

    WIT. I thinke, I Å¿hall not need it.

                          FIT. Well, begin, Sir,
    There is your bound, Sir. Not beyond that ruÅ¿h.

    WIT. If you interrupt me, Sir, I Å¿hall diÅ¿cloake you.
                                             Wittipol _beginnes_.
    The time I haue purchaÅ¿t, Lady, is but Å¿hort;                   75
    And, therefore, if I imploy it thriftily,
    I hope I Å¿tand the neerer to my pardon.
    I am not here, to tell you, you are faire,
    Or louely, or how well you dreÅ¿Å¿e you, Lady,
    Iâll Å¿aue my Å¿elfe that eloquence of your glaÅ¿Å¿e,               80
    Which can Å¿peake these things better to you then I.
    And âtis a knowledge, wherein fooles may be
    As wiÅ¿e as a _Count Parliament_. Nor come I,
    With any preiudice, or doubt, that you                  [107]
    Should, to the notice of your owne worth, neede                 85
    LeaÅ¿t reuelation. Sheeâs a Å¿imple woman,
    Knowâs not her good: (who euer knowes her ill)
    And at all caracts. That you are the wife,
    To Å¿o much blaÅ¿ted fleÅ¿h, as Å¿carce hath Å¿oule,
    In Å¿tead of Å¿alt, to keepe it Å¿weete; I thinke,                 90
    Will aske no witneÅ¿Å¿es, to proue. The cold
    Sheetes that you lie in, with the watching candle,
    That Å¿ees, how dull to any thaw of beauty,
    Pieces, and quarters, halfe, and whole nights, Å¿ometimes,
    The Diuell-giuen _Elfine_ Squire, your husband,                 95
    Doth leaue you, quitting heere his proper circle,
    For a much-worÅ¿e iâ the walks of _Lincolnes Inne_,
    Vnder the Elmes, tâexpect the feind in vaine, there
    Will confeÅ¿Å¿e for you.

           FIT. I did looke for this geere.

    WIT. And what a daughter of darkneÅ¿Å¿e, he doâs make you,       100
    Lockâd vp from all Å¿ociety, or object;
    Your eye not let to looke vpon a face,
    Vnder a Conjurers (or Å¿ome mould for one,
    Hollow, and leane like his) but, by great meanes,
    As I now make; your owne too Å¿enÅ¿ible Å¿ufferings,              105
    Without the extraordinary aydes,
    Of Å¿pells, or Å¿pirits, may aÅ¿Å¿ure you, Lady.
    For my part, I proteÅ¿t âgainÅ¿t all Å¿uch practice,
    I worke by no falÅ¿e arts, medicines, or charmes
    To be said forward and backward.

            FIT. No, I except:                                     110

    WIT. Sir I Å¿hall ease you.

                                   _He offers to diÅ¿cloake him._

            FIT. Mum.

                       WIT. Nor haue I ends, Lady,
    Vpon you, more then this: to tell you how _Loue_
    Beauties good Angell, he that waits vpon her
    At all occaÅ¿ions, and no leÅ¿Å¿e then _Fortune_,
    Helps thâ aduenturous, in mee makes that proffer,              115
    Which neuer faire one was Å¿o fond, to loÅ¿e;
    Who could but reach a hand forth to her freedome:
    On the firÅ¿t Å¿ight, I louâd you: Å¿ince which time,
    Though I haue trauellâd, I haue beene in trauell
    More for this second blessing of your eyes                     120
    Which now Iâhaue purchasâd, then for all aymes elÅ¿e.
    Thinke of it, Lady, be your minde as actiue,
    As is your beauty: view your object well.
    Examine both my faÅ¿hion, and my yeeres;
    Things, that are like, are Å¿oone familiar:                     125
    And Nature ioyes, Å¿till in equality.
    Let not the Å¿igne oâ the husband fright you, Lady.
    But ere your Å¿pring be gone, inioy it. Flowers,
    Though faire, are oft but of one morning. Thinke,
    All beauty doth not laÅ¿t vntill the _autumne_.                 130
    You grow old, while I tell you this. And Å¿uch,          [108]
    As cannot vÅ¿e the preÅ¿ent, are not wiÅ¿e.
    If Loue and Fortune will take care of vs,
    Why Å¿hould our will be wanting? This is all.
    What doe you anÅ¿wer, Lady?

                                        _Shee stands mute._

                       FIT. Now, the sport comes.                  135
    Let him Å¿till waite, waite, waite: while the watch goes,
    And the time runs. Wife!

                       WIT. How! not any word?
    Nay, then, I taÅ¿te a tricke inât. Worthy Lady,
    I cannot be Å¿o falÅ¿e to mine owne thoughts
    Of your preÅ¿umed goodneÅ¿Å¿e, to conceiue                        140
    This, as your rudeneÅ¿Å¿e, which I Å¿eeâs imposâd.
    Yet, Å¿ince your cautelous _Iaylor_, here Å¿tands by you,
    And yoâ are deniâd the liberty oâ the houÅ¿e,
    Let me take warrant, Lady, from your Å¿ilence,
    (Which euer is interpreted conÅ¿ent)                            145
    To make your anÅ¿wer for you: which Å¿hall be
    To as good purpoÅ¿e, as I can imagine,
    And what I thinke youâld Å¿peake.

             FIT. No, no, no, no.

    WIT. I Å¿hall reÅ¿ume, S^r.

             MAN. Sir, what doe you meane?

                  _He Å¿ets_ M^r. Manly, _his friend, in her place_.

    WIT. One interruption more, Sir, and you goe                   150
    Into your hoÅ¿e and doublet, nothing Å¿aues you.
    And therefore harken. This is for your wife.

    MAN. You muÅ¿t play faire, S^r.

                   WIT. Stand for mee, good friend.
                                           _And Å¿peaks for her._
    Troth, Sir, tis more then true, that you haue vttred
    Of my vnequall, and Å¿o Å¿ordide match heere,                    155
    With all the circumÅ¿tances of my bondage.
    I haue a husband, and a two-leggâd one,
    But Å¿uch a moon-ling, as no wit of man
    Or roÅ¿es can redeeme from being an AÅ¿Å¿e.
    Hâis growne too much, the Å¿tory of mens mouthes,               160
    To Å¿cape his lading: Å¿hould I makeât my Å¿tudy,
    And lay all wayes, yea, call mankind to helpe,
    To take his burden off, why, this one act
    Of his, to let his wife out to be courted,
    And, at a price, proclaimes his aÅ¿inine nature                 165
    So lowd, as I am weary of my title to him.
    But Sir, you Å¿eeme a Gentleman of vertue,
    No leÅ¿Å¿e then blood; and one that euery way
    Lookes as he were of too good quality,
    To intrap a credulous woman, or betray her:                    170
    Since you haue payd thus deare, Sir, for a viÅ¿it,
    And made Å¿uch venter, on your wit, and charge
    Meerely to Å¿ee mee, or at moÅ¿t to Å¿peake to mee,
    I were too Å¿tupid; or (whatâs worÅ¿e) ingrate
    Not to returne your venter. Thinke, but how,                   175
    I may with Å¿afety doe it; I Å¿hall truÅ¿t
    My loue and honour to you, and preÅ¿ume;
    Youâll euer huÅ¿band both, againÅ¿t this huÅ¿band;        [109]
    Who, if we chance to change his liberall eares,
    To other enÅ¿ignes, and with labour make                        180
    A new beaÅ¿t of him, as hee Å¿hall deÅ¿erue,
    Cannot complaine, hee is vnkindly dealth with.
    This day hee is to goe to a new play, Sir.
    From whence no feare, no, nor authority,
    Scarcely the _Kings_ command, Sir, will reÅ¿traine him,         185
    Now you haue fitted him with a _Stage_-garment,
    For the meere names Å¿ake, were there nothing elÅ¿e:
    And many more Å¿uch iourneyes, hee will make.
    Which, if they now, or, any time heereafter,
    Offer vs opportunity, you heare, Sir,                          190
    Whoâll be as glad, and forward to imbrace,
    Meete, and enioy it chearefully as you.
    I humbly thanke you, Lady.

                       _Hee Å¿hifts to his owne place againe_

              FIT. Keepe your ground Sir.

    WIT. Will you be lightned?

              FIT. Mum.

                                    WIT. And but I am,
    By the Å¿ad contract, thus to take my leaue of you              195
    At this Å¿o enuious distance, I had taught
    Our lips ere this, to Å¿eale the happy mixture
    Made of our Å¿oules. But we muÅ¿t both, now, yeeld
    To the neceÅ¿Å¿ity. Doe not thinke yet, Lady,
    But I can kiÅ¿Å¿e, and touch, and laugh, and whiÅ¿per,            200
    And doe those crowning court-Å¿hips too, for which,
    Day, and the publike haue allowâd no name
    But, now, my bargaine binds me. âTwere rude iniury,
    Tâimportune more, or vrge a noble nature,
    To what of itâs owne bounty it is prone to:                    205
    ElÅ¿e, I Å¿hould Å¿peake--But, Lady, I loue Å¿o well,
    As I will hope, youâll doe Å¿o to. I haue done, Sir.

    FIT. Well, then, I haâ won?

               WIT. Sir, And I may win, too.

    FIT. O yes! no doubt onât. Iâll take carefull order,
    That Å¿hee Å¿hall hang forth enÅ¿ignes at the window,             210
    To tell you when I am abÅ¿ent. Or Iâll keepe
    Three or foure foote-men, ready Å¿till of purpoÅ¿e,
    To runne and fetch you, at her longings, Sir.
    Iâll goe beÅ¿peake me Å¿traight a guilt caroch,
    For her and you to take the ayre in. Yes,                      215
    Into _Hide-parke_, and thence into _Black-Fryers_,
    ViÅ¿it the painters, where you may Å¿ee pictures,
    And note the propereÅ¿t limbs, and how to make âhem.
    Or what doe you Å¿ay vnto a middling GoÅ¿Å¿ip
    To bring you aye together, at her lodging?                     220
    Vnder pretext of teaching oâ my wife
    Some rare receit of drawing _almond_ milke? ha?
    It shall be a part of my care. Good Sir, God bâwâyou.
    I haâ kept the contract, and the cloake is mine.

    WIT. Why, much good doât you S^r; it may fall out,     [110]   225
    That you haâ bought it deare, though I haâ not Å¿old it.

    FIT. A pretty riddle! Fare you well, good Sir.
    Wife, your face this way, looke on me: and thinke
    Yoâ haue had a wicked dreame, wife, and forget it.

                                     _Hee turnes his wife about._

    MAN. This is the Å¿trangeÅ¿t motion I ere Å¿aw.                   230

    FIT. Now, wife, Å¿its this faire cloake the worÅ¿e vpon me,
    For my great Å¿ufferings, or your little patience? ha?
    They laugh, you thinke?

                 M^rs. FI. Why S^r. and you might Å¿eeât.
    What thought, they haue of you, may be Å¿oone collected
    By the young Genlemans Å¿peache.

                               FIT. Youug Gentleman?               235
    Death! you are in loue with him, are you? could he not
    Be namâd the Gentleman, without the young?
    Vp to your Cabbin againe.

         M^rs. FI. My cage, yoâ were beÅ¿t
    To call it?

            FIT. Yes, Å¿ing there. Youâld faine be making
    _Blanck Manger_ with him at your mothers! I know you.          240

    Heere is one _Ingine_, Sir, deÅ¿ires to Å¿peake with you.

    FIT. I thought he brought Å¿ome newes, of a broker! Well,

    I told you of, is newly come to towne.

    FIT. Where, _Ingine_?

    Ere hee pullâd off his boots, Sir, but Å¿o followâd,
    For buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿es:

         FIT. But what is a _Proiector_?
    I would conceiue.

                 ING. Why, one Sir, that proiects                   10
    Wayes to enrich men, or to make âhem great,
    By Å¿uites, by marriages, by vndertakings:

    FIT. I hope I Å¿hall: but _Ingine_, you doe talke                20

    Fit to runne out on errands: Let her goe.
    _Via pecunia!_ when Å¿heâs runne and gone,
    And fled and dead; then will I fetch her, againe,
    With _Aqua-vitÃ¦_, out of an old Hogs-head!                       5

    You doe not know MaÅ¿ter _Fitz-dottrel_.

    FIT. He doâs not know me indeed. I thank you, _Ingine_,

    Pull out another, two or three.

    Something, to day; and, by it, you may gather
    Your MiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e is a fruite, thatâs worth the Å¿tealing

    Yoâ haue all your eyes about you; and let in                   161

    To conuey letters. Nor no youths, diÅ¿guisâd
    Like country-wiues, with creame, and marrow-puddings.          165
    Much knauery may be vented in a pudding,

PVG.   MiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e FITZDOTTRELL.

    I haue no Å¿ingular Å¿eruice of this, now?
    Nor no Å¿uperlatiue MaÅ¿ter? I Å¿hall wiÅ¿h
    To be in hell againe, at leaÅ¿ure? Bring,
    A _Vice_ from thence? That had bin Å¿uch a Å¿ubtilty,
    As to bring broad-clothes hither: or tranÅ¿port                   5
    FreÅ¿h oranges into _Spaine_. I finde it, now:
    My _Chiefe_ was iâ the right. Can any feind
    BoaÅ¿t of a better _Vice_, then heere by nature,
    And art, thâare owners of? Hell neâr owne mee,
    But I am taken! the fine tract of it                            10
    Pulls mee along! To heare men Å¿uch profeÅ¿Å¿ors
    Growne in our Å¿ubtleÅ¿t _Sciences_! My firÅ¿t _Act_, now,
    Shall be, to make this MaÅ¿ter of mine cuckold:
    The primitiue worke of darkneÅ¿Å¿e, I will practiÅ¿e!
    I will deÅ¿erue Å¿o well of my faire MiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e,                   15
    By my diÅ¿coueries, firÅ¿t; my counÅ¿ells after;
    And keeping counÅ¿ell, after that: as who,
    So euer, is one, Iâle be another, Å¿ure,
    Iâll haâ my Å¿hare. Most delicate damnâd fleÅ¿h!
    Shee will be! O! that I could Å¿tay time, now,         [116]     20
    Midnight will come too faÅ¿t vpon mee, I feare,
    To cut my pleaÅ¿ure--

           M^rs. FI. Looke at the back-doore,
                                   _Shee Å¿ends_ Diuell _out_.
    One knocks, Å¿ee who it is.

                PVG. Dainty _Å¿he-Diuell_!

    M^rs. FI. I cannot get this venter of the cloake,
    Out of my fancie; nor the Gentlemans way,                       25
    He tooke, which though âtwere Å¿trange, yet âtwas handÅ¿ome,
    And had a grace withall, beyond the newneÅ¿Å¿e.
    Sure he will thinke mee that dull Å¿tupid creature,
    Hee Å¿aid, and may conclude it; if I finde not
    Some thought to thanke thâ attemp. He did preÅ¿ume,              30
    By all the carriage of it, on my braine,
    For anÅ¿wer; and will Å¿weare âtis very barren,
    If it can yeeld him no returne. Who is it?

                                         Diuell _returnes_.

    PVG. MiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e, it is, but firÅ¿t, let me aÅ¿Å¿ure
    The excellence, of MiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es, I am,                            35
    Although my MaÅ¿ters man, my MiÅ¿streÅ¿Å¿e Å¿laue,
    The Å¿eruant of her Å¿ecrets, and Å¿weete turnes,
    And know, what fitly will conduce to either.

    M^rs. FI. Whatâs this? I pray you come to your Å¿elfe and thinke
    What your part is: to make an anÅ¿wer. Tell,                     40
    Who is it at the doore?

                          PVG. The Gentleman, M^rs,
    Who was at the cloake-charge to Å¿peake with you,
    This morning, who expects onely to take
    Some Å¿mall commandâments from you, what you pleaÅ¿e,
    Worthy your forme, hee Å¿aies, and gentleÅ¿t manners.             45

    M^rs. FI. O! youâll anon proue his hyrâd man, I feare,
    What has he giuân you, for this meÅ¿Å¿age? Sir,
    Bid him put off his hopes of Å¿traw, and leaue
    To Å¿pread his nets, in view, thus. Though they take
    MaÅ¿ter _Fitz-dottrell_, I am no Å¿uch foule,                     50
    Nor faire one, tell him, will be had with Å¿talking.
    And wiÅ¿h him to for-beare his acting to mee,
    At the Gentlemans chamber-window in _Lincolnes-Inne_ there,
    That opens to my gallery: elÅ¿e, I Å¿weare
    Tâacquaint my huÅ¿band with his folly, and leaue him             55
    To the iuÅ¿t rage of his offended iealouÅ¿ie.
    Or if your MaÅ¿ters Å¿enÅ¿e be not Å¿o quicke
    To right mee, tell him, I Å¿hall finde a friend
    That will repaire mee. Say, I will be quiet.
    In mine owne houÅ¿e? Pray you, in thoÅ¿e words giue it him.       60

    PVG. This is Å¿ome foole turnâd!

                                          _He goes out._

                      M^rs. FI. If he be the MaÅ¿ter,
    Now, of that Å¿tate and wit, which I allow him;
    Sure, hee will vnderÅ¿tand mee: I durÅ¿t not
    Be more direct. For this officious fellow,
    My husbands new groome, is a Å¿pie vpon me,                      65
    I finde already. Yet, if he but tell him
    This in my words, hee cannot but conceiue               [117]
    HimÅ¿elfe both apprehended, and requited.
    I would not haue him thinke hee met a _Å¿tatue_:
    Or Å¿poke to one, not there, though I were Å¿ilent.               70
    How now? haâ you told him?

           PVG. Yes.

                   M^rs. FI. And what Å¿aies he?

    PVG. Sayes he? That which my Å¿elf would Å¿ay to you, if I durÅ¿t.
    That you are proude, Å¿weet MiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e? and with-all,
    A little ignorant, to entertaine
    The good thatâs profferâd; and (by your beauties leaue)         75
    Not all Å¿o wiÅ¿e, as Å¿ome true politique wife
    Would be: who hauing matchâd with Å¿uch a _NupÅ¿on_
    (I Å¿peake it with my MaÅ¿ters peace) whoÅ¿e face
    Hath left tâaccuÅ¿e him, now, forât doth confeÅ¿Å¿e him,
    What you can make him; will yet (out of Å¿cruple,                80
    And a Å¿picâd conÅ¿cience) defraud the poore Gentleman,
    At leaÅ¿t delay him in the thing he longs for,
    And makes it hs whole Å¿tudy, how to compaÅ¿Å¿e,
    Onely a title. Could but he write _Cuckold_,
    He had his ends. For, looke you--

         M^rs. FI. This can be                                      85
    None but my husbands wit.

               PVG. My pretious M^rs.

    M. FI. It creaks his _Ingine_: The groome neuer durÅ¿t
    Be, elÅ¿e, so Å¿aucy--

                     PVG. If it were not clearely,
    His worÅ¿hipfull ambition; and the top of it;
    The very forked top too: why Å¿hould hee                         90
    Keepe you, thus murâd vp in a back-roome, MiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e,
    Allow you neâr a caÅ¿ement to the Å¿treete,
    Feare of engendering by the eyes, with gallants,
    Forbid you paper, pen and inke, like Rats-bane.
    Search your halfe pint of _muÅ¿catell_, leÅ¿t a letter            95
    Be Å¿uncke iâ the pot: and hold your new-laid egge
    AgainÅ¿t the fire, leÅ¿t any charme be writ there?
    Will you make benefit of truth, deare MiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e,
    If I doe tell it you: I doât not often?
    I am Å¿et ouer you, imployâd, indeed,                           100
    To watch your Å¿teps, your lookes, your very breathings,
    And to report them to him. Now, if you
    Will be a true, right, delicate Å¿weete MiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e,
    Why, wee will make a _Cokes_ of this _WiÅ¿e MaÅ¿ter_,
    We will, my MiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e, an abÅ¿olute fine _Cokes_,               105
    And mock, to ayre, all the deepe diligences
    Of Å¿uch a Å¿olemne, and effectuall AÅ¿Å¿e,
    An AÅ¿Å¿e to Å¿o good purpoÅ¿e, as weeâll vÅ¿e him.
    I will contriue it Å¿o, that you Å¿hall goe
    To _Playes_, to _MaÅ¿ques_, to _Meetings_, and to _FeaÅ¿ts_.     110
    For, why is all this Rigging, and fine Tackle, MiÅ¿tris,
    If you neat handÅ¿ome veÅ¿Å¿ells, of good Å¿ayle,
    Put not forth euer, and anon, with your nets
    Abroad into the world. It is your fiÅ¿hing.                [118]
    There, you Å¿hal chooÅ¿e your friends, your Å¿eruants, Lady,
    Your Å¿quires of honour; Iâle conuey your letters,              116
    Fetch anÅ¿wers, doe you all the offices,
    That can belong to your bloud, and beauty. And,
    For the variety, at my times, although
    I am not in due _Å¿ymmetrie_, the man                           120
    Of that proportion; or in rule
    Of _phyÅ¿icke_, of the iuÅ¿t complexion:
    Or of that truth of _Picardill_, in clothes,
    To boaÅ¿t a Å¿oueraignty oâre Ladies: yet
    I know, to do my turnes, Å¿weet MiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e. Come, kiÅ¿Å¿e--

    M^rs. FI. How now!

                PVG. Deare delicate MiÅ¿t. I am your Å¿laue,         126
    Your little _worme_, that loues you: your fine _Monkey_;
    Your _Dogge_, your _Iacke_, your _Pug_, that longs to be

FITZ-DOTTRELL.   MiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e FITZ-DOTTREL.   PVG.

    How now, Å¿weet heart? whatâs the matter?

                                  M^rs. FI. Good!
    You are a Å¿tranger to the plot! you Å¿et not
    Your fancy _Diuell_, here, to tempt your wife,
    With all the inÅ¿olent vnciuill language,
    Or action, he could vent?

                          FIT. Did you so, _Diuell_?                 5

    M^rs. FIT. Not you? you were not planted iâ your hole to heare him,
    Vpoâ the Å¿tayres? or here, behinde the hangings?
    I doe not know your qualities? he durÅ¿t doe it,
    And you not giue directions?

                         FIT. You shall Å¿ee, wife,
    Whether he durÅ¿t, or no: and what it was,                       10
    I did direct.

             _Her huÅ¿band goes out, and enters presently with a
                   cudgell vpon him._

          PVG. Sweet MiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e, are you mad?

    FIT. You moÅ¿t mere Rogue! you open manifeÅ¿t Villaine!
    You Feind apparant you! you declarâd Hel-hound!

    PVG. Good S^r.

                 FIT. Good Knaue, good RaÅ¿cal, and good Traitor.
    Now, I doe finde you parcel-_Diuell_, indeed.                   15
    Vpoâ the point of truÅ¿t? Iâ your firÅ¿t charge?
    The very day oâ your probation?
    To tempt your MiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e? You doe Å¿ee, good wedlocke,
    How I directed him.

                M^rs. FIT. Why, where S^r? were you?         [119]

    FIT. Nay, there is one blow more, for exerciÅ¿e:                 20
                            _After a pause. He Å¿trikes him againe_
    I told you, I Å¿hould doe it.

               PVG. Would you had done, Sir.

    FIT. O wife, the rareÅ¿t man! yet thereâs another
    To put you in mind oâ the laÅ¿t, Å¿uch a braue man, wife!
    Within, he has his proiects, and doâs vent âhem,
                                                    _and againe._
    The gallanteÅ¿t! where you _tentiginous_? ha?                    25
    Would you be acting of the _Incubus_?
    Did her Å¿ilks ruÅ¿tling moue you?

                PVG. Gentle Sir.

    FIT. Out of my Å¿ight. If thy name were not _Diuell_,
    Thou Å¿houldÅ¿t not Å¿tay a minute with me. In,
    Goe, yet Å¿tay: yet goe too. I am reÅ¿oluâd.                      30
    What I will doe: and you Å¿hall knowât afore-hand.
    Soone as the Gentleman is gone, doe you heare?
    Iâll helpe your liÅ¿ping. Wife, Å¿uch a man, wife!
                                                Diuell _goes out_.
    He has Å¿uch plots! He will make mee a _Duke_!
    No leÅ¿Å¿e, by heauen! Å¿ix Mares, to your coach, wife!            35
    Thatâs your proportion! And your coach-man bald!
    BecauÅ¿e he Å¿hall be bare, inough. Doe not you laugh,
    We are looking for a place, and all, iâ the map
    What to be of. Haue faith, be not an Infidell.
    You know, I am not eaÅ¿ie to be gullâd.                          40
    I Å¿weare, when I haue my _millions_, elÅ¿e. Iâll make
    Another _DutcheÅ¿Å¿e_: if you haâ not faith.

    M^rs. FI. Youâll haâ too much, I feare, in theÅ¿e falÅ¿e Å¿pirits.

    FIT. Spirits? O, no such thing! wife! wit, mere wit!
    This man defies the _Diuell_, and all his works!                45
    He dosât by _Ingine_, and deuiÅ¿es, hee!
    He has his winged ploughes, that goe with Å¿ailes,
    Will plough you forty acres, at once! and mills.
    Will Å¿pout you water, ten miles off! All _Crowland_
    Is ours, wife; and the fens, from vs, in _Norfolke_,            50
    To the vtmoÅ¿t bound of _Lincoln-Å¿hire_! we haue viewâd it,
    And meaÅ¿urâd it within all; by the Å¿cale!
    The richeÅ¿t tract of land, Loue, iâ the kingdome!
    There will be made Å¿euenteene, or eighteene _millions_;
    Or more, asât may be handled! wherefore, thinke,                55
    Sweet heart, if thâ haÅ¿t a fancy to one place,
    More then another, to be _DutcheÅ¿Å¿e_ of;
    Now, name it: I will haât what ere it coÅ¿t,
    (Ifât will be had for money) either here,                       59

    Leaue vs to talke of it, who vnderÅ¿tand it.

    MER. I thinke we haâ found a place to fit you, now, Sir.
    _GlocâÅ¿ter_.

    MER. That you Å¿ay right in. _SpenÅ¿er_, I thinke, the younger,
    Had his laÅ¿t honour thence. But, he was but _Earle_.

    FIT. I know not that, Sir. But _Thomas_ of _WoodÅ¿tocke_,
    Iâm Å¿ure, was _Duke_, and he was made away,
    At _Calice_; as _Duke Humphrey_ was at _Bury_:                  10
    And _Richard_ the third, you know what end he came too.

    MER. By mâfaith you are cunning iâ the _Chronicle_, Sir.

    Pretends to that. I will doe no man wrong.

    MER. Then take one propoÅ¿ition more, and heare it
    As paÅ¿t exception.

                                    MER. To be
    _Duke_ of thoÅ¿e lands, you Å¿hall recouer; take
    Your title, thence, Sir, _Duke_ of the _Drownâd lands_,         20
    Or _Drownâd-land_.

             FIT. Ha? that laÅ¿t has a good Å¿ound!

                                       ING. Yes;
    It goes like _Groen-land_, Sir, if you marke it.

                                MER. I,
    And drawing thus your honour from the worke,
    You make the reputation of that, greater;                       25

                                MER. Yes, when you
    Haâ no foote left; as that muÅ¿t be, Sir, one day.
    And, though it tarry in your heyres, some _forty_,
    _Fifty_ deÅ¿cents, the longer liuer, at laÅ¿t, yet,               30
    MuÅ¿t thruÅ¿t âhem out onât: if no quirk in law,

    Wee Å¿ee thoÅ¿e changes, daily: the faire lands,
    That were the _Clyents_, are the _Lawyers_, now:

    This was a fortune, happy aboue thought,             [122]
    That this Å¿hould proue thy chamber: which I fearâd
    Would be my greateÅ¿t trouble! this muÅ¿t be
    The very window, and that the roome.

                            MAN. It is.
    I now remember, I haue often Å¿eene there                         5
    A woman, but I neuer markâd her much.

    WIT. Where was your Å¿oule, friend?

         MAN. Faith, but now, and then,
    Awake vnto thoÅ¿e obiects.

                        WIT. You pretend Å¿o.
    Let mee not liue, if I am not in loue
    More with her wit, for this direction, now,                     10
    Then with her forme, though I haâ praisâd that prettily,
    Since I Å¿aw her, and you, to day. Read thoÅ¿e.
          _Hee giues him a paper, wherein is the copy of a Song._
    Theyâll goe vnto the ayre you loue Å¿o well.
    Try âhem vnto the note, may be the muÅ¿ique
    Will call her Å¿ooner; light, Å¿heeâs here. Sing quickly.         15

    M^rs. FIT. Either he vnderÅ¿tood him not: or elÅ¿e,
    The fellow was not faithfull in deliuery,
    Of what I bad. And, I am iuÅ¿tly payâd,
    That might haue made my profit of his Å¿eruice,
    But, by miÅ¿-taking, haue drawne on his enuy,                    20
    And done the worÅ¿e defeate vpon my Å¿elfe.
                        Manly _Å¿ings_, Pug _enters perceiues it_.
    How! MuÅ¿ique? then he may be there: and is sure.

    PVG. O! Is it Å¿o? Is there the enter-view?
    Haue I drawne to you, at laÅ¿t, my cunning _Lady_?
    The _Diuell_ is an _AÅ¿Å¿e_! foolâd off! and beaten!              25
    Nay, made an inÅ¿trument! and could not Å¿ent it!
    Well, Å¿ince yoâ haue Å¿howne the malice of a woman,
    No leÅ¿Å¿e then her true wit, and learning, MiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e,
    Iâll try, if little _Pug_ haue the malignity
    To recompence it, and Å¿o Å¿aue his danger.                       30
    âTis not the paine, but the diÅ¿credite of it,
    The _Diuell_ Å¿hould not keepe a body intire.

    WIT. Away, fall backe, Å¿he comes.

                    MAN. Iâll leaue you, Sir,
    The MaÅ¿ter of my chamber. I haue buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e.

    WIT. M^rs!

            M^rs. FI. You make me paint, S^r.

             WIT. Theâare faire colours,                            35
    _Lady_, and naturall! I did receiue
    Some commands from you, lately, gentle _Lady_,          [123]
       _This Scene is acted at two windoâs as out of_
              _two contiguous buildings._
    But Å¿o perplexâd, and wrapâd in the deliuery,
    As I may feare tâhaue miÅ¿-interpreted:
    But muÅ¿t make Å¿uit Å¿till, to be neere your grace.               40

    M^rs. FI. Who is there with you, S^r?

                               WIT. None, but my Å¿elfe.
    It falls out. _Lady_, to be a deare friends lodging.
    Wherein thereâs Å¿ome conÅ¿piracy of fortune
    With your poore Å¿eruants bleÅ¿ affections.

    M^rs. FI. Who was it Å¿ung?

         WIT. He, _Lady_, but heeâs gone,                           45
    Vpon my entreaty of him, Å¿eeing you
    Approach the window. Neither need you doubt him,
    If he were here. He is too much a gentleman.

    M^rs. FI. Sir, if you iudge me by this Å¿imple action,
    And by the outward habite, and complexion                       50
    Of eaÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e, it hath, to your deÅ¿igne;
    You may with IuÅ¿tice, Å¿ay, I am a woman:
    And a Å¿trange woman. But when you Å¿hall pleaÅ¿e,
    To bring but that concurrence of my fortune,
    To memory, which to day your Å¿elfe did vrge:                    55
    It may beget Å¿ome fauour like excuÅ¿e,
    Though none like reaÅ¿on.

    WIT. No, my tune-full MiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e?
    Then, Å¿urely, _Loue_ hath none: nor _Beauty_ any;
    Nor _Nature_ violenced, in both theÅ¿e:
    With all whoÅ¿e gentle tongues you Å¿peake, at once.              60
    I thought I had inough remouâd, already,
    That Å¿cruple from your breÅ¿t, and left yoâ all reaÅ¿on;
    When, through my mornings perÅ¿pectiue I Å¿hewd you
    A man Å¿o aboue excuÅ¿e, as he is the cauÅ¿e,
    Why any thing is to be done vpon him:                           65
    And nothing callâd an iniury, miÅ¿-placâd.
    Iârather, now had hope, to Å¿hew you how _Loue_
    By his acceÅ¿Å¿es, growes more naturall:
    And, what was done, this morning, with Å¿uch force
    Was but deuisâd to Å¿erue the preÅ¿ent, then.                     70
    That Å¿ince _Loue_ hath the honour to approach
                  _He grows more familiar in his Court-Å¿hip._
    TheÅ¿e Å¿iÅ¿ter-Å¿welling breÅ¿ts; and touch this Å¿oft,
    And roÅ¿ie hand; hee hath the skill to draw
    Their _Nectar_ forth, with kiÅ¿Å¿ing; and could make
    More wanton Å¿alts, from this braue promontory,                  75
    Downe to this valley, then the nimble _Roe_;
                  _playes with her paps, kiÅ¿Å¿eth her hands, &c._
    Could play the hopping _Sparrow_, âbout theÅ¿e nets;
    And Å¿porting _Squirell_ in theÅ¿e criÅ¿ped groues;
    Bury himÅ¿elfe in euery _Silke-wormes_ kell,
    Is here vnrauellâd; runne into the Å¿nare,                       80
    Which euery hayre is, caÅ¿t into a curle,
    To catch a _Cupid_ flying: Bath himselfe
    In milke, and roÅ¿es, here, and dry him, there;
    Warme his cold hands, to play with this Å¿mooth, round,   [124]
    And well tornâd chin, as with the _Billyard_ ball;              85
    Rowle on theÅ¿e lips, the banks of loue, and there
    At once both plant, and gather kiÅ¿Å¿es. _Lady_,
    Shall I, with what I haue made to day here, call
    All Å¿enÅ¿e to wonder, and all faith to Å¿igne
    The myÅ¿teries reuealed in your forme?                           90
    And will _Loue_ pardon mee the blasphemy
    I vtterâd, when I Å¿aid, a glaÅ¿Å¿e could Å¿peake
    This beauty, or that fooles had power to iudge it?

    _Doe but looke, on her eyes! They doe light--
      All that_ Loueâs _world comprizeth!                           95
    Doe but looke on her hayre! it is bright,
      As_ Loueâs _Å¿tarre, when it riÅ¿eth!
    Doe but marke, her fore-headâs Å¿moother,
      Then words that Å¿ooth her!
    And from her arched browes, Å¿uch a grace                       100
      Sheds it Å¿elfe through the face;
    As alone, there triumphs to the life,
      All the gaine, all the good, of the elements Å¿trife!_

    _Haue you Å¿eene but a bright Lilly grow,
      Before rude hands haue touchâd it?                           105

    FIT. Where I haâ beene vexâd a little, with a toy!

    MER. O Sir! no toyes muÅ¿t trouble your graue head,
    Now it is growing to be great. You muÅ¿t
    Be aboue all thoÅ¿e things.

              FIT. Nay, nay, Å¿o I will.                              5

    MER. Now you are toâard the Lord, you muÅ¿t put off

    Thou doÅ¿t not know the priueledges, _Ingine_,
    Follow that Title; nor how Å¿wift: To day,
    When he has put on his Lords face once, then--

    FIT. Sir, for theÅ¿e things I Å¿hall doe well enough,
    There is no feare of me. But then, my wife is                   15
    Such an vntoward thing! Å¿heeâll neuer learne
    How to comport with it. I am out of all

    FIT. Where? Are there any Schooles for _Ladies_? Is there
    An _Academy_ for women? I doe know,                             20
    For men, there was: I learnâd in it, my Å¿elfe,

       Ingine _whiÅ¿pers_ Merecraft, Merecraft _turnes to_ Fitz-dottrel.

                         MER. Ha! I doe thanke thee,
    With all my heart, deare _Ingine_. Sir, there is                25
    A certaine _Lady_, here about the Towne,
    An _EngliÅ¿h_ widdow, who hath lately trauellâd,
    But Å¿heeâs callâd the _Spaniard_; cauÅ¿e Å¿he came
    LateÅ¿t from thence: and keepes the _SpaniÅ¿h_ habit.
    Such a rare woman! all our women heere,                         30
    That are of Å¿pirit, and faÅ¿hion flocke, vnto her,
    As to their PreÅ¿ident; their _Law_; their _Canon_;
    More then they euer did, to _Oracle-Foreman_.
    Such rare receipts Å¿hee has, Sir, for the face;
    Such _oyles_; such _tinctures_; such _pomatumnâs_;              35
    Such _perfumes_; _medâcines_; _quinteÅ¿Å¿ences_, _&c._
    And Å¿uch a MiÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e of behauiour;                        [127]
    She knowes, from the _Dukes_ daughter, to the Doxey,
    What is their due iuÅ¿t: and no more!

                                   FIT. O Sir!
    You pleaÅ¿e me iâ this, more then mine owne greatneÅ¿Å¿e,          40
    Where is Å¿hee? Let vs haue her.

                            MER. By your patience,
    We muÅ¿t vÅ¿e meanes; caÅ¿t how to be acquainted--

    FIT. Good, S^r, about it.

                MER. We muÅ¿t think how, firÅ¿t.

                             FIT. O!
    I doe not loue to tarry for a thing,
    When I haue a mind toât. You doe not know me.                   45
    If you doe offer it.

                       MER. Your wife muÅ¿t Å¿end
    Some pretty token to her, with a complement,
    And pray to be receiuâd in her good graces,
    All the great _Ladies_ doât.

        FIT. She Å¿hall, Å¿he Å¿hall,
    What were it beÅ¿t to be?

                        MER. Some little toy,                       50
    I would not haue it any great matter, Sir:
    A _Diamant_ ring, of _forty_ or _fifty_ pound,
    Would doe it handÅ¿omely: and be a gift
    Fit for your wife to Å¿end, and her to take.

    FIT. Iâll goe, and tell my wife onât, Å¿treight.                 55

                                 Fitz-dottrel _goes out_.

                                             MER. Why this
    Is well! The clothes weâhaue now: But, whereâs this _Lady_?
    If we could get a witty boy, now, _Ingine_;
    That were an excellent cracke: I could inÅ¿truct him,
    To the true height. For any thing takes this _dottrel_.

    ING. Why, Sir your beÅ¿t will be one oâ the players!             60

    MER. No, thereâs no truÅ¿ting them. Theyâll talke onât,
    And tell their _Poets_.

                      ING. What if they doe? The ieÅ¿t
    will brooke the Stage. But, there be Å¿ome of âhem
    Are very honeÅ¿t Lads. Thereâs _Dicke RobinÅ¿on_
    A very pretty fellow, and comes often                           65
    To a Gentlemans chamber, a friends of mine. We had
    The merrieÅ¿t Å¿upper of it there, one night,
    The Gentlemans Land-lady invited him
    Toâa GoÅ¿Å¿ips feaÅ¿t. Now, he Sir brought _Dick RobinÅ¿on_,
    DreÅ¿t like a Lawyers wife, amongÅ¿t âhem all;                    70
    (I lent him cloathes) but, to Å¿ee him behaue it;
    And lay the law; and carue; and drinke vnto âhem;
    And then talke baudy: and Å¿end frolicks! o!
    It would haue burÅ¿t your buttons, or not left you
    A Å¿eame.

                MER. They Å¿ay heeâs an ingenious youth!             75

    Forty oâ your very _Ladies_! did you neâr Å¿ee him?

    MER. No, I do Å¿eldome Å¿ee thoÅ¿e toyes. But thinke you,
    That we may haue him?

                        ING. Sir, the young Gentleman
    I tell you of, can command him. Shall I attempt it?             80

    MER. Yes, doe it.

                                       _Enters againe._

             FIT. Sâlight, I cannot get my wife
    To part with a ring, on any termes: and yet,
    The Å¿ollen _Monkey_ has two.

                            MER. It were âgainst reaÅ¿on
    That you Å¿hould vrge it; Sir, Å¿end to a Gold-Å¿mith,       [128]
    Let not her loÅ¿e byât.

        FIT. How doâs Å¿he loÅ¿e byât?                                85
    Isât not for her?

                       MER. Make it your owne bounty,
    It will haâ the better Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e; what is a matter
    Of _fifty_ pound to you, S^r.

                           FIT. Iâhaue but a hundred
    _Pieces_, to Å¿hew here; that I would not breake--

    MER. You Å¿hall haâ credit, Sir. Iâll Å¿end a ticket              90
    Vnto my Gold-Å¿mith. Heer, my man comes too,
    To carry it fitly. How now, _Traines_? What birds?

                                              Traines _enters_.

    TRA. Your CouÅ¿in _Euer-ill_ met me, and has beat mee,
    BecauÅ¿e I would not tell him where you were:
    I thinke he has dogd me to the houÅ¿e too.

                                        FIT. Well--                 95
    You Å¿hall goe out at the back-doore, then, _Traines_.
    You muÅ¿t get _Guilt-head_ hither, by Å¿ome meanes:

    TRA. âTis impoÅ¿Å¿ible!

                          FIT. Tell him, we haue _veniÅ¿on_,
    Iâll gâ him a piece, and Å¿end his wife a _PheÅ¿ant_.

    TRA. A ForreÅ¿t moues not, till that _forty_ pound,             100
    Yoâ had of him, laÅ¿t, be paiâd. He keepes more Å¿tirre,
    For that Å¿ame petty Å¿umme, then for your bond
    Of _Å¿ixe_; and _Statute_ of _eight_ hundred!

                                      FIT. Tell him
    Weeâll hedge in that. Cry vp _Fitz-dottrell_ to him,
    Double his price: Make him a man of mettall.                   105

    All this is to make you a Gentleman:
    Iâll haue you learne, Sonne. Wherefore haue I placâd you
    With S^r. _Poul Either-Å¿ide_, but to haue Å¿o much Law
    To keepe your owne? BeÅ¿ides, he is a _IuÅ¿tice_,
    Here iâ the Towne; and dwelling, Sonne, with him,                5
    You Å¿hal learne that in a yeere, Å¿hall be worth twenty
    Of hauing Å¿tayâd you at _Oxford_, or at _Cambridge_,
    Or Å¿ending you to the _Innes_ of _Court_, or _France_.
    I am callâd for now in haÅ¿te, by MaÅ¿ter _Meere-craft_
    To truÅ¿t MaÅ¿ter _Fitz-dottrel_, a good man:                     10
    Iâhaue inquirâd him, eighteene hundred a yeere,
    (His name is currant) for a diamant ring
    Of forty, Å¿hall not be worth thirty (thats gainâd)
    And this is to make you a Gentleman!

    PLV. O, but good father, you truÅ¿t too much!

                                  GVI. Boy, boy,                    15
    We liue, by finding fooles out, to be truÅ¿ted.
    Our Å¿hop-bookes are our paÅ¿tures, our corn-grounds,
    We lay âhem opân for them to come into:
    And when wee haue âhem there, wee driue âhem vp
    In tâone of our two Pounds, the _Compters_, Å¿treight,           20
    And this is to make you a Gentleman!
    Wee Citizens neuer truÅ¿t, but wee doe coozen:
    For, if our debtors pay, wee coozen them;
    And if they doe not, then we coozen our Å¿elues.
    But thatâs a hazard euery one muÅ¿t runne,                       25
    That hopes to make his Sonne a Gentleman!

    PLV. I doe not wiÅ¿h to be one, truely, Father.
    In a deÅ¿cent, or two, wee come to be
    IuÅ¿t âitheir Å¿tate, fit to be coozend, like âhem.
    And I had rather haâ tarryed iâ your trade: 30
    For, Å¿ince the _Gentry_ Å¿corne the Citty Å¿o much,         [130]
    Me thinkes we Å¿hould in time, holding together,
    And matching in our owne tribes, as they Å¿ay,
    Haue got an _Act_ of _Common Councell_, for it,
    That we might coozen them out of _rerum natura_.                35

    GVI. I, if we had an _Act_ firÅ¿t to forbid
    The marrying of our wealthy heyres vnto âhem:
    And daughters, with Å¿uch lauiÅ¿h portions.
    That confounds all.

             PLV. And makes a _Mungril_ breed, Father.
    And when they haue your money, then they laugh at you:          40
    Or kick you downe the Å¿tayres. I cannot abide âhem.

    O, is he come! I knew he would not faile me.
    Welcome, good _Guilt-head_, I muÅ¿t haâ you doe
    A noble Gentleman, a courteÅ¿ie, here:
    In a mere toy (Å¿ome pretty Ring, or Iewell)
    Of fifty, or threeÅ¿core pound (Make it a hundred,                5
    And hedge in the laÅ¿t forty, that I owe you,
    And your owne price for the Ring) Heâs a good man, S^r,
    And you may hapâ Å¿ee him a great one! Hee,
    Is likely to beÅ¿tow hundreds, and thouÅ¿ands,
    Wiâ you; if you can humour him. A great prince                  10
    He will be Å¿hortly. What doe you Å¿ay?

                               GVI. In truth, Sir
    I cannot. âT has beene a long vacation with vs?

    FIT. Of what, I pray thee? of wit? or honesty?
    ThoÅ¿e are your Citizens long vacations.

    PLV. Good Father do not truÅ¿t âhem.

                   MER. Nay, _Thom. Guilt-head_.                    15
    Hee will not buy a courteÅ¿ie and begge it:
    Heeâll rather pay, then pray. If you doe for him,
    You muÅ¿t doe cheerefully. His credit, Sir,
    Is not yet proÅ¿titute! Whoâs this? thy Å¿onne?
    A pretty youth, whatâs his name?

                  PLV. _Plutarchus_, Sir,                           20

    MER. _Plutarchus!_ How came that about?

                              GVI. That yeere S^r,
    That I begot him, I bought _Plutarchâs_ liues,
    And fell Å¿â in loue with the booke, as I callâd my Å¿onne
    Byâhis name; In hope he Å¿hould be like him:
    And write the liues of our great men!

              MER. Iâ the City?                         [131]       25
    And you do breed him, there?

        GVI. His minde, Sir, lies
    Much to that way.

           MER. Why, then, he is iâ the right way.

    GVI. But, now, I had rather get him a good wife,
    And plant him iâ the countrey; there to vÅ¿e
    The bleÅ¿Å¿ing I Å¿hall leaue him:

                               MER. Out vponât!                     30
    And loÅ¿e the laudable meanes, thou haÅ¿t at home, heere,
    Tâaduance, and make him a young _Alderman_?
    Buy him a Captaines place, for Å¿hame; and let him

    O, are you heere, Sir? âpray you let vs whiÅ¿per.

    PLV. Father, deare Father, truÅ¿t him if you loue mee.

    GVI. Why, I doe meane it, boy; but, what I doe,
    MuÅ¿t not come eaÅ¿ily from mee: Wee muÅ¿t deale
    With _Courtiers_, boy, as _Courtiers_ deale with vs.             5
    If I haue a _BuÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e_ there, with any of them,
    Why, I muÅ¿t wait, Iâam Å¿ure onât, Son: and though
    My _Lord_ diÅ¿patch me, yet his worÅ¿hipfull man--
    Will keepe me for his Å¿port, a moneth, or two,
    To Å¿hew mee with my fellow Cittizens.                           10
    I muÅ¿t make his traine long, and full, one quarter;
    And helpe the Å¿pectacle of his greatneÅ¿Å¿e. There,
    Nothing is done at once, but iniuries, boy:
    And they come head-long! an their good turnes moue not,    [124]
    Or very Å¿lowly.

             PLV. Yet Å¿weet father, truÅ¿t him.                      15

    GVI. VVell, I will thinke.

                     EV. Come, you muÅ¿t doât, Sir.
    I am vndone elÅ¿e, and your _Lady Tayle-buÅ¿h_
    Has Å¿ent for mee to dinner, and my cloaths
    Are all at pawne. I had Å¿ent out this morning,
    Before I heard you were come to towne, Å¿ome twenty              20
    Of my epiÅ¿tles, and no one returne--

                         Mere-craft _tells him of his faults_.

    MER. VVhy, I haâ told you oâ this. This comes of wearing
    Scarlet, gold lace, and cut-works! your fine gartring!
    VVith your blowne roÅ¿es, CouÅ¿in! and your eating
    _PheÅ¿ant_, and _Godwit_, here in _London_! haunting             25
    The _Globes_, and _Mermaides_! wedging in with _Lords_,
    Still at the table! and affecting lechery,
    In veluet! where could you haâ contented your Å¿elfe
    With cheeÅ¿e, Å¿alt-butter, and a pickled hering,
    Iâ the Low-countries; there worne cloth, and fuÅ¿tian!           30
    Beene Å¿atisfied with a leape oâ your HoÅ¿tâs daughter,
    In garriÅ¿on, a wench of a Å¿toter! or,
    Your _Sutlers_ wife, iâ the leaguer, of two blanks!
    You neuer, then, had runne vpon this flat,
    To write your letters miÅ¿Å¿iue, and Å¿end out                     35
    Your priuy Å¿eales, that thus haue frighted off
    All your acquaintance; that they Å¿hun you at diÅ¿tance,
    VVorse, then you do the Bailies!

                          EV. Pox vpon you.
    I come not to you for counÅ¿ell, I lacke money.

                                               _Hee repines._

    MER. You doe not thinke, what you owe me already?

                                       EV. I?                       40
    They owe you, that meane to pay you. Iâll beÅ¿worne,
    I neuer meant it. Come, you will proiect,
    I Å¿hall vndoe your practice, for this moneth elÅ¿e:
    You know mee.
                               _and threatens him._

          MER. I, yoâ are a right Å¿weet nature!

    EV. Well, thatâs all one!

          MER. Youâll leaue this Empire, one day?                   45
    You will not euer haue this tribute payd,
    Your Å¿cepter oâ the Å¿word?

         EV. Tye vp your wit,
    Doe, and prouoke me not--

             MER. Will you, Sir, helpe,
    To what I Å¿hall prouoke another for you?

    EV. I cannot tell; try me: I thinke I am not                    50
    So vtterly, of an ore vn-to-be-melted,
    But I can doe my Å¿elfe good, on occaÅ¿ions.

                                             _They ioyne._

    MER. Strike in then, for your part. M^r. _Fitz-dottrel_
    If I tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿e in point of manners, afford mee
    Your beÅ¿t conÅ¿truction; I muÅ¿t beg my freedome                  55
    From your affayres, this day.

                FIT. How, S^r.

                             MER. It is
    In Å¿uccour of this Gentlemans occaÅ¿ions,
    My kinÅ¿-man--
                                  Mere-craft _pretends_ buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e.

                 FIT. Youâll not do me that affront, S^r.

    MER. I am Å¿ory you Å¿hould Å¿o interpret it,
    But, Sir, it Å¿tands vpon his being inueÅ¿ted                     60
    In a new _office_, hee has Å¿tood for, long:             [133]

                   Mere-craft _describes the_ office _of_ Dependancy.

    _MaÅ¿ter_ of the _Dependances_! A place
    Of my proiection too, Sir, and hath met
    Much oppoÅ¿ition; but the State, now, Å¿eeâs
    That great neceÅ¿Å¿ity of it, as after all                        65
    Their writing, and their Å¿peaking, againÅ¿t _Duells_,
    They haue erected it. His booke is drawne--
    For, Å¿ince, there will be differences, daily,
    âTwixt Gentlemen; and that the roaring manner
    Is growne offenÅ¿iue; that thoÅ¿e few, we call                    70
    The ciuill men oâ the Å¿word, abhorre the vapours;
    They Å¿hall refer now, hither, for their _proceÅ¿Å¿e_;
    And Å¿uch as treÅ¿Å¿paÅ¿e âgainÅ¿t the rule of _Court_,
    Are to be finâd--

             FIT. In troth, a pretty place!

    MER. A kinde of arbitrary _Court_ âtwill be, Sir.               75

    FIT. I Å¿hall haue matter for it, I beleeue,
    Ere it be long: I had a diÅ¿taÅ¿t.

                              MER. But now, Sir,
    My learned councell, they muÅ¿t haue a feeling,
    Theyâll part, Sir, with no bookes, without the hand-gout
    Be oyld, and I muÅ¿t furniÅ¿h. Ifât be money,                     80
    To me Å¿treight. I am Mine, _Mint_ and _Exchequer_.
    To Å¿upply all. What isât? a hundred pound?

    EVE. No, thâ _Harpey_, now, Å¿tands on a hundred pieces.

    MER. Why, he muÅ¿t haue âhem, if he will. To morrow, Sir,
    Will equally Å¿erue your occaÅ¿ionâs,----                         85
    And therefore, let me obtaine, that you will yeeld
    To timing a poore Gentlemans diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿es,
    In termes of hazard.--

             FIT. By no meanes!

                    MER. I muÅ¿t
    Get him this money, and will.--

                        FIT. Sir, I proteÅ¿t,
    Iâd rather Å¿tand engagâd for it my Å¿elfe:                       90
    Then you Å¿hould leaue mee.

               MER. O good S^r. do you thinke
    So courÅ¿ely of our manners, that we would,
    For any need of ours, be preÅ¿t to take it:
    Though you be pleasâd to offer it.

       FIT. Why, by heauen,
    I meane it!

                 MER. I can neuer beleeue leÅ¿Å¿e.                    95
    But wee, Sir, muÅ¿t preÅ¿erue our dignity,
    As you doe publiÅ¿h yours. By your faire leaue, Sir.

                                     _Hee offers to be gone._

    FIT. As I am a Gentleman, if you doe offer
    To leaue mee now, or if you doe refuÅ¿e mee,                     99
    I will not thinke you loue mee.

                      MER. Sir, I honour you.
    And with iuÅ¿t reaÅ¿on, for theÅ¿e noble notes,
    Of the nobility, you pretend too! But, Sir--
    I would know, why? a motiue (he a Å¿tranger)
    You Å¿hould doe this?

                    (EVE. Youâll mar all with your fineneÅ¿Å¿e)

    FIT. Why, thatâs all one, if âtwere, Sir, but my fancy.        105
    But I haue a _BuÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e_, that perhaps Iâd haue
    Brought to his _office_.

                    MER. O, Sir! I haue done, then;
    If hee can be made profitable, to you.                 [134]

    FIT. Yes, and it Å¿hall be one of my ambitions
    To haue it the firÅ¿t _BuÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e_? May I not?                   110

    EVE. So you doe meane to makeât, a perfect _BuÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e_.

    FIT. Nay, Iâll doe that, aÅ¿Å¿ure you: Å¿hew me once.

    MER. S^r, it concernes, the firÅ¿t be a perfect _BuÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e_,
    For his owne honour!

      EVE. I, and thâ reputation
    Too, of my place.

                   FIT. Why, why doe I take this courÅ¿e, elÅ¿e?     115
    I am not altogether, an _AÅ¿Å¿e_, good Gentlemen,
    Wherefore Å¿hould I conÅ¿ult you? doe you thinke?
    To make a Å¿ong onât? Howâs your manner? tell vs.

    MER. Doe, Å¿atisfie him: giue him the whole courÅ¿e.

    EVE. FirÅ¿t, by requeÅ¿t, or otherwiÅ¿e, you offer                120
    Your _BuÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e_ to the _Court_: wherein you craue:
    The iudgement of the _MaÅ¿ter_ and the _AÅ¿siÅ¿tants_.

    FIT. Well, thatâs done, now, what doe you vpon it?

    EVE. We Å¿treight S^r, haue recourÅ¿e to the Å¿pring-head;
    ViÅ¿it the ground; and, Å¿o diÅ¿cloÅ¿e the nature:                 125
    If it will carry, or no. If wee doe finde,
    By our proportions it is like to proue
    A Å¿ullen, and blacke _BusâneÅ¿Å¿e_ That it be
    Incorrigible; and out of, treaty; then.
    We file it, a _Dependance_!

                                FIT. So âtis filâd.                130
    What followes? I doe loue the order of theÅ¿e things.

    EVE. We then aduiÅ¿e the party, if he be
    A man of meanes, and hauings, that forth-with,
    He Å¿ettle his eÅ¿tate: if not, at leaÅ¿t
    That he pretend it. For, by that, the world                    135
    Takes notice, that it now is a _Dependance_.
    And this we call, Sir, _Publication_.

    FIT. Very Å¿ufficient! After _Publication_, now?

    EVE. Then we grant out our _ProceÅ¿Å¿e_, which is diuers;
    Eyther by _Chartell_, Sir, or _ore-tenus_,                     140
    Wherein the Challenger, and Challengee
    Or (with your _Spaniard_) your _Prouocador_,
    And _Prouocado_, haue their Å¿euerall courÅ¿es--

    FIT. I haue enough onât! for an hundred pieces?
    Yes, for two hundred, vnder-write me, doe.                     145
    Your man will take my bond?

                          MER. That he will, Å¿ure.
    But, theÅ¿e Å¿ame Citizens, they are Å¿uch Å¿harks!
    Thereâs an old debt of forty, I gaâ my word
    For one is runne away, to the _Bermudas_,
    And he will hooke in that, or he wiâ not doe.                   150

                      _He whiÅ¿pers_ Fitz-dottrell _aÅ¿ide_.

    FIT. Why, let him. That and the ring, and a hundred pieces,
    Will all but make two hundred?

                      MER. No, no more, Sir.
    What ready _Arithmetique_ you haue? doe you heare?
                                         _And then_ Guilt-head.
    A pretty mornings worke for you, this? Do it,
    You Å¿hall haâ twenty pound onât.

                          GVI. Twenty pieces?            [135]     155

    (PLV. Good Father, doât)

                         MER. You will hooke Å¿till? well,
    Shew vs your ring. You could not haâ done this, now
    With gentleneÅ¿Å¿e, at firÅ¿t, wee might haâ thankâd you?
    But groane, and haâ your courteÅ¿ies come from you
    Like a hard Å¿toole, and Å¿tinke? A man may draw                 160
    Your teeth out eaÅ¿ier, then your money? Come,
    Were little _Guilt-head_ heere, no better a nature,
    I Å¿hould neâr loue him, that could pull his lips off, now!
                             _He pulls_ Plutarchus _by the lips_.
    Was not thy mother a Gentlewoman?

                      PLV. Yes, Sir.

    MER. And went to the Court at _ChriÅ¿tmas_,
                       and S^t. _Georges-tide_?                    165
    And lent the Lords-men, chaines?

                       PLV. Of gold, and pearle, S^r.

    MER. I knew, thou muÅ¿t take, after Å¿ome body!
    Thou couldâÅ¿t not be elÅ¿e. This was no Å¿hop-looke!
    Iâll haâ thee Captaine _Guilt-head_, and march vp,
    And take in _Pimlico_, and kill the buÅ¿h,                      170
    At euery tauerne! Thou shalt haue a wife,
    If Å¿mocks will mount, boy. How now? you haâ there now
    Some _BriÅ¿to-Å¿tone_, or _CorniÅ¿h_ counterfeit
    Youâld put vpon vs.
                              _He turns to old_ Guilt-head.

    Hâhas all his corners, view him well.

                  MER. Hâis yellow.

    GVI. Vpoâ my faith, S^r, oâ the right black-water,
    And very deepe! Hâis Å¿et without a foyle, too.                 180
    Hereâs one oâ the yellow-water, Iâll Å¿ell cheape.

    MER. And what do you valew this, at? thirty pound?

    GVI. No, Sir, he cost me forty, ere he was Å¿et.

    MER. Turnings, you meane? I know your _Equinocks_:
    Youâare growne the better Fathers of âhem oâ late.             185
    Well, whereât muÅ¿t goe, âtwill be iudgâd, and, therefore,
    Looke youât be right. You Å¿hall haue fifty pound forât.

    Nothing you purpoÅ¿e. Then, heâis of opinion,
    That _RobinÅ¿on_ might want audacity,                      [129]
    She being Å¿uch a gallant. Now, hee has beene,
    In _Spaine_, and knowes the faÅ¿hions there; and can

    To Å¿ay, he weares _Cioppinos_: and they doe Å¿o
    In _Spaine_. And _RobinÅ¿onâs_ as tall, as hee.

    To his beÅ¿t vÅ¿e?

    Neuer feare that: canÅ¿t thou get neâr a bird?
    No _ThruÅ¿hes_ hungry? Stay, till cold weather come,
    Iâll help thee to an _OuÅ¿ell_, or, a _Field-fare_.
    Whoâs within, with Madame?

              PIT. Iâll tell you straight.                           5

    MER. PleaÅ¿e you Å¿tay here, a while Sir, Iâle goe in.

    PVG. I doe Å¿o long to haue a little venery,
    While I am in this body! I would taÅ¿t
    Of euery Å¿inne, a little, if it might be
    After the mÄner of man! _Sweet-heart!_

                 PVG. I Å¿ent it you.

      PVG. A fellow here, eâen now,                                 20
    Came for it iâ your name.

    What fellow was it, doe you know him?

         PVG. Here,
    But now, he had it.

              MER. Saw you any? _Traines_?                          25

                           PVG. I aske,
    Sir, credit for another, but till to morrow?

    MER. There is not Å¿o much time, Sir. But how euer,
    The lady is a noble Lady, and will
    (To Å¿aue a Gentleman from check) be intreated
                     Mere-craft _promiÅ¿eth faintly, yet comforts him_.
    To Å¿ay, Å¿he haâs receiuâd it.

    Will Å¿hee be won?

              MER. No doubt, to Å¿uch an office,
    It will be a Ladyâs brauery, and her pride.

    PVG. And not be knowne onât after, vnto him?

    MER. That were a treachery! Vpon my word,
    Be confident. Returne vnto your maÅ¿ter,                         50
    My _Lady PreÅ¿ident_ Å¿its this after-noone,

TAILE-BVSH.   MERE-CRAFT.   MANLY.

    A Pox vpoâ referring to _CommiÅ¿sioners_,
    Iâhad rather heare that it were paÅ¿t the Å¿eales:
    Your _Courtiers_ moue Å¿o Snaile-like iâ your _BuÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e_.
    Wuld I had begun wiâ you.

                        MER. We muÅ¿t moue,
    _Madame_, in order, by degrees: not iump.                        5

    TAY. Why, there was S^r. _Iohn Monie-man_ could iump
    A _BuÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e_ quickely.

                        MER. True, hee had great friends,
    But, becauÅ¿e Å¿ome, Å¿weete _Madame_, can leape ditches,
    Wee muÅ¿t not all Å¿hunne to goe ouer bridges.
    The harder parts, I make account are done:                      10
                                          _He flatters her._
    Now, âtis referrâd. You are infinitly bound
    Vntoâthe _Ladies_, they haâ so criâd it vp!

    TAY. Doe they like it then?

    MER. They haâ Å¿ent the _SpaniÅ¿h-Lady_,
    To gratulate with you--

      TAY. I must Å¿end âhem thankes
    And Å¿ome remembrances.

      MER. That you muÅ¿t, and viÅ¿it âhem.                           15
    Whereâs _Ambler_?

         TAY. LoÅ¿t, to day, we cannot heare of him.

    MER. Not _Madam_?

             TAY. No in good faith. They Å¿ay he lay not
    At home, to night. And here has fallân a _BuÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e_
    Betweene your CouÅ¿in, and MaÅ¿ter _Manly_, has
    Vnquieted vs all.

    MER. So I heare, _Madame_.                                      20
    Pray you how was it?

                     TAY. Troth, it but appeares
    Ill oâ your KinÅ¿mans part. You may haue heard,
    That _Manly_ is a Å¿utor to me, I doubt not:

    MER. I gueÅ¿sâd it, _Madame_.

                   TAY. And it Å¿eemes, he truÅ¿ted
    Your CouÅ¿in to let fall some faire reports                      25
    Of him vnto mee.

            MER. Which he did!

                               TAY. So farre
    From it, as hee came in, and tooke him rayling
    AgainÅ¿t him.

            MER. How! And what said _Manly_ to him?

    TAY. Inough, I doe aÅ¿Å¿ure you: and with that Å¿corne
    Of him, and the iniury, as I doe wonder                         30
    How _Euerill_ bore it! But that guilt vndoeâs
    Many mens valors.

            MER. Here comes _Manly_.

         MAN. _Madame_,                                       [143]
    Iâll take my leaue--

                      Manly _offers to be gone_.

           TAY. You Å¿haâ not goe, iâ faith.
    Iâll haâ you Å¿tay, and Å¿ee this _SpaniÅ¿h_ miracle,
    Of our _EngliÅ¿h Ladie_.

            MAN. Let me pray your _LadiÅ¿hip_,                       35
    Lay your commands on me, some other time.

    TAY. Now, I proteÅ¿t: and I will haue all piecâd,
    And friends againe.

            MAN. It will be but ill Å¿olderâd!

    TAY. You are too much affected with it.

                              MAN. I cannot
    _Madame_, but thinke onât for thâ iniuÅ¿tice.

              TAY. Sir,                                             40
    His kinÅ¿man here is Å¿orry.

                      MER. Not I, _Madam_,
    I am no kin to him, wee but call CouÅ¿ins,
                                  Mere-craft _denies him_.
    And if wee were, Sir, I haue no relation
    Vnto his crimes.

                  MAN. You are not vrged with âhem.
    I can accuÅ¿e, Sir, none but mine owne iudgement,                45
    For though it were his crime, Å¿o to betray mee:
    I am Å¿ure, âtwas more mine owne, at all to truÅ¿t him.
    But he, therein, did vÅ¿e but his old manners,
    And fauour Å¿trongly what hee was before.

    TAY. Come, he will change!

        MAN. Faith, I muÅ¿t neuer think it.                          50
    Nor were it reaÅ¿on in mee to expect
    That for my Å¿ake, hee Å¿hould put off a nature
    Hee Å¿uckâd in with his milke. It may be _Madam_,
    Deceiuing truÅ¿t, is all he has to truÅ¿t to:
    If Å¿o, I Å¿hall be loath, that any hope                          55
    Of mine, Å¿hould bate him of his meanes.

         TAY. Yoâ are Å¿harp, Sir.
    This act may make him honeÅ¿t!

                               MAN. If he were
    To be made honeÅ¿t, by an act of _Parliament_,
    I Å¿hould not alter, iâ my faith of him.

                                     TAY. _Eyther-Å¿ide!_
    Welcome, deare _Either-Å¿ide_! how haÅ¿t thou done, good wench?

    From your great friends, at _Court_, to Å¿ee your _Ladi-Å¿hip_:
    And haue the honour of your acquaintance.

         TAY. Sir.
    She doâs vs honour.

              WIT. Pray you, Å¿ay to her _LadiÅ¿hip_,
    It is the manner of _Spaine_, to imbrace onely,                  5

    To take a Å¿eate.

                WIT. Yes, _Madame_. Iâhaue had
    The fauour, through a world of faire report
    To know your vertues, _Madame_; and in that                     10
    Name, haue deÅ¿irâd the happineÅ¿Å¿e of preÅ¿enting
    My Å¿eruice to your _LadiÅ¿hip_!

    TAY. Your loue, _Madame_,

       WIT. Both are due, _Madame_,
    To your great vndertakings.

                     TAY. Great? In troth, _Madame_,
    They are my friends, that thinke âhem any thing:                15
    If I can doe my Å¿exe (by âhem) any Å¿eruice,
    Iâhaue my ends, _Madame_.

    That make a multitude beholden, _Madame_:
    The common-wealth of _Ladies_, muÅ¿t acknowledge from you.

    EIT. Except Å¿ome enuious, _Madame_.

           WIT. Yoâ are right in that, _Madame_,                    20
    Of which race, I encountred Å¿ome but lately.
    Who (ât Å¿eemes) haue Å¿tudyed reaÅ¿ons to diÅ¿credit

               TAY. How, Å¿weet _Madame_.

                             WIT. Nay, the parties
    Wiâ not be worth your pauÅ¿e--MoÅ¿t ruinous things, _Madame_,
    That haue put off all hope of being recouerâd                   25
    To a degree of handÅ¿omeneÅ¿Å¿e.

    TAY. But their reaÅ¿ons, _Madame_?
    I would faine heare.

                      WIT. Some _Madame_, I remember.
    They Å¿ay, that painting quite deÅ¿troyes the face--

    EIT. O, thatâs an old one, _Madame_.

                          Manly _begins to know him_.

    Of heat, and motion, may diÅ¿place the colours;
    And if the paint once runne about their faces,
    Twenty to one, they will appeare Å¿o ill-fauourâd,
    Their Å¿eruants run away, too, and leaue the pleaÅ¿ure            45
    Imperfect, and the reckoning all vnpayâd.

    EIT. Pox, theÅ¿e are _Poets_ reaÅ¿ons.

                                TAY. Some old _Lady_
    That keepes a _Poet_, has deuisâd theÅ¿e Å¿candales.

    At your Å¿trange faÅ¿hionâd venture, hither.

                          VVIT. It is

    Of the white _Hen_, of the _Lady EÅ¿tifanias_!                   40

    TAY. O, I, that Å¿ame, good _Madame_, I haue heard of:

    Be not afraid, Å¿weet _Lady_: yoâ are truÅ¿ted           [154]
    To loue, not violence here; I am no rauiÅ¿her,
    But one, whom you, by your faire truÅ¿t againe,
    May of a Å¿eruant make a moÅ¿t true friend.

    M^rs. FI. And Å¿uch a one I need, but not this way:               5
    Sir, I confeÅ¿Å¿e me to you, the meere manner
    Of your attempting mee, this morning tooke mee,
    And I did hold mâinuention, and my manners,
    Were both engagâd, to giue it a requitall;
    But not vnto your ends: my hope was then,                       10
    (Though interrupted, ere it could be vtterâd)
    That whom I found the MaÅ¿ter of Å¿uch language,
    That braine and Å¿pirit, for Å¿uch an enterpriÅ¿e,
    Could not, but if thoÅ¿e Å¿uccours were demanded
    To a right vÅ¿e, employ them vertuouÅ¿ly!                         15
    And make that profit of his noble parts,
    Which they would yeeld. S^r, you haue now the ground,
    To exerciÅ¿e them in: I am a woman:
    That cannot Å¿peake more wretchedneÅ¿Å¿e of my Å¿elfe,
    Then you can read; matchâd to a maÅ¿Å¿e of folly;                 20
    That euery day makes haÅ¿te to his owne ruine;
    The wealthy portion, that I brought him, Å¿pent;
    And (through my friends neglect) no ioynture made me.
    My fortunes Å¿tanding in this precipice,
    âTis _CounÅ¿ell_ that I want, and honeÅ¿t aides:                  25
    And in this name, I need you, for a friend!
    Neuer in any other; for his ill,
    MuÅ¿t not make me, S^r, worÅ¿e.

               Manly, _concealâd this while, Å¿hews himÅ¿elf_.

                 MAN. O friend! forÅ¿ake not
    The braue occaÅ¿ion, vertue offers you,
    To keepe you innocent: I haue fearâd for both;                  30
    And watchâd you, to preuent the ill I fearâd.
    But, Å¿ince the weaker Å¿ide hath Å¿o aÅ¿Å¿urâd mee,
    Let not the Å¿tronger fall by his owne vice,
    Or be the leÅ¿Å¿e a friend, cauÅ¿e vertue needs him.

    WIT. Vertue Å¿hall neuer aske my Å¿uccours twice;                 35
    MoÅ¿t friend, moÅ¿t man: your _CounÅ¿ells_ are commands:
    Lady, I can loue _goodnes_ in you, more                  [155]
    Then I did _Beauty_; and doe here intitle
    Your vertue, to the power, vpon a life
    You Å¿hall engage in any fruitfull Å¿eruice,                      40

    Heâhaâs a quarrell to carry, and haâs cauÅ¿âd
    A deed of _Feoffment_, of his whole eÅ¿tate
    To be drawne yonder; hâhaâÅ¿t within: And you,                   45
    Onely, he meanes to make _Feoffee_. Hâis falne
    So deÅ¿peratly enamourâd on you, and talkes
    MoÅ¿t like a mad-man: you did neuer heare
    A _Phrentick_, Å¿o in loue with his owne fauour!
    Now, you doe know, âtis of no validity                          50
    In your name, as you Å¿tand; Therefore aduiÅ¿e him

AMBLER.   PITFALL.   MERE-CRAFT.

    Bvt haâs my Lady miÅ¿t me?

                          PIT. Beyond telling!
    Here haâs been that infinity of Å¿trangers!
    And then Å¿he would haâ had you, to haâ Å¿ampled you
    VVith one within, that they are now a teaching;
    And doâs pretend to your ranck.

                        AMB. Good fellow _Pit-fall_,                 5
    Tel M^r. _Mere-craft_, I intreat a word with him.
                                        Pitfall _goes out_.
    This most vnlucky accident will goe neare
    To be the loÅ¿Å¿e oâ my place; I am in doubt!

    MER. VVith me? what Å¿ay you M^r _Ambler_?

                                      AMB. Sir,
    I would beÅ¿eech your worÅ¿hip Å¿tand betweene                     10
    Me, and my _Ladies_ diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ure, for my abÅ¿ence.

    MER. O, is that all? I warrant you.

    AMB. I would tell you Sir
    But how it happened.

                 MER. Brief, good MaÅ¿ter _Ambler_,
    Put your selfe to your rack: for I haue taÅ¿que
    Of more importance.
                         Mere-craft _Å¿eemes full of buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e_.

                 AMB. Sir youâll laugh at me?                       15
    But (Å¿o is _Truth_) a very friend of mine,
    Finding by conference with me, that I liuâd
    Too chaÅ¿t for my complexion (and indeed
    Too honeÅ¿t for my place, Sir) did aduiÅ¿e me
    If I did loue my Å¿elfe (as that I do,                           20
    I muÅ¿t confeÅ¿Å¿e)

               MER. Spare your _ParentheÅ¿is_.

    AMB. To giâ my body a little euacuation--

    MER. Well, and you went to a whore?

                         AMB. No, S^r. I durÅ¿t not
    (For feare it might arriue at Å¿ome bodyâs eare,
    It Å¿hould not) truÅ¿t my Å¿elfe to a common houÅ¿e;                25
                    Ambler _tels this with extraordinary Å¿peed_.
    But got the Gentlewoman to goe with me,
    And carry her bedding to a _Conduit-head_,
    Hard by the place toward _Tyborne_, which they call
    My L. Majors _Banqueting-houÅ¿e_. Now Sir, This morning
    Was _Execution_; and I nerâe dreamât onât 30
    Till I heard the noiÅ¿e oâ the people, and the horÅ¿es;
    And neither I, nor the poore Gentlewoman                 [159]
    DurÅ¿t Å¿tirre, till all was done and paÅ¿t: Å¿o that
    Iâ the _Interim_, we fell a Å¿leepe againe.

                                            _He flags_.

    MER. Nay, if you fall, from your gallop, I am gone S^r.         35

    AMB. But, when I wakâd, to put on my cloathes, a Å¿ute,
    I made new for the action, it was gone,
    And all my money, with my purÅ¿e, my Å¿eales,
    My hard-wax, and my table-bookes, my Å¿tudies,
    And a fine new deuiÅ¿e, I had to carry                           40
    My pen, and inke, my ciuet, and my tooth-picks,
    All vnder one. But, that which greiuâd me, was
    The Gentlewomanâs Å¿hoes (with a paire of roÅ¿es,
    And garters, I had giuen her for the buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e)
    So as that made vs Å¿tay, till it was darke.                     45
    For I was faine to lend her mine, and walke
    In a rug, by her, barefoote, to Saint _Gilesâes_.

    MER. A kind of IriÅ¿h penance! Is this all, Sir?

    AMB. To Å¿atisfie my _Lady_.

                     MER. I will promiÅ¿e you, S^r.

    AMB. I haâ told the true _DiÅ¿aÅ¿ter_.

                     MER. I cannot Å¿tay wiâ you                     50
    Sir, to condole; but gratulate your returne.

    AMB. An honeÅ¿t gentleman, but heâs neuer at leiÅ¿ure

    O, Call me home againe, deare _Chiefe_, and put me
    To yoaking foxes, milking of Hee-goates,
    Pounding of water in a morter, lauing
    The Å¿ea dry with a nut-Å¿hell, gathering all
    The leaues are falne this _Autumne_, drawing farts               5
    Out of dead bodies, making ropes of Å¿and,
    Catching the windes together in a net,
    MuÅ¿tring of ants, and numbring atomes; all
    That hell, and you thought exquiÅ¿ite torments, rather
    Then Å¿tay me here, a thought more: I would Å¿ooner               10
    Keepe fleas within a circle, and be accomptant
    A thouÅ¿and yeere, which of âhem and how far
    Out leapâd the other, then endure a minute
    Such as I haue within. There is no hell
    To a _Lady_ of faÅ¿hion. All your torture there                  15
    Are paÅ¿times to it. âT would be a refreÅ¿hing           [160]

                           Ambler _comes in, & Å¿uruayes him_.

    AMB. This is my Å¿uite, and thoÅ¿e the Å¿hoes and roÅ¿es!

    Ha! This is hee, I tooke a Å¿leepe with his _Wench_,
    And borrowâd his cloathes. What might I doe to balke him?

    AMB. Do you heare, S^r?

             PVG. Answ. him but not to thâpurpoÅ¿e

    AMB. What is your name, I pray you Sir.

    PVG. I thanke you, Sir. Yes it dos hold Sir, certaine.

    AMB. Hold, Sir? what holds? I muÅ¿t both hold, and talke to you
    About theÅ¿e clothes.

       PVG. A very pretty lace!
    But the _Taylor_ coÅ¿Å¿end me.

    By you! robbâd.

              AMB. Pox oâ your _gleeke_,
    And three pence. Giue me an anÅ¿were.

    Who is your MaÅ¿ter.

             PVG. Let it be friday night.

    AMB. What Å¿hould be then?

             PVG. Your beÅ¿t Å¿ongs _Thom. oâ Betâlem_                35

    Or do not I Å¿peake to him, what I meane?
    Good Sir your name.

             PVG. Only a couple aâ _Cocks_ Sir,
    If we can get a _Widgin_, âtis in Å¿eaÅ¿on.

AMBLER.  {_To them._

    O MaÅ¿ter _Sledge_, are you here? I haâ been to Å¿eeke you.
    You are the _ConÅ¿table_, they Å¿ay. Hereâs one
    That I do charge with _Felony_, for the Å¿uite
    He weares, Sir.

    MER. Who? M. _Fitz-Dottrels_ man?
    Ware what you do, M. _Ambler_.

                        AMB. Sir, theÅ¿e clothes                      5
    Iâll Å¿weare, are mine: and the Å¿hooes the gentlewomans
    I told you of: and haâ him afore a _IuÅ¿tice_,             [163]
    I will.

         PVG. My maÅ¿ter, Sir, will paÅ¿Å¿e his word for me.

    AMB. O, can you Å¿peake to purpoÅ¿e now?

                                   FIT. Not I,
    If you be Å¿uch a one Sir, I will leaue you                      10
    To your _God fathers_ in Law. Let twelue men worke.

                               Fitz-dottrel _diÅ¿claimes him_.

    PVG. Do you heare Sir, pray, in priuate.

               FIT. well, what Å¿ay you?
    Briefe, for I haue no time to looÅ¿e.

                      PVG. Truth is, Sir,
    I am the very _Diuell_, and had leaue
    To take this body, I am in, to Å¿erue you;                       15
    Which was a _CutpurÅ¿es_, and hangâd this Morning.
    And it is likewiÅ¿e true, I Å¿tole this Å¿uite
    To cloth me with. But Sir let me not goe
    To priÅ¿on for it. I haue hitherto
    LoÅ¿t time, done nothing; Å¿howne, indeed, no part                20
    Oâ my _Diuels_ nature. Now, I will Å¿o helpe
    Your malice, âgainst theÅ¿e parties; Å¿o aduance
    The buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e, that you haue in hand of _witchcraft_,
    And your _poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion_, as my Å¿elfe were in you.
    Teach you Å¿uch tricks, to make your belly Å¿well,                25
    And your eyes turne, to foame, to Å¿tare, to gnaÅ¿h
    Your teeth together, and to beate your Å¿elfe,
    Laugh loud, and faine Å¿ix voices--

                              FIT. Out you Rogue!
    You moÅ¿t infernall counterfeit wretch! Auant!
    Do you thinke to gull me with your _ÃÅ¿ops Fables_?              30
    Here take him to you, I haâ no part in him.

              PVG. Sir.

    FIT. Away, I do diÅ¿claime, I will not heare you.

                                     _And Å¿ends him away._

    MER. What Å¿aid he to you, Sir?

    FIT. Like a lying raskall
    Told me he was the _Diuel_.

              MER. How! a good ieÅ¿t!

    FIT. And that he would teach me, Å¿uch fine _diuels_ tricks      35
    For our new reÅ¿olution.

                                   EVE. Oâ pox on him,
    âTwas excellent wiÅ¿ely done, Sir, not to truÅ¿t him.

              Mere-craft _giues the instructions to him and the reÅ¿t_.

    MER. Why, if he were the Diuel, we Å¿haâ not need him,
    If youâll be rulâd. Goe throw your Å¿elfe on a bed, Sir,
    And faine you ill. Weeâll not be Å¿eene wiâ you,                 40
    Till after, that you haue a fit: and all
    Confirmâd within. Keepe you with the two _Ladies_
    And perÅ¿wade them. Iâll to _IuÅ¿tice Either-Å¿ide_,
    And poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e him with all. _Traines_ Å¿hall Å¿eeke out _Ingine_,
    And they two fill the towne withât, euery cable                 45
    Is to be veerâd. We muÅ¿t employ out all
    Our _emiÅ¿Å¿aries_ now; Sir, I will Å¿end you
    _Bladders_ and _Bellowes_. Sir, be confident,
    âTis no hard thing tâout doe the _Deuill_ in:
    A Boy oâ thirteene yeere old made him an _AÅ¿Å¿e_                 50
    But tâtoher day.

            FIT. Well, Iâll beginne to practice;
    And Å¿cape the imputation of being _Cuckold_,
    By mine owne act.

               MER. yoâ are right.

                                 EVE. Come, you haâ put
    Your Å¿elfe to a Å¿imple coyle here, and your freinds,     [164]
    By dealing with new _Agents_, in new plots.                     55

    MER. No more oâ that, Å¿weet couÅ¿in.

                               EVE. What had you
    To doe with this Å¿ame _Wittipol_, for a _Lady_?

    MER. QueÅ¿tion not that: âtis done.

    EVE. You had Å¿ome Å¿traine
    âBoue E-_la_?

         MER. I had indeed.

             EVE. And, now, you crack forât.

    MER. Do not vpbraid me.

         EVE. Come, you muÅ¿t be told onât;                          60
    You are Å¿o couetous, Å¿till, to embrace
    More then you can, that you looÅ¿e all.

                                         MER. âTis right.

    To _New-gate_, brought? How is the name of _Deuill_
    DiÅ¿credited in me! What a loÅ¿t fiend
    Shall I be, on returne? My _Cheife_ will roare                  5

    A day, and done no noted thing, but brought
    That body back here, was hangâd out this morning.
    Well! would it once were midnight, that I knew

    He is Å¿o Å¿till, and moues not! I doe glory

    Put a looke on, as round, boy, and red as a cherry.
    CaÅ¿t care at thy poÅ¿ternes; and firke iâ thy fetters,           15
    They are ornaments, _Baby_, haue graced thy betters:
    Looke vpon me, and hearken. Our _Cheife_ doth Å¿alute thee,
    And leaÅ¿t the coldyron Å¿hould chance to confute thee,

    That Å¿o thou mayeÅ¿t haue a triumphall egreÅ¿Å¿ion.

    PVG. In a cart, to be hangâd.

                       ING. No, _Child_, in a Carre,
    The charriot of Triumph, which moÅ¿t of them are.
    And in the meane time, to be greazy, and bouzy,                 25
    And naÅ¿ty, and filthy, and ragged and louzy,
    With damân me, renounce me, and all the fine phraÅ¿es;

    PVG. He is a _Diuell_! and may be our _Cheife_!          [165]
    The great Superiour _Diuell_! for his malice:                   30
    _Arch-diuel_! I acknowledge him. He knew
    What I would Å¿uffer, when he tieâd me vp thus
    In a rogues body: and he has (I thanke him)
    His tyrannous pleaÅ¿ure on me, to confine me
    To the vnlucky carkaÅ¿Å¿e of a _CutpurÅ¿e_,                        35
    wherein I could do nothing.

                         _The great_ Deuill _enters, and vpbraids
                              him with all his dayes worke_.

                           DIV. Impudent fiend,
    Stop thy lewd mouth. DoeÅ¿t thou not Å¿hame and tremble
    To lay thine owne dull damnâd defects vpon
    An innocent caÅ¿e, there? Why thou heauy Å¿laue!
    The Å¿pirit, that did poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e that fleÅ¿h before                 40
    Put more true life, in a finger, and a thumbe,
    Then thou in the whole MaÅ¿Å¿e. Yet thou rebellâÅ¿t
    And murmurâÅ¿t? What one profer haÅ¿t thou made,
    Wicked inough, this day, that might be callâd
    Worthy thine owne, much leÅ¿Å¿e the name that Å¿ent thee?          45
    FirÅ¿t, thou didâÅ¿t helpe thy Å¿elfe into a beating
    Promptly, and withât endangeredâÅ¿t too thy tongue:
    A _Diuell_, and could not keepe a body intire
    One day! That, for our credit. And to vindicate it,
    HinderdâÅ¿t (for ought thou knowâÅ¿t) a deed of darkneÅ¿Å¿e:        50
    Which was an act of that egregious folly,
    As no one, toâard the _Diuel_, could haâ thought on.
    This for your acting! but for suffering! why
    Thou haÅ¿t beene cheated on, with a falÅ¿e beard,
    And a turnâd cloake. Faith, would your predeceÅ¿Å¿our             55
    The _CutpurÅ¿e_, thinke you, haâ been Å¿o? Out vpon thee,
    The hurt thâ haÅ¿t don, to let men know their Å¿trength,
    And that theâare able to out-doe a _diuel_
    Put in a body, will for euer be
    A Å¿carre vpon our Name! whom haÅ¿t thou dealt with,              60
    Woman or man, this day, but haue out-gone thee
    Some way, and moÅ¿t haue prouâd the better fiendes?
    Yet, you would be imployâd? Yes, hell Å¿hall make you
    _Prouinciall_ oâ the _Cheaters_! or _Bawd-ledger_,
    For this Å¿ide oâ the towne! No doubt youâll render              65
    A rare accompt of things. Bane oâ your itch,
    And Å¿cratching for imployment. Iâll haâ brimÅ¿tone
    To allay it Å¿ure, and fire to Å¿indge your nayles off,
    But, that I would not Å¿uch a damnâd diÅ¿honor
    Sticke on our Å¿tate, as that the _diuell_ were hangâd;          70
    And could not Å¿aue a body, that he tooke
    From _Tyborne_, but it muÅ¿t come thither againe:
    You Å¿hould eâen ride. But, vp away with him--

    He that caries the fiend, is Å¿ure of his loade.                 75

TITLE-PAGE.

=THE DIUELL IS AN ASSE.= âSchlegel, seizing with great felicity upon
an untranslateable German idiom, called the play _Der dumme Teufel_
[Schlegelâs _Werke_, ed. BÃ¶cking, 6. 340]--a title which must be
allowed to be twice as good as that of the English original. The
phrase âthe Devil is an assâ appears to have been proverbial.
See Fletcherâs _The Chances_, Act 5. Sc. 2:

                             Dost thou think
    The devil such an ass as people make him?â
                                         --Ward, _Eng. Drama_ 2. 372.

A still more important passage occurs in Dekkerâs _If this be not a
good Play_, a partial source of Jonsonâs drama:

    _Scu._ Sweete-breads I hold my life, that diuels an asse.
                                          --Dekker, _Wks._ 3. 328.

Jonson uses it again in _The Staple of News_, _Wks._ 5. 188:

    The conjurer cozened him with a candleâs end; he was an ass.

Dekker (_Non-dram. Wks._ 2. 275) tells us the jest of a citizen
who was told that the âLawyers get the Diuell and all: What an
Asse, replied the Citizen is the diuell? If I were as he I would
get some of them.â

=HIS MAIESTIES SERVANTS.= Otherwise known as the
_Kingâs Company_, and popularly spoken of as the _Kingâs Men_. For
an account of this company see Winter, ed. _Staple of News_, p. 121;
and Fleay, _Biog. Chron._ 1. 356-7; 2. 403-4.

=Ficta voluptatis=, etc. The quotation is from Horace,
_De Art. Poet._, line 338. Jonsonâs translation is:

    Let what thou feignâst for pleasureâs sake, be near
    The truth.

Jonson makes use of this quotation again in his note âTo the
Readerâ prefixed to Act 3 of _The Staple of News_.

=I. B.= Fleay speaks of this printer as J. Benson (_Biog. Chron_. 1.
354). Benson did not âtake up freedomâ until June 30, 1631 (_Sta.
Reg._ 3. 686). Later he became a publisher (1635-40; _Sta. Reg._ 5.
lxxxiv). I. B. was also the printer of _Bartholomew Fair_ and _Staple
of News_. J. Benson published a volume of Jonsonâs, containing
_The Masque of the Gypsies_ and other poems, in 1640 (_Brit. Museum
Cat._ and Yale Library). In the same year he printed the _Art of
Poetry_, 12mo, and the _Execration against Vulcan_, 4to (cf. _Pub. of
Grolier Club_, N. Y. 1893, pp. 130, 132). The evidence that I. B. was
Benson is strong, but not absolutely conclusive.

=ROBERT ALLOT.= We find by Arberâs reprint of the
_Stationerâs Register_ that Robert Allot âtook up freedomâ Nov. 7,
1625. He must have begun publishing shortly after, for under the
date of Jan. 25, 1625-6 we find that Mistris Hodgettes âassigned
over unto him all her estate,â consisting of the copies of certain
books, for the âsome of forty-five pounds.â The first entry of a
book to Allot is made May 7, 1626. In 1630 Master Blount âassigned
over unto him all his estate and right in the copiesâ of sixteen of
Shakespeareâs plays. In 1632 Allot brought out the Second Folio
of Shakespeareâs works. On Sept. 7, 1631 _The Staple of News_ was
assigned to him. The last entry of a book in his name is on Sept.
12, 1635. The first mention of âMistris Allottâ is under the date of
Dec. 30, 1635. Under date of July 1, 1637 is the record of the
assignment by Mistris Allott of certain books, formerly the estate
of âMaster Roberte Allotts deceased.â Among these books are â37.
_Shakespeares Workes_ their part. 39. _Staple of Newes_ a Play.
40. _Bartholomew fayre_ a Play.â I have been able to find no record
of _The Devil is an Ass_ in the _Stationerâs Register_.

=the Beare.= In the Shakespeare folio of 1632 Allotâs sign reads
âthe Black Beare.â The first mention of the shop in the _London
Street Directory_ is in 1575, among the âHouses round the Churchyard.â

=Pauls Church-yard.= âBefore the Fire, which destroyed the old
Cathedral, St. Paulâs Churchyard was chiefly inhabited by stationers,
whose shops were then, and until the year 1760, distinguished by
signs.â--Wh-C.


THE PERSONS OF THE PLAY.

=GVILT-HEAD, A Gold-smith.= The goldsmiths seem to have
been a prosperous guild. (See Stow, _Survey_, ed. Thoms, p. 114.)
At this time they performed the office of banking, constituting the
intermediate stage between the usurer and the modern banker. âThe
goldsmiths began to borrow at interest in order to lend out to
traders at a higher rate. In other words they became the connecting
link between those who had money to lend and those who wished
to borrow for trading purposes, or it might be to improve their
estates. No doubt at first the goldsmiths merely acted as guardians
of their clientsâ hoards, but they soon began to utilize those hoards
much as bankers now make use of the money deposited with
them.â--_Social England_ 3. 544.

=AMBLER.= Jonson uses this name again in _Neptuneâs Triumph_,
_Wks._ 8. 32:

    Grave master Ambler, news-master oâ Paulâs,
    Supplies your capon.

It reappears in _The Staple of News_.

=Her Gentlemanvsher.= For an exposition of the character and
duties of the gentleman-usher see the notes to 4. 4. 134. 201, 215.

=Newgate.= âThis gate hath of long time been a gaol, or prison
for felons and trespassers, as appeareth by records in the reign of
King John, and of other kings.â--Stow, _Survey_, ed. Thoms, p. 14.


THE PROLOGUE.

=1 The DIVELL is an Asse.= âThis is said by the prologue pointing
to the _title_ of the play, which as was then the custom, was
painted in large letters and placed in some conspicuous part of the
stage.â--G.

Cf. _Poetaster_, _After the second sounding_: âWhatâs here? THE
ARRAIGNMENT!â Also _Wily Beguiled_: _Prol._ How now, my
honest rogue? What play shall we have here to-night?

    _Player._ Sir, you may look upon the title.
    _Prol._   What, _Spectrum_ once again?â

Jonson often, but not invariably, announces the title of
the play in the prologue or induction. Cf. _Every Man out_,
_Cynthiaâs Revels_, _Poetaster_, and all plays subsequent
to _Bart. Fair_ except _Sad Shep_.

=3 Grandeeâs.= Jonson uses this affected form of address
again in _Timber_, ed. Schelling. 22. 27

=4 allowing vs no place.= As Gifford points out, the prologue is a
protest against the habit prevalent at the time of crowding the stage
with stools for the accommodation of the spectators.

Dekker in Chapter 6 of _The Guls Horne-booke_ gives the gallant full
instructions as to the behavior proper to the play-house. The youth
is advised to wait until âthe quaking prologue hath (by rubbing) got
culor into his cheekesâ, and then âto creepe from behind the Arras,â
and plant himself âon the very Rushes where the Commedy is to daunce,
yea, and vnder the state of Cambises himselfe.â Sir John Davies makes
a similar allusion _(Epigrams_, ed. Grosart, 2. 10). Jonson makes
frequent reference to the subject. Cf. _Induction_ to _The Staple
of News_, _Every Man out_, _Wks._ 2. 31; _Prologue_ to _Cynthiaâs
Revels_, _Wks._ 2. 210, etc.

=5 a subtill thing.= I. e., thin, airy, spiritual, and so not
occupying space.

=6 worne in a thumbe-ring.= âNothing was more common, as we learn
from Lilly, than to carry about familiar spirits, shut up in rings,
watches, sword-hilts, and other articles of dress.â--G.

I have been unable to verify Giffordâs statement from Lilly,
but the following passage from Harsnetâs _Declaration_ (p. 13)
confirms it: âFor compassing of this treasure, there was a
consociation betweene 3 or 4 priests, _deuill-coniurers_, and
4 _discouerers_, or _seers_, reputed to carry about with them,
their familiars in rings, and glasses, by whose suggestion they
came to notice of those golden hoards.â

Gifford says that thumb-rings of Jonsonâs day were set with jewels
of an extraordinary size, and that they appear to have been âmore
affected by magistrates and grave citizens than necromancers.â Cf.
_I Henry IV_ 2. 4: âI could have crept into any aldermanâs thumb-ring.â
Also _Witts Recreat._, _Epig._ 623:

    He wears a hoop-ring on his thumb; he has
    Of gravidad a dose, full in the face.

Glapthorne, _Wit in a Constable_, 1639, 4. 1: âAn alderman--I may
say to you, he has no more wit than the rest of the bench, and that
lies in his thumb-ring.â

=8 In compasse of a cheese-trencher.= The figure seems forced
to us, but it should be remembered that trenchers were a very
important article of table equipment in Jonsonâs day. They were
often embellished with âposies,â and it is possible that Jonson was
thinking of the brevity of such inscriptions. Cf. Dekker, _North-Ward
Hoe_ 3. 1 (_Wks._ 3. 38): âIle have you make 12. poesies for a dozen
of cheese trenchers.â Also _Honest Whore_, Part I, Sc. 13; and
Middleton, _Old Law_ 2. 1 (_Wks._ 2. 149); _No Wit, no Help like a
Womanâs_ 2. 1 (_Wks._ 4. 322).

=15 Like the young adders.= It is said that young adders, when
frightened, run into their motherâs mouth for protection.

=16 Would wee could stand due North.= I. e., be as infallible as
the compass.

=17 Muscouy glasse.= Cf. Marston, _Malcontent_, _Wks_. 1. 234: âShe
were an excellent lady, but that her face peeleth like Muscovy
glass.â Reed (_Old Plays_ 4. 38) quotes from Giles Fletcherâs _Russe
Commonwealth_, 1591, p. 10: âIn the province of Corelia, and about
the river Duyna towards the North-sea, there groweth a soft rock
which they call Slude. This they cut into pieces, and so tear it
into thin _flakes, which naturally it is apt for_, and so use it for
glasse lanthorns and such like. It giveth both inwards and outwards
a clearer light then glasse, and for this respect is better than
either glasse or horne; for that it neither breaketh like glasse, nor
yet will burne like the lanthorne.â Dekker _(Non-dram. Wks._ 2. 135)
speaks of a âMuscouie Lanthorne.â See Gloss.

=22 the Diuell of Edmunton.= _The Merry Devil of Edmunton_ was
acted by the Kingâs Men at the Globe before Oct. 22, 1607. It has
been conjecturally assigned to Shakespeare and to Drayton. Hazlitt
describes it as âperhaps the first example of sentimental comedy
we haveâ (see _O. Pl._, 4th ed., 10. 203 f.). Fleay, who believes
Drayton to be the author, thinks that the âMerry devilâ of _The
Merchant of Venice_ 2. 3, alludes to this play (_Biog. Chron._ 1.
151 and 2. 213). There were six editions in the 17th century, all in
quarto--1608, 1612, 1617, 1626, 1631, 1655. Middleton, _The Black
Book_, _Wks._ 8. 36, alludes to it pleasantly in connection with
_A Woman killâd with Kindness_. Genest mentions it as being revived
in 1682. Cf. also _Staple of News_, 1st Int.

=26 If this Play doe not like=, etc. Jonson refers to Dekkerâs play
of 1612 (see Introduction, p. xxix). On the title-page of this play
we find _If it be not good, The Diuel is in it_. At the head of Act.
1, however, the title reads _If this be not a good play_, etc.


ACT I.

=1. 1. 1 Hoh, hoh=, etc. âWhalley is right in saying that this is
the conventional way for the devil to make his appearance in the old
morality-plays. Gifford objects on the ground that âit is not the roar
of terror; but the boisterous expression of sarcastic merriment at the
absurd petition of Pug;â an objection, the truth of which does not
necessarily invalidate Whalleyâs statement. Jonson of course adapts the
old conventions to his own ends. See Introduction, p. xxiii.

=1. 1. 9 Entring a Sow, to make her cast her farrow?= Cf. Dekker,
etc., _Witch of Edmonton_ (_Wks._ 4. 423): â_Countr._ Iâll be sworn,
_Mr. Carter_, she bewitched Gammer _Washbowls_ sow, to cast her Pigs
a day before she would have farried.â

=1. 1. 11 Totnam.= âThe first notice of Tottenham Court, as a place
of public entertainment, contained in the books of the parish of St.
Gileâs-in-the-Fields, occurs under the year 1645 (Wh-C.). Jonson,
however, as early as 1614 speaks of âcourting it to Totnam to eat
creamâ (_Bart. Fair_, Act 1. Sc. 1, _Wks._ 4. 362). George Wither,
in the _Britainâs Remembrancer_, 1628, refers to the same thing:

    And Hogsdone, Islington, and Tothnam-court,
    For cakes and cream had then no small resort.

Tottenham Fields were until a comparatively recent date a favorite
place of entertainment.

=1. 1. 13 a tonning of Ale=, etc. Cf. _Sad Shep._, _Wks._ 6. 276:

    The house wives tun not work, nor the milk churn.

=1. 1. 15 Spight oâ the housewiues cord, or her hot spit.=
âThere be twentie severall waies to make your butter come, which
for brevitie I omit; as to bind your cherne with a rope, to
thrust thereinto a red hot spit, &c.â--Scot, _Discovery_, p. 229.

=1. 1. 16, 17 Or some good Ribibe ... witch.= This seems
to be an allusion, as Fleay suggests, to Heywoodâs _Wise-Woman
of Hogsdon_. The witch of that play declares her dwelling to
be in âKentstreetâ (Heywoodâs _Wks._ 5. 294). A ribibe meant
originally a musical instrument, and was synonymous with rebec.
By analogy, perhaps, it was applied to a shrill-voiced old
woman. This is Giffordâs explanation. The word occurs again
in Skeltonâs _Elynour Rummyng_, l. 492, and in Chaucer, _The
Freres Tale_, l. 1377: âa widwe, an old ribybe.â Skeat offers
the following explanation: âI suspect that this old joke, for
such it clearly is, arose in a very different way [from that
suggested by Gifford], viz. from a pun upon _rebekke_, a fiddle,
and _Rebekke_, a married woman, from the mention of Rebecca in
the marriage-service. Chaucer himself notices the latter in E. 1704.â

=1. 1. 16 Kentish Towne.= Kentish Town, Cantelows, or Cantelupe
town is the most ancient district in the parish of Pancras. It was
originally a small village, and as late as the eighteenth century a
lonely and somewhat dangerous spot. In later years it became noted
for its Assembly Rooms. In 1809 Hughson (_London_ 6. 369) called it
âthe most romantic hamlet in the parish of Pancras.â It is now a part
of the metropolis. See Samuel Palmerâs _St. Pancras_, London, 1870.

=1. 1. 17 Hogsden.= Stow (_Survey_, ed. Thoms, p. 158) describes
Hogsden as a âlarge street with houses on both sides.â It was a
prebend belonging to St. Paulâs. In Hogsden fields Jonson killed
Gabriel Spenser in a duel in 1598. These fields were a great
resort for the citizens on a holiday. The eating of cream there is
frequently mentioned. See the quotation from Wither under note 1. 1.
11, and _Alchemist_, _Wks._ 4. 155 and 175:

                ----Ay, he would have built
    The city new; and made a ditch about it
    Of silver, should have run with cream from Hogsden.

Stephen in _Every Man in_ dwelt here, and so was forced to associate
with âthe archers of Finsbury, or the citizens that come a-ducking
to Islington ponds.â Hogsden or Hoxton, as it is now called, is
to-day a populous district of the metropolis.

=1. 1. 18 shee will not let you play round Robbin.= The expression
is obscure, and the dictionaries afford little help. Round-robin
is a common enough phrase, but none of the meanings recorded is
applicable in this connection. Some childâs game, played in a circle,
seems to be referred to, or the expression may be a cant term for
âplay the deuce.â Robin is a name of many associations, and its
connection with Robin Hood, Robin Goodfellow, and âRobertâs Menâ
(âThe third old rank of the Canting crew.â--Grose.) makes such an
interpretation more or less probable.

M. N. G. in _N. & Q._ 9th Ser. 10. 394 says that âwhen a man does
a thing in a circuitous, involved manner he is sometimes said âto
go all round Robin Hoodâs barn to do it.ââ âRound Robin Hoodâs
barnâ may possibly have been the name of a game which has been
shortened to âround Robin.â

=1. 1. 21 By a Middlesex Iury.= âA reproof no less severe than
merited. It appears from the records of those times, that many
unfortunate creatures were condemned and executed on charges of the
rediculous nature here enumerated. In many instances, the judge was
well convinced of the innocence of the accused, and laboured to
save them; but such were the gross and barbarous prejudices of the
juries, that they would seldom listen to his recommendations; and
he was deterred from shewing mercy, in the last place by the brutal
ferociousness of the people, _whose teeth were set on edge withât_,
and who clamoured tumultuously for the murder of the accused.â--G.

=1. 1. 32 Lancashire.= This, as Gifford says, âwas the very hot-bed
of witches.â Fifteen were brought to trial on Aug. 19, 1612, twelve
of whom were convicted and burnt on the day after their trial âat the
common place of execution near to Lancaster.â The term âLancashire
Witchesâ is now applied to the beautiful women for which the country
is famed. The details of the Lancaster trial are contained in Pottsâ
_Discoverie_ (Lond. 1613), and a satisfactory account is given by
Wright in his _Sorcery and Magic_.

=1. 1. 33 or some parts of Northumberland.= The first witch-trial
in Northumberland, so far as I have been able to ascertain,
occurred in 1628. This was the trial of the Witch of Leeplish.

=1. 1. 37 a Vice.= See Introduction, pp. xxxiv f.

=1. 1. 38 To practice there-with any play-fellow.= See variants.
The editors by dropping the hyphen have completely changed the
sense of the passage. Pug wants a vice in order that he may corrupt
his play-fellows _there-with_.

    =1. 1. 41 ff. Why, any Fraud;=
            =Or Couetousnesse; or Lady Vanity;=
            =Or old Iniquity.=

Fraud is a character in Robert Wilsonâs _The Three Ladies of London_,
printed 1584, and _The Three Lords and Three Ladies of London_, c
1588, printed 1590. Covetousness appears in _Robin Conscience_, c
1530, and is applied to one of the characters in _The Staple of
News_, _Wks._ 5. 216. Vanity is one of the characters in _Lusty
Juventus_ (see note 1. 1. 50) and in _Contention between Liberality
and Prodigality_, printed 1602 (_O. Pl._ 4th ed., 8. 328). She seems
to have been a favorite with the later dramatists, and is frequently
mentioned (_I Henry IV._ 2. 4; _Lear_ 2. 2; _Jew of Malta_ 2. 3,
Marloweâs _Wks._ 2. 45). Jonson speaks of her again in _The Fox_,
_Wks._ 3. 218. For Iniquity see Introduction, p. xxxviii.

The change in punctuation (see variants), as well as that two lines
below, was first suggested by Upton in a note appended to his
_Critical Observations on Shakespeare_. Whalley silently adopted
the reading in both cases.

=1. 1. 43 Iâll call him hither.= See variants. Coleridge, _Notes_, p.
280, says: âThat is, against all probability, and with a (for Jonson)
impossible violation of character. The words plainly belong to Pug,
and mark at once his simpleness and his impatience.â Cunningham says
that he arrived independently at the same conclusion, and points out
that it is plain from Iniquityâs opening speech that _he_ understood
the words to be Pugâs.

=1. 1. 49 thy dagger.= See note 1. 1. 85.

=1. 1. 50 lusty Iuuentus.= The morality-play of _Lusty Juventus_
was written by R. Wever about 1550. It âbreathes the spirit of the
dogmatic reformation of the Protector Somerset,â but âin spite of its
abundant theology it is neither ill written, nor ill constructedâ
(Ward, _Eng. Drama_ 1. 125). It seems to have been very popular,
and the expression âa lusty Juventusâ became proverbial. It is used
as early as 1582 by Stanyhurst, _Aeneis_ 2 (Arber). 64 and as late
as Heywoodâs _Wise Woman of Hogsdon_ (c 1638), where a gallant is
apostrophised as Lusty Juventus (Act 4). (See Nares and _NED_.)
Portions of the play had been revived not many years before this
within the tragedy of _Thomas More_ (1590, acc. to Fleay 1596) under
the title of _The Mariage of Witt and Wisedome_. âBy dogs precyous
woundesâ is one of the oaths used by Lusty Juventus in the old play,
and may be the âGogs-nownesâ referred to here (_O. Pl._, 4th ed.,
2. 84). âGogs nownsâ is used several times in _Like will to Like_
(_O. Pl._, 4th ed., 3. 327, 331, etc.).

=1. 1. 51 In a cloake to thy heele.= See note 1. 1. 85.

=1. 1. 51 a hat like a pent-house.= âWhen they haue walkt thorow the
streetes, weare their hats ore their eye-browes, like pollitick
penthouses, which commonly make the shop of a Mercer, or a Linnen
Draper, as dark as a roome in Bedlam.â Dekker, _West-ward Hoe_,
_Wks._ 2. 286.

    With your hat penthouse-like oâer the slope of your eyes.
                                   --_Loveâs Labourâs Lost_ 3. 1. 17.

Halliwell says (_L. L. L._, ed. Furness, p. 85): âAn open shed
or shop, forming a protection against the weather. The house
in which Shakespeare was born had a penthouse along a portion
of it.â In Hollybandâs _Dictionarie_, 1593, it is spelled
âpentice,â which shows that the rime to âJuventusâ is probably
not a distorted one.

=1. 1. 52 thy doublet all belly.= âCertaine I am there was neuer any
kinde of apparell euer inuented that could more disproportion the
body of man then these Dublets with great bellies, ... stuffed with
foure, fiue or six pound of Bombast at the least.â--Stubbes, _Anat._,
Part 1, p. 55.

=1. 1. 54 how nimble he is!= âA perfect idea of his activity may be
formed from the incessant skipping of the modern Harlequin.â--G.

=1. 1. 56 the top of Pauls-steeple.= As Gifford points out, Iniquity
is boasting of an impossible feat. St. Paulâs steeple had been
destroyed by fire in 1561, and was not yet restored. Several attempts
were made and money collected. âJames I. countenanced a sermon at
_Paulâs Cross_ in favor of so pious an undertaking, but nothing was
done till 1633 when reparations commenced with some activity, and
Inigo Jones designed, at the expense of Charles I., a classic portico
to a Gothic church.â--Wh-C.

Lupton, _London Carbonadoed_, 1632, writes: âThe head of St. Paulâs
hath twice been troubled with a burning fever, and so the city, to
keep it from a third danger, lets it stand without a head.â Gifford
says that âthe Puritans took a malignant pleasure in this mutilated
state of the cathedral.â Jonson refers to the disaster in his
_Execration upon Vulcan_, _U. 61_, _Wks._ 8. 408. See also Dekker,
_Paules Steeples complaint_, _Non-dram. Wks._ 4. 2.

=1. 1. 56 Standard in Cheepe.= This was a water-stand or conduit
in the midst of the street of West Cheaping, where executions were
formerly held. It was in a ruinous condition in 1442, when it was
repaired by a patent from Henry VI. Stow (_Survey_, ed. Thoms, p.
100) gives a list of famous executions at this place, and says that
âin the year 1399, Henry IV. caused the blanch charters made by
Richard II. to be burnt there.â

=1. 1. 58 a needle of Spaine.= Gifford, referring to Randolphâs
_Amyntos_ and Fordâs _Sunâs Darling_, points out that âthe best
needles, as well as other sharp instruments, were, in that age, and
indeed long before and after it, imported from Spain.â The tailorâs
needle was in cant language commonly termed a _Spanish pike_.

References to the Spanish needle are frequent. It is mentioned by
Jonson in _Chloridia_, _Wks._ 8. 99; by Dekker, _Wks._ 4. 308; and by
Greene, _Wks._ 11. 241. Howes (p. 1038) says: âThe making of Spanish
Needles, was first taught in England by Elias Crowse, a Germane,
about the eight yeare of Queene Elizabeth, and in Queen Maries time,
there was a Negro made fine Spanish Needles in Cheape-side, but would
neuer teach his Art to any.â

=1. 1. 59 the Suburbs.= The suburbs were the outlying districts
without the walls of the city. Cf. Stow, _Survey_, ed. Thoms, p. 156
f. They were for the most part the resort of disorderly persons. Cf.

1. 2.; Shak., _Jul. Caes._ 2. 1; and Nares, _Gloss_. Wheatley (ed.
_Ev. Man in_, p. 1) quotes Chettleâs _Kind Harts Dreame_, 1592: âThe
suburbs of the citie are in many places no other but dark dennes for
adulterers, thieves, murderers, and every mischief worker; daily
experience before the magistrates confirms this for truth.â Cf. also
Glapthorne, _Wit in a Constable_, _Wks._, ed. 1874, 1. 219:

                            ----make safe retreat
    Into the Suburbs, there you may finde cast wenches.

In _Every Man in_, _Wks._ 1. 25, a âsuburb humourâ is spoken of.

=1. 1. 60 Petticoate-lane.= This is the present Middlesex
Street, Whitechapel. It was formerly called Hog Lane and was
beautified with âfair hedge-rows,â but by Stowâs time it had
been made âa continual building throughout of garden houses and
small cottagesâ (_Survey_, ed. 1633, p. 120 b). Strype tells us
that the house of the Spanish Ambassador, supposedly the famous
Gondomar, was situated there (_Survey_ 2. 28). In his day the
inhabitants were French Protestant weavers, and later Jews of a
disreputable sort. That its reputation was somewhat unsavory as
early as Nashâs time we learn from his _Prognostication_
(_Wks._ 2. 149):

âIf the Beadelles of Bridewell be carefull this Summer, it may
be hoped that Peticote lane may be lesse pestered with ill aires
than it was woont: and the houses there so cleere clensed, that
honest women may dwell there without any dread of the whip and
the carte.â Cf. also _Penniless Parliament, Old Book Collectorâs
Misc._ 2. 16: âMany men shall be so venturously given, as they
shall go into Petticoat Lane, and yet come out again as honestly
as they went first in.â

=1. 1. 60 the Smock-allies.= Petticoat Lane led from the
high street, Whitechapel, to _Smock Alley_ or Gravel Lane.
See Hughson 2. 387.

=1. 1. 61 Shoreditch.= Shoreditch was formerly notorious for the
disreputable character of its women. âTo die in Shoreditchâ seems
to have been a proverbial phrase, and is so used by Dryden in _The
Kind Keeper_, 4to, 1680. Cf. Nash, _Pierce Pennilesse_, _Wks._ 2. 94:
âCall a Leete at _Byshopsgate_, & examine how euery second house in
_Shorditch_ is mayntayned; make a priuie search in _Southwarke_, and
tell mee how many Shee-Inmates you fin de: nay, goe where you will in
the Suburbes, and bring me two Virgins that haue vowd Chastity and
Ile builde a Nunnery.â Also _ibid._, p. 95; Gabriel Harvey, _Prose
Wks._, ed. Grosart. 2. 169; and Dekker, _Wks._ 3. 352.

=1. 1. 61 Whitechappell.= âTill within memory the district north
of the High Street was one of the very worst localities in London;
a region of narrow and filthy streets, yards and alleys, many of
them wholly occupied by thievesâ dens, the receptacles of stolen
property, gin-spinning dog-holes, low brothels, and putrescent
lodging-houses,--a district unwholesome to approach and unsafe for
a decent person to traverse even in the day-time.â--Wh-C.

=1. 1. 61, 2                          and so to Saint Kathernes.=
=To drinke with the Dutch there, and take forth their patternes.=
Saint Kathernes was the name of a hospital and precinct without
London. The hospital was said to have been founded by Queen
Matilda, wife of King Stephen. In _The Alchemist_ (_Wks._ 4.
161), Jonson speaks of its having been used âto keep the better
sort of mad-folks.â It was also employed as a reformatory for
fallen women, and it is here that Winifred in _Eastward Ho_ (ed.
Schelling, p. 84) finds an appropriate landing-place.

From this hospital there was âa continual street, or filthy
strait passage, with alleys of small tenements, or cottages,
built, inhabited by sailorsâ victuallers, along by the river of
Thames, almost to Radcliff, a good mile from the Tower.â--Stow,
ed. Thoms, p. 157.

The precinct was noted for its brew-houses and low drinking
places. In _The Staple of News_ Jonson speaks of âan ale-wife in
Saint Katherineâs, At the Sign of the Dancing Bearsâ (_Wks._ 5.
226). The same tavern is referred to in the _Masque of Augurs_
as well as âthe brew-houses in St. Katherineâs.â The sights of
the place are enumerated in the same masque.

The present passage seems to indicate that the precinct was largely
inhabited by Dutch. In the _Masque of Augurs_ Vangoose speaks a sort
of Dutch jargon, and we know that a Flemish cemetery was located here
(see Wh-C). Cf. also Sir Thomas Overburyâs _Character of A drunken
Dutchman resident in England_, ed. Morley, p. 72: âLet him come over
never so lean, and plant him but one month near the brew-houses of
St. Catherineâs and he will be puffed up to your hand like a bloat
herring.â Dutch weavers had been imported into England as early as
the reign of Edward III. (see Howes, p. 870 a), and in the year 1563
great numbers of Netherlanders with their wives and children fled
into England owing to the civil dissension in Flanders (Howes, p.
868 a). They bore a reputation for hard drinking (cf. _Like will to
Like_, _O. Pl._ 3. 325; Dekker, _Non-dram. Wks._ 3. 12; Nash,
_Wks._ 2. 81, etc.).

The phrase âto take forth their patternesâ is somewhat obscure, and
seems to have been forced by the necessity for a rhyme. Halliwell
says that âtake forthâ is equivalent to âlearn,â and the phrase seems
therefore to mean âtake their measure,â âsize them up,â with a view
to following their example. It is possible, of course, that actual
patterns of the Dutch weavers or tailors are referred to.

=1. 1. 63 Custome-house key.= This was in Tower Street
on the Thames side. Stow (ed. Thoms, pp. 51. 2) says that the
custom-house was built in the sixth year of Richard II. Jonson
mentions the place again in _Every Man in_, _Wks._ 1. 69.

=1. 1. 66 the Dagger, and the Wool-sacke.= These were two
ordinaries or public houses of low repute, especially famous
for their pies. There were two taverns called the âDagger,â one
in Holborn and one in Cheapside. It is probably to the former
of these that Jonson refers. It is mentioned again in the
_Alchemist_ (_Wks._ 4. 24 and 165) and in Dekkerâs _Satiromastix_
(_Wks._ 1. 200). Hotten says that the sign of a dagger was
common, and arose from its being a charge in the city arms.

The Woolsack was without Aldgate. It was originally a
wool-makerâs sign. Machyn mentions the tavern in 1555; and it is
alluded to in Dekker, _Shoemakerâs Holiday_, _Wks._ 1. 61. See
Wh-C. and Hottenâs _History of Signboards_, pp. 325 and 362.

=1. 1. 69 Belins-gate.= Stow (ed. Thoms, p. 78) describes
Belins-gate as âa large water-gate, port or harborough.â He
mentions the tradition that the name was derived from that of
Belin, King of the Britons, but discredits it. Billingsgate is
on the Thames, a little below London Bridge, and is still the
great fish-market of London.

=1. 1. 70 shoot the Bridge.= The waterway under the old
London Bridge was obstructed by the narrowness of the arches,
by cornmills built in some of the openings, and by the great
waterworks at its southern end. âOf the arches left open some
were too narrow for the passage of boats of any kind. The widest
was only 36 feet, and the resistance caused to so large a body
of water on the rise and fall of the tide by this contraction of
its channel produced a fall or rapid under the bridge, so that
it was necessary to âship oarsâ to _shoot the bridge_, as it was
called,--an undertaking, to amateur watermen especially, not
unattended with danger. âWith the flood-tide it was impossible,
and with the ebb-tide dangerous to pass through or _shoot_ the
arches of the bridge.â In the latter case prudent passengers
landed above the bridge, generally at the _Old Swan Stairs_, and
walked to some wharf, generally _Billingsgate_, below it.â--Wh-C.

=1. 1. 70 the Cranes iâ the Vintry.= These were âthree strong cranes of
timber placed on the Vintry wharf by the Thames to crane up wine there
(Stow, ed. Thoms, p. 00). They were situated in Three Cranesâ lane, and
near by was the famous tavern mentioned as one of the authorâs favorite
resorts (_Bart. Fair_ 1. 1, _Wks._ 4. 356). Jonson speaks of it again
in _The Silent Woman_, _Wks._ 3. 376, and in the _Masque of Augurs_.
Pepys visited the place on January 23, 1662, and describes the best
room as âa narrow dogg-holeâ in which he and his friends were crammed
so close âthat it made me loath my company and victuals, and a sorry
dinner it was too.â Cf. also Dekker, (_Non-dram. Wks._ 8. 77).

=1. 1. 72 the Strand.= This famous street was formerly the road between
the cities of Westminster and London. That many lawyers lived in this
vicinity we learn from Middleton (_Father Hubburdâs Tales_, _Wks._ 8.
77).

=1. 1. 73 Westminster-hall.= It was once the hall of the
Kingâs palace at Westminster, originally built by William Rufus.
The present hall was formed 1397-99. Here the early parliaments
were held. âThis great hall hath been the usual place of
pleadings, and ministration of justice.â--Stow, ed. Thoms,
p. 174.

=1. 1. 75 so Veluet to Leather.= Velvet seems to have
been much worn by lawyers. Cf. Overbury, _Characters_, p. 72:
âHe loves his friend as a counsellor at law loves the velvet
breeches he was first made barrister in.â

=1. 1. 85 In his long coat, shaking his wooden dagger.=
See Introduction, pp. xxxviii f.

=1. 1. 93 Cokeley.= Whalley says that he was the master of
a puppet show, and this has been accepted by all authorities
(Gifford, ed.; Nares, _Gloss_.; Alden, ed. of _Bart. Fair_).
He seems, however, to have been rather an improviser like
Vennor, or a mountebank with a gift of riming. He is mentioned
several times by Jonson: _Bart. Fair_, _Wks._ 4. 422, 3: âHe has
not been sent for, and sought out for nothing, at your great
city-suppers, to put down Coriat and Cokely.â _Epigr._129; _To
Mime_, _Wks._ 8. 229:

    Or, mounted on a stool, thy face doth hit
    On some new gesture, thatâs imputed wit?
    --Thou dost out-zany Cokely, Pod; nay Gue:
    And thine own Coryat too.

=1. 1. 94 Vennor.= Gifford first took Vennor to be a juggler, but
corrected his statement in the _Masque of Augurs_, _Wks._ 7. 414.
He says: âFenner, whom I supposed to be a juggler, was a rude kind
of _improvisatore_. He was altogether ignorant; but possessed a
wonderful facility in pouring out doggrel verse. He says of himself,

    Yet, without boasting, let me boldly say
    Iâll rhyme with any man that breathes this day
    Upon a subject, in _extempore_, etc.

He seems to have made a wretched livelihood by frequenting city
feasts, &c., where, at the end of the entertainment, he was called in
to mount a stool and amuse the company by stringing together a
number of vile rhymes upon any given subject. To this the quotation
alludes. Fenner is noticed by the duchess of Newcastle: âFor
the numbers every schoolboy can make them on his fingers, and for
the _rime_, Fenner would put down Ben Jonson, and yet neither boy
nor Fenner so good poets.â This, too, is the person meant in the
Cambridge answer to Corbetâs satire:

    A ballad late was made,
    But God knows who the penner;
    Some say the rhyming sculler,
    And others say âtwas Fenner. p. 24.

Fenner was so famed for his faculty of rhyming, that James, who,
like Bartholomew Cokes, would willingly let no raree-show escape
him, sent for him to court. Upon which Fenner added to his other
titles that of his âMajestyâs Riming Poet.â This gave offense to
Taylor, the Water poet, and helped to produce that miserable
squabble printed among his works, and from which I have principally
derived the substance of this note.â--G.

âIn Richard Bromeâs _Covent Garden Weeded_ (circ. 1638), we
have: âSure âtis Fenner or his ghost. He was a riming souldier.â
(p. 42.)â--C.

The controversy referred to may be found in the Spenser Societyâs
reprint of the 1630 folio of Taylorâs _Works_, 1869, pp. 304-325.
Here may be gathered a few more facts regarding the life of
Fenner (or Fennor as it should be spelled), among them that he
was apprenticed when a boy to a blind harper. In the quarrel, it
must be confessed, Fennor does not appear markedly inferior to his
derider either in powers of versification or in common decency. The
quarrel between the poets took place in October, 1614, and Fennorâs
admittance to court seems to be referred to in the present passage.

=1. 1. 95 a Sheriffes dinner.= This was an occasion of considerable
extravagance. Entick (_Survey_ 1. 499) tells us that in 1543 a
sumptuary law was passed âto prevent luxurious eating or feasting
in a time of scarcity; whereby it was ordained, that the lord-mayor
should not have more than seven dishes at dinner or supper,â and âan
alderman and sheriff no more than six.â

=1. 1. 96 Skip with a rime oâ the Table, from New-nothing.= What is
meant by _New-nothing_ I do not know. From the construction it would
seem to indicate the place from which the fool was accustomed to take
his leap, but it is possible that the word should be connected with
_rime_, and may perhaps be the translation of a Greek or Latin title
for some book of _facetiae_ published about this time. Such wits as
Fennor and Taylor doubtless produced many pamphlets, the titles of
which have not been recorded. In 1622 Taylor brought out a collection
of verse called âSir Gregory Non-sense His Newes from no place,â and
it may have been this very book in manuscript that suggested Jonsonâs
title. In the play of _King Darius_, 1106, one of the actors says:
âI had rather then my new nothing, I were gon.â

=1. 1. 97 his Almaine-leape into a custard.= âIn the earlier days,
when the city kept a fool it was customary for him at public
entertainments, to leap into a large bowl of custard set on
purpose.â--W. Whalley refers also to _Allâs well that Ends Well_
2. 5: âYou have made a shift to run into it, boots and all, like
him that leapt into the custard.â

Gifford quotes Glapthorne, _Wit in a Const._:

    The custard, with the four and twenty nooks
    At my lord Mayorâs feast.

He continues: âIndeed, no common supply was required; for, besides
what the Corporation (great devourers of custard) consumed on the
spot, it appears that it was thought no breach of city manners to
send, or take some of it home with them for the use of their ladies.â
In the excellent old play quoted above, Clara twits her uncle with
this practise:

    Now shall you, sir, as âtis a frequent custom,
    âCause youâre a worthy alderman of a ward,
    Feed me with custard, and perpetual white broth
    Sent from the lord Mayorâs feast.â

Cunningham says: âPoets of a comparatively recent date continue to
associate mayors and custards.â He Quotes Prior _(Alma_, Cant. 1) and
a letter from Bishop Warburton to Hurd (Apr. 1766): âI told him (the
Lord Mayor) in what I thought he was defective--that I was greatly
disappointed to see no custard at table. He said that they had been
so ridiculed for their custard that none had ventured to make its
appearance for some years.â Jonson mentions the âquaking custardsâ
again in _The Fox_, _Wks._ 3. 164., and in _The Staple of News_,
_Wks._ 5. 196, 7.

An Almain-leap was a dancing leap. âAllemands were danced here a few
years backâ (Nares). Cunningham quotes from Dyce: âRabelais tells us
that Gargantua âwrestled, ran, jumped, not at three steps and a leap,
... nor yet at the Almaneâs, for, said Gymnast, these jumps are for the
wars altogether unprofitable and of no use.â _Rabelais_, Book 1, C. 23.â

Bishop Barlow, _Answer to a Catholike Englishman_, p. 231, Lond.
1607, says: âNow heere the Censurer makes an Almaine leape, skipping
3 whole pages togetherâ (quoted in _N. & Q._ 1st Ser. 10. 157).


=1. 1. 97 their hoods.= The French hood was still worn by
citizensâ wives. Thus in the _London Prodigal_, ed. 1709:

    No _Frank_, Iâll have thee go like a _Citizen_
    In a Garded Gown, and a _French_ Hood.

When Simon Eyre is appointed sheriff, his wife immediately inquires
for a âFardingale-makerâ and a âFrench-hood makerâ (Dekker, _Wks._
1. 39). Strutt says that French hoods were out of fashion by the middle
of the 17th century (_Antiq._ 3. 93). See the frequent references to
this article of apparel in _Bart. Fair_. It is interesting to notice
that the hoods are worn at dinner.

=1. 1. 106, 7.= The readings of âWhalley and Gifford are distinctly
inferior to the original.

=1. 1. 112, 3 Car-men Are got into the yellow starch.= Starch was
introduced in the age of Elizabeth to meet the needs of the huge
Spanish ruff which had come into favor some years before (see
_Soc. Eng._, p. 386). It was frequently colored. In Middleton and
Rowleyâs _World Tossed at Tennis_ five different colored starches are
personified. Stubbes says that it was âof all collours and hues.â
Yellow starch must have come into fashion not long before this play
was acted, for in the _Owleâs Allmanacke_, published in 1618, it is
said: âSince yellow bandes and saffroned chaperoones came vp, is not
above two yeeres past.â This, however, is not to be taken literally,
for the execution of Mrs. Turner took place Nov. 14, 1615. Of her
we read in Howellâs Letters 1. 2: âMistress _Turner_, the first
inventress of _yellow Starch_, was executed in a Cobweb Lawn Ruff
of that colour at _Tyburn_; and with her I believe that _yellow
Starch_, which so much disfigured our Nation, and rendered them so
ridiculous and fantastic, will receive its Funeral.â Sir S. DâEwes
_(Autobiog._ 1. 69) says that from that day it did, indeed, grow
âgenerally to be detested and disused.â _The Vision of Sir Thomas
Overbury_, 1616 (quoted in Amos, _Great Oyer_, p. 50) speaks of

              ----that fantastic, ugly fall and ruff
    Daubâd oâer with that base starch of yellow stuff

as already out of fashion. Its popularity must have returned,
however, since Barnaby Riche in the _Irish Hubbub_,1622, p.
40, laments that âyellow starcht bandsâ were more popular than
ever, and he prophesies that the fashion âshortly will be as
conversant amongst taylors, tapsters, and tinkers, as now they
have brought tobacco.â

DâEwes also in describing the procession of King James from Whitehall
to Westminster, Jan. 30, 1620, says that the king saw one window
âfull of gentlewomen or ladies, all in yellow bandes,â whereupon he
called out âA pox take yee,â and they all withdrew in shame. In _The
Parsonâs Wedding_, printed 1664, _O. Pl._ 11. 498, it is spoken of as
out of fashion. Yellow starch is mentioned again in 5. 8. 74. 5, and
a ballad of âgoose-green starch and the devilâ is mentioned in _Bart.
Fair_, _Wks._ 4. 393. Similarly, Nash speaks in _Pierce Pennilesse_,
_Wks._ 2. 44. of a âBallet of Blue starch and poaking stick.â
See also Dodsleyâs note on _Albumazar_, _O. Pl._ 7. 132.

=1. 1. 113, 4 Chimney-sweepers To their tabacco.= See the quotation
from Riche in the last note and note 5. 8. 71.

=1. 1. 114, 5 Hum, Meath, and Obarni.= Hum is defined B. E. _Dict.
Cant. Crew, Hum_ or _Humming Liquor_, Double Ale, Stout, Pharoah.
It is mentioned in Fletcherâs _Wild Goose Chase_ 2. 3 and Heywoodâs
_Drunkard_. p. 48. Meath or mead is still made in England. It was
a favorite drink in the Middle Ages, and consisted of a mixture
of honey and water with the addition of a ferment. Harrison,
_Description of England_, ed. Furnivall, 1. 161, thus describes it:
âThere is a kind of swish swash made also in Essex, and diuerse other
places, with honicombs and water, which the [homelie] countrie wiues,
putting some pepper and a little other spice among, call mead, verie
good in mine opinion for such as loue to be loose bodied [at large,
or a little eased of the cough,] otherwise it differeth so much from
the true metheglin, as chalke from cheese.â

Obarni was long a crux for the editors and dictionaries. Gifford
(_Wks._ 7. 226) supplied a part of the quotation from _Pimlyco or
Runne Red-Cap_, 1609, completed by James Platt, Jun. (_N. & Q._
9th Ser. 3. 306). in which âMead Obarne and Mead Cherunkâ are
mentioned as drinks

          ----that whet the spites
    Of Russes and cold Muscovites.

Mr. Platt first instanced the existing Russian word _obarni_ or
_obvarnyi_ (see Gloss.), meaning âboiling, scalding,â and C. C. B.
(_N. & Q._ 9. 3. 413) supplied a quotation from the account of the
voyage of Sir Jerome Bowes in 1583 (Harrisâs _Travels_ 1. 535), in
which âSodden Meadâ appears among the items of diet supplied by the
Emperor to the English Ambassador. The identification was completed
with a quotation given by the _Stanford Dict._: â1598 Hakluyt _Voy._
1. 461 One veather of sodden mead called _Obarni_.â

=1. 1. 119 your rope of sand.= This occupation is mentioned
again in 5. 2. 6.

=1. 1. 126 Tissue gownes.= Howes, p. 869. tells us that John Tuce,
âdweling neere Shorditch Churchâ, first attained perfection in the
manufacture of cloth of tissue.

=1. 1. 127 Garters and roses.= Howes, p. 1039, says that âat this
day (1631) men of meane rancke weare Garters, and shooe Roses, of
more than fiue pound price.â Massinger, in the _City Madam_, _Wks._,
p. 334, speaks of âroses worth a family.â Cf. also John Taylorâs
_Works_, 1630 (quoted in _Hist. Brit. Cost_.):

    Weare a farm in shoe-strings edged with gold
    And spangled garters worth a copyhold.

=1. 1. 128 Embroydred stockings.= âThen haue they nether-stocks to
these gay hosen, not of cloth (though neuer so fine) for that is
thought to base, but of _Iarnsey_ worsted, silk, thred, and such
like, or els at the least of the finest yarn _that_ can be, and so
curiouslye knit with open seam down the leg, with quirks and clocks
about the ancles, and sometime (haply) interlaced with gold or siluer
threds, as is wonderful to behold.â--Stubbes, _Anat._, Part 1, p. 57.
The selling of stockings was a separate trade at this time, and great
attention was paid to this article of clothing. Silk stockings are
frequently mentioned by the dramatists. Cf. Stephen Gosson, _Pleasant
Quippes_:

    These worsted stockes of bravest die, and silken garters
                                     fringâd with gold;
    These corked shooes to beare them hie makes them to trip
                                     it on the molde;
    They mince it with a pace so strange,
    Like untamâd heifers when they range.

=1. 1. 128 cut-worke smocks, and shirts.= Cf. B. & Fl.,
_Four Plays in One_:

              ----She showâd me gownes, head tires,
    Embroiderâd waistcoats, smocks seamed with cutworks.

=1. 1. 135 But you must take a body ready made.= King James in his
_DÃ¦monologie_ (_Wks._, ed. 1616, p. 120) explains that the devil,
though but of air, can âmake himself palpable, either by assuming any
dead bodie, and vsing the ministerie thereof, or else by deluding as
well their sence of feeling as seeing.â

=1. 1. 143 our tribe of Brokers.= Cf. _Ev. Man in_, _Wks._ 1. 82:

    â_Wel._ Where gotâst thou this coat, I marle?
    _Brai._ Of a Hounsditch man, sir, one of the devilâs
    near kinsmen, a broker.â

The pawnbrokers were cordially hated in Jonsonâs time. Their
quarter was Houndsditch. Stow says: âthere are crept in among
them [the inhabitants of Houndsditch] a base kinde of vermine,
wel-deserving to bee ranked and numbred with them, whom our old
Prophet and Countryman, _Gyldas_, called _Ãtatis atramentum_,
the black discredit of the Age, and of place where they are suffered
to live.... These men, or rather monsters in the shape of men,
professe to live by lending, and yet will lend nothing but upon
pawnes;â etc.

Nash speaks of them in a similar strain: âFruits shall be greatly eaten
with Catterpillers; as Brokers, Farmers and Flatterers, which feeding
on the sweate of other mens browes, shall greatlye hinder the beautye
of the spring.â--_Prognostication_, _Wks._2. 145. âThey shall crie out
against brokers, as Jeremy did against false prophets.â _Ibid._ 2. 162.

=1. 1. 148 as you make your soone at nights relation.= Cf.
Dekker, _Satiromastix_, _Wks._ 1. 187: âSheeâl be a late
sturrer soone at night sir,â and _ibid._ 223:

    By this faire Bride remember soone at night.

=1. 2. 1 ff. I, they doe, now=, etc. âCompare this
exquisite piece of sense, satire, and sound philosophy in 1616
with Sir M. Haleâs speech from the bench in a trial of a witch
many years afterwards.â--Coleridge, _Notes_, p. 280.

=1. 2. 1 Bretnor.= An almanac maker (fl. 1607-1618). A list
of his works, compiled from the catalogue of the British Museum,
is given in the _DNB_. He is mentioned twice by Middleton:

    This farmer will not cast his seed iâ the ground
    Before he look in Bretnor.
                             --_Inner-Temple Masque_, _Wks._ 7. 211.

â_Chough._ Iâll not be married to-day, Trimtram: hast eâer an almanac
about thee? this is the nineteenth of August, look what day of the
month âtis.

    _Trim._ âTis tenty-nine indeed, sir. [_Looks in almanac._
    _Chough._ Whatâs the word? What says Bretnor?
    _Trim._ The word is, sir, _Thereâs a hole in her coat_.â
                         --Middleton, _A Fair Quarrel_, _Wks._ 4. 263.

Fleay identifies him with Norbret, one of the astrologers in
Beaumont and Fletcherâs _Rollo, Duke of Normandy_.

=1. 2. 2 Gresham.= A pretended astrologer, contemporary with Forman,
and said to be one of the associates of the infamous Countess of
Essex and Mrs. Turner in the murder of Sir Thomas Overbury. Arthur
Wilson mentions him in _The Life of James I._, p. 70:

âMrs. _Turner_, the Mistris of the _Work_, had lost both her
supporters. _Forman_, her first prop, dropât away suddenly by death;
and _Gresham_ another rotten _Engin_ (that succeded him) did not hold
long: She must now bear up all her self.â

He is mentioned twice in Sparkâs _Narrative History of King James_,
Somerâs _Tracts_ 2. 275: âDr. Forman being dead, Mrs. Turner wanted
one to assist her; whereupon, at the countesses coming to London, one
Gresham was nominated to be entertained in this businesse, and, in
processe of time, was wholly interested in it; this man was had in
suspition to have had a hand in the Gunpowder plot, he wrote so near
it in his almanack; but, without all question, he was a very skilful
man in the mathematicks, and, in his latter time, in witchcraft, as
was suspected, and therefore the fitter to bee imployed in those
practises, which, as they were devilish, so the devil had a hand
in them.â

_Ibid._ 287: âNow Gresham growing into years, having spent much time
in many foule practises to accomplish those things at this time,
gathers all his babies together, _viz._ pictures in lead, in wax, in
plates of gold, of naked men and women with crosses, crucifixes, and
other implements, wrapping them all up together in a scarfe, crossed
every letter in the sacred word Trinity, crossed these things very
holily delivered into the hands of one Weston to bee hid in the earth
that no man might find them, and so in Thames-street having finished
his evill times he died, leaving behind him a man and a maid, one
hanged for a witch, and the other for a thief very shortly after.â

In the âHeads of Charges against Robert, Earl of Somersetâ,
drawn up by Lord Bacon, we read: âThat the countess laboured
Forman and Gresham to inforce the Queen by witchcraft to favour
the countessâ (Howellâs _State Trials_ 2. 966). To this King
James replied in an âApostyle,â _Nothing to Somerset_. This
exhausts the references to Gresham that I have been able to
find. See note on Savory, 1. 2. 3.

=1. 2. 2. Fore-man.= Simon Foreman, or Forman (1552-1611)
was the most famous of the group of quacks here mentioned. He
studied at Oxford, 1573-1578, and in 1579 began his career as
a necromancer. He claimed the power to discover lost treasure,
and was especially successful in his dealings with women. A
detailed account of his life is given in the _DNB_. and a short
but interesting sketch in _Social England_ 4. 87. The chief
sources are Wm. Lillyâs _History_ and a diary from 1564 to 1602,
with an account of Formanâs early life, published by Mr. J. O.
Halliwell-Phillipps for the Camden Soc., 1843.

He is mentioned again by Jonson in _Silent Woman_, _Wks._ 3.
413: â_Daup._ I would say, thou hadst the best philtre in the
world, and couldst do more than Madam Medea, or Doctor Foreman.â
In _Sir Thomas Overburyâs Vision_ (Harl. Ms., vol. 7, quoted in
DâEwesâ _Autobiog._, p. 89) he is spoken of as âthat fiend in
human shape.â

=1. 2. 3 Francklin.= Francklin was an apothecary, and
procured the poison for Mrs. Turner (see Amos, _Great Oyer_. p.
97). He was one of the three persons executed with Mrs. Turner.
Arthur Wilson, in his _Life of James I._ (p. 70), describes him
as âa swarthy, sallow, crooked-backt fellow, who was to be the
_Fountain_ whence these bitter waters came.â See also Somerâs
_Tracts_ 2. 287. The poem already quoted furnishes a description
of Francklin:

    A man he was of stature meanly tall.
    His bodyâs lineaments were shaped, and all
    His limbs compacted well, and strongly knit.
    Natureâs kind hand no error made in it.
    His beard was ruddy hue, and from his head
    A wanton lock itself did down dispread
    Upon his back; to which while he did live
    Thâ ambiguous name of _Elf-lock_ he did give.
                                          --Quoted in Amos. p. 50.

=1. 2. 3 Fiske.= âIn this year 1633, I became acquainted with
Nicholas Fiske, licentiate in physick, who was borne in Suffolk, near
Framingham [Framlingham] Castle, of very good parentage.... He was a
person very studious, laborious, and of good apprehension.... He was
exquisitely skilful in the art of directions upon nativities, and had
a good genius in performing judgment thereupon.... He died about the
seventy-eighth year of his age, poor.â--Lilly, _Hist._, p. 42 f.

Fiske appears as La Fiske in _Rollo, Duke of Normandy_, and is also
mentioned by Butler, _Hudibr_., Part 2, Cant. 3. 403:

    And nigh an ancient obelisk
    Was raisâd by him, found out by _Fisk_.

=1. 2. 3 Sauory.= âAnd therefore, she fearing that her
lord would seek some public or private revenge against her, by
the advice of the before-mentioned Mrs. Turner, consulted and
practised with Doctor Forman and Doctor Savory, two conjurers,
about the poisoning of him.â--DâEwes, _Autobiog._ 1. 88. 9.

He was employed after the sudden death of Dr. Forman. Wright
(_Sorcery and Magic_, p. 228) says that the name is written
Lavoire in some manuscripts. âMrs. Turner also confessed, that
Dr. Savories was used in succession, after Forman, and practised
many sorceries upon the Earle of Essex his person.â--Spark,
_Narrative History_, Somerâs _Tracts_ 2. 333.

In the _Calendar of State Papers_ the name of âSaveryâ appears
four times. Under date of Oct. 16, 1615, we find Dr. Savery
examined on a charge of âspreading Popish Books.â âSavery
pretends to be a doctor, but is probably a conjurer.â And again
under the same date he is interrogated as to his relations with
Mrs. Turner and Forman. Under Oct. 24 he replies to Coke. âOct.
?â we find Dr. Savery questioned as to his âpredictions of
troubles and alterations in Court.â This is the last mention
of him.

Just what connection Gresham and Savory had with the Overbury
plot is a difficult matter to determine. Both are spoken of as
following Forman immediately, and of neither is any successor
mentioned except the actual poisoner, Franklin. It seems
probable that Gresham was the first to be employed after Forman,
and that his own speedy death led to the selection of Savory.
How the latter managed to escape a more serious implication in
the trial it is difficult to conceive.

=1. 2. 6-9 christalls, ... characters.= As in other fields,
Jonson is well versed in magic lore. Lumps of crystal were one
of the regular means of raising a demon. Bk. 15, Ch. 16 of
Scotâs _Discovery of Witchcraft_, 1584, is entitled: âTo make a
spirit appear in a christallâ, and Ch. 12 shows âHow to enclose
a spirit in a christall stone.â

Lilly (_History_, p. 78) speaks of the efficacy of âa
constellated ringâ in sickness, and they were doubtless
considered effective in more sinister dealings. Jonson has
already spoken of the devil being carried in a thumb-ring
(see note P. 6).

Charms were usually written on parchment. In Barrettâs _Magus_,
Bk. 2, Pt. 3. 109, we read that the pentacle should be drawn
âupon parchment made of a kid-skin, or virgin, or pure clean
white paper.â

That parts of the human body belonged to the sorcererâs
paraphernalia is shown by the Statute 1 Jac. I. c. xii, which
contains a clause forbidding conjurors to âtake up any dead
man woman or child out of his her or their grave ... or the
skin bone or any other parte of any dead person, to be imployed
or used in any manner of Witchcrafte Sorcerie Charme or
Inchantment.â

The wing of the raven, as a bird of ill omen, may be an
invention of Jonsonâs own. The lighting of candles within the
magic circle is mentioned below (note 1. 2. 26).

Most powerful of all was the pentacle, of which Scotâs
_Discovery_ (Ap. II, p. 533, 4) furnishes an elaborate
description. This figure was used by the Pythagorean school as
their seal, and is equivalent to the pentagram or five-pointed
star (see _CD._).

Dekker (_Wks._ 2. 200) connects it with the Periapt as a âpotent
charm,â and Marlowe speaks of it in _Hero and Leander_,
_Wks._ 3. 45:

    A rich disparent pentacle she wears,
    Drawn full of circles and strange characters.

It will be remembered that the inscription of a pentagram on the
threshold prevents the escape of Mephistopheles in Goetheâs _Faust_.
The editors explain its potency as due to the fact that it is
resolvable into three triangles, and is thus a triple sign of the
Trinity.

Cunningham says that the pentacle âwhen delineated upon the body of a
man was supposed to point out the five wounds of the Saviour.â W. J.
Thoms (_Anecdotes_, Camden Soc., 1839, p. 97) speaks of its presence
in the western window of the southern aisle of Westminster Abbey, an
indication that the monks were versed in occult science.

=1. 2. 21 If they be not.= Gifford refers to Chrysippus, _De
Divinatione,_ Lib. 1. Â§ 71: âThis is the very syllogism by which that
acute philosopher triumphantly proved the reality of augury.â

=1. 2. 22 Why, are there lawes against âhem?= It was
found necessary in 1541 to pass an act (33 Hen. VIII. c. 8) by
which--âit shall be felony to practise, or cause to be practised
conjuration, witchcrafte, enchantment, or sorcery, to get
money: or to consume any person in his body, members or goods;
or to provoke any person to unlawful love; or for the despight
of Christ, or lucre of money, to pull down any cross; or to
declare where goods stolen be.â Another law was passed 1 Edward
VI. c. 12 (1547). 5 Elizabeth. c. 16 (1562) gives the âseveral
penalties of conjuration, or invocation of wicked spirits, and
witchcraft, enchantment, charm or sorcery.â Under Jas. I, anno
secundo (vulgo primo), c. 12, still another law was passed,
whereby the second offense was declared a felony. The former act
of Elizabeth was repealed. This act of James was not repealed
until 9 George II. c. 5.

_Social England_, p. 270, quotes from Ms. Lansdowne, 2. Art.
26, a deposition from William Wicherley, conjurer, in which he
places the number of conjurers in England in 1549 above five
hundred. A good idea of the character of the more disreputable
type of conjurer can be got from Beaumont and Fletcherâs
_Fair Maid of the Inn_. See especially Act 5, Sc. 2.

=1. 2. 26 circles.= The magic circle is one of the things
most frequently mentioned among the arts of the conjurer. Scot
(_Discovery_, p. 476) has a long satirical passage on the
subject, in which he enjoins the conjurer to draw a double
circle with his own blood, to divide the circle into seven
parts and to set at each division a âcandle lighted in a
brazen candlestick.â

=1. 2. 27 his hard names.= A long list of the âdiverse
names of the divellâ is given in _The Discovery_, p. 436,
and another in the Second Appendix, p. 522.

=1. 2. 31, 2 I long for thee. Anâ I were with child by him, ...
I could not more.= The expression is common enough. Cf.
_Eastward Hoe_: âGer. As I am a lady, I think I am with child
already, I long for a coach so.â Dekker, _Shomakers Holiday_,
_Wks._ 1. 17: âI am with child till I behold this huffecap.â The
humors of the longing wife are a constant subject of ridicule.
See _Bart. Fair_, Act 1, and Butlerâs _Hudibras_, ed. 1819,
3. 78 and note.

=1. 2. 39 A thousand miles.= âNeither are they so much
limited as Tradition would have them; for they are not at all
shut up in any separated place: but can remove millions of miles
in the twinkling of an eye.â--Scot, _Discovery_, Ap. II, p. 493.

=1. 2. 43 The burnât child dreads the fire.= Jonson is fond of
proverbial expressions. Cf. 1. 6. 125; 1. 6. 145; 5. 8. 142, 3, etc.

=1. 3. 5 while things be reconcilâd.= In Elizabethan
English both _while_ and _whiles_ often meant âup to the time
whenâ, as well as âduring the time whenâ (d. a similar use of
âdumâ in Latin and of á¼ Î¿Ï in Greek).--Abbot, Â§137.

For its frequent use in this sense in Shakespeare see Schmidt
and note on _Macbeth_ 3. 1. 51, Furnessâs edition. Cf. also
Nash, _Prognostication_, _Wks._ 2. 150: âThey shall ly in their
beds while noon.â

=1. 3. 8, 9 those roses Were bigge inough to hide a clouen
foote.= Dyce (_Remarks_, p. 289) quotes Webster, _White
Devil_, 1612:

                        --why, âtis the devil;
    I know him by a great rose he wears onâs shoe,
    To hide his cloven foot.

Cunningham adds a passage from Chapman, _Wks._ 3. 145:

      _Fro._ Yet you cannot change the old fashion (they say)
    And hide your cloven feet.
      _Oph._ No! I can wear roses that shall spread quite
    Over them.

Gifford quotes Nash, _Unfortunate Traveller_, _Wks._ 5. 146: âHee
hath in eyther shoo as much taffaty for his tyings, as would serue
for an ancient.â Cf. also Dekker, _Roaring Girle_, _Wks._ 3. 200:
âHaue not many handsome legges in silke stockins villanous splay feet
for all their great roses?â

=1. 3. 13 My Cater.= Whalley changes to âmâacterâ on the authority
of the _Sad Shep._ (vol. 4. 236):

            --Go bear âem in to Much
    Thâ acater.

The form âcaterâ, however, is common enough. Indeed, if we are
to judge from the examples in Nares and _NED._, it is much the
more frequent, although the present passage is cited in both
authorities under the longer form.

=1. 3. 21 Iâle hearken.= W. and G. change to âIâd.â The
change is unnecessary if we consider the conditional clause
as an after-thought on the part of Fitzdottrel. For a similar
construction see 3. 6. 34-6.

=1. 3. 27 Vnder your fauour, friend, for, Iâll not
quarrell.= âThis was one of the qualifying expressions, by
which, âaccording to the laws of the duelloâ, the lie might be
given, without subjecting the speaker to the absolute necessity
of receiving a challenge.â--G.

Leigh uses a similar expression. Cf. note 2. 1. 144. It occurs
several times in _Ev. Man in_:

    â_Step._ Yet, by his leave, he is a rascal, under his favour,
    do you see.
    _E. Know._ Ay, by his leave, he is, and under favour:
    a pretty piece of civility!â
                                            --_Wks._ 1. 68.

    â_Down._ âSdeath! you will not draw then?
    _Bob._ Hold, hold! under thy favour forbear!â
                                            --_Wks._ 1. 117.

    â_Clem._ Now, sir, what have you to say to me?
    _Bob._ By your worshipâs favour----.â
                                            --_Wks._ 1. 140.

I have not been able to confirm Giffordâs assertion.

=1. 3. 30 thatâs a popular error.= Gifford refers to _Othello_
5. 2. 286:

    _Oth._ I look down towards his feet,--but thatâs a fable.--
         If that thou beâst a devil, I cannot kill thee.

Cf. also _The Virgin Martyr_, Dekkerâs _Wks._ 4. 57:

    --Ile tell you what now of the Divel;
    Heâs no such horrid creature, cloven footed,
    Black, saucer-eyâd, his nostrils breathing fire,
    As these lying Christians make him.

=1. 3. 34 Of Derby-shire, S^r. about the Peake.= Jonson seems to have
been well acquainted with the wonders of the Peak of Derbyshire. Two of
his masques, _The Gipsies Metamorphosed_, acted first at Burleigh on
the Hill, and later at Belvoir, Nottinghamshire, and _Loveâs Welcome
at Welbeck_, acted in 1633 at Welbeck, Nottinghamshire, the seat of
William Cavendish, Earl of Newcastle, are full of allusions to them.
The Devilâs Arse seems to be the cavern now known to travellers as the
_Peak_ or _Devilâs Cavern_. It is described by Baedeker as upwards of
2,000 feet in extent. One of its features is a subterranean river known
as the Styx. The origin of the cavernâs name is given in a coarse song
in the _Gypsies Met._ (_Wks._ 7. 357), beginning:

    Cocklorrel would needs have the Devil his guest,
    And bade him into the Peak to dinner.

In _Loveâs Welcome_ Jonson speaks again of âSatanâs sumptuous Arseâ,
_Wks._ 8. 122.

=1. 3. 34, 5.        That Hole.
    Belonged to your Ancestors?= Jonson frequently omits the relative
pronoun. Cf. 1. 5. 21; 1. 6. 86, 87; 3. 3. 149; 5. 8. 86, 87.

=1. 3. 38 Foure pound a yeere.= âThis we may suppose to have
been the customary wages of a domestic servant.â--C. Cunningham
cites also the passage in the _Alchemist_, _Wks._ 4. 12;
âYou were once ... the good, Honest, plain, livery-three-pound-thrum,
that kept Your masterâs worshipâs house,â in which he takes the
expression âthree-poundâ to be the equivalent of âbadly-paidâ.

=1. 4. 1 Iâll goe lift him.= Jonson is never tired of punning on
the names of his characters.

=1. 4. 5 halfe a piece.= âIt may be necessary to observe,
once for all, that the _piece_ (the double sovereign) went for
two and twenty shillings.â--G. Compare 3. 3. 83, where a
hundred pieces is evidently somewhat above a hundred pounds.
By a proclamation, Nov. 23, 1611, the piece of gold called the
Unitie, formerly current at twenty shillings was raised to the
value of twenty two shillings (S. M. Leake, _Eng. Money_ 2.
276). Taylor, the water-poet, tells us that Jonson gave him âa
piece of gold of two and twenty shillings to drink his health
in Englandâ (_Conversations_, quoted in Schellingâs _Timber_,
p. 105). In the _Busie Body_ Mrs. Centlivre uses _piece_ as
synonymous with _guinea_ (2d ed., pp. 7 and 14).

=1. 4. 31 Iust what it list.= Jonson makes frequent use of the
subjunctive. Cf. 1. 3. 9; 1. 6. 6; 5. 6. 10; etc.

=1. 4. 43 Ã hereâs the bill, S^r.= Collier says that the
use of play-bills was common prior to the year 1563 (Strype,
_Life of Grindall,_ ed. 1821, p. 122). They are mentioned in
_Histriomastix_, 1610; _A Warning for Fair Women_, 1599, etc.
See Collier, _Annals_ 3. 382 f.

=1. 4. 50 a rotten Crane.= Whalley restores the right
reading, correctly explained as a pun on Ingineâs name.

=1. 4. 60 Good time!= Apparently a translation of the Fr.
_A la bonne heure_, âvery goodâ, âwell done!â etc.

=1. 4. 65 The good mans gravity.= Cf. Homer, _Il._, Î 105:

          á¼Î¾ÎµÏÎµ Î´á½² Î ÏÎ¹Î¬Î¼Î¿Î¹Î¿ ÎÎ¯Î·Î½.

Shak., _Tempest_ 5. 1: âFirst, noble friend, let me embrace
thine age.â _Catiline_ 3. 2.: âTrouble this good shame (good and
modest lady) no farther.â

=1. 4. 70 into the shirt.= Cf. Dekker, _Non-dram. Wks._ 2.
244: âDice your selfe into your shirt.â

=1. 4. 71 Keepe warme your wisdome?= Cf. _Cyn. Rev._,
_Wks._ 2. 241: â_Madam, your whole self cannot but be perfectly
wise; for your hands have wit enough to keep themselves warm._â
Giffordâs note on this passage is: âThis proverbial phrase is
found in most (sic) of our ancient dramas. Thus in _The Wise
Woman of Hogsden_: âYou are the wise woman, are you? You _have
wit to keep yourself warm enough_, I warrant youââ. Cf. also
_Lusty Juventus_, p. 74: âCover your head; For indeed you have
need to keep in your wit.â

=1. 4. 72 You lade me.= âThis is equivalent to the modern
phrase, you do not spare me. You lay what imputations you please
upon me.â--G.

The phrase occurs again in 1. 6. 161, where Wittipol calls
Fitzdottrel an ass, and says that he cannot âscape his ladingâ.
âYou lade meâ, then, seems to mean âYou make an ass of meâ.
The same use of the word occurs in Dekker, _Olde Fortunatus_,
_Wks._ 1. 125: âI should serue this bearing asse rarely now, if
I should load himâ. And again in the works of Taylor, the Water Poet,
p. 311: âMy Lines shall load an Asse, or whippe an Ape.â Cf.
also _Bart. Fair_, _Wks._ 4. 421: âYes, faith, I have my
lading, you see, or shall have anon; you may know whose beast I am
by my burden.â

=1. 4. 83, 4      But, not beyond=,
=A minute, or a second, looke for=. The omission of the comma after
_beyond_ by all the later editors destroys the sense. Fitzdottrel
does not mean that Wittipol cannot have âbeyond a minuteâ, but that
he cannot have a minute beyond the quarter of an hour allowed him.

=1. 4. 96 Migniard.= âCotgrave has in his dictionary,
â_Mignard_--migniard, prettie, quaint, neat, feat, wanton, dainty,
delicate.â In the _Staple of News_ [_Wks._ 5. 221] Jonson tries
to introduce the substantive _migniardise_, but happily without
success.â--G.

=1. 4. 101 Prince Quintilian.= The reputation of this famous
rhetorician (c 35-c 97 A. D.) is based on his great work entitled
_De Instiutione Oratoria Libri_ XII. The first English edition seems
to have been made in 1641, but many Continental editions had preceded
it. The title Prince seems to be gratuitous on Jonsonâs part. He is
mentioned again in _Timber_ (ed. Schelling, 57. 29 and 81. 4).

=1. 5. 2= Cf. _New Inn_, _Wks._ 5. 323:
    â_Host._ What say you, sir? where are you, are you within?
    (_Strikes_ LOVEL _on the breast_.)â

=1. 5. 8, 9. Old Africk, and the new America,
             With all their fruite of Monsters.= Cf. Donne,
_Sat._, _Wks._ 2. 190 (ed. 1896):

    Stranger ...
    Than Africâs monsters, Guianaâs rarities.

Brome, _Queenâs Exchange_, _Wks._ 3. 483: âWhat monsters are bred
in _Affrica_?â Glapthorne, _Hollander_, _Wks._, 1874, 1. 81: âIf
_Africke_ did produce no other monsters,â etc. The people of London
at this time had a great thirst for monsters. See Alden, _Bart.
Fair_, p. 185, and Morley, _Memoirs of Bartholomew Fair_.

=1. 5. 17 for hidden treasure.= âAnd when he is appeared, bind him
with the bond of the dead above written: then saie as followeth.
I charge thee N. by the father, to shew me true visions in this
christall stone, if there be anie treasure hidden in such a place N.
& wherein it now lieth, and how manie foot from this peece of earth,
east, west, north, or south.â--Scot, _Discovery_, p. 355.

Most of the conjurers pretended to be able to recover stolen
treasure. The laws against conjurers (see note 1. 2. 6) contained
clauses forbidding the practice.

=1. 5. 21 his men of Art.= A euphemism for conjurer.
Cf. B. & Fl., _Fair Maid of the Inn_ 2. 2:

â_Host._ Thy master, that lodges here in my Osteria,
is a rare man of art; they say heâs a witch.

_Clown._ A witch? Nay, heâs one step of the ladder to
preferment higher; heâs a conjurer.â

=1. 6. 10 wedlocke.= Wife; a common latinism of the period.

=1. 6. 14 it not concernes thee?= A not infrequent word-order in
Jonson. Cf. 4. 2. 22.

=1. 6. 18 a Niaise.= Gifford says that the side note âcould scarcely
come from Jonson; for it explains nothing. A niaise (or rather
an _eyas_, of which it is a corruption) is unquestionably a young hawk,
but the niaise of the poet is the French term for, âa simple, witless,
inexperienced gullâ, &c. The word is very common in our old
writers.â

The last statement is characteristic of Gifford. It would have been
well in this case if he had given some proof of his assertion. The
derivation _an eyas_ âº _a nyas_ is probably incorrect. The _Centary
Dictionary_ gives â_Niaise_, _nyas_ (and corruptly _eyas_, by
misdivision of _a nias_).â The best explanation I can give of the side
note is this. The glossator takes the meaning âsimpletonâ for granted.
But Fitzdottrel has just said âLaught at, sweet bird?â In explanation
the side note is added. This, perhaps, does not help matters much and,
indeed, I am inclined to believe with Gifford that the side notes are
by another hand than Jonsonâs. See Introduction, pp. xiii, xvii.

=1. 6. 29, 30.                  When I haâ seene
       All London inât, and London has seene mee.=
Gifford compares Pope:

    Europe he saw, and Europe saw him too.

=1. 6. 31 Black-fryers Play-house.= This famous theatre was founded
by James Burbage in 1596-7. The Burbages leased it to Henry Evans
for the performances of the Children of the Chapel, and the Kingâs
Servants acted there after the departure of the children. In 1619
the Lord Mayor and the Council of London ordered its discontinuance,
but the players were able to keep it open on the plea that it was a
private house. In 1642 âpublic stage playsâ were suppressed, and on
Aug. 5, 1655, Blackfriars Theatre was pulled down and tenements were
built in its place. See Wh-C.

Nares, referring to Shirleyâs _Six New Playes_, 1653, says that
âthe Theatre of Black-Friars was, in Charles I.âs time at least
considered, as being of a higher order and more respectability
than any of those on the Bank-side.â

=1. 6. 33 Rise vp between the Acts.= See note 3. 5. 43.

=1. 6. 33, 4          let fall my cloake,
Publish a handsome man, and a rich suite.= The gallants of this
age were inordinately fond of displaying their dress, or âpublishing
their suits.â The play-house and âPaulâs Walk,â the nave of St.
Paulâs Cathedral, were favorite places for accomplishing this. The
fourth chapter of Dekkerâs _Guls Horne-booke_ is entitled âHow a
Gallant should behaue himselfe in Powles walkes.â He bids the gallant
make his way directly into the middle aisle, âwhere, in view of all,
you may publish your suit in what manner you affect most, either with
the slide of your cloake from the one shoulder, and then you must
(as twere in anger) suddenly snatch at the middle of the inside (if
it be taffata at the least) and so by that meanes your costly lining
is betrayd,â etc. A little later on (_Non-dram. Wks._ 2. 238) Dekker
speaks of âPowles, a Tennis-court, or a Playhouseâ as a suitable
place to âpublish your clothes.â Cf. also _Non-dram. Wks._ 4. 51.

Sir Thomas Overbury gives the following description of âa
Phantastique:â âHe withers his clothes on a stage as a salesman is
forced to do his suits in Birchin Lane; and when the play is done, if
you mark his rising, âtis with a kind of walking epilogue between the
two candles, to know if his suit may pass for current.â Morley, p. 73.

Stephen Gosson (_School of Abuse_, p. 29) says that âoverlashing
in apparel is so common a fault, that the verye hyerlings of
some of our plaiers, which stand at reversion of vi^s by
the weeke, jet under gentlemens noses in sutes of silke.â

=1. 6. 37, 8         For, they doe come
To see vs, Loue, as wee doe to see them.= Cf. _Induction_ to _The
Staple of News_, _Wks._ 5. 151: âYes, on the stage; we are persons
of quality, I assure you, and women of fashion, and come to see
and to be seen.â _Silent Woman_, _Wks._ 3. 409: âand come abroad
where the matter is frequent, to court, ... to plays, ...
thither they come to shew their new tires too, to see, and to
be seen.â Massinger, _City Madam_, _Wks._, p. 323:

      _Sir. Maur._ Is there aught else
    To be demanded?
      _Anne._ ... a fresh habit,
    Of a fashion never seen before, to draw,
    The gallantsâ eyes, that sit upon the stage, upon me.

Gosson has much to say on the subject of women frequenting the
theatre. There, he says (p. 25). âeverye man and his queane are first
acquainted;â and he earnestly recommends all women to stay away from
these âplaces of suspitionâ (pp. 48 f.).

=1. 6. 40 Yes, wusse.= _Wusse_ is a corruption of _wis_, OE. _gewis_,
certainly. Jonson uses the forms _I wuss_ (_Wks._ 1. 102), _I wusse_
(_Wks._ 6. 146), and _Iwisse_ (_Wks._ 2. 379. the fol. reading;
Gifford changing to _I wiss_), in addition to the present form. In
some cases the word is evidently looked upon as a verb.

=1. 6. 58 sweet Pinnace.= Cf. 2. 2. 111 f. A woman is often compared
to a ship. Nares cites B. & Fl., _Womanâs Pr._ 2. 6:

    This pinck, this painted foist, this cockle-boat.

Cf. also _Stap. of News_, _Wks._ 5. 210:

    She is not riggâd, sir; setting forth some lady
    Will cost as much as furnishing a fleet.--
    Here she is come at last, and like a galley
    Gilt in the prow.

Jonson plays on the names of Pinnacia in the _New Inn_, _Wks._ 5. 384:

    â_Host._ Pillage the Pinnace....
    _Lord B._ Blow off her upper deck.
    _Lord L._ Tear all her tackle.â

Pinnace, when thus applied to a woman, was almost always used with a
conscious retention of the metaphor. Dekker is especially fond of the
word. _Match me in London_, _Wks._ 4. 172:

                                --Thereâs a Pinnace
    (Was mannâd out first by thâ City), is come to thâ Court,
    New riggâd.

Also Dekker, _Wks._ 4. 162; 3. 67, 77, 78.

When the word became stereotyped into an equivalent for procuress or
prostitute, the metaphor was often dropped. Thus in _Bart. Fair_,
_Wks._ 4. 386: âShe hath been before me, punk, pinnace and bawd,
any time these two and twenty years.â Gifford says on this passage:
âThe usual gradation in infamy. A _pinnace_ was a light vessel built
for speed, generally employed as a tender. Hence our old dramatists
constantly used the word for a person employed in love messages, a
go-between in the worst sense, and only differing from a bawd in not
being stationary.â A glance at the examples given above will show,
however, that the term was much more elastic than this explanation
would indicate.

The dictionaries give no suggestion of the origin of the metaphor.
I suspect that it may be merely a borrowing from classical usage.
Cf. _Menaechmi_ 2. 3. 442:

    Ducit lembum dierectum nauis praedatoria.

In _Miles Gloriosus_ 4. 1. 986, we have precisely the same
application as in the English dramatists: âHaec celox (a swift
sailing vessel) illiust, quae hinc agreditur, internuntia.â

=1. 6. 62 thâ are right.= Whalleyâs interpretation is, of
course, correct. See variants.

=1. 6. 73 Not beyond that rush.= Rushes took the place of
carpets in the days of Elizabeth. Shakespeare makes frequent
reference to the custom (see Schmidt). The following passage from
Dr. Bulleyne has often been quoted: âRushes that grow upon dry
groundes be good to strew in halles, chambers and galleries, to
walk upon, defending apparel, as traynes of gownes and kertles
from dust.â Cf. also _Cyn. Rev._ 2. 5; _Every Man out_ 3. 3.

=1. 6. 83 As wise as a Court Parliament.= Jonson refers
here, I suppose, to the famous Courts or Parliaments of Love,
which were supposed to have existed during the Middle Ages (cf.
Skeat, _Chaucerâs Works_ 7. lxxx).

Cunningham calls attention to the fact that Massingerâs
_Parliament of Love_ was not produced until 1624. Jonson depicts
a sort of mock Parliament of Love in the _New Inn_, Act 4.

=1. 6. 88 And at all caracts.= âI. e., to the nicest point,
to the minutest circumstance.â--G. See Gloss. and cf. _Every Man
in_, _Wks._ 1. 70.

=1. 6. 89, 90 as scarce hath soule, In stead of salt.= Whalley
refers to _Bart. Fair_, _Wks._ 4. 446, 7: âTalk of him to have a
soul! âheart, if he have any more than a thing given him instead of
salt, only to keep him from stinking. Iâll be hangâd afore my time.â
Gifford quotes the passage from B. & Fl., _Spanish Curate_:

                      --this soul I speake of,
    Or rather salt, to keep this heap of flesh
    From being a walking stench.

W. furnishes a Latin parallel: âSus vero quid habet praeter escam?
cui quidem, ne putresceret, animam ipsam pro sale datam dicit esse
Chrysippus.â--Cic. _De Natura Deor_, lib. 2.

It is to these passages that Carlyle refers in his _Past and
Present_: âA certain degree of soul, as Ben Jonson reminds us,
is indispensable to keep the very body from destruction of the
frightfulest sort; to âsave us,â says he, âthe expense of salt.â
Bk. 2, Ch. 2.

âIn our and old Jonsonâs dialect, man has lost the _soul_ out of
him; and now, after the due period,--begins to find the want of
it.... Man has lost his soul, and vainly seeks antiseptic salt.â
(Simpson in _N. & Q._, 9th Ser. 4. 347, 423.)

To the same Latin source Professor Cook (_Mod. Lang. Notes_,
Feb., 1905) attributes the passage in _Rabbi Ben Ezra_ 43-45:

    What is he but a brute
    Whose flesh has soul to suit,
    Whose spirit works lest arms and legs want play?

and Samuel Johnsonâs âfamous sentence recorded by Boswell under June
19, 1784: âTalking of the comedy of _The Rehearsal_, he said: âIt has
not wit enough to keep it sweet.âââ

=1. 6. 97 the walks of Lincolnes Inne.= One of the famous Inns
of Court (note 3.1.8). It formerly pertained to the Bishops of
Chichester (Stow, _Survey_, ed. 1633, p. 488a). The gardens âwere
famous until the erection of the hall, by which they were curtailed
and seriously injuredâ (Wh-C.). The Tatler (May 10, 1709, no. 13)
speaks of Lincolnâs Inn Walks.

=1. 6. 99 I did looke for this geere.= See variants. Cunningham says:
âIn the original it is _geere_, and so it ought still to stand. Gear
was a word with a most extended signification. Nares defines it,
âmatter, subject, or business in general!â When Jonson uses the word
_jeer_ he spells it quite differently. The _Staple of News_ was first
printed at the same time as the present play, and in the beginning of
Act IV. Sc. 1, I find: â_Fit._ Letâs _ieere_ a little. _Pen._ Ieere?
whatâs that?ââ

It is so spelt regularly throughout _The Staple of News_, but in
_Ev. Man in_ 1. 2 (fol. 1616), we find: âSuch petulant, geering
gamsters that can spare No ... subject from their jest.â The
fact is that both words were sometimes spelt _geere_, as well
as in a variety of other ways. The uniform spelling in _The
Staple of News_, however, seems to indicate that this is the
word _gear_, which fits the context, fully as well as, perhaps
better than Giffordâs interpretation. A common meaning is âtalk,
discourseâ, often in a depreciatory sense. See Gloss.

=1. 6. 125 Things, that are like, are soone familiar.=
âLike will to likeâ is a familiar proverb.

=1. 6. 127 the signe oâ the husband.= An allusion to the
signs of the zodiac, some of which were supposed to have a
malign and others a beneficent influence.

=1. 6. 131 You grow old, while I tell you this.=
    Hor. [_Carm._ I. II. 8 f.]:

                         Dum loquimur, fugerit invida
                         Aetas, carpe diem.--G.

Whalley suggested:

    Fugit Hora: hoc quod loquor, inde est.
                                --Pers. _Sat._ 5.

=1. 6. 131, 2                      And such
    As cannot vse the present, are not wise.=
Cf. _Underwoods_ 36. 21:

    To use the present, then, is not abuse.

=1. 6. 138 Nay, then, I taste a tricke inât.= Cf. âI do
taste this as a trick put on me.â _Ev. Man in_, _Wks._ 1. 133.
See Introduction, p. xlvii.

=1. 6. 142 cautelous.= For similar uses of the word cf.
Massinger, _City Madam_, _Wks._, p. 321, and B. & Fl., _Elder
Brother_, _Wks._ 10. 275. Gifford gives an example from Knolles,
_Hist. of the Turks,_ p. 904.

=1. 6. 149 MAN. Sir, what doe you meane?

       153 MAN. You must play faire, S^r.= âI am not certain about
 the latter of these two speeches, but it is perfectly unquestionable
 that the former _must_ have been spoken by the husband
 Fitzdottrel.â--C.

Cunningham may be right, but the change is unnecessary if
we consider Manlyâs reproof as occasioned by Fitzdottrelâs
interruption.

=1. 6. 158, 9              No wit of man=

=Or roses can redeeme from being an Asse.= âHere is an allusion to
the metamorphosis of Lucian into an _ass_; who being brought into
the theatre to shew tricks, recovered his human shape by eating some
_roses_ which he found there. See the conclusion of the treatise,
_Lucius, sive Asinus_.â--W.

See Lehmanâs edition, Leipzig, 1826, 6. 215. As Gifford says,
the allusion was doubtless more familiar in Jonsonâs day than
in our own. The story is retold in Harsnetâs _Declaration_
(p. 102), and Lucianâs work seems to have played a rather important
part in the discussion of witchcraft.

=1. 6. 161 To scape his lading.= Cf. note 1. 4. 72.

=1. 6. 180 To other ensignes.= âI. e., to horns, the
Insignia of a cuckold.â--G.

=1. 6. 187 For the meere names sake.= âI. e. the name of
the play.â--W.

=1. 6. 195 the sad contract.= See variants. W. and G. are
doubtless correct.

=1. 6. 214 a guilt caroch.= âThere was some distinction
apparently between _caroch_ and _coach_. I find in
Lord Baconâs will, in which he disposed of so much imaginary
wealth, the following bequest: âI give also to my wife my four
coach geldings, and my best caroache, and her own coach mares and
caroache.ââ--C.

Minsheu says that a carroch is a great coach. Cf. also Taylorâs
_Wks._, 1630:

    No coaches, or carroaches she doth crave.

_Rom Alley_, _O. Pl._, 2d ed., 5. 475:

    No, nor your jumblings,
    In horslitters, in coaches or caroches.

_Greeneâs Tu Quoque_, _O. Pl._, 2d ed., 7. 28:

    Mayâst draw him to the keeping of a coach
    For country, and carroch for London.

Cf. also Dekker, _Non-dram. Wks._ 1. 111. Finally the matter is
settled by Howes (p. 867), who gives the date of the introduction
of coaches as 1564, and adds: âLastly, euen at this time, 1605,
began the ordinary use of Caroaches.â In _Cyn. Rev._, _Wks._ 2. 281,
Gifford changes _carroch_ to _coach_.

=1. 6. 216 Hide-parke.= Jonson speaks of coaching in Hyde Park in the
_Prologue to the Staple of News_, _Wks._ 5. 157, and in _The World
in the Moon_, _Wks._ 7. 343. Pepys has many references to it in his
_Diary_. âMay 7, 1662. And so, after the play was done, she and The
Turner and Mrs. Lucin and I to the Parke; and there found them out,
and spoke to them; and observed many fine ladies, and staid till all
were gone almost.â

âApril 22, 1664. In their coach to Hide Parke, where great plenty of
gallants, and pleasant it was, only for the dust.â

Ashton in his _Hyde Park_ (p. 59) quotes from a ballad in the British
Museum (c 1670-5) entitled, _News from Hide Park_, In which the
following lines occur:

    Of all parts of _England_, Hide-park hath the name,
    For Coaches and Horses, and Persons of fame.

=1. 6. 216, 7 Black-Fryers, Visit the Painters.= A church,
precinct, and sanctuary with four gates, lying between Ludgate
Hill and the Thames and extending westward from Castle Baynard
(St. Andrewâs Hill) to the Fleet river. It was so called from
the settlement there of the Black or Dominican Friars in 1276.
Sir A. Vandyck lived here 1632-1641. âBefore Vandyck, however,
Blackfriars was the recognized abode of painters. Cornelius
Jansen (d. 1665) lived in the Blackfriars for several years.
Isaac Oliver, the miniature painter, was a still earlier
resident.â Painters on glass, or glass stainers, and collectors
were also settled here.--Wh-C.

=1. 6. 219 a middling Gossip.= âA go-between, an
_internuntia_, as the Latin writers would have called her.â--W.

=1. 6. 224 the cloake is mine.= The reading in the folio
belonging to Dr. J. M. Berdan of Yale is: âthe cloake is mine
owne.â This accounts for the variant readings.

=1. 6. 230 motion.= Spoken derogatively, a âperformance.â
Lit., a puppet-show. The motion was a descendent of the
morality, and exceedingly popular in England at this time.
See Dr. Winter, _Staple of News_, p. 161; Strutt, _Sports and
Pastimes_, p. 166 f.; Knight, _London_ 1. 42. Jonson makes
frequent mention of the motion. _Bartholomew Fair_ 5. 5 is
largely devoted to the description of one, and _Tale Tub_ 5. 5
presents a series of them.

=1. 7. 4 more cheats?= See note on _Cheaters_, 5. 6. 64,
and Gloss.

=1. 7. 16 The state hath tane such note of âhem.=
See note 1. 2. 22.

=1. 7. 25 Your Almanack-Men.= An excellent account of the
Almanac-makers of the 17th century is given by H. R. Plomer in
_N. & Q._,6th Ser. 12. 243, from which the following is abridged:

âAlmanac-making had become an extensive and profitable trade
in this country at the beginning of the 17th century, and with
the exception of some fifteen or twenty years at the time of
the Rebellion continued to flourish until its close. There
were three distinct classes of almanacs published during the
seventeenth century--the common almanacs, which preceded and
followed the period of the Rebellion, and the political and
satirical almanacs that were the direct outcome of that event.

âThe common almanacs came out year after year in unbroken
uniformity. They were generally of octavo size and consisted
of two parts, an almanac and a prognostication. Good and evil
days were recorded, and they contained rules as to bathing,
purging, etc., descriptions of the four seasons and rules to
know the weather, and during the latter half of the century an
astrological prediction and âschemeâ of the ensuing year.

âIn the preceding century the makers of almanacs were âPhysitians and
Preestsâ, but they now adopted many other titles, such as âStudent in
Astrologyâ, âPhilomathâ, âWell Willer to the Mathematics.â The majority
of them were doubtless astrologers, but not a few were quack doctors,
who only published their almanacs as advertisements.â (Almanac, a
character in _The Staple of News_, is described as a âdoctor in
physic.â)

Among the more famous almanac-makers the names of William Lilly, John
Partridge and Bretnor may be mentioned. For the last see note 2. 1.
1, and B. & Fl., _Rollo, Duke of Normandy_, where Fiske and Bretnor
appear again. Cf. also _Alchemist_, _Wks._ 4. 41; _Every Man out_,
_Wks._ 2. 39-40; _Mag. La._, _Wks._ 6. 74, 5. In Sir Thomas Overburyâs
_Character_ of _The Almanac-Maker_ (Morley, p. 56) we read: âThe verses
of his book have a worse pace than ever had Rochester hackney; for his
prose, âtis dappled with ink-horn terms, and may serve for an almanac;
but for his judging at the uncertainty of weather, any old shepherd
shall make a dunce of him.â


ACT II.

=2. 1. 1 Sir, moneyâs a whore=, etc. Coleridge, _Notes_,
p. 280. emends: âMoney, sir, moneyâs aâ, &c. Cunningham, on the
other hand, thinks that âthe 9-syllable arrangement is quite in
Jonsonâs manner, and that it forces an emphasis upon every word
especially effective at the beginning of an act.â See variants.

Money is again designated as a whore in the _Staple of News_
4. 1: âSaucy Jack, away: Pecunia is a whore.â In the same
play Pennyboy, the usurer, is called a âmoney-bawd.â Dekker
(_Non-dram. Wks._ 2. 137) speaks of keeping a bawdy-house for
Lady Pecunia. The figure is a common one.

=2. 1 .3 Via.= This exclamation is quite common among the dramatists
and is explained by Nares as derived from the Italian exclamation
_via!_ âaway, on!â with a quibble on the literal of L. _via_, a way.
The _Century Dictionary_ agrees substantially with this derivation.
Abundant examples of its use are given by the authorities quoted, to
which may be added _Merry Devil of Edmonton_ 1. 2. 5, and Marston,
_Dutch Courtezan_, _Wks._ 2. 20:

    O, yes, come, _via_!--away, boy--on!

=2. 1. 5 With Aqua-vitae.= Perhaps used with especial reference to
line 1, where he has just called money a bawd Compare:

    O, ay, as a bawd with aqua-vitae.
                  --Marston, _The Malcontent_, _Wks_. 1. 294.

âHer face is full of those red pimples with drinking Aquauite,
the common drinke of all bawdes.â--Dekker, _Whore of Babylon_,
_Wks._ 2. 246.

=2. 1. 17. See variants.= Line 15 shows that the original
reading is correct.

=2. 1. 19 it shall be good in law.= See note 1. 2. 22.

=2. 1. 20 Wood-cock.= A cant term for a simpleton or dupe.

=2. 1. 21 thâ Exchange.= This was the first Royal Exchange,
founded by Sir Thomas Gresham in 1566, opened by Queen Elizabeth
in 1570-1, and destroyed in the great fire of 1666 (Wh-C.).
Howes (1631) says that it was âplenteously stored with all kinds
of rich wares and fine commodities,â and Paul Hentzner (p. 40)
speaks of it with enthusiasm.

It was a favorite lounging-place, especially in the evening.
Wheatley quotes Hayman, _Quodlibet_, 1628, p. 6:

    Though little coin thy purseless pockets line,
    Yet with great company thouârt taken up;
    For often with Duke Humfray thou dost dine,
    And often with Sir Thomas Gresham sup.

âWe are told in _London_ and _Country Carbonadoed_, 1632, that at the
exchange there were usually more coaches attendant than at church
doors.â Cf. also _Bart. Fair_, _Wks._ 4. 357: âI challenge all
Cheapside to shew such another: Moor-fields, Pimlico-path, Or the
Exchange, in a summer evening.â Also _Ev. Man in_, _Wks._ 1. 39.

=2. 1. 30 do you doubt his eares?= Ingineâs speech is capable of a
double interpretation. Pug has already spoken of the âliberal earsâ of
his asinine master.

=2. 1. 41 a string ofâs purse.= Purses, of course, used to
be hung at the girdle. A thief was called a cut-purse. See the
amusing scene in _Bart. Fair_, _Wks._ 5. 406.

=2. 1. 53, 4 at the Pan, Not, at the skirts.= â_Pan_ is not
easily distinguished from _skirt_. Both words seem to refer to
the outer parts, or extremities. Possibly Meercraft means--on
a broader scale, on a more extended front.â--G.

âThe pan is evidently the deepest part of the swamp, which
continues to hold water when the _skirts_ dry up, like the hole
in the middle of the tray under a joint when roasting, which
collects all the dripping. Meercraft proposed to grapple with
the main difficulty at once.â--C.

I had already arrived at the same conclusion before reading
Cunninghamâs note. The _NED._ gives: âPan. A hollow or depression in
the ground, esp. one in which water stands.

1594 Plat, _Jewell-ho_ 1. 32 Of all Channels, Pondes, Pooles,
Riuers, and Ditches, and of all other pannes and bottomes
whatsoeuer.â

_Pan_, however, is also an obsolete form of _pane_, a cloth
or skirt. The use is evidently a quibble. The word _pan_ suggested
to Jonson the word _skirt_, which he accordingly employed not
unaptly.

=2. 1. 63 his black bag of papers, there, in Buckram.= The
buckram bag was the usual sign of the pettifogger. Cf. Marston,
_Malcontent_, _Wks._ 1. 235:

    _Pass._ Ay, as a pettifogger by his buckram bag.

Dekker, _If this be not a good Play_, _Wks._ 3. 274: âWe must all
turn pettifoggers and in stead of gilt rapiers, hang buckram bags at
our girdles.â Nash refers to the same thing in _Pierce Pennilesse_,
_Wks._ 2. 17.

=2. 1. 64 thâ Earledome of Pancridge.= Pancridge is a corruption
of Pancras. The Earl of Pancridge was âone of the âWorthiesâ who
annually rode to Mile End, or the Artillery Ground, in the ridiculous
procession called _Arthurs Shew_â (G.). Cf. _To Inigo Marquis
Would-be_, _Wks._ 8. 115:

    Content thee to be Pancridge earl the while.

_Tale Tub_, _Wks._ 6. 175:

                            --next our St. George,
    Who rescued the kingâs daughter, I will ride;
    Above Prince Arthur.
    _Clench._ Or our own Shoreditch duke.
    _Med._. Or Pancridge earl.
    _Pan._ Or Bevis or Sir Guy.

For _Arthurâs Show_ see Entickâs _Survey_ 1. 497; Wh-C. 1. 65;
and Nares 1. 36. Cf. note 4. 7. 65Â·

=2. 1. 71, 2 Your Borachio Of Spaine.= ââ_Borachio_ (says
Min-shieu) is a bottle commonly of a pigges skin, with the hair
inward, dressed inwardly with rozen, to keep wine or liquor
sweet:â--Wines preserved in these bottles contract a peculiar
flavour, and are then said _to taste of the borachio_.â--G.

Florio says: âa boracho, or a bottle made of a goates skin such
as they vse in Spaine.â The word occurs somewhat frequently
(see _NED._) and apparently always with this meaning, or in the
figurative sense of âdrunkardâ. It is evident, however, from
Engineâs question, âOf the Kingâs glouer?â either that it is
used here in a slightly different sense, or more probably that
Merecraft is relying on Fitzdottrelâs ignorance of the subject.
Spanish leather for wearing apparel was at this time held in
high esteem. See note 4. 4. 71, 2.

=2. 1. 83 a Harrington.= âIn 1613, a patent was granted to John
Stanhope, lord Harrington, Treasurer of the Chambers, for the
coinage of royal farthing tokens, of which he seems to have availed
himself with sufficient liberality. Some clamour was excited on the
occasion: but it speedily subsided; for the Star Chamber kept a
watchful eye on the first symptoms of discontent at these pernicious
indulgences. From this nobleman they took the name of Harrington
in common conversation.â--G.

âNow (1613) my lord Harrington obtained a patent from the
King for the making of Brasse Farthings, a thing that brought with
it some contempt through lawfull.â--Sparke, _Hist. Narration_,
Somerâs _Tracts_ 2. 294.

A reference to this coin is made in _Drunken Barnabyâs Journal_
in the _Oxoniana_ (quoted by Gifford) and in Sir Henry Wottonâs
Letters (p. 558, quoted by Whalley). Cf. also _Mag. La._, _Wks._
6. 89: âI will note bate you a single Harrington,â and _ibid._,
_Wks._ 6. 43.

=2. 1. 102 muscatell.= The grape was usually called
_muscat_. So in Pepysâ _Diary_, 1662: âHe hath also sent each of
us some anchovies, olives and muscatt.â The wine was variously
written _muscatel_, _muscadel_, and _muscadine_. Muscadine and
eggs are often mentioned together (cf. Text, 2. 2. 95-96; _New
Inn_ 3. 1; Middleton, _Wks._ 2. 290; 3. 94; and 8. 36), and were
used as an aphrodisiac (Bullen). Nares quotes Minsheu: âVinum
muscatum, quod moschi odorem referat; for the sweetnesse and
smell it resembles muske.â

=2. 1. 116, 7 the receiuâd heresie, That England beares no Dukes.=
âI know not when this _heresy_ crept in. There was apparently some
unwillingness to create dukes, as a title of honour, in the Norman
race; probably because the Conqueror and his immediate successors were
dukes of Normandy, and did not choose that a subject should enjoy
similar dignities with themselves. The first of the English who bore
the title was Edward the black prince, (son of Edward III.) who was
created duke of Cornwall, by charter, as Collins says, in 1337. The
dignity being subsequently conferred on several of the blood-royal,
and of the nobility, who came to untimely ends, an idea seems to have
been entertained by the vulgar, that the title itself was ominous. At
the accession of James I. to the crown of this country, there was, I
believe, no English peer of ducal dignity.â--G.

The last duke had been created in the reign of Henry VIII., who made
his illegitimate son the Duke of Richmond, and Charles Brandon, who
married his sister Mary, Duke of Suffolk. After the attainder and
execution of Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, in 1572, there was no duke
in England except the kingâs sons, until the creation of the Duke of
Richmond in 1623. (See _New Int. Cyc._ 6. 349.)

=2. 1. 144 Bermudas.= âThis was a cant term for some places in
the town with the same kind of privilege as the mint of old, or the
purlieus of the Fleet.â--W.

âThese _streights_ consisted of a nest of obscure courts,
alleys, and avenues, running between the bottom of St. Martinâs
Lane, Half-moon, and Chandos-street. In Justice Overdoâs time,
they were the receptacles of fraudulent debtors, thieves and
prostitutes.â--G. (Note on _Bart. Fair_, _Wks._ 4. 407.)

âOn Wednesday at the Bermudas Court, Sir Edwin Sandys fell foul
of the Earl of Warwick. The Lord Cavendish seconded Sandys and
the Earl told the Lord, âBy his favour he believed he lied.â
Hereupon, it is said, they rode out yesterday, and, as it is
thought, gone beyond sea to fight.--_Leigh to Rev. Joseph Mede_,
July 18, 1623.â (Quoted Wh-C. 1. 169.) So in _Underwoods_,
_Wks._ 8. 348:

                              turn pirates here at land,
    Have their Bermudas and their Streights iâ the Strand.

_Bart. Fair_, _Wks._ 4. 407: âThe Streights, or the Bermudas,
where the quarrelling lesson is read.â

It is evident from the present passage and the above quotations that
ruffians like Everill kept regular quarters in the âBermudasâ, where
they might be consulted with reference to the settlement of affairs
of honor.

=2. 1. 151 puts off man, and kinde.= âI. e., human nature.â--G. Cf.
_Catiline_, _Wks._ 4. 212:

                  --so much, that kind
    May seek itself there, and not find.

=2. 1. 162 French-masques.= âMasks do not appear as ordinary
articles of female costume in England previous to the reign of
Queen Elizabeth.... French masks are alluded to by Ben Jonson
in _The Devil is an Ass_. They were probably the half masks
called in France âloups,â whence the English term âloo masks.â

    Loo masks and whole as wind do blow,
    And Miss abroadâs disposed to go.
                        _Mundus Muliebris_, 1690.
                        --PlanchÃ© _Cycl. of Costume_ 1. 365.

âBlack masks were frequently worn by ladies in public in the
time of Shakespeare, particularly, and perhaps universally at
the theatres.â--Nares.

=2. 1. 163 Cut-works.= A very early sort of lace deriving
its name from the mode of its manufacture, the fine cloth on
which the pattern was worked being cut away, leaving the design
perfect. It is supposed to have been identical with what was
known as Greek work, and made by the nuns of Italy in the
twelfth century. It was introduced into England during the
reign of Queen Elizabeth, and continued in fashion during those
of James I. and Charles I. Later it fell under the ban of the
Puritans, and after that period is rarely heard of. (Abridged
from PlanchÃ©, _Cycl._)

=2. 1. 168 ff. nor turne the key=, etc. Gifford points out that the
source of this passage is Plautus, _Aulularia_ [ll. 90-100]:

    Caue quemquam alienum in aedis intromiseris.
    Quod quispiam ignem quaerat, extingui uolo,
    Ne causae quid sit quod te quispiam quaeritet.
    Nam si ignis uiuet, tu extinguere extempulo,
    Tum aquam aufugisse dicito, si quis petet.
    Cultrum, securim, pistillum, mortarium,
    Quae utenda uasa semper uicini rogant,
    Fures uenisse atque abstulisse dicito.
    Profecto in aedis meas me absente neminem
    Volo intromitti, atque etiam hoc praedico tibi,
    Si Bona Fortuna ueniat, ne intromiseris.

Jonson had already made use of a part of this passage:

    Put out the fire, kill the chimneyâs heart,
    That it may breathe no more than a dead man.
                       _Case is Altered_ 2. 1, _Wks._ 6. 328.

Wilson imitated the same passage in his _Projectors_, Act 2, Sc.
1: âShut the door after me, bolt it and bar it, and see you let
no one in in my absence. Put out the fire, if there be any, for
fear somebody, seeing the smoke, may come to borrow some! If
any one come for water, say the pipeâs cut off; or to borrow a
pot, knife, pestle and mortar, or the like, say they were stole
last night! But harke ye! I charge ye not to open the door to
give them an answer, but whisperât through the keyhole! For, I
tell you again, I wilt have nobody come into my house while Iâm
abroad! No; no living soul! Nay, though Good Fortune herself
knock at a door, donât let her in!â

=2. 2. 1 I haue no singular seruice=, etc. I. e., This is
the sort of thing I must become accustomed to, if I am to
remain on earth.

=2. 2. 49, 50 Though they take Master Fitz-dottrell, I am no
such foule.= Gifford points out that the punning allusion of
_foul_ to _fowl_ is a play upon the word dottrel. âThe dotterel
(Fuller tells us) is avis Î³ÎµÎ»Î¿ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¿Î¹Î¿Ï a mirth-making bird,
so ridiculously mimical, that he is easily caught, or rather
catcheth himself by his over-active imitation. As the fowler
stretcheth forth his arms and legs, stalking towards the bird,
so the bird extendeth his legs and wings, approaching the fowler
till he is surprised in the net.â--G.

This is what is alluded to in 4. 6. 42. The use of the metaphor is
common. Gifford quotes Beaumont & Fletcher. _Bonduca_ and _Sea Voyage_.
Many examples are given in Nares and the _NED._, to which may be added
_Damon and Pithias_, _O. Pl._ 4. 68; Nash, _Wks._ 3. 171; and Butlerâs
_Character of a Fantastic_ (ed. Morley, p. 401): âHe alters his gait
with the times, and has not a motion of his body that (like a dottrel)
he does not borrow from somebody else.â Nares quotes _Old Couple_ (_O.
Pl._, 4th ed., 12. 41):

    _E._ Our Dotterel then is caught?
                         _B._ He is and just
    As Dotterels use to be: the lady first
    Advancâd toward him, stretchâd forth her wing, and he
    Met her with all expressions.

It is uncertain whether the sense of âbirdâ or âsimpletonâ is
the original. _Dottrel_ seems to be connected with _dote_ and
_dotard_. The bird is a species of plover, and Cunningham says
that âSelby ridicules the notion of its being more stupid than
other birds.â In _Bart. Fair_ (_Wks._ 4. 445) we hear of the
âsport callâd Dorring the Dotterel.â

=2. 2. 51 Nor faire one.= The dramatists were fond of
punning on _foul_ and _fair_. Cf. _Bart. Fair_ passim.

=2. 2. 77 a Nupson.= Jonson uses the word again in _Every
Man in_, _Wks._ 1. 111: âO that I were so happy as to light on
a nupson now.â In _Lingua_, 1607, (_O. Pl._, 4th ed., 9. 367,
458) both the forms _nup_ and _nupson_ are used. The etymology
is uncertain. The _Century Dictionary_ thinks _nup_ may be a
variety of _nope_. Gifford thinks it may be a corruption of
Greek Î½Î·Ï.

=2. 2. 78 with my Masterâs peace.= âI. e. respectfully,
reverently: a bad translation of _cum pace domini_.â--G.

=2. 2. 81 a spicâd conscience.= Used again in _Sejanus_,
_Wks._ 3. 120, and _New Inn_, _Wks._ 5. 337.

=2. 2. 90 The very forked top too.= Another reference to the
horned head of the cuckold. Cf. 1. 6. 179, 80.

=2. 2. 93 engendering by the eyes.= Cf. Song in _Merch. of V._
3. 2. 67: âIt is engenderâd in the eyes.â

=2. 2. 98 make benefit.= Cf. _Every Man in_, _Wks._ 1. 127.

=2. 2. 104 a Cokes.= Cf. Ford, _Loverâs Melancholy_, _Wks._
2. 80: âA kind of cokes, which is, as the learned term [it], an
ass, a puppy, a widgeon, a dolt, a noddy, a----.â Cokes is the
name of a foolish coxcomb in _Bart. Fair_.

=2. 2. 112 you neat handsome vessells.= Cf. note 1. 6. 57.

=2. 2. 116 your squires of honour.= This seems to be
equivalent to the similar expression âsquire of dames.â

=2. 2. 119-125 For the variety at my times, ... I know, to
do my turnes, sweet Mistresse.= I. e., when for variety you turn
to me, I will be able to serve your needs. Pug, of course, from the
delicate nature of the subject, chooses to make use of somewhat
ambiguous phrases.

=2. 2. 121.= Thos. Keightley, _N. & Q._ 4. 2. 603,
proposes to read:

    Of that proportion, or in the rule.

=2. 2. 123 Picardill.= Cotgrave gives: âPiccadilles: Piccadilles;
the severall divisions or peeces fastened together about the brimme
of the collar of a doublet, &c.â Gifford says: âWith respect to the
_Piccadil_, or, as Jonson writes it, Picardil, (as if he supposed the
fashion of wearing it be derived from Picardy,) the term is simply a
diminutive of picca (Span. and Ital.) a spear-head, and was given to
this article of foppery, from a fancied resemblance of its stiffened
plaits to the bristled points of those weapons. Blount thinks, and
apparently with justice, that Piccadilly took its name from the sale
of the âsmall stiff collars, so calledâ, which was first set on foot
in a house near the western extremity of the present street, by one
Higgins, a tailor.â

As Gifford points out, âPug is affecting modesty, since he had
not only assumed a handsome body, but a fashionable dress, âmade
newâ for a particular occasion.â See 5. 1. 35, 36.

Jonson mentions the _Picardill_ again in the _Challenge at
Tilt_, _Wks._ 7. 217, and in the _Epistle to a Friend_,
_Wks._ 8. 356. For other examples see Nares, _Gloss_.

=2. 2. 127 f. your fine Monkey=; etc. These are all common
terms of endearment. The monkey is frequently mentioned as a
ladyâs pet by the dramatists. See _Cynthiaâs Revels_, passim, and
Mrs. Centlivreâs _Busie Body_.

=2. 3. 36, 7 and your coach-man bald! Because he shall be bare.=
See note to 4. 4. 202.

=2. 3. 45 This man defies the Diuell.= See 2. 1. 18.

=2. 3. 46 He dosât by Ingine.= I. e., wit, ingenuity, with a
possible reference to the name of Merecraftâs agent.

=2. 3. 49 Crowland.= Crowland, or Croyland is an ancient town
and parish of Lincolnshire, situated in a low flat district, about
eight miles north-east from Peterborough. The origin of Crowland was
in a hermitage founded in the 7th century by St. Guthlac. An abbey
was founded in 714 by King Ethelbald, which was twice burnt and
restored.

=2. 4. 6 Spenser, I thinke, the younger.= Thomas (1373-1400)
was the only member of the Despenser family who was an Earl of
Gloucester. The person referred to here, however, is Hugh le
Despenser, the younger baron, son of Hugh le Despenser, the elder.
He married Eleanor, daughter of Gilbert of Clare, Earl of Gloucester,
and sister and coheiress of the next Earl Gilbert. After the
death of the latter, the inheritance was divided between the husbands
of his three sisters, and Despenser was accordingly sometimes called
Earl of Gloucester.

Despenser was at first on the side of the barons, but later joined
the Kingâs party. In 1321 a league was formed against him, and he
was banished, but was recalled in the following year. In the
Baronsâ rising of 1326 he was taken prisoner, brought to Hereford,
tried and put to death.

=2. 4. 8 Thomas of Woodstocke.= Thomas of Woodstock, Earl
of Buckingham (1355-97), the youngest son of Edward III., was
made Duke of Gloucester by his nephew, Richard II., in 1385, and
later acquired an extraordinary influence, dominating the affairs of
England for several years. By his high-handed actions he incurred
Richardâs enmity. He was arrested July 10, 1397, and conveyed to
Calais, where he was murdered in the following September by the
kingâs order.

=2. 4. 10 Duke Humphrey.= Humphrey, called the Good Duke
Humphrey (1391-1447), youngest son of Henry IV., was created
Duke of Gloucester and Earl of Pembroke in 1414. During the
minority of Henry VI. he acted as Protector of the kingdom. His
career was similar to that of Thomas of Woodstock. In 1447 he
was arrested at Bury by order of Henry VI., who had become king
in 1429. Here he died in February, probably by a natural death,
although there were suspicions of foul play.

=2. 4. 11 Richard the Third.= Richard III. (1452-1485), Duke of
Gloucester and King of England, was defeated and slain in the battle
of Bosworth Field, 1485.

=2. 4. 12-4 MER. By ... authentique.= This passage has been
the occasion of considerable discussion. The subject was first
approached by Malone. In a note to an essay on _The Order of
Shakespeareâs Plays_ in his edition of Shakespeareâs works (ed.
1790, 3. 322) he says: âIn _The Devilâs an Ass_, acted in 1616,
all his historical plays are obliquely censured.â

Again in a dissertation on _Henry VI._: âThe malignant Ben, does
indeed, in his _Devilâs an Ass_, 1616, sneer at our authorâs
historical pieces, which for twenty years preceding had been in high
reputation, and probably were _then_ the only historical dramas that
had possession of the theatre; but from the list above given, it is
clear that Shakespeare was not the _first_ who dramatized our old
chronicles; and that the principal events of English History were
familiar to the ears of his audience, before he commenced a writer
for the stage.â Malone here refers to quotations taken from Gosson
and Lodge. Both these essays were reprinted in Steevensâ edition, and
Maloneâs statements were repeated in the edition by Dr. Chalmers.

In 1808 appeared Gilchristâs essay, _An Examination of the
Charges ... of Ben Jonsonâs enmity,_ etc. _towards Shakespeare_.
This refutation, strengthened by Giffordâs _Proofs of Ben
Jonsonâs Malignity_, has generally been deemed conclusive.
Giffordâs note on the present passage is written with much
asperity. He was not content, however, with an accurate
restatement of Maloneâs arguments. He changes the italics in
order to produce an erroneous impression, printing thus: âwhich
were probably then the _only historical dramas on the stage_:
He adds: âAnd this is advanced in the very face of his own
arguments, to prove that there were scores, perhaps hundreds, of
others on it at the time.â This is direct falsification. There
is no contradiction in Maloneâs arguments. What he attempted
to prove was that Shakespeare had had predecessors in this
field, but that in 1616 his plays held undisputed possession
of the stage. Gifford adds a passage from Heywoodâs _Apology
for Actors_, 1612, which is more to the point: âPlays have
taught the unlearned the knowledge of many famous _histories_,
instructed such as cannot read in the discovery of our _English
Chronicles_: and what man have you now of that weake capacity
that being possest of their true use, cannot discourse of any
notable thing recorded even from _William the Conqueror_, until
this day?â

This passage seems to point to the existence of other historical plays
_contemporary_ with those of Shakespeare. Besides, Jonsonâs words
seem sufficiently harmless. Nevertheless, although I am not inclined
to accept Maloneâs charge of âmalignityâ, I cannot agree with Gifford
that the reference is merely a general one. I have no doubt that the
âChronicle,â of which Merecraft speaks, is Hallâs, and the passage
the following: âIt semeth to many men, that the name and title of
Gloucester, hath been vnfortunate and vnluckie to diuerse, whiche
for their honor, haue been erected by creacion of princes, to that
stile and dignitie, as Hugh Spencer, Thomas of Woodstocke, sonne to
kyng Edward the third, and this duke Humfrey, which thre persones,
by miserable death finished their daies, and after them kyng Richard
the iii. also, duke of Gloucester, in ciuill warre was slaine and
confounded: so y^t this name of Gloucester, is take for an vnhappie
and vnfortunate stile, as the prouerbe speaketh of Seianes horse,
whose rider was euer unhorsed, and whose possessor was euer brought to
miserie.â Hallâs _Chronicle_, ed. 1809, pp. 209-10. The passage in âthe
Play-bookesâ which Jonson satirizes is at the close of _3 Henry VI._ 2.
6:

      _Edw._ Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,
    And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,
    Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.
      _Rich._ Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;
    For Gloucesterâs dukedom is too ominous.

The last line, of course, corresponds to the _âTis fatal_ of
Fitzdottrel. Furthermore it may be observed that Thomas of
Woodstockâs death at Calais is referred to in Shakespeareâs _K.
Rich. II._; Duke Humphrey appears in _2 Henry IV._; _Henry V._;
and _1_ and _2 Henry VI._; and Richard III. in _2_ and _3 Henry
VI._ and _K. Rich. III._ _3 Henry VI._ is probably, however, not
of Shakespearean authorship.

=2. 4. 15 a noble house.= See Introduction, p. lxxiv.

=2. 4. 23 Groen-land.= The interest in Greenland must have been
at its height in 1616. Between 1576 and 1622 English explorers
discovered various portions of its coast; the voyages of Frobisher,
Davis, Hudson and Baffin all taking place during that period.
Hakluytâs _Principall Navigations_ appeared in 1589, Davisâs _Worldes
Hydrographical Description_ in 1594, and descriptions of Hudsonâs
voyages in 1612-3. The usual spelling of the name seems to have
been _Groenland_, as here. I find the word spelled also _Groineland_,
_Groenlandia_, _Gronland_, and _Greneland_ (see Publications of the
Hakluyt Society). Jonsonâs reference has in it a touch of sarcasm.

=2. 4. 27 f. Yes, when you=, etc. The source of this passage is
Hor., _Sat._ 2. 2. 129 f.:

    Nam propriae telluris erum natura neque illum
    Nec me nec quemquam statuit; nos expulit ille,
    Ilium aut nequities, aut vafri inscitia juris
    Postremo expellet certe vivacior haeres.
    Nunc ager Umbreni sub nomine, nuper Ofelli
    Dictus, erit nulli proprius, sed cadet in usum
    Nunc mihi, nunc alii.

Gifford quotes a part of the passage and adds: âWhat follows is
admirably turned by Pope:

    Shades that to Bacon might retreat afford,
    Become the portion of a booby lord;
    And Helmsley, once proud Buckinghamâs delight,
    Slides to a scrivener, or city knight.â

A much closer imitation is found in Webster, _Devilâs Law Case_,
_Wks._ 2. 37:

    Those lands that were the clients art now become
    The lawyerâs: and those tenements that were
    The country gentlemanâs, are now grown
    To be his tailorâs.

=2. 4. 32 not doâit first.= Cf. 1. 6. 14 and note.

=2. 5. 10 And garters which are lost, if shee can shew âhem.=
Gifford thinks the line should read: âcan not shewâ. Cunningham gives
a satisfactory explanation: âAs I understand this it means that if a
gallant once saw the garters he would never rest until he obtained
possession of them, and they would thus be _lost_ to the family.
Garters thus begged from the ladies were used by the gallants as
_hangers_ for their swords and poniards. See _Every Man out of his
Humour_, _Wks._ 2. 81: âO, I have been graced by them beyond all aim
of affection: this is her garter my dagger hangs in;â and again p.
194. We read also in _Cynthiaâs Revels_, _Wks._ 2. 266, of a gallant
whose devotion to a lady in such that he

                              Salutes her pumps,
    Adores her hems, her skirts, her knots, her curls,
    _Will spend his patrimony for a garter_,
    Or the least feather in her bounteous fan.â

Giffordâs theory that ladies had some mode of displaying their
garters is contradicted by the following:

    _Mary._ These roses will shew rare: would âtwere in fashion
    That the garters might be seen too!
                           --Massinger, _City Madam_, _Wks._, p. 317.

Cf. also _Cynthiaâs Revels_, _Wks._ 2. 296.

=2. 5. 14 her owne deare reflection, in her glasse.= âThey must haue
their looking glasses caryed with them wheresoeuer they go, ... no
doubt they are the deuils spectacles to allure vs to pride, and
consequently to distruction for euer.â--Stubbes, _Anat._, Part 1, P. 79.

=2. 6. 21 and done the worst defeate vpon my selfe.= _Defeat_ is often
used by Shakespeare in this sense. See Schmidt, and compare _Hamlet_ 2.
2. 598:

                                  --A king
    Upon whose property and most dear life
    A damnâd defeat was made.

=2. 6. 32 a body intire.= Cf. 5. 6. 48.

=2. 6. 35 You make me paint.= Gifford quotes from the _Two Noble
Kinsmen_:

    How modestly she blows and paints the sun
    With her chaste blushes.

=2. 6. 37 SN.= âWhoever has noticed the narrow streets or
rather lanes of our ancestors, and observed how story projected
beyond story, till the windows of the upper rooms almost touched
on different sides, will easily conceive the feasibility of
everything which takes place between Wittipol and his mistress,
though they make their appearance in different houses.â--G.

I cannot believe that Jonson wished to represent the two houses
as on opposite sides of the street. He speaks of them as
âcontiguousâ, which would naturally mean side by side. Further
than this, one can hardly imagine even in the ânarrow lanes of
our ancestorsâ so close a meeting that the liberties mentioned
in 2. 6. 76 SN. could be taken.

=2. 6. 53 A strange woman.= In _Bart. Fair_, _Wks._ 4. 395,
Justice Overdo says: âRescue this youth here out of the hands
of the lewd man and _the strange woman_.â Gifford explains in a
note: âThe scripture phrase for an immodest woman, a prostitute.
Indeed this acceptation of the word is familiar to many
languages. It is found in the Greek; and we have in Terence--pro
_uxore habere hanc_ peregrinam: upon which Donatus remarks, _hoc
nomine etiam_ meretrices _nominabantur_.â

=2. 6. 57-113 WIT. No, my tune-full Mistresse?= etc.
This very important passage is the basis of Fleayâs theory of
identification discussed in section D. IV. of the Introduction.
The chief passages necessary for comparison are quoted below.


       A CELEBRATION OF CHARIS:

        In Ten Lyric Pieces.

                 V.

       His Discourse with Cupid.

      Noblest Charis, you that are
    Both my fortune and my star,
    And do govern more my blood,
    Than the various moon the flood,
    Hear, what late discourse of you,                                5
    Love and I have had; and true.
    âMongst my Muses finding me,
    Where he chanced your name to see
    Set, and to this softer strain;
    Sure, said he, if I have brain,                                 10
    This, here sung, can be no other,
    By description, but my Mother!
    So hath Homer praised her hair;
    So Anacreon drawn the air
    Of her face, and made to rise                                   15
    Just about her sparkling eyes,
    Both her brows bent like my bow.
    By her looks I do her know,
    Which you call my shafts. And see!
    Such my Motherâs blushes be,                                    20
    As the bath your verse discloses
    In her cheeks, of milk and roses;
    Such as oft I wanton in:
    And, above her even chin,
    Have you placed the bank of kisses,                             25
    Where, you say, men gather blisses,
    Ripenâd with a breath more sweet,
    Than when flowers and west-winds meet.
    Nay, her white and polishâd neck,
    With the lace that doth it deck,                                30
    Is my motherâs: hearts of slain
    Lovers, made into a chain!
    And between each rising breast,
    Lies the valley callâd my nest,
    Where I sit and proyne my wings                                 35
    After flight; and put new stings
    To my shafts: her very name
    With my motherâs is the same.
    I confess all, I replied,
    And the glass hangs by her side,                                40
    And the girdle âbout her waist,
    All is Venus, save unchaste.
    But alas, thou seest the least
    Of her good, who is the best
    Of her sex: but couldst thou, Love,                             45
    Call to mind the forms that strove
    For the apple, and those three
    Make in one, the same were she.
    For this beauty yet doth hide
    Something more than thou hast spied.                            50
    Outward grace weak love beguiles:
    She is Venus when she smiles:
    But sheâs Juno when she walks,
    And Minerva when she talks.


             UNDERWOODS XXXVI.

                _AN ELEGY_.

    By those bright eyes, at whose immortal fires
    Love lights his torches to inflame desires;
    By that fair stand, your forehead, whence he bends
    His double bow, and round his arrows sends;
    By that tan grove, your hair, whose globy rings                  5
    He flying curls, and crispeth with his wings;
    By those pure baths your either cheek discloses,
    Where he doth steep himself in milk and roses;
    And lastly, by your lips, the bank of kisses,
    Where men at once may plant and gather blisses:                 10
    Ten me, my lovâd friend, do you love or no?
    So well as I may tell in verse, âtis so?
    You blush, but do not:--friends are either none,
    Though they may number bodies, or but one.
    Iâll therefore ask no more, but bid you love,                   15
    And so that either may example prove
    Unto the other; and live patterns, how
    Others, in time, may love as we do now.
    Slip no occasion; as time stands not still,
    I know no beauty, nor no youth that will.                       20
    To use the present, then, is not abuse,
    You have a husband is the just excuse
    Of all that can be done him; such a one
    As would make shift to make himself alone
    That which we can; who both in you, his wife,                   25
    His issue, and all circumstance of life,
    As in his place, because he would not vary,
    Is constant to be extraordinary.


        THE GIPSIES METAMORPHOSED

    _Gip._ Help me, wonder, hereâs a book,                           2
    Where I would for ever look:
    Never yet did gipsy trace
    Smoother lines in hands or face:
    Venus here doth Saturn move                                      5
    That you should be Queen of Love;
    And the other stars consent;
    Only Cupidâs not content;
    For though you the theft disguise,
    You have robbâd him of his eyes.                                10
    And to shew his envy further:
    Here he chargeth you with murther:
    Says, although that at your sight,
    He must all his torches light;
    Though your either cheek discloses                              15
    Mingled baths of milk and roses;
    Though your lips be banks of blisses,
    Where he plants, and gathers kisses;
    And yourself the reason why,
    Wisest men for love may die;                                    20
    You will turn all hearts to tinder,
    And shall make the world one cinder.

            A CHALLENGE AT TILT,

                AT A MARRIAGE.

 _2 Cup._ What can I turn other than a Fury itself to see thy
impudence? If I be a shadow, what is substance? was it not I that
yesternight waited on the bride into the nuptial chamber, and,
against the bridegroom came, made her the throne of love? had I
not lighted my torches in her eyes, planted my motherâs roses in     5
her cheeks; were not her eye-brows bent to the fashion of my bow,
and her looks ready to be loosed thence, like my shafts? had I not
ripened kisses on her lips, fit for a Mercury to gather, and made
her language sweeter than his upon her tongue? was not the girdle
about her, he was to untie, my motherâs, wherein all the joys and   10
delights of love were woven?

  _1 Cup._ And did not I bring on the blushing bridegroom to taste
those joys? and made him think all stay a torment? did I not
shoot myself into him like a flame, and made his desires and his
graces equal? were not his looks of power to have kept the night    15
alive in contention with day, and made the morning never wished
for? Was there a curl in his hair, that I did not sport in, or a
ring of it crisped, that might not have become Junoâs fingers? his
very undressing, was it not Loveâs arming? did not all his kisses
charge? and every touch attempt? but his words, were they not       20
feathered from my wings, and flew in singing at her ears, like
arrows tipt with gold?

=2. 6. 72 These sister-swelling brests.= âThis is an
elegant and poetical rendering of the _sororiantes mammae_ of
the Latins, which Festus thus explains: _Sororiare puellarum
mammae dicuntur, cum primum tumescunt_.â--G.

=2. 6. 76 SN.= âLiberties very similar to these were, in the poetâs
time, permitted by ladies, who would have started at being told that
they had foregone all pretensions to delicacy.â--G.

The same sort of familiarity is hinted at in Stubbes, _Anatomy
of Abuses_ (Part 1, p. 78). Furnivall quotes _Histriomastix_
(Simpsonâs _School of Shak._ 2. 50) and _Vindication of Top
Knots_, Bagford Collection, 1. 124, in illustration of the
subject. Gossonâs _Pleasant Quippes_ (1595) speaks of âthese
naked paps, the Devils ginnes.â Cf. also _Cyn. Rev._, _Wks._
2. 266, and _Case is A._, _Wks._ 6. 330. It seems to have been
a favorite subject of attack at the hands of both Puritans and
dramatists.

=2. 6. 76 Downe to this valley.= Jonson uses a similar
figure in _Cyn. Rev._, _Wks._ 2. 240 and in _Charis_
(see note 2. 6. 57).

=2. 6. 78 these crisped groues.= So Milton, _Comus_, 984:
âAlong the crisped shades and bowers.â Herrick, _Hesper., Cerem.
Candlemas-Eve_: âThe crisped yew.â

=2. 6. 85 well tornâd.= Jonsonâs usual spelling. See
_Timber_, ed. Schelling, 64. 33; 76. 22. etc.

=2. 6. 85 Billyard ball.= Billiards appears to have been an
out-of-door game until the sixteenth century. It was probably
introduced into England from France. See J. A. Picton, _N. &
Q._. 5. 5. 283. Jonson uses this figure again in _Celeb. Charis_
9. 19-20.

than that.â--_Study of Ben Jonson_, p. 104.

=2. 6. 104 Have you seene.= Sir John Suckling (ed. 1874, p.
79) imitates this stanza:

    Hast thou seen the down in the air
        When wanton blasts have tossed it?
    Or the ship on the sea,
        When ruder winds have crossed it?
    Hast thou marked the crocodileâs weeping,
        Or the foxâs sleeping?
    Or hast viewed the peacock in his pride,
        Or the dove by his bride
        When he courts for his lechery?
    O, so fickle, O, so vain, O, so false, so false is she!

=2. 6. 104 a bright Lilly grow.= The figures of the lily, the snow,
and the swanâs down have already been used in _The Fox_, _Wks._ 3.
195. The source of that passage is evidently Martial, _Epig._ 1. 115:

    Loto candidior puella cygno,
    Argento, nive, lilio, ligustro.

In this place Jonson seems to have more particularly in mind _Epig._
5. 37:

    Puella senibus dulcior mibi cygnis ...
    Cui nec lapillos praeferas Erythraeos, ...
    Nivesque primas liliumque non tactum.

=2. 7. 2, 3 that Wit of man will doeât.= There is evidently
an ellipsis of some sort before _that_ (cf. Abbott, Â§284).
Perhaps âprovidedâ is to be understood.

=2. 7. 4 She shall no more be buzâd at.= The metaphor is
carried out in the words that follow, _sweet meates_ 5, _hum_
6, _flye-blowne_ 7. âFly-blownâ was a rather common term of
opprobrium. Cf. Dekker, _Satiromastix_, _Wks._ 1. 195: âShal
distaste euery vnsalted line, in their fly-blowne Comedies.â
Jonson is very fond of this metaphor, and presses it beyond all
endurance in _New Inn_, Act 2. Sc. 2, _Wks._ 5. 344, 5, etc.

=2. 7. 13 I am resoluâd onât, Sir.= See variants. Gifford
points out the quibble on the word _resolved_. See Gloss.

=2. 7. 17 O! I could shoote mine eyes at him.= Cf. _Fox_,
_Wks._ 3. 305: âThat I could shoot mine eyes at him, like
gun-stones!â

=2. 7. 22.= See variants. The _the_ is probably absorbed by
the preceding dental. Cf. 5. 7. 9.

=2. 7. 33 fine pacâd huishers.= See note 4. 4. 201.

=2. 7. 38 turnâd my good affection.= âNot diverted or
changed its course; but, as appears from what follows, soured
it. The word is used in a similar sense by Shakespeare:

    Has friendship such a faint and _milky_ heart,
    It turns in less than two nights!
                                     _Timon_, 3. 2.â--G.

=2. 8. 9, 10 That was your bed-fellow.= Ingine, perhaps in
anticipation of Fitzdottrelâs advancement, employs a term usually
applied to the nobility. Cf. _K. Henry V._ 2. 2. 8:

    Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,
    Whom he had cloyâd and gracâd with princely favors.

Steevens in a note on the passage points out that the familiar
appellation of _bedfellow_, which appears strange to us, was
common among the ancient nobility.â He quotes from _A Knack
to know a Knave_, 1594; _Look about you_, 1600; _Cynthiaâs
Revenge_, 1613; etc., where the expression is used in the sense
of âintimate companionâ and applied to nobles. Jonson uses the
term _chamberfellow_ in _Underwoods_, _Wks._ 8. 353.

=2. 8. 20 An Academy.= With this passage compare _U._ 62,
_Wks._ 8. 412:

                    --There is up of late
    The Academy, where the gallants meet--
    What! to make legs? yes, and to smell most sweet:
    All that they do at plays. O but first here
    They learn and study; and then practice there.

Jonson again refers to âthe Academiesâ (apparently schools of
deportment or dancing schools) in 3. 5. 33.

=2. 8. 33 Oracle-Foreman.= See note 1. 2. 2.

=2. 8. 59 any thing takes this dottrel.= See note 2. 2. 49-50.

=2. 8. 64 Dicke Robinson.= Collier says: âThis player may have
been an original actor in some of Shakespeareâs later dramas, and
he just outlived the complete and final suppression of the stage.â
His death and the date at which it occurred have been matters of
dispute.

His earliest appearance in any list of actors is at the end of
Jonsonâs _Catiline_, 1611, with the Kingâs Majestyâs Servants.
He was probably the youngest member of the company, and
doubtless sustained a female part. Gifford believes that he took
the part of Wittipol in the present play, though this is merely
a conjecture. âThe only female character he is known to have
filled is the lady of Giovanus in _The Second Maidenâs Tragedy_,
but at what date is uncertain; neither do we know at what period
he began to represent male characters.â Of the plays in which
he acted, Collier mentions Beaumont and Fletcherâs _Bonduca_,
_Double Marriage_, _Wife for a Month_, and _Wild Goose Chase_
(1621); and Websterâs _Duchess of Malfi_, 1622.

His name is found in the patent granted by James I. in 1619 and
in that granted by Charles I. in 1625. Between 1629 and 1647 no
notice of him occurs, and this is the last date at which we hear of
him. âHis name follows that of Lowin in the dedication to the folio
of Beaumont and Fletcherâs works, published at that time.â--Collier,
_Memoirs_, p. 268.

Jonson not infrequently refers to contemporary actors. Compare
the _Epitaph on Salathiel Pavy_, _Ep._ 120; the speech of Venus
in _The Masque of Christmas_, _Wks._ 7. 263; and the reference
to Field and Burbage in _Bart. Fair_ 5. 3.

=2. 8. 73 send frolicks!= â_Frolics_ are couplets,
commonly of an amatory or satirical nature, written on small
slips of paper, and wrapt round a sweetmeat. A dish of them is
usually placed on the table after supper, and the guests amuse
themselves with sending them to one another, as circumstances
seem to render them appropriate: this is occasionally productive
of much mirth. I do not believe that the game is to be found in
England; though the drawing on Twelfth Night may be thought to
bear some kind of coarse resemblance to it. On the continent I
have frequently been present at it.â--G.

The _NED._ gives only one more example, from R. H. _Arraignm._
_Whole Creature XIV._ Â§ 2. 244 (1631) âMoveable as Shittlecockes
... or as Frolicks at Feasts, sent from man to man, returning
againe at last, to the first man.â

=2. 8. 74, 5 burst your buttons, or not left you seame.=
Cf. _Bart. Fair_, _Wks._ 4. 359: âhe breaks his buttons,
and cracks seams at every saying he sobs out.â

=2. 8. 95, 103.= See variants.

=2. 8. 100 A Forrest moues not.= âI suppose Trains means,
âIt is in vain to tell him of venison and pheasant, the right
to the bucks in a whole forest will not move him.ââ--C.

=2. 8. 100 that forty pound.= See 3. 3. 148.

=2. 8. 102 your bond Of Sixe; and Statute of eight
hundred!= I. e., of six, and eight hundred pounds. âStatutes
merchant, statutes staple, and recognizances in the nature of
a statute staple were acknowledgements of debt made in writing
before officers appointed for that purpose, and enrolled of
record. They bound the lands of the debtor; and execution
was awarded upon them upon default in payment without the
ordinary process of an action. These securities were originally
introduced for the encouragement of trade, by providing a sure
and speedy remedy for the recovery of debts between merchants,
and afterwards became common assurances, but have now become
obsolete.â--S. M. Leake, _Law of Contracts_, p. 95.

Two of Pecuniaâs attendants in _The Staple of News_ are
_Statute_ and _Band_ (i. e. Bond, see _U._ 34).
The two words are often mentioned together. In Dekkerâs
_Bankrouts Banquet_ (_Non-dram. Wks._ 3. 371)
statutes are served up to the bankrupts.

Trains is evidently trying to impress Fitzdottrel with the
importance of Merecraftâs transactions.


ACT III.

=3. 1. 8 Innes of Court.= âThe four Inns of Court, Grayâs
Inn, Lincolnâs Inn, the Inner, and the Middle Temple, have alone
the right of admitting persons to practise as barristers, and
that rank can only be attained by keeping the requisite number
of terms as a student at one of those Inns.â--Wh-C.

Jonson dedicates _Every Man out of his Humor_ âTo the Noblest
Nurseries of Humanity and Liberty in the Kingdom, the Inns of Court.â

=3. 1. 10 a good man.= Gifford quotes _Merch. of Ven._
1. 3. 15: âMy meaning in saying he is a good man, is, to have
you understand me, that he is sufficient.â Marston, _Dutch
Courtesan_, _Wks._ 2. 57. uses the word in the same sense.

=3. 1. 20 our two Pounds, the Compters.= The London
Compters or Counters were two sheriffâs prisons for debtors,
etc., mentioned as early as the 15th century. In Jonsonâs day
they were the Poultry Counter and the Wood Street Counter. They
were long a standing joke with the dramatists, who seem to
speak from a personal acquaintance with them. Dekker (_Roaring
Girle_, _Wks._ 3. 189) speaks of âWood Street College,â and
Middleton (_Phoenix_, _Wks._ 1. 192) calls them âtwo most famous
universitiesâ and in another place âthe two city hazards,
Poultry and Wood Street.â Jonson in _Every Man in_ (_Wks._ 1.
42) speaks of them again as âyour city pounds, the countersâ,
and in _Every man out_ refers to the âMasterâs sideâ (_Wks_. 2.
181) and the âtwo-penny ward,â the designations for the cheaper
quarters of the prison.

=3. 1. 35 out of rerum natura.= _In rerum natura_ is a
phrase used by Lucretius 1. 25. It means, according to the
_Stanford Dictionary_, âin the nature of things, in the physical
universe.â In some cases it is practically equivalent to âin
existence.â Cf. _Sil. Wom._, _Wks._ 3. 382: âIs the bull, bear,
and horse, in _rerum natura_ still?â

=3. 2. 12 a long vacation.= The long vacation in the Inns
of Court, which Jonson had in mind, lasts from Aug. 13 to Oct.
23. In _Staple of News_, _Wks._ 5. 170, he makes a similar
thrust at the shop-keepers:

    Alas I they have had a pitiful hard time onât,
    A long vacation from their cozening.

=3. 2. 22 I bought Plutarchâs liues.= T. Northâs famous
translation first appeared in 1579. New editions followed in
1595, 1603, 1610-12, and 1631.

=3. 2. 33 Buy him a Captaines place.= The City Train Bands
were a constant subject of ridicule for the dramatists. They are
especially well caricatured by Fletcher in _The Knight of the
Burning Pestle_, Act 5. In addition to the City Train Bands,
the Fraternity of Artillery, now called The Honorable Artillery
Company, formed a separate organization. The place of practice
was the Artillery Garden in Bunhill Fields (see note 3. 2. 41).
In spite of ridicule the Train Bands proved a source of strength
during the Civil War (see Clarendon, _Hist. of the Rebellion_,
ed. 1826, 4. 236 and Wh-C., _Artillery Ground_).

Jonson was fond of poking fun at the Train Bands. Cf. _U._ 62,
_Wks._ 8. 409; _Ev. Man in_, _Wks._ 1. 88; and _Alchemist_,
_Wks._ 4. 13. Face, it will be remembered, had been âtranslated
suburb-captainâ through Subtleâs influence.

The immediate occasion of Jonsonâs satire was doubtless the
revival of military enthusiasm in 1614, of which Entick
(_Survey_ 2. 115) gives the following account:

âThe military genius of the _Londoners_ met with an opportunity,
about this time, to convince the world that they still retained the
spirit of their forefathers, should they be called out in the cause
of their king and country. His majesty having commanded a general
muster of the militia throughout the kingdom, the city of _London_
not only mustered 6000 citizens completely armed, who performed their
several evolutions with surprizing dexterity; but a martial spirit
appeared amongst the rising generation. The children endeavoured
to imitate their parents; chose officers, formed themselves into
companies, marched often into the fields with colours flying and beat
of drums, and there, by frequent practice, grew up expert in the
military exercises.â

=3. 2. 35 Cheapside.= Originally Cheap, or West Cheap, a street
between the Poultry and St. Paulâs, a portion of the line from
Charing Cross to the Royal Exchange, and from Holborn to the
Bank of England.

âAt the west end of this Poultrie and also of Buckles bury, beginneth
the large street of West Cheaping, a market-place so called, which
street stretcheth west till ye come to the little conduit by Pauleâs
Gate.â--Stow, ed. Thoms, p. 99.

The glory of Cheapside was Goldsmithâs Row (see note 3. 5. 2).
It was also famous in early times for its âRidings,â and during
Jonsonâs period for its âCross,â its âConduit,â and its âStandardâ
(see note 1. 1. 56 and Wh--C.).

=3. 2. 35 Scarfes.= âMuch worn by knights and military
officers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.â--PlanchÃ©.

=3. 2. 35 Cornehill.= Cornhill, between the Poultry and Leadenhall
Street, an important portion of the greatest thoroughfare in the
world, was, says Stow, âso called of a corn market time out of mind
there holden.â In later years it was provided with a pillory and
stocks, a prison, called the Tun, for street offenders, a conduit of
âsweet waterâ, and a standard. See Wh-C.

=3. 2. 38 the posture booke.= A book descriptive of military
evolutions, etc. H. Peachamâs _Compleat Gentleman_, 1627 (p. 300,
quoted by Wheatley, _Ev. Mall in_), gives a long list of âPostures of
the Musquetâ and G. Markhamâs _Souldierâs Accidence_ gives another.
Cf. _Tale Tub_, _Wks._ 6. 218:

                --All the postures
    Of the trainâd bands of the country.

=3. 2. 41 Finsbury.= In 1498, âcertain grounds, consisting of
gardens, orchards, &c. on the north side of _Chiswell-street_, and
called _Bunhill_ or _Bunhill-fields_, within the manor of _Finsbury_,
were by the mayor and commonalty of _London_, converted into a large
field, containing 11 acres, and 11 perches, now known by the name
of the _Artillery-ground_, for their train-bands, archers, and other
military citizens, to exercise in.â--Entick, _Survey_ 1. 441.

In 1610 the place had become neglected, whereupon commissioners were
appointed to reduce it âinto such order and state for the archers as
they were in the beginning of the reign of King Henry VIII.â (_Ibid._
2. 109). See also Stow, _Survey_, ed. Thoms, p. 159.

Dekker (_Shomakerâs Holiday_, _Wks._ 1. 29) speaks of being
âturnd to a Turk, and set in Finsburie for boyes to shoot atâ,
and Nash (_Pierce Pennilesse_, _Wks._ 2. 128) and Jonson (_Bart.
Fair_, _Wks._ 4. 507) make precisely similar references. Master
Stephen in _Every Man in_ (_Wks._ 1. 10) objects to keeping
company with the âarchers of Finsbury.â Cf. also the elaborate
satire in _U._ 62, (_Wks._ 8. 409).

=3. 2. 45          to traine the youth=
     =Of London, in the military truth.= Cf. _Underwoods_ 62:

    Thou seed-plot of the war! that hast not sparâd
    Powder or paper to bring up the youth
    Of London, in the military truth.

Gifford believes these lines to be taken from a contemporary
posture-book, but there is no evidence of quotation in the case
of _Underwoods_.

=3. 3. 22, 3       This comes of wearing=
=Scarlet, gold lace, and cut-works!= etc. Webster has a passage very
similar to this in the _Devilâs Law Case_, _Wks._ 2. 37 f.:

  â_Ari._ This comes of your numerous wardrobe.
  _Rom._ Ay, and wearing cut-work, a pound a purl.
  _Ari._ Your dainty embroidered stockings, with overblown roses,
              to hide your gouty ankles.
  _Rom._ And wearing more taffata for a garter, than would serve
              the galley dung-boat for streamers....
  _Rom._ And resorting to your whore in hired velvet with a
              spangled copper fringe at her netherlands.
  _Ari._ Whereas if you had stayed at Padua, and fed upon cow-trotters,
              and fresh beef to supper.â etc., etc.

For âcut-worksâ see note 1. 1. 128.

=3. 3. 24 With your blowne roses.= Compare 1. 1. 127,
and B. & Fl., _Cupidâs Revenge_:

    No man to warm your shirt, and blow your roses.

and Jonson, _Ep._ 97, _Wks._ 8. 201:

    His rosy ties and garters so oâerblown.

=3. 3. 25 Godwit.= The godwit was formerly in great repute as a table
delicacy. Thomas Muffett in _Healthâs Improvement_, p. 99, says:
âA fat godwit is so fine and light meat, that noblemen (yea, and
merchants too, by your leave) stick not to buy them at four nobles a
dozen.â

Cf. also Sir T. Browne, _Norf. Birds_, _Wks._, 1835, 4. 319: God-wyts
... accounted the daintiest dish in England; and, I think, for the
bigness of the biggest price.â Jonson mentions the godwit in this
connection twice in the _Sil. Wom._ (_Wks._ 3. 350 and 388), and
in Horace, _Praises of a Country Life_ (_Wks._ 9. 121) translates
âattagen Ionicusâ by âIonian godwit.â

=3. 3. 26 The Globes, and Mermaides!= Theatres and taverns. Mr.
Halliwell-Phillipps has proved that the Globe Theatre on the
Bankside, Southwark, the summer theatre of Shakespeare and his
fellows, was built in 1599. It was erected from materials brought
by Richard Burbage and Peter Street from the theatre in Shoreditch.
On June 29, 1613, it was destroyed by fire, but was rebuilt without
delay in a superior style, and this time with a roof of tile, King
James contributing to the cost. Chamberlaine, writing to Alice
Carleton (June 30, 1614), calls the Globe Playhouse âthe fairest in
England.â It was pulled down Apr. 15, 1644.

Only the Lord Chamberlainâs Company (the Kingâs Men) seems to
have acted here. It was the scene of several of Shakespeareâs
plays and two of Jonsonâs, _Every Man out_ and _Every Man in_
(Halliwell-Phillips, _Illustrations_, p. 43). The term âsummer
theatreâ is applicable only to the rebuilt theatre (_ibid._, p.
44). In _Ev. Man out_ (quarto, _Wks._ 2. 196) Johnson refers to
âthis fair-fitted _Globe_â, and in the _Execration upon Vulcan_
(_Wks._ 8. 404) to the burning of the âGlobe, the glory of the
Bank.â In _Poetaster_ (_Wks._ 2. 430) he uses the word again
as a generic term: âyour Globes, and your Triumphs.â

There seem to have been two Mermaid Taverns, one of which stood
in Bread Street with passage entrances from Cheapside and Friday
Street, and the other in Cornhill. They are often referred to
by the dramatists. Cf. the famous lines written by _Francis
Beaumont to Ben Jonson_, B. & Fl., _Wks._, ed. 1883, 2. 708;
_City Match_, _O. Pl._ 9. 334, etc. Jonson often mentions
the Mermaid. Cf. _Inviting a Friend_, _Wks._ 8. 205:

    Is a pure cup of rich Canary Wine,
    Which is the Mermaidâs now, but shall be mine.

_On the famous Voyage_, _Wks._ 8. 234:

    At Bread-Streetâs Mermaid having dined, and merry,
    Proposed to go to Holborn in a wherry.

_Bart. Fair_, _Wks._ 4. 356-7: âyour Three Cranes, Mitre,
 and Mermaid-men!â

=3. 3. 28 In veluet!= Velvet was introduced into England in the
fifteenth century, and soon became popular as an article of luxury
(see Hillâs _Hist. of Eng. Dress_ 1. 145 f.).

=3. 3. 30 Iâ the Low-countries.= âThen went he to the Low Countries;
but returning soone he betook himself to his wonted studies. In his
service in the Low Countries, he had, in the face of both the campes,
killed ane enemie and taken _opima spolia_ from him.â--_Conversations
with William Drummond_, _Wks._ 9. 388.

In the Epigram _To True Soldiers_ Jonson says:

                                        --I love
    Your great profession, which I once did prove.
                                                _Wks._ 8. 211.

=3. 3. 32 a wench of a stoter!= See variants. The word is
not perfectly legible in the folios, which I have consulted, but
is undoubtedly as printed. Cunningham believes âstoterâ to be a
cheap coin current in the camps. This supplies a satisfactory
sense, corresponding to the â_Sutlers_ wife, ... of two blanksâ
in the following line.

=3. 3. 33 of two blanks!= âJonson had Horace in his
thoughts, and has, not without some ingenuity, parodied several
loose passages of one of his satires.â--G. Gifford is apparently
referring to the close of Bk. 2. Sat. 3.

=3. 3. 51 vn-to-be-melted.= Cf. _Every Man in_, _Wks._ 1.
36: âand in un-in-one-breath-utterable skill, sir.â _New Inn_,
_Wks._ 5. 404: you shewed a neglect Un-to-be-pardonâd.â

=3. 3. 62 Master of the Dependances!= See Introduction.
pp. lvi, lvii.

=3. 3. 69 the roaring manner.= Gifford defines it as the âlanguage
of bullies affecting a quarrelâ (_Wks._ 4. 483). The âRoaring Boyâ
continued under various designations to infest the streets of London
from the reign of Elizabeth until the beginning of the eighteenth
century. Spark (Somerâs _Tracts_ 2. 266) says that they were persons
prodigall and of great expence, who having runne themselves
into debt, were constrained to run into factions to defend themselves
from danger of the law.â He adds that divers of the nobility
afforded them maintenance, in return for which âthey entered into
many desperate enterprises.â

Arthur Wilson (_Life of King James I._, p. 28), writing of the
disorderly state of the city in 1604, says: âDivers _Sects_ of
_vitious Persons_ going under the Title of _Roaring Boyes_,
_Bravadoes_, _Roysters_, &c. commit many insolences; the Streets
swarm night and day with bloody quarrels, private _Duels_
fomented,â etc.

Kastril, the âangry boyâ in the _Alchemist_, and Val Cutting and
Knockem in _Bartholomew Fair_ are roarers, and we hear of them
under the title of âterrible boysâ in the _Silent Woman_
(_Wks._ 3. 349). Cf. also Sir Thomas Overburyâs _Character of a
Roaring Boy_ (ed. Morley, p. 72): âHe sleeps with a tobacco-pipe
in his mouth; and his first prayer in the morning is he may
remember whom he fell out with over night.â

=3. 3. 71 the vapours.= This ridiculous practise is
satirized in _Bart. Fair_, _Wks._ 4. 3 (see also stage
directions).

=3. 3. 77 a distast.= The quarrel with Wittipol.

=3. 3. 79 the hand-gout.= Jonson explains the expression in
_Magnetic Lady_, _Wks._ 6. 61.

    You cannot but with trouble put your hand
    Into your pocket to discharge a reckoning,
    And this we sons of physic do call _chiragra_,
    A kind of cramp, or hand-gout.

Cf. also Overburyâs _Characters_, ed. Morley, p. 63: âhis liberality
can never be said to be gouty-handed.â

=3. 3. 81 Mint.= Until its removal to the Royal Mint on Tower
Hill in 1810, the work of coinage was carried on in the Tower of
London. Up to 1640, when banking arose, merchants were in the habit
of depositing their bullion and cash in the Tower Mint, under
guardianship of the Crown (see Wh-C. under _Royal Mint_, and _History
of Banking in all the Leading Nations_, London, 1896, 2. 1).

=3. 3. 86-8 let ... hazard.= Merecraft seems to mean: âYou are in no
hurry. Pray therefore allow me to defer your business until I have
brought opportune aid to this gentlemanâs distresses at a time when
his fortunes are in a hazardous condition.â The pregnant use of the
verb _timing_ and the unusual use of the word _terms_ for a period of
time render the meaning peculiarly difficult.

=3. 3. 106 a Businesse.= This was recognized as the technical
expression. Sir Thomas Overbury ridicules it in his _Characters_,
ed. Morley, p. 72: âIf any private quarrel happen among our great
courtiers, he (the Roaring Boy) proclaims the business--thatâs the
word, the business--as if the united force of the Roman Catholics
were making up for Germany.â Jonson ridicules the use of the
word in similar fashion in the Masque of _Mercury Vindicated from
the Alchemists_.

=3. 3. 133 hauings.= Jonson uses the expression again in _Ev. Man
in_, _Wks._ 1. 29, and _Gipsies Met._, _Wks._ 7. 364. It
is also used in _Museâs Looking Glasse_, _O. Pl._ 9. 175.

=3. 3. 147 such sharks!= Shift in _Ev. Man in_ is described as a
âthreadbare shark.â Cf. also Earle, _Microcosmography_, ed. Morley,
p. 173.

=3. 3. 148 an old debt of forty.= See 2. 8. 100.

=3. 3. 149 the Bermudas.= See note 2. 1. 144. Nares thinks that
the real Bermudas are referred to here.

=3. 3. 155 You shall haâ twenty pound onât.= As Commission on
the two hundred. âTen in the hundredâ was the customary rate at
this period (see _Staple of News_, _Wks._ 5. 189).

=3. 3. 165 St. Georges-tide?= From a very early period the 23d of
April was dedicated to St. George. From the time of Henry V. The
festival had been observed with great splendor at Windsor and other
towns, and bonfires were built (see Shak, _1 Henry VI._ 1. 1). The
festival continued to be celebrated until 1567, when Elizabeth
ordered its discontinuance. James I., however, kept the 23d of April
to some extent, and the revival of the feast in all its glories was
only prevented by the Civil War. So late as 1614 it was the custom
for fashionable gentlemen to wear blue coats on St. Georgeâs Day,
probably in imitation of the blue mantle worn by the Knights of the
Garter, an order created at the feast of St. George in 1344 (see
Chambersâ _Book of Days_ 1. 540).

The passages relating to this custom are _Ram Alley_, _O. Pl._, 2d
ed., 5. 486:

    By Dis, I will be knight,
    Wear a blue coat on great St. Georgeâs day,
    And with my fellows drive you all from Paulâs
    For this attempt.

_Runne and a great Cast_, _Epigr._ 33:

    Withâs coram nomine keeping greater sway
    Than a court blew-coat on St. Georgeâs day.

From these passages Nares concludes âthat some festive ceremony was
carried on at St. Paulâs on St. Georgeâs day annually; that the court
attended; that the _blue-coats_, or attendants, of the courtiers,
were employed and authorised to keep order, and drive out refractory
persons; and that on this occasion it was proper for a knight to
officiate as _blue coat_ to some personage of higher rankâ.

In the _Conversations with Drummond_, Jonsonâs _Wks._ 9. 393, we
read: âNorthampton was his mortal enimie for beating, on a St.
Georgeâs day, one of his attenders.â Pepys speaks of there being
bonfires in honor of St. Georgeâs Day as late as Apr. 23, 1666.

=3. 3. 166 chaines? PLV. Of gold, and pearle.= The gold chain was
formerly a mark of rank and dignity, and a century before this it
had been forbidden for any one under the degree of a gentleman of two
hundred marks a year to wear one (_Statutes of the Realm_, 7 Henry
VIII. c. 6). They were worn by the Lord Mayors (Dekker, _Shomakerâs
Holiday_, _Wks._ 1. 42), rich merchants and aldermen (Glapthorne,
_Wit for a Constable_, _Wks._, ed. 1874, 1. 201-3), and later
became the distinctive mark of the upper servant in a great family,
especially the steward (see Nares and _Ev. Man out_, _Wks._ 2. 31).
Massinger (_City Madam_, _Wks._, p. 334) speaks of wearing a chain
of gold âon solemn days.â With the present passage cf. _Underwoods_
62, _Wks._ 8. 410:

    If they stay here but till St. Georgeâs day.
    All ensigns of a war are not yet dead,
    Nor marks of wealth so from a nation fled,
    But they may see gold chains and pearl worn then,
    Lent by the London dames to the Lordsâ men.

=3. 3. 170 take in Pimlico.= âNear Hoxton, a great summer resort in
the early part of the 17th century and famed for its cakes, custards,
and Derby ale. The references to the Hoxton Pimlico are numerous
in our old dramatists.â--Wh--C. It is mentioned among other places
in _Greeneâs Tu Quoque, The City Match_, fol. 1639, _News from
Hogsdon_, 1598, and Dekker, _Roaring Girle_, _Wks._ 3. 219, where it
is spoken of as âthat nappy land of spice-cakes.â In 1609 a tract
was published, called _Pimlyco or Runne Red-Cap, âtis a Mad World at
Hogsdon_.

Jonson refers to it repeatedly. Cf. _Alch._, _Wks._ 4. 155:

                              --Gallants, men and women.
    And of all sorts, tag-rag, been seen to flock here,
    In threaves, these ten weeks, as to a second Hogsden,
    In days of Pimlico and Eye-bright.

Cf. also _Alch._, _Wks._ 4. 151; _Bart. Fair_, _Wks._ 4. 357; and
this play 4. 4. 164. In _Underwoods_ 62 the same expression is used
as in this passage:

    What a strong fort old Pimlico had been!
    How it held out! how, last, âtwas taken in!--

_Take in_ in the sense of âcaptureâ is used again in _Every Man
in_, _Wks._ 1. 64, and frequently in Shakespeare (see Schmidt).
The reference here, as Cunningham suggests, is to the Finsbury
sham fights. Hogsden was in the neighborhood of Finsbury, and
the battles were doubtless carried into its territory.

=3. 3. 173 Some Bristo-stone or Cornish counterfeit.= Cf.
Heywood, _Wks._ 5. 317: âThis jewell, a plaine _Bristowe_ stone,
a counterfeit.â See Gloss.

=3. 3. 184, 5                      I know your Equiuocks:=
=Youâare growne the better Fathers of âhem oâ late.= âSatirically
reflecting on the Jesuits, the great patrons of _equivocation_.â--W.

âOr rather on the Puritans, I think; who were sufficiently obnoxious
to this charge. The Jesuits would be out of place here.â--G.

Why the Puritans are any more appropriate Gifford does not vouchsafe
to tell us. So far as I have been able to discover the Puritans
were never called âFathers,â their regular appellation being âthe
brethrenâ (cf. _Alch._ and _Bart. Fair_). The Puritans were accused
of a distortion of Scriptural texts to suit their own purposes,
instances of which occur in the dramas mentioned above. On the whole,
however, equivocation is more characteristic of the Jesuits. They
were completely out of favor at this time. Under the generalship
of Claudio Acquaviva, 1581-1615, they first began to have a
preponderatingly evil reputation. In 1581 they were banished from
England, and in 1601 the decree of banishment was repeated, this time
for their suspected share in the Gunpowder Plot.

=3. 3. 206, 7 Come, giâ me Ten pieces more.= The transaction with
Guilthead is perhaps somewhat confusing. Fitzdottrel has offered to
give his bond for two hundred pieces, if necessary. Merecraftâs âold
debt of fortyâ (3. 3. 149), the fifty pieces for the ring, and the
hundred for Everillâs new office (3. 3. 60 and 83) âall but make two
hundred.â Fitzdottrel furnishes a hundred of this in cash, with the
understanding that he receive it again of the gold-smith when he
signs the bond (3. 3. 194). He returns, however, without the gold,
though he seals the bond (3. 5. 1-3). Of the hundred pieces received
in cash, twenty go to Guilthead as commission (3. 3. 155).
This leaves forty each for Merecraft and Everill.

=3. 3. 213 how thâ Asse made his diuisions.= See _Fab._ cix,
_Fabulae Aesopicae_, Leipzig, 1810, _Leo, Asinus et Vulpes_. Harsnet
(_Declaration_, p. 110) refers to this fable, and Dekker made a
similar application in _Match me in London_, 1631, _Wks._ 4. 145:

        _King._ Father Ile tell you a Tale, vpon a time
    The Lyon Foxe and silly Asse did jarre.
    Grew friends and what they got, agreed to share:
    A prey was tane, the bold Asse did diuide it
    Into three equall parts, the Lyon spyâd it.
    And scorning two such sharers, moody grew,
    And pawing the Asse, shooke him as I shake you ...
    And in rage tore him peece meale, the Asse thus dead,
    The prey was by the Foxe distributed
    Into three parts agen; of which the Lyon
    Had two for his share, and the Foxe but one:
    The Lyon (smiling) of the Foxe would know
    Where he had this wit, he the dead Asse did show.
       _Valasc._ An excellent Tale.
       _King._ Thou art that Asse.

=3. 3. 214 Much good do you.= So in _Sil. Wom._, _Wks._ 3.
398: âMuch good do him.â

=3. 3. 217 And coozen iâ your bullions.= Massingerâs _Fatal
Dowry_, _Wks._, p. 272, contains the following passage:
âThe other is his dressing-block, upon whom my lord lays all his
clothes and fashions ere he vouchsafes them his own person:
you shall see him ... at noon in the Bullion,â etc. In a note
on this passage (_Wks._ 3. 390, ed. 1813) Gifford advanced the
theory that the _bullion_ was âa piece of finery, which derived
its denomination from the large globular gilt buttons, still in
use on the continent.â In his note on the present passage, he
adds that it was probably âadopted by gamblers and others, as a
mark of wealth, to entrap the unwary.â

Nares was the next man to take up the word. He connected it with
â_bullion_; Copper-plates set on the Breast-leathers and Bridles
of Horses for ornamentâ (Phillips 1706). âI suspect that it also
meant, in colloquial use, copper lace, tassels, and ornaments in
imitation of gold. Hence contemptuously attributed to those who
affected a finery above their station.â

Dyce (B. & Fl., _Wks._ 7. 291) was the first to disconnect the
word from _bullion_ meaning uncoined gold or silver. He says:
â_Bullions_, I apprehend, mean some sort of hose or breeches,
which were _bolled_ or _bulled_, i. e. swelled, puffed out
(cf. _Sad. Shep._, Act 1. Sc. 2, _bulled_ nosegaysâ).â

The _NED._ gives âprob. a. F. _bouillon_ in senses derived from
that of âbubble.ââ

Besides the passages already given, the word occurs in B. & Fl.,
_The Chances_, _Wks._ 7. 291:

    Why should not bilbo raise him, or a pair of bullions?

_Beggarâs Bush_, _Wks._ 9. 81:

    In his French doublet, with his blisterâd
    (1st fol. _basterâd_) bullions.

Brome, _Sparagus Garden_, _Wks._ 3. 152:

                            --shaking your
    Old Bullion Tronkes over my Trucklebed.

_Gesta Gray_ in Nicholsâ _Prog. Q. Eliz._ 3. 341 A, 1594:
âA bullion-hose is best to go a woeing in; for tis full of
promising promontories.â

=3. 3. 231 too-too-vnsupportable!= This reduplicated
form is common in Shakespeare. See _Merch. of Ven._ 2. 6.
42; _Hamlet_ 1. 2. 129; and Schmidt, _Dict._ Jonson uses it
in _Sejanus_, _Wks._ 3. 54, and elsewhere. It is merely a
strengthened form of _too_. (See Halliwell in _Sh. Soc. Papers_,
1884, 1. 39, and _Hamlet_, ed. Furness, 11th ed., 1. 41.) Jonson
regularly uses the hyphen.

=3. 4. 13 Cioppinos.= Jonson spells the word as if it were
Italian, though he says in the same sentence that the custom of
wearing chopines is Spanish. The _NED._, referring to Skeat,
_Trans. Phil. Soc._, 1885-7, p. 79, derives it from Sp. _chapa_,
a plate of metal, etc. âThe Eng. writers c 1600 persistently
treated the word as Italian, even spelling it _cioppino_, pl.
_cioppini_, and expressly associated it with Venice, so that,
although not recorded in Italian Dicts. it was app. temporarily
fashionable there.â The statement of the _NED._ that âthere is
little or no evidence of their use in England (except on the
stage)â seems to be contradicted by the quotation from Stephen
Gossonâs _Pleasant Quippes_ (note 1. 1. 128). References to the
chopine are common in the literature of the period (see Nares
and _NED._). I have found no instances of the Italianated form
earlier than Jonson, and it may be original with him. He uses
the plural _cioppini_ in _Cynthiaâs Revels_, _Wks._ 2. 241.
See note 4. 4. 69.

=3. 4. 32 your purchase.= Cf. _Alch._, _Wks._ 4. 150, and
_Fox_, _Wks._ 3. 168: âthe cunning purchase of my wealth.â
Cunningham (_Wks._ 3. 498) says: âPurchase, as readers of
Shakespeare know, was a cant term among thieves for the plunder
they acquired, also the act of acquiring it. It is frequently
used by Jonson.â

=3. 4. 35 Proâuedor.= Giffordâs change to provedorÃ©
is without authority. The word is _provedor_, Port., or
_proveedor_, Sp., and is found in Hakluyt, _Voyages_, 3. 701;
G. Sandys, _Trav._, p. 6 (1632); and elsewhere, with various
orthography, but apparently never with the accent.

=3. 4. 43 Gentleman huisher.= For the gentleman-usher see
note 4. 4. 134. The forms _usher_ and _huisher_ seem to be used
without distinction. The editorsâ treatment of the form is
inconsistent. See variants, and compare 2. 7. 33.

=3. 4. 45-8 wee poore Gentlemen ... piece.= Cf. Webster,
_Devilâs Law Case_, _Wks._ 2. 38: âYou have certain rich city
chuffs, that when they have no acres of their own, they will go
and plough up fools, and turn them into excellent meadow.â Also
_The Fox_ 2. 1:

                        --if Italy
    Have any glebe more fruitful than these fellows,
    I am deceived.

As source of the latter Dr. L. H. Holt (_Mod. Lang. Notes_,
June, 1905) gives Plautus, _Epidicus_ 2. 3. 306-7:

    nullum esse opinor ego agrum in agro Attico
    aeque feracem quam hic est noster Periphanes.

=3. 5. 2 the row.= Stow (_Survey_, ed. 1633, p. 391) says that
Goldsmithâs Row, âbetwixt _Breadstreete_ end and the Crosse in
_Cheap_,â is âthe most beautifull Frame of faire houses and shops,
that be within the Wals of _London_, or elsewhere in England.â It
contained âten faire dwelling houses, and fourteene shopsâ beautified
with elaborate ornamentation. Howes (ed. 1631, p. 1045) says that
at his time (1630) Goldsmithâs Row âwas much abated of her wonted
store of Goldsmiths, which was the beauty of that famous streete.â
A similar complaint is made in the _Calendar of State Papers_,
1619-23, p. 457, where Goldsmithâs Row is characterized as the âglory
and beauty of Cheapside.â Paul Hentzner (p. 45) speaks of it as
surpassing all the other London streets. He mentions the presence
there of a âgilt tower, with a fountain that plays.â

=3. 5. 29, 30                           answering=
   =With the French-time, in flexure of your body.= This may mean
bowing in the deliberate and measured fashion of the French, or
perhaps it refers to French musical measure. See Gloss.

=3. 5. 33 the very Academies.= See note 2. 8. 20.

=3. 5. 35 play-time.= Collier says that the usual hour of dining in
the city was twelve oâclock, though the passage in _Case is Altered_,
_Wks._ 6. 331, seems to indicate an earlier hour:

    Eat when your stomach serves, saith the physician,
    Not at eleven and six.

The performance of plays began at three oâclock.
Cf. _Histriomastix_, 1610:

    Come to the Town-house, and see a play:
    At three aâclock it shall begin.

See Collier, _Annals_ 3. 377. Sir Humphrey Mildmay, in his Ms.
Diary (quoted _Annals_ 2. 70), speaks several times of going to
the play-house after dinner.

=3. 5. 39 his Damme.= _NED._ gives a use of the phrase âthe
devil and his damâ as early as Piers Plowman, 1393. The âdevilâs
damâ was later applied opprobriously to a woman. It is used thus
in Shakespeare, _Com. Err._ 4. 3. 51. The expression is common
throughout the literature of the period.

=3. 5. 43 But to be seene to rise, and goe away.= Cf.
Dekker, _Guls Horne-booke_, _Non-dram. Wks._ 2. 253: âNow sir,
if the writer be a fellow that hath either epigrammd you, or
hath had a flirt at your mistris, ... you shall disgrace him
worse then by tossing him in a blancket ... if, in the middle of
his play, ... you rise with a screwd and discontented face from
your stoole to be gone: no matter whether the Scenes be good or
no; the better they are the worse do you distast them.â

=3. 5. 45, 6     But say, that he be one=,
    Wiâ not be awâd! but laugh at you=. In the Prologue to Massingerâs
_Guardian_ we find:

                    --nor dares he profess that when
    The critics laugh, heâll laugh at them agen.
    (Strange self-love in a writer!)

Gifford says of this passage: âThis Prologue contains many sarcastick
allusions to Old Ben, who produced, about this time, his _Tale of a
Tub_, and his _Magnetic Lady_, pieces which failed of success, and
which, with his usual arrogance, (_strange self-love in a writer!_)
he attributed to a want of taste in the audience.â--Massingerâs
(_Wks._, ed. 1805, 4. 121.)

The _Guardian_ appeared in 1633, two years after the printing of
_The Devil is an Ass_. It seems certain that the reference is to the
present passage.

=3. 5. 47 pay for his dinner himselfe.= The custom of inviting the
poet to dinner or supper seems to have been a common one. Dekker
refers to it in the _Guls Horne-booke_, _Non-dram. Wks._ 2. 249. Cf.
also the Epilogue to the present play.

=3. 5. 47 Perhaps, He would doe that twice, rather then thanke you.=
âThis ill-timed compliment to himself, Jonson might have spared, with
some advantage to his judgment, at least, if not his modesty.â--G.

=3. 5. 53.= See variants. Giffordâs change destroys the
meaning and is palpably ridiculous.

=3. 5. 77 your double cloakes.= âI. e., a cloake adapted
for disguises, which might be worn on either side. It was of
different colours, and fashions. This turned cloke with a false
beard (of which the cut and colour varied) and a black or yellow
peruke, furnished a ready and effectual mode of concealment,
which is now lost to the stage. â--G.

=3. 6. 2 canst thou get neâr a bird?= Throughout this page
Merecraft and Pug ring the changes on Pitfallâs name.

=3. 6. 15, 16 TRA.    You must send, Sir.=
                 =The Gentleman the ring.= Traines, of course,
is merely carrying out Merecraftâs plot to âachieve the ringâ (3. 5.
67). Later (4. 4. 60) Merecraft is obliged to give it up to Wittipol.

=3. 6. 34-6     Whatâll you do, Sir?= ...
     =Run from my flesh, if I could.= For a similar construction
cf. 1. 3. 21 and note.

=3. 6. 38, 9  Woe to the seuerall cudgells,=
                =Must suffer on this backe!= Adapted from Plautus,
_Captivi_ 3. 4. 650:

    Vae illis uirgis miseris, quae hodie in tergo morientur meo.

(Gifford mentions the fact that this is adapted from the classics. I
am indebted for the precise reference to Dr. Lucius H. Holt.)

=3. 6. 40 the vse of it is so present.= For other Latinisms cf.
_resume_, 1. 6. 149; _salts_, 2. 6. 75; _confute_, 5. 6. 18, etc.

=3. 6. 61 Iâll= ... See variants. The original reading is undoubtedly
wrong.


ACT IV

=4. 1. 1 referring to Commissioners.= In the lists of
patents we frequently read of commissions specially appointed
for examination of the patent under consideration. The Kingâs
seal was of course necessary to render the grant valid.

=4. 1. 5 S^r. Iohn Monie-man.= See Introduction, p. lxxiii.

=4. 1. 37 I will haue all piecâd.= Cf. _Mag. La._,
_Wks._ 6. 50:

    _Item._ I heard they were out.
    _Nee._ But they are pieced, and put together again.

=4. 1. 38 ill solderâd!= Cf. _The Forest_, 12,
_Epistle to Elizabeth_, etc.; âSolders cracked friendship.â

=4. 2. 11 Haue with âhem.= âAn idea borrowed from the gaming
table, being the opposite of âhave at them.ââ--C.

=4. 2. 11 the great Carroch.= See note 1. 6. 214.

=4. 2. 12 with my Ambler, bare.= See note 4. 4. 202.

=4. 2. 22 I not loue this.= See note 1. 6. 14.

=4. 2. 26 Tooth-picks.= This was an object of satire to the
dramatists of the period. Nares says that they âappear to have been
first brought into use in Italy; whence the travellers who had
visited that country, particularly wished to exhibit that symbol
of gentility.â It is referred to as the mark of a traveller by
Shakespeare, _King John_, 1. 1 (cited by Gifford):

                        --Now your traveller,
    He, and his tooth-pick, at my worshipâs mess.

Overbury (_Character_ of _An Affected Traveller_, ed. Morley, p. 35)
speaks of the _pick-tooth_ as âa main part of his behavior.â

It was also a sign of foppery. Overbury (p. 31) describes the
courtier as wearing âa pick-tooth in his hat,â and Massinger, _Grand
Duke of Florence_, Act 3 (quoted by Nares), mentions âmy case of
tooth-picks, and my silver forkâ among the articles ârequisite to the
making up of a signior.â John Earle makes a similar reference in his
_Character_ of _An Idle Gallant_ (ed. Morley, p. 179), and Furnivall
(Stubbesâ _Anatomy_, p. 77) quotes from _Laugh and lie downe_: or
_The worldes Folly_, London, 1605, 4to: âThe next was a nimble-witted
and glib-tonguâd fellow, who, having in his youth spent his wits in
the Arte of love, was now become the jest of wit.... The picktooth in
the mouth, the flower in the eare, the brush upon the beard; ... and
what not that was unneedefull,â etc.

It is a frequent subject of satire in Jonson. Cf. _Ev. Man out_, _Wks._
2. 124; _Cyn. Rev._, _Wks._ 2. 218, 248; _Fox_, _Wks._ 3. 266. See also
Dekker, _Wks._ 3. 280.

=4. 2. 63 What vile Fucus is this.= The abuse of face-painting is
a favorite subject of satire with the moralists and dramatists of
the period. Stubbes (_Anatomy of Abuses_, Part 1, pp. 64-8) devotes
a long section to the subject. Dr. Furnivall in the notes to this
passage, pp. 271-3, should also be consulted. Brome satirizes it in
the _City Wit_, _Wks._ 2. 300. Lady Politick Would-be in the _Fox_
is of course addicted to the habit, and a good deal is said on the
subject in _Epicoene_. Dekker (_West-ward Hoe_, _Wks._ 2. 285) has
a passage quite similar in spirit to Jonsonâs satire.

=4. 2. 71 the very Infanta of the Giants!= Cf. Massinger and Field,
_Fatal Dowry_ 4. 1: âO that I were the infanta queen of Europe!â
Pecunia in the _Staple of News_ is called the âInfanta of the
mines.â Spanish terms were fashionable at this time. Cf. the use of
_Grandees_, 1. 3. It is possible that the reference here is to the
Infanta Maria. See Introduction, p. xviii.

=4. 3. 5, 6 It is the manner of Spaine, to imbrace onely, Neuer to
kisse.= Cf. Minsheuâs _Pleasant and Delightfull Dialogues,_ pp. 51-2:
â_W._ I hold that the greatest cause of dissolutenesse in some women
in England is this custome of kissing publikely.... _G._ In Spaine
doe not men vse to kisse women? _I._ Yes the husbands kisse their
wiues, but as if it were behinde seuen walls, where the very light
cannot see them.â

=4. 3. 33 f. Decayes the fore-teeth, that should guard the tongue;=
etc. Cf. _Timber_, ed. Schelling, 13. 24: âIt was excellently said of
that philosopher, that there was a wall or parapet of teeth set in
our mouth, to restrain the petulancy of our words; that the rashness
of talking should not only be retarded by the guard and watch of our
heart, but be fenced in and defended by certain strengths placed in
the mouth itself, and within the lips.â

Professor Schelling quotes Plutarch, _Moralia, de Garrulitate_ 3,
translated by Goodwin: âAnd yet there is no member of human bodies
that nature has so strongly enclosed within a double fortification
as the tongue, entrenched within a barricade of sharp teeth, to the
end that, if it refuses to obey and keep silent when reason âpresses
the glittering reinsâ within, we should fix our teeth in it till the
blood comes rather than suffer inordinate and unseasonable dinâ (4.
223).

=4. 3. 39 Mad-dames.= See variants. The editors have taken out of
the jest whatever salt it possessed, and have supplied meaningless
substitutes. Gifford followed the same course in his edition of Ford
(see Fordâs _Wks._ 2. 81), where, however, he changes to Mad-dam.
Such gratuitous corruptions are inexplicable. Cf. _Tale Tub_, _Wks._
6. 172:

    Here is a strange thing callâd a lady, a mad-dame.

=4. 3. 45 Their seruants.= A common term for a lover.
Cf. _Sil. Wom._, _Wks._ 3. 364.

=4. 3. 51.= See variants. There are several mistakes in the
assignment of speeches throughout this act. Not all of Giffordâs
changes, however, are to be accepted without question. Evidently,
if the question _where?_ is to be assigned to Wittipol, the first
speech must be an aside, as it is inconceivable that Merecraft should
introduce Fitzdottrel first under his own name, and then as the
âDuke of Drownâd-land.â

My conception of the situation is this: Pug is playing the part
of gentleman usher. He enters and announces to Merecraft that
Fitzdottrel and his wife are coming. Merecraft whispers: âMaster
Fitzdottrel and his wife! where?â and then, as they enter, turns to
Wittipol and introduces them; âMadame,â etc.

=4. 4. 30 Your Allum Scagliola=, etc. Many of the words in this
paragraph are obscure, and a few seem irrecoverable. Doubtless Jonson
picked them up from various medical treatises and advertisements
of his day. I find no trace of _Abezzo_, which may of course be a
misprint for Arezzo. The meanings assigned to _Pol-dipedra_ and
_Porcelletto Merino_ are unsatisfactory. Florio gives â_Zucca_:
a gourd; a casting bottle,â but I have been unable to discover
_Mugia_. The loss of these words is, to be sure, of no moment. Two
things illustrative of Jonsonâs method are sufficiently clear.
(1) The articles mentioned are not, as they seem at first, merely
names coined for the occasion. (2) They are a polyglot jumble,
intended to make proficiency in the science of cosmetics as
ridiculous as possible. It is worth while to notice, however, that
this list of drugs is carefully differentiated from the list at
4. 4. 142 f., which contains the names of sweetmeats and perfumes.

=4. 4. 32, 3 Soda di leuante, Or your Ferne ashes.= Soda-ash is still
the common trade name of sodium carbonate. In former times soda was
chiefly obtained from natural deposits and from the incineration
of various plants growing by the sea-shore. These sources have
become of little importance since the invention of artificial soda
by Leblanc toward the end of the eighteenth century (see _Soda_
in _CD._). Florioâs definition of soda is: âa kind of Ferne-ashes
whereof they make glasses.â Cf. also W. Warde, Tr. _Alessioâs Secr._,
Pt. 1 fol. 78^{m} 1Âº: âTake an vnce of Soda (which is asshes made
of grasse, whereof glassemakers do vse to make their Cristall).â
In Chaucerâs _Squireâs Tale_ (11. 254 f.) the manufacture of glass
out of âfern-asshenâ is mentioned as a wonder comparable to that of
Canaceeâs ring.

=4. 4. 33 Beniamin di gotta.= The _Dict. dâHistoire Naturelle_,
Paris, 1843, 2. 509, gives: âBenjoin. Sa teinture, Ã©tendue dâeau,
sert Ã  la toilette sous le nom de _Lait virginal_.â See 4. 4. 52.

=4. 4. 38 With a piece of scarlet.= Lady Politick Would-beâs remedies
in the _Fox_ are to be âapplied with a right scarlet cloth.â Scarlet
was supposed to be of great efficacy in disease. See Whalleyâs note
on the _Fox_, _Wks._ 3. 234.

=4. 4. 38, 9 makes a Lady of sixty Looke at sixteen.= Cunningham
thinks this is a reference to the _In decimo sexto_ of line 50.

=4. 4. 39, 40 the water Of the white Hen, of the Lady Estifanias!= The
Lady Estifania seems to have been a dealer in perfumes and cosmetics.
In _Staple of News_, _Wks._ 5. 166, we read: âRight Spanish perfume,
the lady Estifaniaâs.â Estefania is the name of a Spanish lady in B. &
Fl.âs _Rule a Wife_.

=4. 4. 47 galley-pot.= Mistresse Gallipot is the name of a
tobacconist in Dekkerâs and Middletonâs _Roaring Girle_.

=4. 4. 50 In decimo sexto.= This is a bookbinderâs or printerâs
term, âapplied to books, etc., a leaf of which is one-sixteenth of
a full sheet or signature.â It is equivalent to â16mo.â and hence
metaphorically used to indicate âa small compass, miniatureâ (see
_Stanford_, p. 312). In _Cyn. Rev._, _Wks._ 2. 218, Jonson says:
âmy braggart in decimo sexto!â Its use is well exemplified in John
Taylorâs _Works_, sig. L_1 v^{0/1}: âwhen a mans stomache is in Folio,
and knows not where to haue a dinner in Decimo sexto.â The phrase
is fairly common in the dramatic literature. See Massinger, _Unnat.
Combat_ 3. 2; Middleton, _Father Hubburdâs Tales_, _Wks._ 8 64, etc.
In the present passage, however, the meaning evidently required
is âperfect: âspotless,â and no doubt refers to the comparative
perfection of a sexto decimo, or perhaps to the perfection naturally
to be expected of any work in miniature.

=4. 4. 52 Virgins milke for the face.= Cf. John French, _Art
Distill._. Bk. 5. p. 135 (1651): âThis salt being set in a cold
cellar on a marble stone, and dissolved into an oil, is as good as
any _Lac virginis_ to clear, and smooth the face.â _Lac Virginis_ is
spoken of twice in the _Alchemist_, Act 2, but probably in neither
case is the cosmetic referred to. See Hathawayâs edition, p. 293.
Nash speaks of the cosmetic in _Pierce Pennilesse_, _Wks._ 2. 44:
âShe should haue noynted your face ouer night with _Lac virginis_.â

=4. 4. 55 Cataputia.= Catapuce is one of the laxatives that Dame
Pertelote recommended to Chauntecleer in Chaucerâs _Nonne Preestes
Tale_, l. 145.

=4. 4. 63 Doe not you dwindle.= The use of _dwindle_ in this sense
is very rare. _NED._ thinks it is âprobably a misuse owing to two
senses of _shrink_.â It gives only a single example, _Alch._, _Wks._
4. 163: âDid you not hear the coil about the door? _Sub._ Yes, and I
dwindled with it.â Besides the two instances in Jonson I have noticed
only one other, in Ford, _Fancies chaste and noble_, _Wks._ 2. 291:
â_Spa._ Hum, howâs that? is he there, with a wanion! then do I begin
to dwindle.â

=4. 4. 69 Cioppinoâs.= The source of this passage, with the anecdote
which follows, seems to be taken from Coryatâs _Crudities_ (ed.
1776, 2. 36, 7): âThere is one thing vsed of the Venetian women, and
some others dwelling in the cities and towns subject to the Signiory
of Venice, that is not to be obserued (I thinke) amongst any other
women in Christendome: which is so common in Venice, that no woman
whatsoeuer goeth without it, either in her house or abroad; a thing
made of wood, and couered with leather of sundry colors, some with
white, some redde, some yellow. It is called a Chapiney, which they
weare vnder their shoes. Many of them are curiously painted; some
also I haue seene fairely gilt: so vncomely a thing (in my opinion)
that it is pitty this foolish custom is not cleane banished and
exterminated out of the citie. There are many of these Chapineys of a
great heigth, euen half a yard high, which maketh many of their women
that are very short, seeme much taller then the tallest women we haue
in England. Also I haue heard that this is obserued amongst them,
that by how much the nobler a woman is, by so much the higher are her
Chapineys. All their Gentlewomen, and most of their wiues and widowes
that are of any wealth, are assisted and supported eyther by men or
women when they walke abroad, to the end they may not fall. They
are borne vp most commonly by the left arme, otherwise they might
quickly take a fall. For I saw a woman fall a very dangerous fall as
she was going down the staires of one of the little stony bridges
with her high Chapineys alone by her selfe: but I did nothing pitty
her, because shee wore such friuolous and (as I may truely term them)
ridiculous instruments, which were the occasion of her fall. For both
I myselfe, and many other strangers (as I haue obserued in Venice)
haue often laughed at them for their vaine Chapineys.â

=4. 4. 71, 2 Spanish pumps Of perfumâd leather.= Pumps are
first mentioned in the sixteenth century (PlanchÃ©). A reference
to them occurs in _Midsummer Nightâs Dream_, 1593-4, 4. 2. They
were worn especially by footmen.

Spanish leather was highly esteemed at this time. Stubbes (_Anat. of
Abuses_, Part 1, p. 77) says: âThey haue korked shooes, pinsnets,
pantoffles, and slippers, ... some of spanish leather, and some of
English lether.â Marston (_Dutch Courtezan_, _Wks._ 2. 7) speaks of
a âSpanish leather jerkin,â and Middleton (_Father Hubburdâs Tales_,
_Wks._ 8. 70) of âa curious pair of boots of King Philipâs leather,â
and a little farther on (_Wks._ 8. 108) of Spanish leather shoes.
Fastidious Briskâs boots are made of the same material (_Ev. Man
out_, _Wks._ 2. 147). Cf. also Dekker, _Wks._ 2. 305.

Perfumes were much in fashion, and Stubbesâ _Anatomy_ has a great
deal to say on the subject. We hear of perfumed jerkins in Marstonâs
_Malcontent_ (_Wks._ 1. 314) and in _Cynthiaâs Revels_ (_Wks._ 2.
325). Spanish perfume for gloves is spoken of in the latter play
(p. 328) and in the _Alchemist_ (_Wks._ 4. 131) âyour Spanish
titillation in a gloveâ is declared to be the best perfume.

=4. 4. 77, 8     The Guardo-duennas, such a little old man,=
=As this.= Minsheu gives the definition: âEscudero, m. An
Esquire, a Seruingman that waits on a Ladie or Gentlewoman,
in Spaine neuer but old men and gray beards.â

=4. 4. 81 flat spred, as an Vmbrella.= The umbrella of the
seventeenth century seems to have been used exclusively to protect
the face from the sun. Blount, _Glossographia_, 1670, gives:
â_Umbrello_ (Ital. Ombrella), a fashion of round and broad Fans,
wherewith the Indians (and from them our great ones) preserve
themselves from the heat of the sun or fire; and hence any little
shadow, Fan, or other thing wherewith women guard their faces from
the sun.â

It was apparently not in use in England when Coryat published his
_Crudities_, which contains the following description (1. 135): âAlso
many of them doe carry other fine things of a far greater price, that
will cost at the least a duckat, which they commonly call in the
Italian tongue _vmbrellaes_, that is, things that minister shadow
unto them for shelter against the scorching heate of the sunne. These
are made of leather something answerable to the forme of a little
cannopy, & hooped in the inside with diuers little wooden hoopes that
extend the _vmbrella_ in a pretty large compasse.â

âAs a defense from rain or snow it was not used in western
Europe till early in the eighteenth century.â--_CD._

=4. 4. 82 Her hoope.= A form of the farthingale (fr.
Sp. _Verdugal_) was worn in France, Spain, and Italy, and
in England as early as 1545. It gradually increased in size,
and Elizabethâs farthingale was enormous. The aptness of the
comparison can be appreciated by reading Coryatâs description of
the umbrella above.

=4. 4. 87 An Escudero.= See note 4. 4. 77, 8.

=4. 4. 97 If no body should loue mee, but my poore
husband.= Cf. _Poetaster_, _Wks._ 2. 444: âMethinks a
bodyâs husband does not so well at court; a bodyâs friend,
or so--but, husband! âtis like your clog to your marmoset,â etc.

=4. 4. 134 your Gentleman-vsher.= âGentleman-Usher.
Originally a state-officer, attendant upon queens, and
other persons of high rank, as, in Henry VIII, Griffith is
gentleman-usher to Queen Catherine; afterwards a private
affectation of state, assumed by persons of distinction, or
those who pretended to be so, and particularly ladies. He
was then only a sort of upper servant, out of livery, whose
office was to hand his lady to her coach, and to walk before
her bare-headed, though in later times she leaned upon his
arm.â--Nares.

Cf. Dekker, _West-ward Hoe_, _Wks._ 2. 324: âWeare furnisht for
attendants as Ladies are, We have our fooles, and our Vshers.â

The sources for a study of the gentleman-usher are the present play,
_The Tale of a Tub_, and Chapmanâs _Gentleman Usher_. In the _Staple
of News_ the Lady Pecunia is provided with a gentleman-usher. The
principal duties of this office seem to have consisted in being
sent on errands, handing the lady to her coach, and preceding her
on any occasion where ceremony was demanded. In Chapmanâs play
Lasso says that the disposition of his house for the reception of
guests was placed in the hands of this servant (cf. Chapman, _Wks._
1. 263 f.). Innumerable allusions occur in which the requirement
of going bare-headed is mentioned (see note on 4. 4. 202). Another
necessary quality was a fine pace, which is alluded to in the present
characterâs name (see also note 4. 4. 201). An excellent description
of the gentleman-usher will be found in Naresâ _Glossary,_ quoting
from Lentonâs _Leasures_, a book published in 1631, and now very rare.

=4. 4. 142 the Dutchesse of Braganza.= Braganza is the
ruling house of Portugal. Dom John, Duke of Braganza, became
king of Portugal in 1640.

=4. 4. 143 Almoiauna.= The _Stanford Dictionary_ gives:
âAlmojabana, Sp. fr. Arab. _Al-mojabbana_: cheese-and-flour cake.
Xeres was famed for this dainty, which is named from Arabic
_jobn_ = âcheese.ââ

=4. 4. 147 Marquesse Muja.= Apparently a Spanish marquise,
occupying a position in society similar to that of Madame
RÃ©camier.

=4. 4. 156 A Lady of spirit.= With this line and lines 165
f. cf. _U._ 32, _Wks._ 8. 356:

    To be abroad chanting some bawdy song,
    And laugh, and measure thighs, then squeak, spring, itch,
    Do all the tricks of a salt lady bitch!
    --For these with her young company sheâll enter,
    Where Pitts, or Wright, or Modet would not venture;
                                      (Fol. reads âventerâ)
    And come by these degrees the style tâinherit
    Of woman of fashion, and a lady of spirit.

=4. 4. 164 Pimlico.= See note 3. 3. 170.

=4. 4. 164 daunce the Saraband.= The origin of the saraband is in
doubt, being variously attributed to Spain and to the Moors. It
is found in Europe at the beginning of the sixteenth century, and
its immoral character is constantly referred to. Grove (_Dict. of
Music_ 3. 226) quotes from chapter 12, âDel baile y cantar llamado
Zarabanda,â of the _Tratado contra los Juegos Publicos_ (âTreatise
against Public Amusementsâ) of Mariana (1536-1623): âEntre las otras
invenciones ha salido estos aÃ±os un baile y cantar tan lacivo en las
palabras, tan feo en las meneos, que basta para pegar fuego aun Ã¡ las
personas muy honestasâ (âamongst other inventions there has appeared
during late years a dance and song, so lascivious in its words, so
ugly in its movements, that it is enough to inflame even very modest
peopleâ). âThis reputation was not confined to Spain, for Marini in
his poem âLâAdoneâ (1623) says:

    Chiama questo suo gioco empio e profano
    Saravanda, e Ciaccona, il nuova Ispano.

Padre Mariana, who believed in its Spanish origin, says that its
invention was one of the disgraces of the nation, and other authors
attribute its invention directly to the devil. The dance was attacked
by Cervantes and Guevara, and defended by Lope de Vega, but it seems
to have been so bad that at the end of the reign of Philip II. it was
for a time suppressed. It was soon, however, revived in a purer form
and was introduced at the French court in 1588â (Grove 3. 226-7).

In England the saraband was soon transformed into an ordinary
country-dance. Two examples are to be found in the first edition of
Playfordâs _Dancing Master_, and Sir John Hawkins (_Hist. of the
Science and Practice of Music_, 1776) speaks of it several times.
âWithin the memory of persons now living,â he says, a Saraband
danced by a Moor was constantly a part of the entertainment at a
puppet-showâ (4. 388). In another place (2. 135), in speaking of the
use of castanets at a puppet-show, he says: âThat particular dance
called the Saraband is supposed to require as a thing of necessity,
the music, if it may be called so, of this artless instrument.â

In the _Staple of News_, _Wks._ 5. 256, Jonson speaks of âa light
air! the bawdy Saraband!â

=4. 4. 165 Heare, and talke bawdy; laugh as loud, as a larum.= Jonson
satirizes these vices again in _U. 67_ (see note 4. 4. 156) and
_Epigrams_ 48 and _115_. Dekker (_Guls Horne-booke_, _Non-dram. Wks._
2. 238) advises the young gallant to âdiscourse as lowd as you can,
no matter to what purpose, ... and laugh in fashion, ... you shall be
much obserued.â

=4. 4. 172 Shee must not lose a looke on stuffes, or cloth.= It being
the fashion to âswim in choice of silks and tissues,â plain woolen
cloth was despised. =4. 4. 187 Blesse vs from him!= Preserve us. A
precaution against any evil that might result from pronouncing the
devilâs name. Cf. _Knight of the Burning Pestle_ 2. 1: Sure the devil
(God bless us!) is in this springald!â and Wilson, _The Cheats_,
Prologue:

    No little pug nor devil,--bless us all!

=4. 4. 191, 2 What things they are? That nature should be at leasure=
=Euer to make âhem!= Cf. _Ev. Man in_, _Wks._ 1. 119: âO manners that
this age should bring forth such creatures! that nature should be at
leisure to make them!â

=4. 4. 197 Hee makes a wicked leg.= Gifford thinks that _wicked_ here
means âawkward or clownish.â It seems rather to mean âroguish,â a
common colloquial use.

=4. 4. 201 A setled discreet pase.= Cf. 3. 5. 22; 2. 7. 33; and
Dekker, _Guls Horne-booke_, _Non-dram. Wks._ 2. 238: âWalke
vp and downe by the rest as scornfully and as carelesly as a
Gentleman-Usher.â

=4. 4. 202 a barren head, Sir.= Cf. 2. 3. 36, 7 and 4. 2. 12.
Here again we have a punning allusion to the uncovered head of
the gentleman-usher. âIt was a piece of state, that the servants
of the nobility, particularly the gentleman-usher, should attend
bare-headed.â Nares, _Gloss._ For numerous passages illustrating the
practice both in regard to the gentleman-usher and to the coachman,
see the quotations in Nares, and Ford, _Loverâs Melancholy_, _Wks._
1. 19; Chapman, _Gentleman-Usher_, _Wks._ 1. 263; and the following
passage, _ibid._ 1. 273:

      _Vin._ I thanke you sir.
    Nay pray be couerd; O I crie you mercie,
    You must be bare.
      _Bas._ Euer to you my Lord.
      _Vin._ Nay, not to me sir,
    But to the faire right of your worshipfull place.

A passage from Lenton (see note 4. 4. 134) may also be quoted: âHe is
forced to stand bare, which would urge him to impatience, but for the
hope of being covered, or rather the delight hee takes in shewing his
new-crispât hayre, which his barber hath caused to stand like a print
hedge, in equal proportion.â

The dramatists ridiculed it by insisting that the coachman should be
not only bare-headed, but bald. Cf. 2. 3. 36 and Massinger, _City
Madam_, _Wks._ p. 331: âThou shalt have thy proper and bald-headed
coachman.â Jonson often refers to this custom. Cf. _Staple of News_,
_Wks._ 5. 232:

    Such as are bald and barren beyond hope,
    Are to be separated and set by
    For ushers to old countesses: and coachmen
    To mount their boxes reverently, etc.

_New Inn_, _Wks._ 5. 374:

      _Jor._ Whereâs thy hat?...
      _Bar._ The wind blewât off at Highgate, and my lady
    Would not endure me light to take it up;
    But made me drive bareheaded in the rain.
      _Jor._ That she might be mistaken for a countess?

Cf. also _Mag. La._, _Wks._ 6. 36, and _Tale Tub_,
_Wks._ 6. 217 and 222.

=4. 4. 204 his Valley is beneath the waste.= âWaistâ and âwasteâ were
both spelled _waste_ or _wast_. Here, of course, is a pun on the two
meanings.

=4. 4. 206 Dulnesse vpon you! Could not you hit this?= Cf. _Bart.
Fair_, _Wks._ 4. 358: âNow dullness upon me, that I had not that
before him.â

=4. 4. 209 the French sticke.= Walking-sticks of various sorts are
mentioned during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. âIn Chas.
II.âs time the French walking-stick, with a ribbon and tassels to
hold it when passed over the wrist, was fashionable, and continued
so to the reign of George II.â (PlanchÃ©).

=4. 4. 215, 6 report the working, Of any Ladies physicke.= In
Lentonâs _Leasures_ (see note 4.4.134) we find: âHis greatest
vexation is going upon sleevelesse arrands, to know whether some lady
slept well last night, or how her physick workâd iâ thâ morning,
things that savour not well with him; the reason that ofttimes he
goes but to the next taverne, and then very discreetly brings her
home a tale of a tubbe.â

Cf. also B. & Fl., _Fair Maid of the Inn_ 2. 2: â_Host._ And have
you been in England?... But they say ladies there take physic for
fashion.â

Dekker, _Guls Horne-booke_, _Non-dram. Wks._ 2. 255, speaks of âa
country gentleman that brings his wife vp to learne the fashion,
see the Tombs at Westminster, the Lyons in the Tower, or to take
physicke.â In the 1812 reprint the editor observes that in Jonsonâs
time âfanciful or artful wives would often persuade their husbands
to take them up to town for the advantage of _physick_, when the
principal object was dissipation.â

=4. 4. 219 Corne-cutter.= This vulgar suggestion renders hopeless
Pugâs pretensions to gentility. Corncutters carried on a regular
trade (see _Bart. Fair_ 2. 1.), and were held in the greatest
contempt, as we learn from Nash (_Four Letters Confuted_, _Wks._ 2.
211).

=4. 4. 232 The Moone.= I. e., see that the moon and zodiacal sign are
propitious.

=4. 4. 235 Get their natiuities cast!= Astrology was a favorite
subject of satire. Cf. Massinger, _City Madam_ 2. 2; B. & Fl., _Rollo
Duke of Normandy_ 4. 2, etc.

=4. 5. 31, 2 his valour has At the tall board bin questionâd.= _Tall
board_ is, I think, the same as _table-board_, a gaming-table. In
Dyceâs edition of Websterâs _Devilâs Law Case_ (_Wks._ 2. 38) we
read: âshaking your elbow at the table-board.â Dyce says in a note
that the old folio reads _Taule-board_. _Tables_ is derived from Lat.
_Tabularum lusus_ âº Fr. _Tables_. The derivation, _table_ âº _tavl_ âº
_taul_ âº _tall_, presents no etymological difficulties. A note from
Professor Joseph Wright of Oxford confirms me in my theory.

The passage seems to mean that Merecraft was accused of cheating,
and, his valor not rising to the occasion, his reputation for honesty
was left somewhat in doubt.

=4. 6. 38-41 intitle Your vertue, to the power, vpon a life ... Euen
to forfeit.= Wittipol is âwooing in language of the pleas and bench.â
Cf. 4. 7. 62.

=4. 6. 42 We haue another leg-strainâd, for this Dottrel.= See
variants, and note 2. 2. 49, 50.

=4. 6. 49 A Phrentick.= See note 5. 8. 91-2.

=4. 7. 37-40.= See variants. Gifford silently follows Whalleyâs
changes, which are utterly unwarrantable. Cunningham points out the
wrong division in 37, 8. The scansion is thus indicated by Wilke
(_Metrische Untersuchungen_, p. 3):

    Of a/ most wor/thy gen/tleman./ Would one
    Of worth/ had spoke/ it: whence/ it comes,/ it is
    Rather/ a shame/ to me,/ Í then/ a praise.

The missing syllable in the third verse is compensated for by the
pause after the comma. This is quite in accordance with Jonsonâs
custom (see Wilke, p. 1 f.).

=4. 7. 45 Publication.= See 3. 3. 137.

=4. 7. 54 I souât him.= See variants. Gifford says that he can make
nothing of _souât_ but _sought_ and _sousâd_, and that he prefers the
latter. Dyce (_Remarks_) confidently asserts that the word is the
same as _shue_, âto frighten away poultry,â and Cunningham accepts
this without question. There seems, however, to be no confirmation
for the theory that the preterit was ever spelt _souât_. Wrightâs
_Dialect Dictionary_ gives: â_Sough._ 19. to strike; to beat
severely,â but the pronunciation here seems usually to be _souff_.
Professor Wright assures me that _sousâd_ is the correct reading,
and that the others are âmere stupid guesses.â

=4. 7. 62 in possibility.= A legal phrase used of contingent
interests. See note 4. 6. 38, 9.

=4. 7. 65 Duke Oâ Shore-ditch.= âA mock title of honour, conferred on
the most successful of the London archers, of which this account is
given:

When Henry VIII became king, he gave a prize at Windsor to those
who should excel at this exercise, (archery) when Barlo, one of
his guards, an inhabitant of Shoreditch, acquired such honor as an
archer, that the king created him _duke of Shoreditch_, on the spot.
This title, together with that of marquis of Islington, earl of
Pancridge, etc., was taken from these villages, in the neighborhood
of Finsbury fields, and continued so late as 1683. Ellisâs _History
of Shoreditch_, p. 170.

The latest account is this: In 1682 there was a most magnificent
entertainment given by the Finsbury archers, when they bestowed the
title of _duke of Shoreditch_, etc., upon the most deserving. The
king was present. _Ibid._ 173.â--Nares, _Gloss_.

Entick (_Survey_ 2. 65) gives an interesting account of a match which
took place in 1583. The Duke of Shoreditch was accompanied on this
occasion by the âmarquises of _Barlow_, _Clerkenwell_, _Islington_,
_Hoxton_, and _Shaklewell_, the earl of _Pancras_, etc. These, to
the number of 3000, assembled at the place appointed, sumptuously
apparelled, and 942 of them had gold chains about their necks.
They marched from merchant-taylors-hall, preceded by whifflers and
bellmen, that made up the number 4000, besides pages and footmen;
performing several exercises and evolutions in _Moorfields_, and at
last shot at the target for glory in _Smithfield_.â

=4. 7. 69 Haâ.= See variants. The original seems to me the more
characteristic reading.

=4. 7. 84 after-game.= Jonson uses the expression again in the
_New Inn, Wks._ 5. 402:

    And play no after-games of love hereafter.


ACT V.

=5. 1. 28 Tyborne.= This celebrated gallows stood, it is believed, on
the site of Connaught Place. It derived the name from a brook in the
neighborhood (see Minsheu, Stow, etc.).

=5. 1. 29 My L. Majors Banqueting-house.= This was in Stratford
Place, Oxford Street. It was âerected for the Mayor and Corporation
to dine in after their periodical visits to the Bayswater and
Paddington Conduits, and the Conduit-head adjacent to the
Banqueting-House, which supplied the city with water. It was taken
down in 1737, and the cisterns arched over at the same time.â--Wh-C.

Stow (ed. 1633, pp. 475-6) speaks of âmany faire Summer housesâ in
the London suburbs, built ânot so much for use and profit, as for
shew and pleasure.â

The spelling _Major_ seems to be a Latin form. Mr. Charles Jackson
(_N. & Q._ 4. 7. 176) mentions it as frequently used by the mayors
of Doncaster in former days. Cf. also Glapthorne (_Wks._ 1. 231) and
_Ev. Man in_ (Folio 1616, 5. 5. 41).

=5. 1. 41 my tooth-picks.= See note 4. 2. 26.

=5. 1. 47 Saint Gilesâes.= âNow, without the postern of Cripplesgate,
first is the parish church of Saint Giles, a very fair and large
church, lately repaired, after that the same was burnt in the year
1545.â--Stow, _Survey_, ed. Thoms, p. 112.

=5. 1. 48 A kind of Irish penance!= âThere is the same allusion to
the _rug gowns_ of the wild Irish, in the _Night Walker_ of Fletcher:

    We have divided the sextonâs household stuff
    Among us; one has the _rug_, and heâs turnâd _Irish_.â--G.

Cf. also Holinshed, _Chron._ (quoted _CD._):âAs they distill the best
aqua-vitÃ¦, so they spin the choicest _rug_ in Ireland.â Fynes Moryson
(_Itinerary_, fol. 1617, p. 160) says that the Irish merchants were
forbidden to export their wool, in order that the peasants might
âbe nourished by working it into cloth, namely, Rugs ... & mantles
generally worn by men and women, and exported in great quantity.â

Jonson mentions rug as an article of apparel several times. In
_Alch._, _Wks._ 4. 14, it is spoken of as the dress of a poor man
and _ibid._ 4. 83 as that of an astrologer. In _Ev. Man out_ (_Wks._
2. 110) a similar reference is made, and here Gifford explains that
rug was âthe usual dress of mathematicians, astrologers, &c., when
engaged in their sublime speculations.â Marston also speaks of rug
gowns as the symbol of a strict life (_What You Will_, _Wks._ 2. 395):

    Lamp-oil, watch-candles, rug-gowns, and small juice,
    Thin commons, four oâclock rising,--I renounce you all.

=5. 2. 1 ff. put me To yoaking foxes,= etc. Several at least of
the following employments are derived from proverbial expressions
familiar at the time. Jonson speaks of âmilking he-goatsâ in
_Timber,_ ed. Schelling, p. 34, which the editor explains as âa
proverbial expression for a fruitless task.â The occupation of lines
5-6 is adapted from a popular proverb given by Cotgrave: âJâaymeroy
autant tirer vn pet dâun Asne mort, que. I would as soone vndertake
to get a fart of a dead man, as &c.â Under _Asne_ he explains the
same proverb as meaning âto worke impossibilities.â This explains
the passage in _Staple of News_ 3. 1., _Wks._ 5. 226. The proverb
is quoted again in _Eastward Ho_, Marston, _Wks._ 3. 90, and in
Wm. Lillyâs Observations,â _Hist._, pp. 269-70. âMaking ropes of
sandâ was Iniquityâs occupation in 1. 1. 119. This familiar proverb
first appears in Aristides 2. 309: á¼Îº ÏÎ¬Î¼Î¼Î¿Ï ÏÏÎ¿Î¹Î½Î¯Î¿Î½ ÏÎ»Î­ÎºÎµÎ¹Î½. In
the _New Inn_, _Wks._ 5. 394, Lovel says: âI will go catch the wind
first in a sieve.â Whalley says that the occupation of âkeeping
fleas within a circleâ is taken from Socratesâ employment in the
_Clouds_ of Aristophanes (ll. 144-5). Gifford, however, ridicules
the notion. Jonson refers to the passage in the _Clouds_ in _Timber_
(ed. Schelling, 82. 33), where he thinks it would have made the
Greeks merry to see Socrates âmeasure how many foot a flea could
skip geometrically.â But here again we seem to have a proverbial
expression. It occurs in the morality-play of _Nature_, 642. II
(quoted by Cushman, p. 116):

    I had leiver keep as many flese,
    Or wyld hares in an opyn lese,
    As undertake that.

=5. 2. 32.= Scan:

    And three/ pence. Í/ Give me/ an an/swer. Sir.

Thos. Keightley, _N. & Q._ 4. 2. 603, suggests:

    And your threepence, etc.

=5. 2. 35 Your best songs Thom. Oâ Betâlem.= âA song entitled âMad
Tomâ is to be found in Percyâs _Reliques_; Ballad Soc. Roxb. Ball.,
2. p. 259; and Chappellâs _Old Pop. Mus._ The exact date of the poem
is not known.â--H. R. D. Anders, _Shakespeareâs Books_, p. 24-5.

Bethlehem Royal Hospital was originally founded âto have been a
priory of canons,â but was converted to a hospital for lunatics in
1547. In Jonsonâs time it was one of the regular sights of London,
and is so referred to in Dekkerâs _Northward Hoe_, _Wks._ 3. 56 f.;
_Sil. Wom._, _Wks._ 3. 421; _Alch._, _Wks._ 4. 132.

=5. 3. 6 little Darrels tricks.= John Darrel (fl. 1562-1602) was
born, it is believed, at Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, about 1562.
He graduated at Cambridge, studied law, and then became a preacher
at Mansfield. He began to figure as an exorcist in 1586, when he
pretended to cast out an evil spirit from Catherine Wright of Ridgway
Lane, Derbyshire. In 1596 he exorcised Thomas Darling, a boy of
fourteen, of Burton-on-Trent, for bewitching whom Alice Goodrich was
tried and convicted at Derby. A history of the case was written by
Jesse Bee of Burton (Harsnet, _Discovery_, p. 2). The boy Darling
went to Merton College, and in 1603 was sentenced by the Star-chamber
to be whipped, and to lose his ears for libelling the vice-chancellor
of Oxford. In March, 1596-7, Darrel was sent for to Clayworth Hall,
Shakerly, in Leigh parish, Lancashire, where he exorcised seven
persons of the household of Mr. Nicholas Starkie, who accused one
Edmund Hartley of bewitching them, and succeeded in getting the
latter condemned and executed in 1597. In November, 1597, Darrel was
invited to Nottingham to dispossess William Somers, an apprentice,
and shortly after his arrival was appointed preacher of St. Maryâs
in that town, and his fame drew crowded congregations to listen
to his tales of devils and possession. Darrelâs operations having
been reported to the Archbishop of York, a commission of inquiry
was issued (March 1597-8), and he was prohibited from preaching.
Subsequently the case was investigated by Bancroft, bishop of London,
and S. Harsnet, his chaplain, when Somers, Catherine Wright, and Mary
Cooper confessed that they had been instructed in their simulations
by Darrel. He was brought before the commissioners and examined at
Lambeth on 26 May 1599, was pronounced an impostor, degraded from the
ministry and committed to the Gatehouse. He remained in prison for
at least a year, but it is not known what became of him.
(Abridged from _DNB._)

Jonson refers to Darrel again in _U._ 67, _Wks._ 8. 422:

    This age will lend no faith to Darrelâs deed.

=5. 3. 27 That could, pitty her selfe.= See variants.

=5. 3. 28 in PotentiÃ¢.= Jonson uses the phrase again in the
_Alchemist_, _Wks._ 4. 64: âThe eggâs ... a chicken _in potentia_.â
It is a late Latin phrase. See Gloss.

=5. 4. 17 my proiect oâ the forkes.= Forks were just being introduced
into England at this time, and were a common subject of satire. The
first mention of a fork recorded in the _NED._ is: â1463 _Bury Wills_
(Camden) 40, I beqwethe to Davn John Kertelynge my silvir forke for
grene gyngour.â

Cf. Dekker, _Guls Horne-booke_, _Non-dram. Wks._ 2. 211: âOh golden
world, the suspicious Venecian carued not his meate with a siluer
pitch-forke.â B. & Fl., _Queen of Corinth_ 4. 1 (quoted by Gifford):

    It doth express thâ enamoured courtier,
    As full as your fork-carving traveler.

_Fox_, _Wks._ 3. 261:

              --Then must you learn the use
    And handling of your silver fork at meals,
    The metal of your glass; (these are main matters
    With your Italian;)

Coryat has much to say on the subject (_Crudities_ 1. 106): âI
obserued a custome in all those Italian Cities and Townes through
the which I passed, that is not vsed in any other country that I
saw in my trauels, neither doe I thinke that any other nation of
Christendome doth vse it, but only Italy. The Italian and also most
strangers that are commorant in Italy, doe alwaies in their meales
vse a little forke when they cut their meate. For while with their
knife which they hold in one hand they cut the meate out of the
dish, they fasten their forke which they hold in their other hand
vpon the same dish, so that whatsoeuer he be that sitting in the
company of any others at meale, should vnadvisedly touch the dish of
meate with his fingers from which all at the table doe cut, he will
giue occasion of offence vnto the company, as hauing transgressed
the lawes of good manners.... This forme of feeding I vnderstand is
generally vsed in all places of Italy, their forkes being for the
most part made of yron or steele, and some of siluer, but those are
vsed only by Gentlemen.â Coryat carried this custom home with him to
England, for which a friend dubbed him _furcifer_. This passage is
doubtless the source of Jonsonâs lines. Compare the last sentence of
the quotation with lines 30, 31 of this scene.

=5. 4. 23, 4 on my priuate, By cause.= See variants. There is no
necessity for change. Cf. 1616 Sir R. Dudley in _Fortesc. Papers_ 17:
âNor am I so vaine ... bycause I am not worth so much.â The same form
occurs in _Sad Shepherd_ (Fol. 1631-40, p. 143):

    But, beare yee Douce, bycause, yee may meet mee.

Gabriel Harvey uses both the forms _by cause_ and _bycause_.
_Prose Wks_. 1. 101; 102; et frequenter.

=5. 4. 34 at mine owne ap-perill.= The word is of rare occurrence.
Gifford quotes _Timon of Athens_ 1. 2: âLet me stay at thine
apperil, Timon;â and refers to _Mag. La._, _Wks._ 6. 109: âFaith, I
will bail him at mine own apperil.â It occurs again in _Tale Tub_,
_Wks._ 6. 148: âAs you will answer it at your apperil.â

=5. 5. 10, 11 I will leaue you To your God fathers in Law.= âThis
seems to have been a standing joke for a jury. It is used by
Shakespeare and by writers prior to him. Thus Bulleyn, speaking of
a knavish ostler, says, âI did see him ones aske blessyng to xii
godfathers at ones.â _Dialogue_, 1564.â--G.

The passage from Shakespeare is _Merch. of Ven._ 4. 1. 398:

    In christening, shalt thou have two godfathers:
    Had I been judge, thou shouldâst have had ten more,
    To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.

Cf. also _Museâs Looking Glass_, _O. Pl._ 9. 214: âBoets!
I had rather zee him remitted to the jail, and have his twelve
godvathers, good men and true contemn him to the gallows.â

=5. 5. 50, 51 A Boy Oâ thirteene yeere old made him an Asse=
=But tâtoher day.= Whalley believed this to be an allusion to the
âboy of Bilson,â but, as Gifford points out, this case did not occur
until 1620, four years after the production of the present play.
Gifford believes Thomas Harrison, the âboy of Norwich,â to be alluded
to. A short account of his case is given in Hutchinsonâs _Impostures
Detected_, pp. 262 f. The affair took place in 1603 or 1604, and it
was thought necessary to ârequire the Parents of the said Child, that
they suffer not any to repair to their House to visit him, save such
as are in Authority and other Persons of special Regard, and known
Discretion.â Hutchinson says that Harrison was twelve years old. It
is quite possible, though not probable, that Jonson is referring
again to the Boy of Burton, who was only two years older.
See note 5. 3. 6.

=5. 5. 58, 59 You had some straine âBoue E-la?= Cf. 1593 Nash,
_Christâs Tears_, _Wks._ 4. 188: âYou must straine your wits an Ela
aboue theyrs.â Cf. also Nash, _Wks._ 5. 98 and 253; Lyly, _Euphues_,
Aij; and Gloss.

=5. 6. 1 your garnish.= âThis word _garnish_ has been made familiar
to all time by the writings of John Howard. âA cruel custom,â says
he, âobtains in most of our gaols, which is that of the prisoners
demanding of a newcomer _garnish_, footing, or (as it is called in
some London gaols) chummage. _Pay_ or _strip_ are the fatal words. I
say fatal, for they are so to some, who, having no money, are obliged
to give up part of their scanty apparel; and if they have no bedding
or straw to sleep on, contract diseases which I have known to prove
mortal.ââ--C.

Cf. Dekker, _If this be not a good Play_, _Wks._ 3. 324:

    Tis a strong charme gainst all the noisome smels
    Of Counters, Iaylors, garnishes, and such hels.

and Greene, _Upstart Courtier_, Dija: âLet a poore man be arrested
... he shal be almost at an angels charge, what with garnish,
crossing and wiping out of the book ... extortions ... not allowed by
any statute.â

The money here seems to have been intended for the jailer, rather
than for Pugâs fellow-prisoners. The custom was abolished by 4 George
IV. c. 43, Â§ 12.

=5. 6. 10 I thinke Time be drunke, and sleepes.= Cf. 1. 4. 31. For
the metaphor cf. _New Inn_, _Wks._ 5. 393:

    If I but knew what drink the time now loved.

and _Staple of News_, _Wks._ 5. 162:

                            --Now sleep, and rest;
    Would thou couldst make the time to do so too.

=5. 6. 18 confute.= âA pure Latinism. _Confutare_ is properly to
pour cold water in a pot, to prevent it from boiling over; and hence
metaphorically, the signification of _confuting_, reproving, or
controuling.â--W.

For the present use cf. T. Adams in Spurgeon, _Treas. Dav._, 1614,
Ps. lxxx. 20: âGoliath ... shall be confuted with a pebble.â R. Coke,
_Justice Vind._ (1660) 15: âto be confuted with clubs and hissing.â

=5. 6. 21 the Session.= The general or quarter sessions were held
regularly four times a year on certain days prescribed by the
statutes. The length of time for holding the sessions was fixed at
three days, if necessity required it, but the rule was not strictly
adhered to. See Beard, _The Office of the Justice of the Peace in
England_, pp. 158 f.

=5. 6. 23 In a cart, to be hangâd.= âTheft and robbery in their
coarsest form were for many centuries capital crimes.... The
question when theft was first made a capital crime is obscure,
but it is certain that at every period some thefts were punished
with death, and that by Edward I.âs time, at least, the distinction
between grand and petty larceny, which lasted till 1827, was fully
established.â--Stephen, _Hist. Crim. Law_ 3. 128 f.

=5. 6. 24 The charriot of Triumph, which most of them are.= The
procession from Newgate by Holbom and Tyburn road was in truth
often a âtriumphall egression,â and a popular criminal like Jack
Sheppard or Jonathan Wild frequently had a large attendance. Cf.
Shirley, _Wedding_ 4. 3, _Wks._, ed. Gifford, 1. 425: âNow Iâm in the
cart, riding up Holborn in a two-wheeled chariot, with a guard of
Halberdiers. _There goes a proper fellow_, says one; good people pray
for me: now I am at the three wooden stilts,â etc.

=5. 6. 48 a body intire.= Jonson uses the word in its strict
etymological sense.

=5. 6. 54 cheated on.= Dyce (_Remarks_) points out that this phrase
is used in Mrs. Centlivreâs _Wonder_, Act 2. Sc. 1. Jonson uses it
again in _Mercury vindicated_: âand cheat upon your under-officers;â
and Marston in _What You Will_, _Wks._ 2. 387.

=5. 6. 64 Prouinciall oâ the Cheaters!= _Provincial_ is a term
borrowed from the church. See Gloss. Of the _cheaters_ Dekker gives
an interesting account in the _Bel-man of London_, _Non-dram. Wks._
3. 116 f.: âOf all which _Lawes_, the _Highest_ in place, and the
_Highest_ in perdition is the _Cheating_ Law or the Art of winning
money by false dyce: Those that practise this studie call themselues
_Cheators_, / the dyce _Cheaters_, and the money which they purchase
[see note 3.4.31, 2.] _Cheates_ [see 1.7.4 and Gloss.]: borrowing the
tearme from our common Lawyers, with whome all such casuals as fall
to the Lord at the holding of his _Leetes_, as _Waifes_, _Strayes_, &
such like, are sayd to be _Escheated to the Lords vse_ and are called
_Cheates_.â

=5. 6. 64 Bawd-ledger.= Jonson speaks of a similar official in _Every
Man out_, _Wks._ 2. 132: âHeâs a leiger at Hornâs ordinary (cant name
for a bawdy-house) yonder.â See Gloss.

=5. 6. 68 to sindge your nayles off.= In the foolâs song in _Twelfth
Night_ we have the exclamation to the devil: âpaire thy nayles dadâ
(Furnessâs ed., p. 273). The editor quotes Malone: âThe Devil was
supposed from choice to keep his nails unpared, and therefore to pare
them was an affront. So, in Camdenâs _Remaines_, 1615: âI will follow
mine owne minde, and mine old trade; who shall let me? the divelâs
nailes are unparde.ââ

Compare also _Henry V._ 4. 4. 76: âBardolph and Nym had ten times
more valor than this roaring devil iâ the old play, that every one
may pare his nails with a wooden dagger.â

=5. 6. 76 The Diuell was wont to carry away the euill.= Eckhardt, p.
100, points out that Jonsonâs etymology of the word _Vice_, which
has been a matter of dispute, was the generally accepted one, that
is, from _vice_ = evil.

=5. 7. 1 Iustice Hall.= âThe name of the Sessions-house in the Old
Bailey.â--G. Strype, B. 3. p. 281 says that it was âa fair and
stately building, very commodious for that affair.â âIt standeth
backwards, so that it hath no front towards the street, only the
gateway leading into the yard before the House, which is spacious.
It cost above Â£6000 the building. And in this place the Lord Mayor,
Recorder, the Aldermen and Justices of the Peace for the County
of Middlesex do sit, and keep his Majestyâs Sessions of Oyer and
Terminer.â It was destroyed in the Gordon Riots of 1780.--Wh-C.

=5. 7. 9 This strange!= See variants. The change seriously injures the
metre, and the original reading should be preserved. Such absorptions
(_this_ for _this is_ or _thisâs_) are not uncommon. Cf. _Macbeth_ 3.
4. 17, ed. Furness, p. 165: âyet heâs goodâ for âyet he is as good.â

=5. 8. 2 They had giuân him potions.= Jonson perhaps had
in mind the trial of Anne Turner and her accomplices in the
Overbury Case of the previous year. See Introduction, p. lxxii.
For a discussion of love-philtres see Burton, _Anat. of Mel._
(ed. Bullen), 3. 145 f.

=5. 8. 33 with a Wanion.= This word is found only in the
phrases âwith a wanion,â âin a wanion,â and âwanions on you.â It
is a kind of petty imprecation, and occurs rather frequently in
the dramatists, but its precise signification and etymology are
still in doubt. Boswell, _Malone_, 21. 61, proposed a derivation
from _winnowing_,âa beating;â Nares from _wanung_, Saxon,
âdetriment;â Dyce (Fordâs _Wks._ 2. 291) from wan (vaande,
Dutch, âa rod or wandâ), âof which _wannie_ and _wannion_ are
familiar diminutives.â The _CD._ makes it a later form of ME.
_waniand_, âa waning,â spec. of the moon, regarded as implying
ill luck.

=5. 8. 34 If his hornes be forth, the Diuells companion!=
The jest is too obvious not to be a common one. Thus in
_Eastward Ho_ Slitgut, who is impersonating the cuckold at
Horn-fair, says: âSlight! I think the devil be abroad. in
likeness of a storm, to rob me of my horns!â,--Marstonâs _Wks._
3. 72. Cf. also _Staple of News_, _Wks._ 5. 186: âAnd why
would you so fain see the devil? would I say. Because he has horns,
wife, and may be a cuckold as well as a devil.â

=5. 8. 35 How he foames!= For the stock indications of
witchcraft see Introduction, p. xlix.

=5. 8. 40 The Cockscomb, and the Couerlet.= Wittipol is
evidently selecting an appropriate name for Fitzdottrelâs
buffoonery after the manner of the puppet-shows. It is quite
possible that some actual _motion_ of the day was styled
âthe Coxcomb and the Coverlet.â

=5. 8. 50 shee puts in a pinne.= Pricking with pins and needles was
one of the devilâs regular ways of tormenting bewitched persons. They
were often supposed to vomit these articles. So when Voltore feigns
possession, Volpone cries out: âSee! He vomits crooked pinsâ (_The
Fox_, _Wks._ 3. 312).

=5. 8. 61 the Kings Constable.= âFrom the earliest times to our
own days, there were two bodies of police in England, namely, the
parish and high constables, and the watchmen in cities and boroughs.
Nothing could exceed their inefficiency in the 17th century. Of the
constables, Dalton (in the reign of James I.) observes that they âare
often absent from their houses, being for the most part husbandmen.â
The charge of Dogberry shows probably with no great caricature
what sort of watchmen Shakespeare was familiar with. As late as
1796, Colquhoun observes that the watchmen âwere aged and often
superannuated men.â â--Sir J. Stephen, _Hist. Crim. Law_ 1. 194 f.

=5. 8. 71 The taking of Tabacco, with which the Diuell=

=Is so delighted.= This was an old joke of the time. In Middletonâs
_Black Book_, _Wks._ 8. 42 f. the devil makes his will, a part of
which reads as follows: âBut turning my legacy to you-ward, Barnaby
Burning-glass, arch-tobacco-taker of England, in ordinaries, upon
stages both common and private, and lastly, in the lodging of your
drab and mistress; I am not a little proud, I can tell you, Barnaby,
that you dance after my pipe so long, and for all counter-blasts and
tobacco-Nashes (which some call railers), you are not blown away,
nor your fiery thirst quenched with the small penny-ale of their
contradictions, but still suck that dug of damnation with a long
nipple, still burning that rare Phoenix of Phlegethon, tobacco, that
from her ashes, burned and knocked out, may arise another pipeful.â

Middleton here refers to Nashâs _Pierce Pennilesse_ and King James
I.âs _Counterblast to Tobacco_. The former in his supplication to the
devil says: âIt is suspected you have been a great _tobacco_-taker
in your youth.â King James describes it as âa custom loathsome to
the eye, hateful to the nose, harmful to the brain, dangerous to the
lungs, and in the black stinking fume thereof, nearest resembling the
horrid stygian smoke of the pit that is bottomless.â

The dramatists seem never to grow tired of this joking allusion to
the devil and his pipe of tobacco. Cf. Dekker, _If this be not a good
Play_, _Wks._ 3. 293: âI think the Diuell is sucking Tabaccho, heeres
such a Mist.â _Ibid._ 327: âAre there gentleman diuels too? this
is one of those, who studies the black Art, thats to say, drinkes
Tobacco.â Massinger, _Guardian_, _Wks._, p. 344:

                                --You shall fry first
    For a rotten piece of touchwood, and give fire
    To the great fiendâs nostrils, when he smokes tobacco!

Dekker (_Non-dram. Wks._ 2. 89) speaks of âthat great _Tobacconist_
the Prince of Smoake & darknes, _Don Pluto_.â

The art of _taking_ or _drinking_ tobacco was much cultivated
and had its regular professors. The _whiff_, the _ring_, etc.,
are often spoken of. For the general subject see Dekker, _Guls
Horne-booke_; Barnaby Riche, _Honestie of this Age_, 1613; Harrison,
_Chronology_, 1573; _Every Man in_, etc. An excellent description of
a tobacconistâs shop is given in _Alchemist_, _Wks._ 4. 37. For a
historical account of its introduction see Wheatley. _Ev. Man in_,
p. xlvii.

Jonsonâs form _tabacco_ is the same as the Italian and Portuguese.
See Alden, _Bart. Fair_, p. 169.

=5. 8. 74, 5 yellow=, etc.
=Thatâs Starch! the Diuellâs Idoll of that colour.= For the
general subject of yellow starch see note 1. 1. 112, 3. Compare
also Stubbes, _Anat. of Abuses_, p. 52: âThe deuil, as he in
the fulness of his malice, first inuented these great ruffes,
so hath hee now found out also two great stayes to beare vp and
maintaine this his kingdome of great ruffes.... The one arch or
piller whereby his kingdome of great ruffes is vnderpropped, is
a certaine kinde of liquide matter which they call _starch_,
wherein the devil hath willed them to wash and diue his ruffes
wel.â

âStarch houndâ and âTobacco spawling (spitting)â are the names
of two devils in Dekkerâs _If this be not a good Play_,
_Wks._ 3. 270. Jonson speaks of âthat idol starchâ again
in the _Alchemist_, _Wks._ 4. 92.

=5. 8. 78 He is the Master of Players.= An evident allusion
to the Puritan attacks on the stage. This was the period of the
renewed literary contest. George Wither had lately published
his _Abuses stript and whipt_, 1613. For the whole subject see
Thompson, E. N. S., _The Controversy between the Puritans and
the Stage_, New York, 1903.

=5. 8. 81 Figgum.= âIn some of our old dictionaries,
_fid_ is explained to caulk with oakum: figgum, or figâem, may
therefore be a vulgar derivative from this term, and signify the
lighted flax or tow with which jugglers stuff their mouths when
they prepare to amuse the rustics by breathing out smoke and
flames:

                                        --a nut-shell
    With tow, and touch-wood in it, to spite fire (5. 3. 4. 5).â
                                                                --G.

=5. 8. 86, 7 to such a foole, He makes himselfe.= For the omission of
the relative adverb cf. 1. 3. 34, 35.

=5. 8. 89 To come to dinner, in mee the sinner.= The conception of
this couplet and the lines which Fitzdottrel speaks below was later
elaborated in Cocklorrelâs song in the _Gipsies Metamorphosed_. Pluto
in Dekkerâs _If this be not a good Play_, _Wks._ 3. 268, says that
every devil should have âa brace of whores to his breakfast.â Such
ideas seem to be descended from the mediÃ¦val allegories of men like
Raoul de Houdanc, Ruteboeuf, etc.

=5. 8. 91, 2 Are you phrenticke, Sir, Or what graue dotage moues
you.= âDotage, fatuity, or folly, is a common name to all the
following species, as some will have it.... _Phrenitis_, which the
Greeks derive from the word ÏÏÎ®Î½, is a disease of the mind, with a
continual madness or dotage, which hath an acute fever annexed, or
else an inflammation of the brain, or the membranes or kells of it,
with an acute fever, which causeth madness and dotage.â--Burton,
_Anat. of Mel._, ed. Shilleto, 1. 159-60.

=5. 8. 112 f. Îá½¶ Î¼Î¿á½¶ ÎºÎ±ÎºÎ¿Î´Î±Î¯Î¼ÏÎ½=, etc. See variants. âThis
Greek is from the Plutus of Aristophanes, Act 4, Sc. 3.â--W.

Accordingly to Blaydesâs edition, 1886, 11. 850-2. He reads
Îá¼´Î¼Î¿Î¹ ÎºÎ±ÎºÎ¿Î´Î±Î¯Î¼ÏÎ½, etc. (Ah! me miserable, and thrice miserable,
and four times, and five times, and twelve times, and ten
thousand times.)

=5. 8. 116 QuebrÃ©mos=, etc. Letâs break his eye in jest.

=5. 8. 118 Di grÃ¡tia=, etc. If you please, sir, if you have
money, give me some of it.

=5. 8. 119 f. Ouy, Ouy Monsieur=, etc. Yes, yes, sir, a
poor devil! a poor little devil!

=5. 8. 121 by his seuerall languages.= Cf. Marston, _Malcontent_,
_Wks._ 1. 212: â_Mal._ Phew! the devil: let him possess thee; heâll
teach thee to speak all languages most readily and strangely.â

=5. 8. 132 Such an infernall stincke=, etc. Dr. Henry More says that
the devilâs âleaving an ill smell behind him seems to imply the
reality of the businessâ, and that it is due to âthose adscititious
particles he held together in his visible vehicle being loosened at
his vanishingâ (see Lowell, _Lit. Essays_ 2. 347).

=5. 8. 133 St. Pulchars Steeple.= St. Sepulchre in the Bailey
(occasionally written St. âPulcherâs) is a church at the western end
of Newgate Street and in the ward of Farringdon Without. A church
existed here in the twelfth century. The church which Jonson knew was
built in the middle of the fifteenth century. The body of the church
was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666.

It was the custom formerly for the clerk or bellman of St.
Sepulchreâs to go under Newgate on the night preceding the execution
of a criminal, and, ringing his bell, to repeat certain verses,
calling the prisoner to repentance. Another curious custom observed
at this church was that of presenting a nosegay to every criminal on
his way to Tyburn (see Wh-C.). The executed criminals were buried in
the churchyard (d. Middleton, _Black Book_, _Wks._ 8. 25).

Cunningham says that âthe word _steeple_ was not used in the
restricted sense to which we now confine it. The _tower_ of St.
Sepulchreâs in Jonsonâs time, must have been very much like what
we now see it as most carefully and tastefully restored.â

=5. 8. 134 as farre as Ware.= This is a distance of about 22 miles.
Ware is an ancient market-town of Herts, situated in a valley on the
north side of the river Lea. The âgreat bed of Wareâ is mentioned in
_Twelfth Night_ 3. 2. 51, and the town is characterized as âdurty
Wareâ in Dekkerâs _North-ward Hoe_, _Wks._ 3. 53.

=5. 8. 142, 3 I will tell truth=, etc. Jonson uses this proverb again
in _Tale Tub_, _Wks._ 6. 150: âtell troth and shame the devil.â




GLOSSARY


This glossary is designed to include obsolete, archaic, dialectal,
and rare words; current words used in obsolete, archaic, or
exceptional senses; and, so far as practicable, obsolete and archaic
phrases. Current words in current uses have occasionally been
included to avoid confusion, as well as technical words unfamiliar to
the ordinary reader. Favorite words have been treated, for the sake
of illustration, with especial fullness.

For most words treated in its volumes published up to March, 1905,
Murrayâs _New English Dictionary_ is the chief authority. For
words not reached by that work the _Century Dictionary_ has been
preferred. The _Stanford Dictionary_ has been found especially
useful for anglicized words. It has often been necessary to resort
to contemporary foreign dictionaries in the case of words of Romance
origin.

It has been thought best to refer to all or nearly all important
passages. Etymologies are given only in cases of especial interest.

A dagger [ â  ] before a word or definition indicates that the word
or the particular meaning is obsolete; parallel lines [ || ] before
a word, that it has never become naturalized in English; an
interrogation point [ ? ], that the case is doubtful.
