What Christmas did for Jerusha Grumble

A PLAY FOR FIVE GIRLS




SCENEâ_A sitting-room at Isabelâs home_


_Isabel_ (_Isabel, Julia, Hazel busy with Christmas gifts_). I suppose,
Julia, you have finished all the Christmas presents that you intend to
make this year. You certainly have been very industrious for the past
few weeks.

_Julia._ Industrious is the right way to put it, Isabel; I certainly
have been very busy. But when this pair of mittens and wristlets that I
am making for Tom are finished, I can say I am through for this year.

_Hazel._ Have you made many presents this year, Julia?

_Julia._ Yes, quite a number of them, Hazel. I donât remember just how
many, but I surely have been busy.

_Hazel_ (_teasingly, looking at Julia_). I have heard say that it donât
take much to keep some people busy. For instance, now, there isââ

_Julia_ (_quickly_). Now thatâs not me, Hazel, not at all. When I work,
I work.

_Isabel._ So does a pump-handle, Julia. But then some one must take
hold of it.

_Julia._ I see you girls just want to tease me. Well go ahead, I donât
care.

(_Enter Jessie, excitedly, laying aside her wraps._)

_Hazel._ Well, well! If here isnât the sluggard at last. We thought you
were never, never, going to come. What detained you so long?

_Jessie_ (_flurried and excitedly_). Oh, girls, you couldnât everâever
guess. In a yearâs time you couldnât everâeverâever guess.

_Isabel._ An engine down on the railroad crossing?

_Jessie._ No!âNo! (_Shaking her head._)

_Julia._ Had to wait for your mother to fix your hair, or tie your hair
ribbons?

_Jessie._ No! No! Oh, girls (_holding up hands in surprise_) just think
of it! Jerusha Grumble was out sweeping off her walk as I came along
and she looked up and smiled, and said just as pleasant as could be,
âGood afternoon, Jessie.â (_All the girls rise quickly and look at
Jessie in astonishment._)

_Julia_ (_drawls out_). She d-i-d?

_Jessie_ (_nodding_). U-m. Umâm.

_Hazel_ (_with emphasis_). Sheâdidâindeed?

_Jessie._âUmââ. Um-m-mââ

_Isabel_ (_more emphasis_). Reallyâdid she?

_Jessie._ Umâm. Why, girls, I was never so surprised in all my life.
Jerusha Grumble never spoke so nice to me as she did to-day. I was so
surprised that I really had to stop every few minutes to think about
it. That is one reason why I am so late in coming here.

_Hazel_ (_girls take seats again_). Well, this is a surprise, Jessie,
to think Jerusha took the trouble to speak kindly to one of us girls. I
donât think she would ever say good afternoon to me, for you know she
has been very angry with me ever since I called her a cranky old maid.

_Isabel._ Dear me. Hazel, you ought not to have said that to her.
Jerusha is cross, and awfully cranky, too, but perhaps there has been
something in her life that has made her dislike every one. I heard
father say once, that Jerusha had a sweetheart a long time ago, and
that a girl named Hannah Takehim won him away from her, and Jerusha
hasnât been like the same person since. But I really do wish she would
be different.

_Jessie._ She must be getting different, or she wouldnât have spoken so
nice to me to-day. Do you know, girls, what I was thinking of on my way
here? It was just this. That we four be a committee to go down to see
Jerusha, and invite her to go to the Christmas tree exercises to-morrow
night. Letâs try to get Jerusha out among the people of the village,
and when she sees that we want to be friendly with her, perhaps she
will be different.

_Julia._ As likely as not when she sees us come in her gate, she will
get angry and meet us at the door with a broomstick.

_Jessie._ Never mind how mad she is, weâll pretend not to notice it,
but all speak pleasantly to her, and gently push our way into the house.

_Hazel._ I am perfectly willing to go, because I would really like to
see Jerusha live like other people, and not be such an unsociable old
creature. Shall we all go girls? I will lead the way.

_All._ Yes, we will all go, Hazel.

_Hazel._ Weâll all meet at my house to-morrow afternoon. (_All leave
for home with goodbyes, etc._)




SCENE II.â_Sitting-room at Jerushaâs home_

(_Oil stove in one corner; ironing board in the other. Jerushaâs large
rocker at one side. Jerusha very busy._)


_Jerusha._ Well, Jerusha Grumble, youâre getting awful tired, indeed
you are. But my sakes, how happy you have been to-day. (_Seats herself
in rocker._) Here I am just touching on fifty-eight, and all along
Iâve acted like sixty. That is, Iâve acted like some one sixty years
old, and not exactly that either, because most people sixty years old
act decent-like and get some enjoyment out of life. But I always was
cross-like, leastwise ever since Hannah Takehim done what she did. But
Hannahâs dead now, and Jeremiahâs a widower and most blind. Pshaw! them
things are all passed now, and I am going to live like other folks.
Dear me, you donât just know how good I did feel after I had said good
afternoon to Jessie, yesterday. And how nice she did talk to me, and
she said she hoped I would have a nice Christmas! And after she went
on her way, I just thought to myself, Jerusha, just try and have a
real nice Christmas once, and so I sets to work and made pie and cake,
and molasses candy, and popcorn, and then I thought I would have a
Christmas tree all to myself. Only it ainât going to be a real tree,
but just my new broom fixed up. When I was a little girl our poor dear
mother used to fix up the broom on Christmas, and we children had lots
of fun with it. You see we were very poor, and mother couldnât afford
to buy a real tree, so we made the broom answer instead. They are going
to have a real tree up at the church to-night and wouldnât I like to
see it? If I was like other folks I would go up there. Yes, and I will
go, too! Now Iâll lay out that old print skirt, and when I get time I
will press it. (_Lays out the things as she talks._) And Iâll fix my
old bonnet over, and Iâll darn the holes in my black gloves, and go to
the Christmas tree to-night. Now I must write this all down or I will
forget about it. (_Writes._) There now! Iâll fix up my own tree first
before I do anything else. (_Stands the broom up near her rocker, fixed
so that it can be easily knocked over._) There, I guess that will do.
It seems that the more I do to-day the happier I get. Now Iâll put this
popcorn trimming onâand this âcopia Iâll put on, and yes, Iâll just
write Jessieâs name on it, too. And this handkerchief is for Isabel.
And this ribbon is for Julia. Wouldnât those girls laugh if they could
see my Christmas tree and presents on it for them? But it ainât likely
they will ever know that I was so foolish. I have always been so cross
and cranky that no one ever comes here to see me, but I do mean to
be different from now on. (_As she finishes fixing up the broom._)
There, that does look real nice. Now I will just sit down and look at
it before I get things fixed up for to-night. (_Seats herself in chair
and admires the tree._) Jerusha Grumble, this has been your happiest
Christmas since Hannah Takehim.... But as I said before, Hannahâs dead
now, and Jeremiahâs a widower and most blind. (_Falls asleep in the
chair. Chair placed so she cannot be seen from door. Girls knock at
door. Jerusha does not waken. Girls open door a little and peep in, but
do not see her._)

_Julia._ Now Hazel, go in. You said that you would lead the way.

_Hazel._ Oh, supposing she gets mad and drives us away. You all know
what a cross-patch Jerusha is.

_Jessie._ Well, girls, all call out, âMerry Christmas, Jerusha,â and
then walk right in and begin to admire everything she has.

_Isabel._ Knock once more on the inside of the door.

_Hazel._ Here goes! Are you ready?

_Isabel._ Yes, Hazel, do for pityâs sake rap hard. Maybe she is
upstairs.

_Hazel_ (_raises her hand to knock_). Oh, girls, how can I?

_Julia._ You said you would, Hazel, now go ahead. Be quick!

_Hazel._ All ready, girls. (_Raps at the door; no answer. All laugh and
giggle._) She must be out or asleep. Iâll rap again. (_Raps again and
waits._)

_Jessie._ She may be sick. Letâs go right in. Iâll lead the way if
Hazel wonât.

_Hazel._ Oh, do go Jessie, we will all follow you. (_All tiptoe in and
find Jerusha asleep. Examine the tree and find the note Jerusha wrote._)

_Isabel._ Poor Jerusha is trying to have a Christmas tree all to
herself, and by the way this reminder reads, I should think she was
going to fix up for a visit somewhere.

_Jessie_ (_who has examined the tree_). Here is something for each
of us on this broom Christmas tree! I wonder what it means, anyway.
Perhaps Jerusha is trying to live a better life, and if so, then we
girls must help her.

_Julia_ (_who has been examining the dress, bonnet and gloves_). I say,
girls, letâs fix up these things while Jerusha is asleep, and perhaps
it will please her, when she wakes up, to find her work all finished. I
will mend the gloves, and Jessie, you fix up the bonnet, and Hazel can
help you, while Isabel presses out the skirt. Now all work quietly and
fast, for she may soon wake up. (_All get to work._)

_Isabel_ (_admires the skirt, which is of very loud or gay pattern_).
I guess Jerushaâs grandmother must have worn this dress. Itâs most
loud enough to wake Jerusha out of her sleep. I wonder how long it
has been in the family? (_Here Isabel drops the iron on the floor.
All frightened. Jessie places forefinger on her lips. Hazel stands up
with one hand over her mouth and holding bonnet by one string. Isabel
holds up both hands and one foot. Julia, very much frightened, looks at
sleeping Jerusha._)

_Isabel._ My! but I nearly did it that time, girls. Jerusha is a good
sleeper. Iâll be more careful this time. (_Goes on with ironing._)

_Hazel._ I would put that feather in this way, Jessie, if I were doing
it.

_Jessie._ I think this is the best way, Hazel. Just see how graceful it
is! (_Holding up the bonnet._)

_Julia._ My job is done. How about you, Isabel, is that dress pressed
out yet? Oh, how I would like to see you in a dress like that. Do put
it on, Isabel, do now, just for fun.

_Isabel._ What if Jerusha should wake up and catch me with her dress
on? She would be awfully angry. Noâno, I canât do it.

_Hazel._ Oh, do put it on, Isabel, and the bonnet, too. We will be as
quiet as mice, and Jerusha wonât know a thing about it. Come, we will
help you with it.

_Isabel._ Well, if you all keep very quiet, I will see how it fits me.
(_Puts on the dress and bonnet._)

_Julia._ Oh, what a picture you are, Isabel. Just turn around so we can
see you. How sweet you look. Great grandmother, Isabel. (_All laugh
and have a good time as Isabel walks around the room. Finally some one
knocks the broom over on Jerusha, who wakes up with a start._)

_Jerusha._ Mercy me, what does this mean? Where did you all come from?
Who are you all? Oh, I know you, Hazel! You who called me a cranky old
maid! (_Grabs the broom to threaten Hazel._)

_Hazel_ (_very much frightened_). Now donât use your broom on me,
Jerusha. Please donât. You had it all fixed up for a Christmas tree,
and had presents on it for each of us, and now will you use it to drive
us out of the house.

_Jessie_ (_soothingly to Jerusha, placing hand on her shoulder_). Dear
Jerusha, let me explain it all to you. You see we girls came here to
spend the afternoon with you, and we knocked and knocked at the door,
and as you did not answer, we thought that you were sick in bed. So we
came right in and found you asleep, and you looked so tired we thought
that we would let you sleep on, while we fixed up the things you had
laid out for repairs. Now please donât be angry with us, dear.

_Jerusha_ (_spies Isabel in the corner with her dress and bonnet on_).
Isabel, what are you doing with my dress on? And I declare, but you
have my bonnet, too!

_Isabel_ (_timidly_). Oh, Jerusha, after we got them all fixed up,
we thought we would like to see how they would look. (_Admiringly._)
Really, dear Jerusha, this is a beautiful dress. You donât see any
like it nowadays, do you, girls? No Jerusha, we meant no offence, so
youâll excuse us, wonât you?

_Julia._ No, Jerusha, we meant no harm. But do please sit down (_leads
her to chair_), and tell us how you came to make a Christmas tree out
of your broom. And why did you put presents on it for us girls? You
must have had a reason for doing it.

_Jerusha_ (_sits down, wipes tears from eyes. Julia sits beside her._)
Dear me, girls, I am real glad that you have come, even if you did find
me doing foolish things. But really I ainât been so happy on Christmas
before, since Hannah Takehim done what she did. But pshaw, Hannahâs
dead now these twenty years, and Jeremiahâs still a widower, but most
blind. But you want to know about the broom Christmas tree, and I will
tell you. You see, when I was a little girl we lived in the city, and
we were always very poor, and when Christmas came we always wanted a
tree. But our mother, with six children, never could afford to buy
one for us. So we always dressed up the broom for a Christmas tree,
and what fun we did have! A few days ago, as I sat by the window, I
saw some men go by with a great big tree for the church, and I thinks
to myself, Jerusha, wouldnât you like to go to a Christmas exercise
once more? And I said âyesâ to myself. But then I thought how mean I
had always been to every one, ever since Hannah Takehim done what she
did. But pshaw, Hannahâs dead this many a year, and Jeremiahâs still
a widower. Still, I says to myself, Jerusha, you must do different,
and I just made up my mind that I will be different, and I will speak
pleasant-like to people, and I would go where the neighbors were, and
up to the Christmas tree I thought was just the place to begin.

_Hazel._ Yes, Jerusha, that will be nice and brave of you to come up to
the Christmas exercises to-night, and one of the reasons why we came
here was to ask you to go up to the church with us. We expect to have a
splendid time. You will come with us, wonât you, Jerusha?

_Jerusha._ I think it is real nice of you, Hazel, to invite me to go,
much nicer than to call me a cranky old maid. (_Jerusha reaches for her
handkerchief. Hazel thinks she is reaching for the broom and starts for
the door._) Donât be afraid, Hazel, no, no, donât be afraid. I know I
was cranky and mean, but I wouldnât be an old maid if Hannah Takehim
hadnât done what she did. But pshawââ

_Julia._ Jerusha, you havenât said that you would go with us to the
exercises to-night. We girls would dearly love to have you go. You will
meet a lot of people there that you know.

_Jerusha._ Yes, and a lot that I never liked and who never liked
Jerusha Grumble, either.

_Isabel._ But Jerusha that is just the place to become good friends.
You know that Christmas was the time that the angels sang, âPeace on
earth, good-will toward men.â Now let us make it peace right here in
our own village. You must know Mr. Coutant, and Mr. Bennett and Mr.
Macdonald.

_Jerusha._ Oh, yes, I know all them. Mr. Macdonald is superintendent of
the Sunday-school, ainât he, Jessie?

_Jessie._ Yes, my father is the superintendent of the Sunday-school.

_Jerusha._ Well, your father is âmost old enough to remember what
Hannah Takehim did. But, oh, pshaw! Hannahâs dead these twenty years,
and Jeremiahâs a widower still, and most blind. And I am just touching
on fifty-eight, so your father will remember. Itâs no wonder I am a
cranky old maid. (_Hazel starts up again._)

_Jessie._ Let us all meet at my house, and go up together. I know that
every one will try to make it pleasant for you, Jerusha. We will tell
all our friends that you are coming to the exercises, and they wonât be
surprised when they see you.

_Hazel._ And I know that some young ladies will have a little present
on the tree for you to prove that they appreciate your coming.

_Isabel_ (_putting on her wraps_). Please donât fix up too much,
Jerusha, for we are all plain people up there and we donât put on any
airs.

_Jerusha._ No, no, I wonât fix up much. I may wear the things you girls
so kindly fixed up for me, and again I may wear my first best ones.

_Julia_ (_all should now have wraps on to go home_). Girls, letâs sing
a Christmas song for Jerusha before we start for home. (_All stand in
line, join hands and swing them back and forth child-fashion, while
they sing a verse of some familiar Christmas song. At the second verse,
Jerusha takes her place in the middle of the line and sings and swings
with the girls._)

_Jerusha_ (_near close of second verse says_). If only Hannah Takehim
could see me now! But pshawââ

_Jessie._ Merry Christmas, Jerusha. Now be on time. (_All say, âMerry
Christmas.â_)

_Jerusha_ (_as the girls are leaving_). Iâll be there on time, donât
fear. (_Speaking to the audience._) Now ainât this been just splendid?
And ainât those young girls just lovely? I donât think that Hazel
will ever call me a cranky old maid again. And I do just hope that
Jeremiah will be at the Christmas tree exercises. Iâll just show him
that Jerusha Grumble can go out in society even if I am touching on
fifty-eight and an old maid, which _he_ knows I wouldnât be if Hannah
Takehim hadnât done what she did. But pshaw! I must get ready for the
Christmas tree or I will be late, and I think after all that I will
wear my first best clothes, and look real pertâperter than Hannahâbut
pshaw!

    EXIT

    (_If used at the close of a Christmas exercise, have
    the girls and Jerusha come up the aisle of the church
    or hall sometime during the distribution of the
    presents. Jerusha should then be dressed in her âfirst
    best clothes.â_)




Christmas Plays


  =(+) OLA: OR A CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MOTHER.= In this
      little 15-minute play the Christmas present the three
      children of the âGoodâ family find for mother is
      none other than âOla,â a street waif who comes in
      to get warm while mother is out shopping. Alta, the
      only girl in the family, has been wishing she had a
      sister to share the trials which two (2) wideawake
      brothers bring to her, so she has a double motive in
      wanting to hide Ola away when mother comes and then
      bring her out and present her as a Christmas present
      to mother. Only five characters, 2 boys, 2 girls, and
      1 woman, required. No special costumes needed, and
      the one home scene is simple to provide. Five copies
      required. Price 30 cts., postpaid.


  =(+) MISCHIEVOUS ESTHER AT GRANDMOTHERâS.= It was all
      Grandmotherâs fault. Having so many nice things
      hidden about the house at Christmastime should not be
      permitted, when the grandchildren are to be left in
      the house alone while grandmother goes out for the
      afternoon. Of course the boys were not mischievous,
      not even curious, but with Esther it was different,
      for she was a girl. She was a very sweet one though,
      especially when the molasses she got into was all
      over her apron. It was Christmastime and everything
      ends right during this happy season, so putting the
      soiled apron into the box from which she took the
      kitten and putting the kitten into the wash basin
      intended for the apron was only a slight mixup, from
      which mischievous Esther would soon clear herself.
      Three characters, 1 girl and 2 boys, 12 years of age,
      are employed. A simple sitting-room scene; no special
      costumes; time about 15 minutes. 3 copies only
      required. Price 25 cts., postpaid.


  =TELEPHONING TO SANTA CLAUS.= A Christmas dialogue for
      two (2) girls, ten (10) or twelve (12) years of age,
      who conceive the idea of using the telephone to tell
      Santa Claus what they most want, and suffer no great
      surprise when the very things asked for reach them
      through the âphone.â A simple sitting-room scene in
      which a make-believe âphoneâ is installed furnishes
      the setting. Time of rendition about 10 minutes.
      Price 25 cts., postpaid.


  =(+) WHAT CHRISTMAS DID FOR JERUSHA GRUMBLE.=
      Self-confessedly, she was only 58, but for years
      she had acted like sixty, that is to say,âoh well,
      in nature she had been true to her name, and when
      oneâs nature suggests a name like hers, itâs quite
      a job to change it. She couldnât forget that, many
      years before, she had expected to change her name,
      but, oh well, it wasnât her fault, and Christmas
      came along and helped her to cover up the past and
      open a new future for her. Of course it couldnât
      change her name, but this little play tells how
      very effectively it did change her nature, and then
      the contrast between name and nature was a charm in
      the hitherto repulsive life. Itâs a pretty story,
      made into a pleasing Christmas play. There are five
      characters, all girls; two scenes, easily arranged.
      Quite ordinary costumes are used and only 5 copies of
      the book required. Time about 30 minutes. Price 30
      cts., postpaid.


  =(+) WANTEDâCHRISTMAS SPIRIT.= In Prolog, Three Scenes
      and Epilog. By Hester L. Hopkins. 22 females and
      13 male characters in the entire play, but it can
      be given with 8 females and 7 males by having some
      assume different characters in various scenes. Time
      of rendition, 30 to 40 minutes. If only 15 people
      take part, 12 copies will be required. Price 30 cents
      per copy, postpaid.


  =(+) CHRISTMAS CHEER.= A play in two acts for six
      females. Time of rendition about 20 minutes.

      Four young ladies are the members of a Sunday School
      class whose teacher has asked that each member of the
      class shall do something to bring âChristmas Cheerâ
      to someone who would not otherwise be remembered.
      Each of the girls, unbeknown to the other members of
      the class, decides to make the âJones Familyâ the
      object of her Christmas visit.

      It turns out to be quite a âSurprise party.â While one
      of the girls prepares the Christmas pie, the others
      of the class provide a pleasant entertainment. When
      the Christmas pie is cut, Caroline and Amanda find
      that it is filled with the presents which the class
      brought. Simple setting and costumes. 6 copies
      required. Price 25 cents. Postpaid.

    _If the number of copies specified as âREQUIREDâ is

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
